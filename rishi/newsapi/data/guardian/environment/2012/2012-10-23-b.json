  "<p>First of all, the motion says \"would\". I take this to mean \"would, if we could\". Science requires experiment, and there are some questions we do not have the means to address scientifically, at least at the moment. </p> <p>But I support the aspiration and I hope you will too. </p> <p>\"Scientific Investigation\" is a technique for achieving knowledge which is as unbiased and objective as possible. </p> <p>It is not infallible, it is not always particularly efficient, but it is quite simply the best way we have of not fooling ourselves.</p> <p>Are there any areas of knowledge that we want to fool ourselves about?</p> <p>I don't think so. Knowledge may be uncomfortable, but ignorance can be catastrophic.</p> <p>Given the background and profile of the other speakers, I suspect much of this debate will focus on research around human life. When it comes to life, I'm an amateur. But I think a couple of examples from physics might help.</p> <p>The most stunning one, I think, is the development of quantum mechanics. From the point of view of physicists at the time, this was a complete car crash.</p> <p>The model - of seeking underlying mechanisms for physical processes - which had served incredibly well from at least the time of Copernicus through Newton, Kelvin and even Einstein (who participated in its overthrow but never accepted its consequences) came about through repeated application of the scientific method. </p> <p>In the face of the most massive cultural biases, the fact was established. </p> <p>Nature stubbornly behaved in a way which could only be understood by rethinking pretty much every assumption ever made by the most influential physicists - the heroes. In the end quantum mechanics rules. It works. It lies behind the whole digital technology of our civilisation, and more besides. And it went counter to every established scientific prejudice of the days, except for the prejudice that the method works.</p> <p>The physicists of old might be horrified by the outcome, and by the cultural miasma that allows, for example, homeopaths to claim quantum mechanics gives water memory. But they would I hope be proud of the success of the scientific method. (Which of course also tells us that water is water, sugar is sugar, and placebos are placebos.)</p> <p>There are moral debates to be had about the uses to which knowledge is put. There are moral debates to be had about the development of specific technologies from knowledge. But the debate around the morality of nuclear weapons would not be well-served by declaring the study of fundamental physics off limits. Nor would the debates about cloning, or genetic engineering, be well served by declaring the study of life off limits.</p> <p>The scientific pursuit of an understanding of the universe in which we live, the basic constituents, life itself, and the farthest galaxies, is an interconnected and unpredictable activity. Incremental advances in one area can cause sudden revolutions in another. To declare some areas out of bounds would not only be unpredictably damaging in its impact, but would probably be doomed to failure. </p> <p>A rear-guard action against some uncomfortable areas of knowledge may succeed in delaying the inevitable; but surely it is better to seek the knowledge, and face the moral issues which follow with open eyes and minds.</p> <p>None of that is intended to imply that the very pursuit of knowledge is such a high imperative that it negates all other considerations. In particular, we are back to the \"means\" here, and the \"would\" in the title of the motion.</p> <p>An example close to my heart: The Large Hadron Collider and the discovery of a Higgs boson - in fact the whole of particle physics together - costs the UK taxpayer about \u00a32 a year. There are no significant environmental or existential risks, and many benefits.</p> <p>If the cost were an order of magnitude higher, one might start to ask whether the money could be better spent. It may be that the returns would also rise, and we would all benefit. Certainly the endeavour much more than pays for itself at present. But a net financial outlay would raise moral and practical questions about priorities for public expenditure. </p> <p>And if there had been any credible risk of creating, for example, black holes which might consume the world (or even a suburb of Geneva), that would clearly have been a problem. </p> <p>None of that would have been reason to label the Higgs boson itself off limits in principle. But they may have been reasons to halt that line of research until better (safer, more affordable) methods were available.</p> <p>Similarly, considerations about damage or risk to humans, to animals or to the environment, might impact upon efforts to understand biology, psychology or related areas. Knowledge, the ends, do not justify all means. But regulating means and methods is a very different matter from declaring certain areas closed in principle to scientific inquiry.</p> <p>So I would have all areas of knowledge open in principle. If no acceptable means exist to address, scientifically, some important area, I would have us develop better means. But to declare any area closed in principle to scientific inquiry is to declare that we wish to be fooled. </p> <p>And nature, the universe, does not treat fools kindly.</p> <p>I urge you to support the motion.</p> <p><br><em>The debate also featured Lewis Wolpert (on the same side as me) with Caroline Harrison and Michael Reiss opposing, plus some good speeches from the floor.

  "<p>The 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis falls at a time of election; of uncertain political transition in North Korea; of <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/growing-russiapakistan-ties-a-reality-that-india-will-have-to-live-with/article3975260.ece\">rising</a> geostrategic ambitions in Putin's Russia and during a <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/10/2012107151246788109.html\">heightened standoff </a>between America and Iran. Today's global tensions make it particularly important that we understand what really happened during the 20th century's most dangerous moment. All too often, however, the wider historical truths of the cold war's most dramatic showdown are obscured by self-serving myths of the event itself.</p> <p>The first of these myths has been the tendency to see the missile crisis as proof of the underlying good judgment of liberal democracies, especially when confronted by irrational foes. Of course, it was far from a wise move for Khrushchev to attempt to smuggle dozens of ICBMs halfway across the world in the hope of installing them, undetected, just a short hop away from the North American mainland. But the truth is more nuanced than this. And even the phrase \"the missile crisis\" can be misleading here.</p> <p>Not only were there actually several rather distinct crisis moments (from the game of diplomatic cat-and-mouse that took place prior to Kennedy's public challenge to Khrushchev, to the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28584.html\">naval blockade</a>, the shooting down of a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/06/missile_crisis_excerpt200806\">U-2 plane over Cuba</a>, and the fallout between Moscow and Havana before the missiles were removed), but far more importantly, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/kennedy_cuban_missile_01.shtml\">the road to October 1962</a> was much longer in the making than we tend to recall.<br> On this point, the Soviet historical term \u2013 \"the Caribbean crisis\" \u2013 is a far better shorthand, since the missile crisis was above all a crisis about Cuba. When Khrushchev took the decision to place ballistic missiles on the island, it was not simply on a whim, as American cold war historians long claimed. Nor was it a diversionary play in the ongoing superpower <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/kennedy_cuban_missile_01.shtml#four\">struggle</a> over Berlin, as they also suspected. It was chiefly to respond to the Cubans' requests for military support in light of American aggression, as well as the snippets of intelligence that Moscow was already picking up about Operation Mongoose \u2013 the CIA's covert plan to topple Castro.</p> <p>Putting missiles on Cuba was also a way for Khrushchev to <a href=\"http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/HIS242/Notes/SinoSoviet.html\">square off </a>against Chairman Mao, who had been criticizing his lack of revolutionary internationalism. So, framing the crisis as set in motion by an act of Soviet irrationality and Cuban hotheadedness obscures the significant role that American interventionism and Chinese belligerence also played in precipitating events.<br> The second pervasive myth about the missile crisis that has set fast over these past 50 years is that in diplomacy, you win by standing your ground. This is well encapsulated in the<a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/dobbs/\"> popularity of the phrase</a> attributed to Kennedy's Secretary of State Dean Rusk: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We've been eyeball to eyeball and the other fellow just blinked.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Not to mention in films like Kevin Costner's 2001 production, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Days_%28film%29\">Thirteen Days</a>. The archival record of the way that Soviet and American decision-makers actually dealt with the crisis reveals how inaccurate this picture is. As the historians James Blight and Philip Brenner show in their book, <a href=\"http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=7106\">Sad and Luminous Days</a>, it was precisely by failing to compromise, let alone acknowledge the motives of the other side, that the various actors \u2013 Soviets, Americans and Cubans alike \u2013 actually helped escalate the October crisis. The real lesson ought to be, as Robert McNamara himself later <a href=\"http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub_detail.cfm?id=134\">admitted</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Empathize with your adversary, or you may regret it!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A third way in which we misremember the missile crisis is the still-pervasive myth in America that national security is best ensured through military-technological superiority. This rendering of the crisis takes its rhetorical force from the<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol46no1/cubamisslesite.jpg\"> famous image</a> of ICBM missile sites under construction at San Cristobal in western Cuba. This, of course, was the evidence that Kennedy was able to confront Khrushchev with via the American public, his diplomatic ace-in-the-hole. And it inspires a recounting of the crisis as a fable of the careful use, and ultimate value, of covert intelligence as provided by America's then game-changing U-2 spy planes.</p> <p>Again, closer attention to the facts urges caution here. It was intelligence reports on the ground that first led to Kennedy being apprised of the plot in the first place: the now-famous photos were just the final confirmation, with bad weather and internal political wrangles over \"the birds\" having kept the U-2s on the ground for a number of crucial days. Moreover, the U-2s themselves actually escalated the crisis at various points: with one shot down over Cuba at the very height of the crisis on 27 October, and another <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/06/missile_crisis_excerpt200806\">erroneously</a> straying into Soviet airspace.</p> <p>But the inevitable risks of such technology, and the fact that yesterday's surveillance aircraft is now today's expendable drone \u2013 and an armed one at that \u2013 have long been downplayed in favour of a vindication narrative. Indeed, Kennedy's famous public airing of the photographs showing cleared palms and vehicle tracks scored into the earth still had sufficient public currency to have been mimicked by Colin Powell when <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Archives/video/feb-2003-colin-powell-wmd-12802420\">asserting</a> graphic evidence of Iraq's WMD to the UN in February 2003.</p> <p>Which brings us on to the fourth, and perhaps most ironic, way of misremembering the missile crisis. Namely, the way in which so many accounts of it contribute to the idea of the cold war as a largely bloodless affair: not a hot war of real combat, but an ideological and faintly romantic war of spies, diplomacy and geopolitical grandstanding, of which the missile crisis stands as the ultimate example. For all that the crisis may have been, as the late historian Eric Hobsbawm put it, the historical pivot of the 20th century, its sheer prominence in the popular memory has tended to obscure the far greater amounts of money that were spent by the two sides of the cold war to produce and distribute smaller \u2013 and ultimately more deadly \u2013 arms the world over: a legacy many parts of the world still suffer from today.</p> <p>Indeed, one consequence of the missile crisis was to usher in a period in which the superpowers made sure to engage one another well away from their own populations and by proxy if possible: from Vietnam to Afghanistan to Central America.</p> <p>In short, the popular memory of the missile crisis, as the central mise-en-acte of cold war confrontation, has tended to sanitise and to moralise that wider conflict in a way that it is all too easy to overlook. We would do well to bear this in mind today in our own, not so unpolarised times.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">Whoever runs Washington</a> heads a global empire. American politics affects people's lives in every part of the world, often as a matter of life or death. So it's&#xa0;scarcely surprising that <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/105943470/UPI-CVoter-Global-Poll-9-11\" title=\"\">more than 40% of those polled around the world</a> say they want the right to vote&#xa0;in US presidential elections.</p> <p>After all, the American revolution was fought on the slogan of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation\" title=\"\">no taxation&#xa0;without representation</a>\". So long as the US government arrogates to itself the right to impose its \"leadership\"&#xa0;by force across the world, a contemporary version of the colonists' demand might be: \"no global power without accountability\".</p> <p>And with George Bush's blood-drenched presidency still fresh in the memory, it's only to be expected that 81% want to see the less belligerent Barack Obama re-elected. Only in Pakistan, target of relentless civilian-slaughtering US drone attacks, do a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/10/23/poll-finds-20-of-21-countries-strongly-prefer-obama-exception-pakistan/\" title=\"\">larger number prefer his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney</a>.</p> <p>Of course, enfranchising foreigners is fantasy. Only US citizens will have a say in these elections, and barely half of them are likely to bother to vote. Their choice will be made overwhelmingly on domestic issues, not how the administration should deploy its fearsome arsenal on the other side of the world.</p> <p>The race is tight mainly because the economy is still hobbled and <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/150122/americans-access-basic-necessities-recession-level.aspx\" title=\"\">poverty has risen 19% since 2000</a>. But for all Obama's disappointments and an electoral system in the grip of the wealthy, the domestic choice is real enough: from spending and taxes to healthcare and abortion \u2013 facing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/05/romney-47-percent-remarks-history-video\" title=\"\">a challenger who thinks 47% of Americans are scroungers</a>.</p> <p>But for most of Monday night's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-presidential-debates\" title=\"\">candidates' TV debate on foreign policy</a>, it was hard to put a credit card between them. They competed to demonstrate unconditional commitment to Israel, determination to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons at all costs and their firm intention to compel China to \"play by the rules\".</p> <p>Romney had sharply toned down his more menacing rhetoric. Apart from grumbling about Obama's lack of \"strong leadership\", his inner hawk only really broke cover to insist on direct arming of the Syrian rebels and the necessity of yet further deficit-defying increases in the already gargantuan US military budget.</p> <p>At one point the Republican rightwinger even criticised Obama for behaving as if the US could \"kill our way out of this mess\" in the Muslim world. That&#xa0;shouldn't be taken too literally. If&#xa0;nothing else, the experience of Bush \u2013 who presented himself as a compassionate conservative with a \"humble foreign&#xa0;policy\" in 2000 and went on to launch the most devastating war of aggression in modern American history \u2013&#xa0;is an object lesson.</p> <p>But Romney's determination to shake off his image as a warmonger reflects the need at least to nod to US public opinion. Unlike the Washington establishment, <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-16/news/ct-nw-global-attitudes-poll-20121016_1_survey-paints-picture-foreign-policy-military-action\" title=\"\">large majorities of Americans</a> believe neither the Iraq nor Afghanistan wars were worth fighting, polling shows; more than three-quarters think the US plays \"world policeman\" more than it should; and most want military spending cut, reject a US strike on Iran, and oppose arming Syria's opposition. But that also underlines how little influence most people in the US (as in Britain) have on their government's foreign policy and military adventures.</p> <p>For all Obama's tone of reason and his stand against the Iraq war, his record is anything but pacific. He accelerated withdrawal from Iraq, but escalated the war in Afghanistan and failed to subdue armed resistance, at a cost of thousands of extra deaths. He sharply intensified the drone war in Pakistan, spreading it to Somalia and Yemen, personally vetting the \"kill lists\" while expanding \"legitimate targets\" to include all military-age males.</p> <p>He backed Nato's war in Libya, ratcheting up the death toll at least tenfold and unleashing mass ethnic cleansing; supported the suppression of Gulf protest; and managed a violent coup in Honduras to a \"successful conclusion\". With a little help from Congress, he reneged on his pledge to close the Guant\u00e1namo internment camp, acquiesced in Israel's refusal to end illegal colonisation of Palestinian territory, and has now dispatched US troops to sub-Saharan Africa and Jordan.</p> <p>Whatever the personal views of the politician at the top, the US empire is a system, not a policy, underpinned by corporate and military interests. Romney would very likely be a more dangerous leader, but almost every US president has sanctioned military action, and the risk of war with Iran or growing intervention in Syria would remain under a second Obama term.</p> <p>But it's also a system in evident decline, hastened by overreach in the war on terror and paid for in blood and treasure both by Americans and across the world. US military spending is larger than the combined spending of the next 20 powers combined, its troops stationed in a majority of countries.</p> <p>Of course the rest of the world doesn't really want a vote in American elections but the US off its back. Far better for most Americans, too, if that bloated military budget were to be slashed, troops withdrawn and bases closed \u2013 and the money spent instead on jobs, schools and health in the US itself.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",

At first glance this should be a canter: Barcelona are, <em>well</em>, Barcelona. They've lifted the Champions League trophy three times since 2006, are unbeaten at home in Europe for three years, and have the best player and playmaker in the world. Yet, for now at least, the 4,730 Celtic supporters at the Camp Nou are gazing back, misty-eyed, to 2004, when the Hoops drew twice at Barcelona and clinging to an unlikely repeat. They couldn't do it again, could they?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Well, no ... </strong> ... Most of the starting XI that faced Barcelona in 2004 were veterans of the 2003 Uefa Cup campaign, which saw the Hoops reach the final before losing to Jose Mourinho's spoiling, diving, super-cynical Porto side in a minor classic. On their day Martin O'Neill's side could beat anyone. But this 2012 Celtic vintage, while admirable in many ways, isn't in that class. Drop them into the Premier League and they'd surely be fighting to stay up [mbm reporter ducks for cover].</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong></p> <p><strong>Barcelona (4-1-2-3):</strong> Vald\u00e9s, Adriano, Mascherano, Bartra, Song, Jordi, Alba, Xavi, Iniesta, Pedro, Messi, Alexis. <strong>Subs:</strong> Pinto, Montoya, Cesc, Dos Santos, Sergi Roberto, Villa, Tello.</p> <p><strong>Celtic (9-0-1):</strong> Forster, Lustig, Wilson, Ambrose, Izaguirre, Mulgrew, Brown, Ledley, Wanyama, Samaras, Hooper.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Reasons to be cheerful for Celtic fans:</strong> Sergio Busquets, who is suspended, plus Alves, Piqu\u00e9, Puyol, Thiago, Cuenca and Muniesa will also miss tonight's match. Their defence conceded four at the weekend. Any others?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> We're off! Celtic, kicking from right-to-left on my TV<br>screen, gets things underway. I'm having the odd technical gremlin so<br>forgive me if the updates are patchier than a band of particularly<br>unruly pirates for a bit.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 min</strong> Barcelona immediately gain possession and are already<br>probing for weaknesses. Messi finds Alexis ... who puts it wide. What<br>a chance! Meanwhile Colin Wan writes: \"Fabregas has got to be<br>absolutely gutted not to be in the team today. He was brilliant<br>against Deportivo. And I think Messi likes playing with him.

They're conceding a lot of possession, but that was<br>always going to be the case. \"Well, so far Celtic are categorically<br>the best British team in Europe. Well done, them,\" says Matt Dony, not<br>unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> Decent stuff from Celtic, particularly down the left<br>with Samaras and Izaguirre linking nicely. Meanwhile Scott Brown makes<br>his presence felt, and concedes a foul.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass.

Incredible scenes at the<br>Camp Nou!</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>21 min</strong> Barcelona continue to patiently probe. They could be 1-0<br>up or 0-1 down here; you wouldn't know the difference in the style of<br>their play.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Meanwhile Ryan Dunne emails in: \"I'm personally a<br>Glorious Glasgow Rangers fan myself, but dare I say that many a Celtic<br>fan would regard their team as Scottish/Irish (not necessarily a<br>criticism; afterall, Barca are Catalan) rather than being the British<br>anything.

And still Alba, trying to run onto a<br>throughball, is given offside.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> Meanwhile spare a thought for David Goldstone: \"Many<br>months ago I booked a romantic two night break to Barcelona, staying<br>at an indescribably chic and expensive hotel in a peaceful square just<br>off La Ramblas. Brilliantly I managed to choose the two nights when<br>Celtic were in town. No sleep last night.

Fingers crossed ...</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Still Barcelona stick resolutely to plan A, but the<br>speed of their passing has increased. Celtic's formation is now very<br>much 5-4-1. Barcelona win another corner but Adriano's skidding shot<br>from 24 yards is saved at his near post by Forster.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Scott Brown pushes, barges, harries and annoys Messi -<br>all in the space of a few seconds - before conceding a foul. For all<br>their possession, Barcelona have created - what - three decent chances<br>so far?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong> 37 min</strong> Again come the slow handclaps ... clap ... clap ...<br>clap ... as Messi lines up a free-kick, 25 yards out, central. Then -<br>for a millisecond - silence before a huge 'Oooooooooooooh' of<br>exhalation as Messi's free-kick hits the netting over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> Samaras is hobbling here after rolling over his ankle.<br>Surely he can't continue here? Meanwhile this from Gordon Pittendrigh:<br>\"I'm a Celtic fan trying to remember to breathe here. Not sure whether<br>to watch rest of game or DVD of The Alamo.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>42 min</strong> With Samaras off, and James Forrest waiting to come on,<br>Barcelona keep the torture going against the 10-men but again it comes<br>to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Celtic sub: Forrest on, Samaras off. Celtic are<br>desperately hanging on for half-time here.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 1-1 Celtic (Iniesta 45m)</strong> A wonderful, wonderful goal for Barcelona - five, six passes in a blink of an eye, with Xavi<br>and Iniesta key, before the later takes a throughball on the half-turn and slots it into the corner. That was everything Barcelona stand for, right there.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Just before the referee's whistle, Messi dragged a half-chance wide. So it's 1-1 at half-time after a riveting first half. Meanwhile Colin Owens wrote this a few minutes ago: \"With Braga 2-0 ahead and Celtic 1-0 up I hastily deposited \u20ac10 into my Paddy Power account for a Barca/Utd double as I know too well that good things don't last!\" Looks like you might have a shot there, Colin ...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Barcelona get the second half underway. \"I'm not sure if its the same for everyone, but this MBM is appearing on my phone with lots of line breaks, giving it the appearance of blank verse,\" says Matt Dony. It lends a Shakespearean dignity and gravitas to Barca's dinky little sideways passes.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> It's as you were: Barcelona continue to probe, particularly with the Alba-Alexis-Iniesta triangle down the left, while Celtic remain steadfast for now. The vistor's aim is to play the ball into Hooper and try to get runners off him. And it works there, as after five or six passes they win a free-kick in a dangerous. Mulgrew steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> ... and crashes it against the wall, which was about five yards back. The follow up shot from Izaguirre balloons into the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 min</strong> Lovely twist-and-pass from Iniesta to Messi, who immediately brings the ball to heel before attempting a 9-iron over the 6ft 7in Forster. It doesn't miss by very much...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>53 min</strong> So close for Celtic! Barcelona can't defend set-pieces at all. Another flighty corner from Mulgrew spins violently across the six-yard box, flicking the head of two Celtic players before going wide. Neil Lennon, watching on the sidelines, has his head in his hands.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> It's almost all Barcelona here. Forster has just saved a straightforward shot from Adriano. \"I can confirm that I'm not seeing any unusual formatting,\" says, er, Mister Justi. \"I'm currently on a Windows XP SP3 machine with Google Chrome version 22.0.1229.4m which is \"up to date\".

  "<p>Amelia Gentleman's distressing article on the return of the bed and breakfast regime for homeless families (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/15/bed-and-breakfast-families-crisis\" title=\"\">No place like home</a>, G2, 16 October) takes those of us old enough to remember back to the bad old days we thought had gone for ever. The current ruthless rationing of the benefit system will destroy all that was best about the postwar efforts of Beveridge, the architect of the welfare state, and of successive governments, determined to eliminate the destitution of prewar years.</p> <p>Benefit cheating can be prevented by efficient administration and cannot justify hounding the vast majority of those in need of help, most of whom have paid their national insurance contributions while in work.

In my home town, middle-class Harrogate, there are dozens of working families living in council-run hostels.</p> <p>At the time of the last election, I spent some time with these families and was appalled at the conditions and the length of time they were expected to stay in \"temporary\" accommodation. These families, who have lived and worked in Harrogate all their lives, were expected to eke out an existence in conditions the Victorians would have been ashamed of. What kind of society are we when young children are being brought up for months in a hostel where they share a bedsit with their parents and siblings? I was no great defender of the Labour government. But anyone who argues that it makes no difference who is in government should read this article and study the facts on homelessness.<br><strong>Daniel Maguire</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne </em></p> <p>\u2022 The reports on hunger in schools (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/teachers-pupils-hunger-food-survey\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 16 October) and on<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/uk-poor-emergency-food-aid?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> the rise in the number of people receiving food aid</a> from food banks provide quantified examples of what anecdotally has been a growing issue for some time. Recent reports in London have included accounts from the police of children stealing bread for their families, and people going without food for a day at the end of the week when their money runs out to make sure their children eat.</p> <p>Most shocking, perhaps, is the speed at which the numbers of people accessing food banks is rising. In London, the <a href=\"http://www.trusselltrust.org/\" title=\"\">Trussell Trust</a> provided food for around 15,000 between April and September, 6,388 of whom were children.

While part of the rise must be due to the rise in the number of food banks, the overall picture remains bleak.</p> <p>Government needs to do more than welcome the existence of food banks as a sign of a \"big society\".

Over the same period, GDP per head fell by 7%.</p> <p>The figures indicate that the political battles over the \"squeezed middle\" will continue in the runup to the next election. Even if the data is adjusted to include the welfare state \u2013 especially important in Britain with the NHS \u2013 it still reveals a bleak picture. This figure, known as real household actual income per head, dropped in the second quarter of 2012 by 2.9% below its peak in the third quarter of 2009.</p> <p>Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, a shadow Treasury minister, said: \"These figures show how the recovery from the global financial crisis we had two years ago has gone into reverse under this government. Families and pensioners are worse off because of the lack of jobs and growth under David Cameron's failing economic plan.\"</p> <p>According to the study, the decline in living standards has been more pronounced and longer lasting than in the UK's two previous recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s.</p> <p>NNI dropped by around 6% in the slump of the early 1980s, but was back to its pre-recession peak within three years. In the early 1990s, the decline was a more modest 4%, and the lost ground had been recouped in two and a half years. The ONS said the latest recession's longer decline \"was partially a result of unemployment not rising to the same extent as in the previous recession, and historic low interest rates reducing mortgage payments for those on tracker mortgages\".</p> <p>\"In contrast to the recovery from the 1990s recession,\" it said, \"as the economy emerged from the contraction that started in 2008, real household incomes began to fall; a downwards trend that continued to the start of 2012. The cause of this fall was primarily due to an increase in prices, such as fuel, utility bills and food.\"</p> <p>The data release marks a significant shift in the view of how UK economic changes affect people's wellbeing.</p> <p>Since 2008, when a <a href=\"http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm\" title=\"\">report for the French government by economists</a> Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi argued that governments should look at people's income and consumption to evaluate their \"wellbeing\" rather than at production to assess progress, countries have begun to use such measures to size up a nation's happiness.</p> <p>As the ONS admits: \"GDP was not designed as a measure of individual or national wellbeing \u2026 Living standards are more closely aligned with net national income (NNI) (the total income available to residents of that country) as GDP can expand at the same time as incomes decrease and vice versa.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Cardiff, King said that despite the \"probable\" increase in GDP it was clear \"that the recovery and rebalancing of the UK economy are proceeding at a slow and uncertain pace. At this stage, it is difficult to know whether some of the recent more positive signs will persist.\"</p> <p>He said the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee would think \"long and hard\" before deciding next month whether to create more electronic money through quantitative easing, the programme under which Threadneedle Street has purchased \u00a3375bn of gilts. \"But should those signs fade, the MPC does stand ready to inject more money into the economy\", King said, adding that there were no shortcuts to the necessary adjustment in the economy towards investment and exports.</p> <p>He dismissed the idea of handing cash to the public in \"helicopter drops\" of money, describing it as a backdoor way of relaxing the government's austerity strategy that risked either uncontrolled inflation or the eventual insolvency of the Bank of England. \"The problems in the world economy mean that we shall have to be patient,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>One could have been forgiven for assuming that, in the course of four and a half hours of combined presidential debates, all policy bases would have been covered.</p> <p>Big Bird, binders full of women and battleships all featured, after all. </p> <p>But a surprising number of major issues failed to warrant a mention in any of the three head-to-heads. Here's a guide to what was not discussed \u2013 and the candidates' stances on the forgotten topics.</p> <h2>Gay rights</h2> <p>Despite Obama making a high-profile U-turn on the issue of gay marriage just months ago, the topic of same-sex unions didn't get a look in. The closest Obama got to an attack was a snide jab at Romney getting his social policies from the \"1950s\".</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has pushed through a progressive agenda in terms of gay rights, having jettisoned the \"don't ask don't tell\" policy of previous administrations. His conversion to being pro same-sex marriage has been welcomed by the LGBT community, as has his direction to government bodies not to defend the Defence of Marriage Act (Doma) in the courts.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> His agenda of gay rights has been built on shifting sands over the years. In the mid-1990s he told Log Cabin Republicans that he supported \"full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens\". But he has veered towards social conservatism over the last year, repeatedly asserting his belief that \"marriage is between a man and a woman\". He has said he will defend Doma.</p> <h2>War on drugs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398247924\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349292779789/marijuana-medical-angeles-006.jpg\" alt=\"marijuana medical angeles\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Los Angeles city council opted to reverse the ban rather than face an expensive and possibly doomed referendum fight.

Obama has also come out against legalisation. He did, however, bring in legislation to reduce the disparity between sentences given to those caught with crack cocaine, compared to users of powder cocaine. He has also diverted more funds to prevention and treatment programmes.</p> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Likewise anti-legalisation, Romney blames demand in the US for the cross-border violence in Mexico. In a recent forum organised by the Univision TV Network, the Republican reportedly said that the US president has to make \"a priority of reducing demand in this country and communicating to our young people, and older people, that when they use these illegal drugs, they are contributing to the deaths of people around the world\".</p> <h2>Climate change</h2> <p>In the course of the presidential debates, the topics of gas prices and energy independence came up. But neither candidate turned the issue around to green energy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/us-president-debates-climate-change\">and the issue of climate change.</a></p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has pledged to reduce emissions which cause global warming and hit out at sceptics, warning at the Democratic national convention: \"Climate change is not a hoax.\" Obama has also pumped money into the green sector through government grants and loans.</p> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Has called for the phasing out of subsidies for the wind industry and has mocked Obama for wanting to help \"heal the planet\". Although not an outright denier, Romney has said that we \"do not know what's causing climate change on this planet\".</p> <h2>Domestic surveillance</h2> <p>Discussion on homeland security during the first debate failed to nail the candidates on creeping surveillance of US citizens.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> According to the American Civil Liberties Union there has been a 60% increase in electronic surveillance under Obama's watch. He also extended the controversial patriot act, with authorises the wiretapping of US and non-US citizens.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has said that he supports the patriot act. Meanwhile as governor of Massachusetts <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/09/15/wiretap_mosques_romney_suggests/\">he advocated the wiretapping of mosques</a> and carrying out surveillance on foreign students. </p> <h2>Housing</h2> <p>With the economy very much central in the election campaign, it is surprising that some of the main victims of the recession \u2013 homeowners left underwater by falling house prices and those foreclosed on \u2013 didn't get a look in.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has introduced legislation that has helped millions of struggling homeowners, but not as many as he would have hoped. The home affordable modification programme has helped an estimated 1 million families refinance their home loans, but it's goal was to help up to 4 million. </p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has criticised attempts to interfere with the housing market. Indeed his free-market approach appears to extend to giving no help to those facing repossession. \"Don't try to stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom,\" <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/romney-dont-try-and-stop-the-foreclosure-process-video.php\">he said in reference to housing</a>. </p> <h2>Abortion</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398247925\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346274868810/abortion-colorado-personh-006.jpg\" alt=\"abortion colorado personhood\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-life activists march in Washington on the anniversary of Roe V Wade.

  "<p>The government has said the final cost of London's Olympic Games will come in at least \u00a3377m under budget and promised the main stadium will not become a white elephant.</p> <p>Unveiling the government's final quarterly budget update, the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said that at a \"conservative estimate\" the final cost of the Games would be \u00a38.921bn against an overall original budget of \u00a39.28bn.</p> <p>But Olympic organisers conceded that over the course of the project about \u00a31bn of public money had been diverted to the organising committee, Locog, for parts of the project.</p> <p>Locog, which had a separate, privately raised budget of \u00a32bn to stage the Games, received an additional \u00a316m towards the costs of the Paralympics, \u00a326m towards capital works and \u00a314m for Olympic Park venues and infrastructure during the last quarter.</p> <p>\"The key overriding imperative for government was to make sure that this project worked. By far the most efficient way of doing that was to transfer scope and responsibility to Locog,\" said Robertson.</p> <p>\"We have done that whenever it seemed the right thing to do and I would do the same again.\"</p> <p>The government argues that any funds released to the Locog from the public funding package have been for works that were within originally agreed parameters or were one-off costs such as the extra money diverted to the ceremonies budget.</p> <p>Robertson said it was \"by no means certain\" in 2007, when the Labour government announced that the bid budget of \u00a32.4bn had more than tripled to \u00a39.3bn, that the project could be delivered on budget.</p> <p>He praised the delivery of the Games within the agreed budget, which included more than \u00a32bn of contingency funds, as a \"tremendous success\" against the backdrop of a global recession.</p> <p>\"The work of the construction and delivery teams, from the ODA [Olympic Delivery Authority] and Locog, has set a very high standard and I have no doubt that London 2012 has set a new benchmark for the management of Olympic and Paralympic Games in future,\" he said.</p> <p>Talks are also still ongoing between London 2012 organisers and G4S to get it to pay for the army staff brought in at the last minute.</p> <p>Robertson said the future of the \u00a3429m Olympic Stadium should be concluded \"in the next couple of weeks\".</p> <p>Talks are ongoing between the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) and potential tenants, including West Ham.</p> <p>Negotiations with the club are at an impasse over who will pay for conversion costs of up to \u00a3160m to make the stadium suitable for football as well as athletics.</p> <p>The London mayor, Boris Johnson, is keen to explore the possibility of using some of the unspent contingency, which will flow back to the Treasury, towards the conversion costs.</p> <p>\"Do remember that quite a lot of public money has already gone into the stadium. If the mayor wanted to do it, he will have to have that negotiation with the chancellor,\" said Robertson.</p> <p>The LLDC and Johnson have said they would welcome a solution that involved West Ham but \"not at any price\" and insist that an alternative option to mix concerts with other sports could also pay its way.</p> <p>\"This is a 99-year concession we're talking about so we want to make sure that we get it right. It will take as long as it takes,\" said the LLDC and ODA chief executive Dennis Hone.</p> <p>On Tuesday night Great Britain's Olympic and Paralympic heroes were celebrated at a Buckingham Palace reception hosted by the Queen.</p> <p>The athletes arrived in their official Team GB formal wear of suits, which included a special inside pocket for their medals.</p> <p>The Queen, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duchess of Cambridge, had watched the Olympic opening ceremony \u2013 and the Queen took part.</p> <p>Team GB began the summer's medal rush by winning 65 in total, including 29 golds, an achievement that was hailed as the athletes' \"greatest ever\" performance by Andy Hunt, their chef de mission for London 2012.</p>",

Encrusted with mosaics and inlaid with gold, it is the most visible (and audible) sign of the frenzied building boom that has taken hold of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/saudiarabia\" title=\"\">Saudi Arabia</a>'s holy city over the last 10 years. \"It is truly indescribable,\" says Sami Angawi, architect and founder of the Jeddah-based <a href=\"http://www.amarcenter.net/hajj-research-center.html\" title=\"\">Hajj Research Centre</a>, who has spent the last three decades researching and documenting the historic buildings of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/travel/mecca\" title=\"\">Mecca</a> and Medina, few of which now remain. In particular, the house of the prophet's wife, Khadijah, was razed to make way for public lavatories; the house of his companion, Abu Bakr, is now the site of a Hilton hotel; and his grandson's house was flattened by the King's palace. \"They are turning the holy sanctuary into a machine, a city which has no identity, no heritage, no culture and no natural environment. They've even taken away the mountains,\" says&#xa0;Angawi.</p> <p>Geological features have proved no match for dynamite and concrete, which are being liberally deployed to make way for the burgeoning number of visitors. Three million Muslims arrived in Mecca this week for the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/hajj\" title=\"\">annual hajj pilgrimage</a>, an event that has mutated from a simple, spartan rite of passage, in which pilgrims give up their worldly goods, into a big-bucks business worthy of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/lasvegas\" title=\"\">Las Vegas</a> \u2013 with the overblown architecture to&#xa0;match.</p> <p>Along the western flank of the city are the first towers of the <a href=\"http://www.jabalomar.com.sa/portal/index.php?lang=en\" title=\"\">Jabal Omar development</a>, a sprawling complex that will eventually accommodate 100,000 people in 26&#xa0;luxury hotels \u2013&#xa0;sitting on another gargantuan plinth of 4,000 shops and 500 restaurants, along with its own six-storey prayer hall. The line of blocks, which will climb to heights of up to 200 metres and terminate in a monumental gateway building, share the clocktower's Islamic-lite language: a&#xa0;cliched dressing of pointed arches and filigree grillwork plastered over generic concrete shells.</p> <p>The developers have somehow transformed a type of architecture that evolved from a dense urban grain of low-rise courtyards and narrow streets into meaningless wallpaper: an endlessly repeatable pattern for the decoration of standardised slab after standardised slab. Flimsy rows of concrete arches hang above swaths of blue mirror glass, punctuated by stick-on timber trellis screens. These are modelled on traditional mashrabiya panels, those beautiful latticework openings designed as ventilating veils, but here they become meaningless&#xa0;applique. \"If we are imitating, why can't we imitate the best?\" asks Angawi, in a tone of desperation. \"Why are we imitating the worst mistakes of 60 or 70 years ago from around the world \u2013&#xa0;only even&#xa0;bigger?\"</p> <p>Another development of repetitive slabs, echoing Jabal Omar's toast-rack urbanism, is slated for the northern side of the Grand Mosque, at <a href=\"http://alshamiyah.com/en/\" title=\"\">al-Shamiya</a>, while a $10bn plan to provide an extra 400,000 sq metres of prayer halls there is almost complete. Standing like a gigantic triangular slice of wedding cake, this building will accommodate 1.2m more worshippers each year, but it has come at a price.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398922371\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/23/1351012204259/al-Shamiya-010.jpg\" alt=\"al-Shamiya\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toast-rack urbanism ... how the al-Shamiya area will look</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"This was the most historic part of the old city,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/irfan-al-alawi\" title=\"\">Irfan al-Alawi</a>, executive director of the UK-based <a href=\"http://www.islamic-heritage.org/\" title=\"\">Islamic Heritage Research Foundation</a>, who has worked in vain to raise the profile of his country's historic sites. \"It has now all been flattened.\" Residents were evicted, he says, with one week's notice, and many have still not been compensated \u2013 a common story across Mecca's developments. \"They are now living in shantytowns on the edge of the city without proper sanitation. Locals, who have lived here for generations, are being forced out to make way for these marble castles in the sky.\"</p> <p>Alawi describes the imminent arrival of yet more seven-star hotels even closer to the mosque than the al-Bait clocktower, as well as proposals to develop <a href=\"http://www.phase1.de/projects_jabal-khandama_e.htm\" title=\"\">Jabal Khandama</a>, on the hills to the east, which will likely see the erasure of the site where the prophet Muhammad was born. Alawi says this wilful destruction of Islamic heritage is no accident: it is driven by state-endorsed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/08/islam-pakistan-rahman-baba\" title=\"\">wahhabism</a>, the hardline interpretation of Islam that perceives historical sites as encouraging sinful idolatry. So anything that relates to the prophet could be in the bulldozer's&#xa0;sights.</p> <p>\"It is the end of Mecca,\" says Alawi. \"And for what? Most of these hotels are 50% vacant and the malls are empty \u2013 the rents are too expensive for the former souk stall-holders. And people praying in the new mosque extension will not even be able to see the Kaaba.\"</p> <p>The Kaaba is the holy black cube in the centre of the Grand Mosque, around which pilgrims walk; proximity to it has become the ultimate currency, allowing hotel suites with the best views to charge $7,000 per night during peak seasons. This unique concentricity, with everything determined by its orientation towards the hallowed centre, has spawned a strangely diagrammatic radial urbanism. From above, like a sea of iron filings pulled by a magnet, the whole city appears to crowd round a core, the vortex of pilgrims giving way to an equally swirling current of tower blocks. It is the axis of prayer writ large in concrete.</p> <p>The road to Mecca funnels traffic into two lanes: the one marked \"Muslims only\" goes to the holy city; the other, marked \"Non Muslims\", bypasses it, since the latter \u2013 me included \u2013 are forbidden entry to Mecca (and Medina) under Saudi law. Soon after this hajj, work will start on the expansion of the mataf, the open area around the Kaaba, to triple its capacity to 130,000 pilgrims per hour. But to create this, the historic centre of the mosque will be obliterated. \"They want to get rid of the brick vaults and stone columns that have stood there since the 17th century,\" says Alawi. \"These are the oldest part of the holy mosque, designed by the great architect Sinan. The pillars are inscribed with stories and the names of the prophet's companions, so the wahhabis want to see them&#xa0;bulldozed.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398922372\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1351012326661/Toast-rack-in-the-sky-...-004.jpg\" alt=\"Toast rack in the sky ... a CGI construction of what the Jabal Omar project will look like\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jabal Omar project</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The desperation to be, or feel, as close as possible to the Kaaba has forced buildings to become ever higher, ever more ridiculously tapered, so everyone can have a view, however notional, of the sacred centre. This has given the sanctified \"mother of villages\" the most expensive real estate in the world: a square foot around the Grand Mosque now sells for up to $18,000, mayor Osama al-Bar said last&#xa0;year, dwarfing the Monaco average&#xa0;of&#xa0;$4,400.</p> <p>As the influx of pilgrims increases, land values will continue to rise: 12&#xa0;million visit the city every year, a figure expected to swell to 17 million by 2025. They will be eased on their way by a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvQtWlPxRwo\" title=\"\">new high-speed rail link that will connect gateway city Jeddah with Mecca and Medina</a>. Jeddah's <a href=\"http://www.jed-airport.com/en/\" title=\"\">King Abdul Aziz international airport</a> is itself undergoing expansion to quadruple its capacity to 80 million passengers a&#xa0;year.</p> <p>Fuelled by petrodollars, all of these vast projects are now either completed or well under way. So it seems strange that King Abdullah should only now be ordering the creation of a masterplan for Mecca and its surroundings, covering buildings, transport and infrastructure \u2013 given that most of the city's holy mountains have been dynamited into dust, and all but a handful of its ancient monuments buried beneath soaring structures. As Angawi says: \"There is no other place in the world where development starts with bulldozing before planning. But it is not too late if we stop now. Otherwise, we risk the sanctity of Mecca being gone for ever.\"</p> <h2>Prayer room with a view: a pilgrim's perspective</h2> <p>Everything about the hajj is overwhelming \u2013 the numbers, the logistics, the infrastructure, the stakes \u2013 so it's no surprise that the architecture is catching up. Its sleek and state-of-the-art towers offer butler services, designer toiletries, entire floors reserved for Saudi royalty, wet rooms, helipads, quality linens, plush carpets and thick&#xa0;bathrobes.</p> <p>During my 2010 visit to Mecca, a number of hotels in the Abraj al-Bait complex (left, with clocktower) were at 100% capacity. The hotel employee showing me around one presidential suite said I could pray in front of the Qibla without ever leaving the room, gesturing to a window with priceless views to prove his point. The sense of exclusivity extended to the reservation system, too. Rooms could only be booked through the hotel, but not as part of a package, the traditional if not the uniform way of securing accommodation in&#xa0;Mecca.</p> <p>None of this is visible at ground level. Pilgrims occupy every available space and the dimensions of the projects are too grand to be appreciated simply by craning the neck. Instead, the best views are from the Jeddah-Mecca Highway, where the clocktower appears to rear out of the barren landscape in such an outlandish fashion it looks as if it has been drawn on to the skyline. The vast floor-to-ceiling windows of al-Safa Palace, perched on a hill above Mecca's holy sites, fully reveal the audacious vision to reshape the&#xa0;pilgrimage.</p> <p>The building work has inevitably changed the hajj experience for everyone. Aside from the increased pollution and heavy machinery, there is more segregation along economic and class lines. Muslims cannot choose where or when to perform the hajj \u2013 it can only be done in Mecca, at a certain point in the year \u2013 but they can choose where to stay.</p> <p><strong>Riazat Butt</strong></p>",
  "<p>Costa Coffee bosses are perhaps wise not to hold their breath in expectation of hordes of tax campaigners, intellectuals and poets patronising its 1,479 cafes in protest at the tax affairs of rival operator Starbucks. Reminiscent of Paris's Left Bank they are not.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the latest YouGov brand preference survey suggests Costa is continuing to show a clean pair of heels to Starbucks in terms of the brand's ranking in the affections of British coffee drinkers. Conducted before last week's scrutiny of Starbucks's UK tax bill, it showed Costa jumping from 28% to 32% in terms of consumer preference in 2012. About half of the gain appeared to be at the expense of Starbucks, now on 23%. The next survey update, conducted at the end of this month, should make for interesting reading.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that Costa's parent group Whitbread has avoided the kind of tax acrobatics which last week provoked such <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/21/starbucks-tax-ps-wake-up-smell-coffee?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">outrage against Starbucks</a>. The business has long resisted the siren calls of financial engineers promising an easy boost to the bottom line \u2013 and to boardroom bonuses.</p> <p>There is nothing overly clever or flashy about Whitbread. And this simple fact, with the benefit of hindsight, explains quite a lot about how the group has found itself a standout success story in Britain's embattled leisure industry. On Tuesday it delivered yet another strong set of results, with half-year revenue bursting through the \u00a31bn mark for the first time, despite a tough trading environment. Three years ago the figure was \u00a3700m.</p> <p>Much of that growth has been generated by new Costas and Premier Inns sprouting up across the UK, and many more overseas. There are 10,000 more British jobs promised from Whitbread over the next three years. Meanwhile, the shares have <a href=\"http://www.whitbread.co.uk/whitbread/investors.html\" title=\"\">climbed 25% in the last six months</a>, to more than \u00a323.</p> <p>It is hard to think of another FTSE 100 leisure company investing in its future, and creating British jobs, with such confidence. Come to think of it, these days it is hard to think of another FTSE 100 leisure company full stop. Aside from Intercontinental Hotel Group and Carnival \u2013 both largely focused overseas \u2013 Whitbread is the last remaining leisure group to form part of the blue-chip index.</p> <p>Relegation has been the story for pub groups Punch Taverns, Enterprise Inns, Mitchells &amp; Butlers as well as for bookmakers William Hill and Ladbrokes. Each has struggled, to a greater or lesser degree, with mountainous debts. Wind the clock back a few years and Whitbread too had been under tremendous investor pressure to follow its peers down this ill-advised path. Whether by luck or foresight, it did not.</p> <p>If Whitbread has outperformed its British-listed peers, the contrast with other competitors is even more stark. Starbucks is now mired in controversy about whether or not it has been meaningfully profitable in the UK for the last 14 years. Meanwhile, Premier Inn's closest rival Travelodge, a private equity-backed business, has presided over a calamitous destruction of value and was forced into a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/04/travelodge-rescue-deal-landlord-vote?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">rescue deal with landlords </a>last month.</p> <p>Another painful debt restructuring is expected to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/09/david-lloyd-leisure-painful-refinancing-debt\" title=\"\">play out at David Lloyd Leisure</a>, the debt-laden gym and tennis club business acquired by Lloyds Banking Group and property tycoons Richard and Ian Livingstone. It had had conservative borrowings when part of Whitbread. But when five years ago Whitbread received a staggering, debt-fuelled offer for the business of \u00a3925m it had little option but to hand the clubs over to the stewardship of the financial wizards.</p> <p>Even in better times those at the top of Whitbread have never enjoyed anything close to the pay windfalls seen at competitors \u2013 which then went on to fare so poorly. But better builders of long-term shareholder value, in the leisure sector at least, you will struggle to find.</p>",

That may sound as if it means: can the public imagine him bayoneting Syrian President Assad while riding a horse, or ordering a military strike against Iran. But in the last weeks of a campaign, it means something much more specific.</p> <p>Romney has had either 18 months or five years, depending how you're counting, to introduce his commander-in-chief bona fides to the full range of American voters. In the final weeks of a close race, his task was a different one: convincing undecided and middle-of-the road voters, who seem, this cycle, to be disproportionately women, that he is a likeable, moderate guy with solutions to the problems they face.</p> <p>As I have <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2012/10/22/dont-assume-women-dont-care-about-national-security\">written elsewhere</a>, polling continues to find that women are less receptive to violence and conflict-based solutions to problems than men. They \u2013 as well as moderates \u2013 disproportionately prefer Obama's approach to national security policy. This is <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/22/presidential-debate-reactions-2012-twitter-women-foreign-policy_n_2002996.html\">why</a> \"last night's\" Mitt Romney used the word \"peace\" so many times, and was so anxious to agree with President Obama's plans to remove US troops from Afghanistan, refuse to send US troops to Syria and intervene militarily in Iran only as a last resort.</p> <p>But for this to work, Romney had to do more than hug Obama on substance and find smart-sounding attack lines. He needed to come up with positive alternatives: what <em>is</em> the Middle East policy that will get rid of the murderous Assad, convince Israelis and Palestinians to come to terms and provoke the Arab streets to love us? What should the next administration do about the magical opportunity he invoked in Latin America? What tools are there he can deploy that Obama does not have to convince Iran to drop its nuclear program?</p> <p>Commentators \u2013 and not just Democrats \u2013 have been hitting Romney on his lack of substance, since the spring. Bill Kristol, Peggy Noonan, Colin Powell, Danielle Pletka have all at various times suggested that his vague positions lacked seriousness. \"Think, Mitt,\" Powell <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/colin-powell-to-romney-on-foreign-policy-come-on-mitt-think/257578/\">pleaded</a> after the \"Russia No 1 geopolitical foe\" comment.</p> <p>Romney had a run of misfortunes with his foreign policy outings: missteps on his Europe and Israel trip, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/10/romney-speech-vmi-emails\">criticism</a> over politicization of the VMI speech venue, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/06/mitt-romney-afghanistan_n_1862533.html\">omission</a> of Afghanistan and veterans from his convention speech. So, to come off seriously and successfully as a moderate, he needed to shut down Obama's critique of him.</p> <p>And here he failed. Obama scored zinger after zinger: a decade wants its military policy back \u2013 a military of cavalry and bayonets, and on and on. Effective responses were few and far between, which meant Romney was allowing Obama to fire up his own base and sow doubts in Romney's target audience.</p> <p>The insta-polls last night, whatever they may say about the race itself, reflected Romney's failure to move from a candidate with a critique to a leader with bullet-proof, or at least quip-proof, policy alternatives.</p> <p>The polls showed it; the dial-tests showed it; the pundit analyses showed it. Romney made a full run at Obama's dominance on national security, and didn't shake it. It remains to be seen how profound this impact is on the race, but the conventional wisdom about the politics of American national security, marked for three decades by progressives' fear of conservative dominance and mockery, will never be the same.</p> <p><em>Heather Hurlburt is executive director of the National Security Network</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Romney tried to distance himself from George Bush'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245558\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Both candidates were broadly in favor of a US foreign policy that includes or permits preventive war, drone attacks, untrammeled executive surveillance powers and \"crippling sanctions\" against Iran.</p> <p>Both insisted no option was off the table in dealing with Iran, a threat they both described in the same terms. Both supported regime change in Libya by US arms and in Egypt \u2013 though in the latter case, they would leave it up to the Egyptians themselves.</p> <p>Neither was specific about what kind of \"help\" they had in mind for Syrian rebels. Neither was willing to admit their policies might lead to direct American military involvement in the places where they were intervening.</p> <p>The only time the exchange between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney genuinely resembled a debate was when it veered off-topic, tackling subjects ranging from tax cuts to school classroom sizes.</p> <p>Romney uttered cliches about his opponent apologizing for America, while Obama pretended that his successful raid against Osama bin Laden was representative of his track record against al-Qaida more generally.</p> <p>The most interesting aspect of the debate was Romney trying to distance himself from George W Bush, explicitly saying the country didn't need another Iraq or Afghanistan war.</p> <p>The second most interesting was the level of mockery and sarcasm employed by Obama \u2013 he once reminded Romney that the military budget wasn't a game of battleship \u2013 which was unusual for an incumbent president. Perhaps Obama's most effective line, though, was when <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/third_presidential_debate_the_foreign_policy_argument_between_barack_obama.html\">he said Romney would</a> \"do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that will make a difference.\"</p> <p>It stung because it seemed true.</p> <p>Romney tried to be agreeable and avoid looking like a warmonger. Obama was aggressive and looked somewhat like he thought he was running from behind.</p> <p>Obama edged out Romney in the second and third debates, but Romney scored a decisive victory in the first. In the end, it appears that Romney has been the net beneficiary, turning this into a competitive race once again. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57536261/polls-gallup-still-has-romney-up-marist-shows-obama-leads-in-two-swing-states/\">Gallup has the former Massachusetts governor ahead</a>, most swing state polls still suggest the president is the frontrunner. </p> <p>But there's no debating, it's close.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alex-slater\">Alex Slater</a>: 'If anyone took the Bush mantle, it was Obama'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245559\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2010/9/20/1284991083547/alexslater_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Slater\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>America was deprived of a \"rock 'em, sock 'em\" third presidential debate this election season. Instead, what undecided voters in swing states got last night was a meandering, sometimes slightly argumentative, but largely somniferous discussion between two candidates more interested in mild personal attacks than in substantive foreign policy.</p> <p>Yes, Obama won the debate: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/pollingcenter/polls/3287\">48% of a scientifically conducted poll with CNN </a>voters confirmed the president's victory, but only by a relatively small margin. Indeed, 40% believed Governor Romney to be the victor. In an ever-tightening race, this should give Democrats pause.</p> <p>Romney's performance was nuanced to a fault. Clearly, his staff had tattooed the words \"do no harm\" on his arm before he stepped on stage. And clearly, the governor paid attention. Conscious of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/15/swing-states-poll-women-voters-romney-obama/1634791/\">the tightening polls among female voters</a>, Romney had obviously been briefed to be non-aggressive, to avoid the mantle of warmonger \u2013 in short, to avoid becoming the third rail of American politics: the bumbling, warmongering President George W Bush.</p> <p>But that also exposed him to appear weak, a \"yes man\" to Obama's four-year record in office. Indeed, as Mara Liasson, journalist for NPR, pointed out only minutes after the debate, Romney's most uttered words seemed to be \"I agree\".</p> <p>The president, on the other hand, apart from inexplicably having been told to stare at the governor in what can only be described as a creepy glare, was in a feistier mood. For months now, his campaign has steadily avoided the \"go-to\" political tactic in the American political narrative: painting your opponent as a flip-flopper, undecided and vacillating on issues.</p> <p>That restraint was gone last night, as the president repeatedly delivered attack after attack on Romney's inconsistent record, from troops in Iraq to the surge in Afghanistan. In fact, if anyone took the Bush mantle, it was Obama repeating almost word for word parts of President Bush's second convention speech:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will never shy away from defending America.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, where does this leave the campaign in these closing weeks? Yes, Obama won tonight, but these debates have been lackluster at best. On the whole, the three match-ups can likely be called an overall draw, with the first debate propelling what the press is now calling \"Mittmentum\". Nevertheless, the political calculus remains firmly in the president's favor, with Ohio \u2013 this election's pivotal state \u2013 looking likely to swing Obama's way.</p> <p>If that happens, political scientists across the country will be forced to return to the age-old \u2013 and still unresolved \u2013 question, \"Do debates really matter?\" And last night, here in Boca, that seemed doubtful at best.</p> <p><em>Alex Slater is a Democratic strategist and principal of the political consultancy Clyde Strategies</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/markweisbrot\">Mark Weisbrot</a>: 'It was a victory just to have drones mentioned'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245560\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/28/1288281260427/weisbrot.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Weisbrot\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Weisbrot</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The presidential debate on foreign policy is always a painful and disgusting spectacle for any reality-based viewer.</p> <p>Both candidates play into the fantasy that the United States needs to spend more on its military than most of the world combined, because we face grave threats when the rest of the world knows that US foreign and military policy is all about power and empire.

Most importantly, Romney is more likely to go to war with Iran; this despite the fact that Obama shifted his position (during the debate) to Romney's position that Iran will have to give up its \"nuclear program\" (Obama started out saying \"nuclear weapons\" would not be tolerated). Romney's assertion that he wants to make \"pariahs\" of Iranian diplomats reflects a substantive difference \u2013 that he is less likely to seek a negotiated solution and more likely to start another disastrous war. Romney was also forced to acknowledge that he would pay for an additional $2tn in military spending with cuts to domestic spending, something most Americans don't want.</p> <p>Anti-war organizations <a href=\"http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1439/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=11788\">petitioned</a> moderator Bob Schieffer to ask a question about drones, and he did. Drones have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/americans-press-us-ambass_b_1941919.html\">killed</a> hundreds of civilians in Pakistan, building a groundswell of hatred against America. The existence of the program is officially classified, and the Obama administration does not publicly acknowledge it, so it was something of a victory just to have it mentioned.</p> <p>On the technical side, Obama was combative and did very well, as he did in the second debate. If he loses this election \u2013 which is not likely, but still possible \u2013 it will be due to his failure to confront Romney on an issue that is most important to senior citizens, the only age group where he is losing.</p> <p>That issue is social security. <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security\">Both Romney and his party</a> are on the record in favor of cuts to social security, but Obama from the first debate has <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/11991-social-security-president-obamas-biggest-failure-in-last-weeks-debate\">pretended</a> that there is no difference on this issue. This is an enormous tactical and political blunder.</p> <p><em>Mark Weisbrot is co-director of the <a href=\"www.cepr.net\">Center for Economic and Policy Research</a> and president of <a href=\"www.justforeignpolicy.org\">Just Foreign Policy</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/malou-innocent\">Malou Innocent</a>: 'At last, Romney has adopted a tone of moderation'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245561\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1351017284339/malou_innocent.jpg\" alt=\"malou innocent\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At last night's <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-romney-final-presidential-debate-2012-full-transcript-text-video-851763\">final presidential debate</a>, Governor Mitt Romney diverged sharply from his empty rhetoric of muscular American leadership. How refreshing.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Romney has evoked the bluster and relentless chest-thumping of President Bush. But last night, Romney conveyed an attitude of humility that many war-weary Americans are desperate to hear. In his early opening salvo, he congratulated President Obama for \"taking out Osama bin Laden,\" and added: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"But we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, while going after al-Qaida is the right policy, meeting that challenge only militarily won't resolve the underlying political circumstances that give rise to terrorism.</p> <p>In another extraordinary turn, Romney said on the subject of getting the Muslim world to reject extremism that \"[w]e don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan\". Perhaps Romney's realist handlers \u2013 those who want him to win the presidency \u2013 have finally gotten to him: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/9ryfw2v\">polls show overwhelmingly that Americans think the Iraq war was a mistake</a>, and America paid an enormous price in blood and treasure for an Iraq under considerable Iranian influence. Even <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/8kubbv6\">many in the GOP</a> have turned against America's endless wars of nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>The governor was vague and evasive at times, perhaps to obscure the fact that his substantive differences with Obama were minimal and mainly semantic. For instance, on Syria, Romney's policy is no different than the incumbent's. He advocates helping the opposition by working with America's partners; finding responsible parties and rebels and arming them; working for the creation of a responsible government to replace Bashir al-Assad; and not getting drawn into a military conflict by injecting neither American troops nor a no-fly zone.</p> <p>On military spending, Romney came across as disjointed and contradictory. After all, if a President Romney intends to spend 4% of America's GDP on the military \u2013 an increase of $2tn over the next ten years \u2013 then how will his administration pay for that and close the budget deficit?</p> <p>Part of the problem is that Romney's vision appears to be driven by capabilities and tactics (incremental policies to achieve short-term objectives) rather than a clearly articulated strategy (a broad sense of guidance for our actions and decisions). Worse, both Romney and Obama embrace some of the same hawkish and meddlesome national security and surveillance policies adopted under President Bush. In that respect, President Obama's predecessor \u2013 and the pro-interventionist foreign policy establishment in Washington \u2013 was the debate's clear winner.</p> <p>For all of these flaws, though, Governor Romney's shift was still remarkable. Juxtaposed with his previous invocations of the American people watching the world and \"shaping events\", or having \"confidence in our cause\" and \"resolve in our might\", he appears to have realized Americans are tired after enduring the human and financial costs of two prolonged and deeply unpopular wars. At last, the Romney campaign has adopted a tone of moderation in the final weeks before the election.</p> <p><em>Malou Innocent is a foreign policy analyst at the Cato Institute</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Some will find the president's diatribe unattractively sarcastic'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245562\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In a perfect world, candidates would come to a foreign policy debate with great knowledge, recognition of the complications and difficulties in making the world a better place, and a humility about their ability to foresee events in a rapidly-changing world. Both candidates would recall that President George W Bush campaigned on a pledge for a humble foreign policy in 2000, and President Obama would recognize that promises such as closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay turned out to be much harder to keep than he expected. </p> <p>Around the globe, promises are easier to make than keep. Every presidential challenger paints the incumbent as soft on China; once in office, the economic intertwining of the US and China, and Washington's quite limited ability to influence the decision-making in Beijing, become clearer. For <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/316070/bill-clinton-still-talking\">four straight cycles</a>, Bill Clinton and George W Bush pledged to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; for 16 years, those promises were perpetually delayed. (Of course, this year the issue briefly returned again, as Democrats had a floor fight over a declaration that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.)</p> <p>Unfortunately, last night's debate occurred in a far from perfect world. Voters aren't thinking about foreign policy right now, and both candidates knew it. There aren't that many undecided voters left, and those that are may not have been watching. The debate was up against Monday Night Football and the seventh game of the baseball playoffs, suggesting viewership would be lower than the preceding two presidential debates.</p> <p>To the extent undecided voters think about foreign policy at all, they're quasi-isolationist and poorly informed. The last thing they want to hear is that the world is complicated, or that the US can't tell other countries to go pound sand.</p> <p>Finally, while Bob Schieffer seemed to hit the right balance of tough questions without frequent interruptions, the topics were heavily focused on the Middle East. In 90 minutes of debate, there was no discussion of the European Union, its currency and debt crises, and what that could mean for the US economy. No mention of violence on our southern border with Mexico; no mention of India.</p> <p>Mitt Romney and Barack Obama went into Monday night with dramatically different strategies. The president seemed to think he needed a knockout blow and his base undoubtedly believes he landed one after another, while some will find the president's \"horses and bayonets\" and Battleship diatribe remarkably condescending and unattractively sarcastic (the Democratic base undoubtedly believes Mitt Romney is a joke and deserves to be treated as such). The independents and folks who climbed onto the Romney bandwagon since the first debate are unlikely to be persuaded by this sneer, however.</p> <p>Romney, on the other hand, aimed to look presidential. The result was a remarkably uncombative debate performance. It seems he believed Obama's last big card to play was that Romney would be a duplicate of George W Bush on issues of war and peace, and so he disarmed it by declaring early on, \"we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"</p> <p>The word \"peace\" was used 12 times last night; it was spoken by Romney every time. It was a sales pitch to a war-weary nation \u2013 likely to be effective, even if the next four years are rather unlikely to see any genuine, lasting peace.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review and writes the Campaign Spot blog</em></p>",

Scientists, she said, \"should be scientists and not buffoons\".</p> <p>\"They reassured us and then we died in our homes,\" said a resident, Domenico Di Giamberardino.</p> <p>But Eva insisted neither he nor his colleagues had given any reassurances in their brief, 40-minute meeting. \"We always maintained it was not possible to predict or exclude an earthquake,\" he said.</p> <p>With two appeals permitted under Italian law, the scientists will not be going to jail immediately, but Eva said his morale was devastated by the verdict. \"I do not feel guilty from a scientific point of view,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In court the prosecutor referred to the failure in predicting hurricane Katrina, but it is a lot easier to predict a hurricane than an earthquake,\" he said.</p> <p>L'Aquila, which still lies in ruins, was also damaged by earthquakes in 1349, 1461 and 1703. \"An earthquake is like an assassin that returns to the scene of a crime after centuries,\" said Eva, \"but you can never tell when.\"</p>",

So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did</p> </blockquote> <p>In 2012, the auto industry is looking healthier, with growth even on last year, according to this data from the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iagauto.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. It shows employment up slightly on 2011, 53,400 on the year before. </p> <p>However, hourly earnings for those in auto manufacturing haven't kept pace with inflation, down from $21.97 last year to $21.15 now.</p> <p>If you look at the employment data by region it shows slight improvements on last year. But still not a complete revival.</p> <h2><a name=\"health\">Health care</a></h2> <p>US health care and 'Obama care' came up repeatedly too.</p> <p>Said Obama in the second debate</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2014 it's true \u2014 but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years </p> </blockquote> <p>So, how does the US compare? Although it doesn't have a national health service like the UK, it still has the highest health spending in the world. The US has the highest health spending in the world - equivalent to 17.9% of its gross domestic product (GDP), or $8,362 per person. And it's not all private - government spending is at $4,437 per person, only behind Luxembourg, Monaco and Norway.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jun/30/healthcare-spending-world-country\">Read more</a></p> <h2><a name=\"cop\">World cop</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398238793\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1351008304433/US-military-deployments-o-008.jpg\" alt=\"US military deployments overseas, interactive\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US military deployments overseas, interactive.

Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines</p> </blockquote> <p>We extracted the data from the <a href=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org9-4.htm#2000\">US Department of Defense archive</a> and it shows that the Navy is smaller now than in 1917, with 285 vessels, compared to 342.

But it's really just less bad, rather than good.</p> <p>The European commission said confidence edged up from -25.9 points in September to -25.6 this month. That's the eurozone figure. In the wider European Union confidence fell from -24 to -24.2. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>October\u2019s marginal rise in consumer confidence followed a marked overall decline through the previous four months and sentiment is still at its second lowest level since May 2009. Furthermore, it follows on from other latest surveys showing drops in business confidence in October in both France and Belgium.</p> <p>The likelihood is therefore that Eurozone consumers will remain extremely careful in their spending in the fourth quarter, and the suspicion is that the single currency area will struggle markedly to avoid further GDP contraction. This would highly likely be a third successive GDP decline as we estimate that GDP fell by around 0.2%-0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter after a drop of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter.</p> <p>Certainly, the economic fundamentals currently make up a largely unhealthy cocktail for consumer spending across the eurozone - high and rising unemployment, generally muted wage growth and tightening fiscal policy in many countries. Furthermore, Eurozone consumer price inflation moved back up to 2.6% in September and August from 2.4% in July, thereby adding to the squeeze on their purchasing power. On top of this, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis likely remains a serious concern for many consumers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:54:26.214Z\">at 4.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086a28b58f96784ee2909e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T14:01:44.413Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Latest from Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the Greek coalition government's meeting continues (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/23/eurozone-crisis-greek-cuts-spanish-bailout#block-50868cc3c0e343ef1abc7f3f\">see 13.25</a>), politicians have been discussing the need to agree the cuts demanded by the Troika (our Athens correspondent <strong>Helena Smith</strong> reports)</p> <p>Development minister <strong>Costis Hadjidakis</strong> set the scene for further painful austerity by predicting:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Winning] the next aid instalment is a national effort that we are doomed to win</p> </blockquote> <p>adding that \u201cLiquidity is key.\u201d</p> <p>But main opposition leader <strong>Alexis Tsipras</strong> said while Greece needed the money \u201cnot one euro will go to the real economy\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, he said, almost all of the \u20ac31.5bn instalment will go to banks which stand to be recapitalised to the tune of \u20ac25bn.</p> <p><em>And with that, my colleague Nick Fletcher will see you home.

  "<p>Following the most recent presidential and vice presidential debates, global communications network <a href=\"http://www.havasmedia.com/\" title=\"\">Havas Media</a> have released further data on the US Presidential candidates' 'meaningfulness' scores.</p> <p>You can see the first set of results from this series <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/15/obama-romney-brand-analysis\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>The scores track how voters feel the candidates will help them as they strive to live more meaningful and more fulfilled lives. 'Meaningfulness' is defined by measuring 39 softer factors that measure whether the candidates are seen to be not just be making political promises \u2013 but to be actively, tangibly making a difference to people, the community, the planet and society. The analysis also tracks how voters are using different media platforms and how voters are using different media platforms. Here are some of the key findings.</p> <p><strong>Most voters do not think that either candidate will offer them a better quality of life</strong></p> <p>Scores are on the rise for Obama, although they are still low \u2013 only a third of voters think that either will have a positive impact on their personal wellbeing and the wellbeing of the communities they care about. Romney saw gains in factors associated with money and security.</p> <p><strong>Paul Ryan's impact during the vice presidential debate also had a positive effect on Romney's meaningfulness scores</strong></p> <p>Although his scores are still significantly lower than Obama's, Romney did see an increase following the VP and second presidential debates, specifically in the areas feeling safe and less vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>Text and face to face discussion increased significantly during the debates, while chatter on Facebook and Twitter decreased</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Viewing figures increased as the number of voters watching via online video, tablet, mobile phone, desktop or laptop computer increased</p> <p>\u2022 Still only 20% of voters follow or actively write on Facebook about the debate/election</p> <p>\u2022 40% of voters preferred to speak to friends and family in person (compared to 28% three weeks ago)</p> <p>\u2022 Voters are twice as likely to get information about Obama via micro blogs (eg Twitter) than about Romney</p> <p><strong>Fast facts on this week's meaningful scores:</strong></p> <p>1. Following the second presidential debate, Romney is perceived as the stronger candidate in terms of listening to and caring about citizens</p> <p>2. While Obama still leads in perception of support of charities and good causes, Romney is quickly gaining on him</p> <p>3. Obama saw a significant increase in inspiring voters to make the world a better place, in comparison to a modest increase by Romney</p> <p>4. Obama's scores for fostering community development increased, while Romney's increased only marginally</p> <p>5. On the question of who is a 'true leader', while Obama's scores are still significantly higher than Romney's, scores for Romney increased as Obama's scores decreased</p> <p>6. Both candidates' scores increased when voters were asked about their commitment to solving environmental issues \u2013 Obama scored significantly higher overall, however</p> <p>7. In general, Romney continues to lag behind Obama, underscoring his challenge to connect with voters in a meaningful way.</p> <p><em>This post was originally posted on the </em><a href=\"http://www.havasmedia.com/2012/10/as-both-candidates-struggle-to-offer-more-meaning-and-voters-turn-to-more-traditional-communications-can-social-media-and-celebrity-endorsement-widen-the-gap-for-obama/\" title=\"\"><em>Havas Media website</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>One thing I can't get my head around in Bollywood films is all that swapping between Hindi and English (do people really do that in India?). Breaking into English seems to happen for a few reasons: speaking to English people; indicating social class; characters giving it a bit of attitude; for gratuitous dramatic emphasis. The last three apply (often simultaneously) in the preppy new comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fivOhPjX9YM\" title=\"\">Student of the Year</a>, about the lengths ridiculously chiselled students go to get ahead at the ridiculously chipper St Theresa's high school, where English is obviously part of the heritage. But one usage in the film stands out: the title.</p> <p>Having an English title is a sign that a film, like the students, has aspirations. I'm always amazed that so few Bollywood films translate their titles when they're distributed abroad \u2013 this tiny, simple tweak could do so much to extend their reach beyond Hindi speakers. The studios bother to subtitle their films for export \u2013 presumably for second-generation immigrants with a shaky grasp of the mother tongue, and curious foreigners \u2013 so why not extend the effort to some of the overall marketing as well? Student of the Year is a typical 21st-century Bollywood blockbuster, its weave from the same garish MTV-borrowed pattern that is part of youth culture everywhere now. The title seems like a pretty good place to advertise that.</p> <p>But barely any take that first step. A weird resignation has settled that non-Indian audiences aren't fundamentally interested: in the UK at least, Bollywood films are rarely screened to the mainstream press, so they don't get reviewed much. Our critic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/peterbradshaw\" title=\"\">Peter Bradshaw</a> informs me that dominant distributor Eros International stopped press screening several years ago, because film prints often arrive in the UK almost on the day of release: \"I don't think reviews made any difference to their business model!\"</p> <p>Of course the 25 million-strong worldwide Indian diaspora is the priority. Every article I've written about Bollywood always draws comments on how its cinema is too culturally alien to appeal to anyone else: too long, too repetitive, and, yes, all those bloody songs. But that gap will never be bridged in the west, or a market created for the more culturally digestible films that Bollywood has to offer, without some basic overtures \u2013 such as allowing people to understand at a glance what a film is about. I'm convinced the crossover market is there, with today's audiences better travelled and more ethnically mixed. Subtitles aren't the dealbreaker they once were: 49 such films crossed the \u00a31m mark in Britain in the noughties, where that figure was nine in the 90s.</p> <p>After all, it's the big Indian players who have talked in recent years about the way forward for Bollywood: that it needs to turn its attention to the global mainstream, and Hollywood's stranglehold over it. There have been the occasional mild breakouts, such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/134107/3-idiots\" title=\"\">3 Idiots</a> ($72m worldwide) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/134614/my-name-is-khan\" title=\"\">My Name Is Khan</a> ($42m), and the odd gimmicky come-on to the international scene, such as Reliance Entertainment getting Brett Ratner to re-cut <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/may/20/kites-brett-ratner-hrithik-roshan\" title=\"\">Kites</a>, in 2009, into a shorter version.</p> <p>But it strikes me that, just by marketing its regular output more directly, Bollywood could quietly achieve much higher visibility day-by-day. Even with the 150-minute runtime, the irrepressible urge for manufactured song-and-dance, the full pony-show, Student of the Year still has a basic daffy exuberance that, with a Hollywood-scale marketing budget, can cross cultural boundaries: the Indian Glee, maybe? (I'm spitballing here.) That kind of marketplace muscle is all Bollywood's globally streamlined breed is lacking now: last year's Goa crime thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141474/dum-maaro-dum\" title=\"\">Dum Maaro Dum</a>, and this year's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1wEeuAosNM\" title=\"\">Kahaani</a>, with Vidya Balan as a pregnant software engineer leading the audience on a Usual Suspects-style dance, were as multiplex-ready as anything from Hollywood.</p> <p>There's still the matter of the titles, of course (Dum Maaro Dum=Take a Shot; Kahaani=Story). I can understand why Bollywood is reluctant to translate: it might dilute the impact of its existing marketing and alienate the Hindi-speaking faithful. But, set against the talk of becoming a global operator, that shows the true, half-metamorphosed state of where the Indian industry is now. Perhaps it needs to follow the plot of another recent release, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148735/english-vinglish\" title=\"\">English Vinglish</a>, whose laddoo-making Maharashtra housewife decides, because of the mockery of her family, that it's time to take English classes.

They will be permitted to enter the courtroom and argue cases directly, have their own offices and, for the first time, represent male clients.</p> <p>It is a hugely important step along the long and bumpy road Saudi Arabia must travel if it is to achieve anything like gender equality. In theory, female lawyers will enjoy exactly the same professional rights as their male counterparts. In practice, however, it might not be so straightforward.</p> <p>Women will still need approval from their male guardian plus the requisite legal degree and three years' experience in a lawyer's office. Not easy in a strictly gender-segregated country where women are seen as belonging in the home. Around 60% of Saudi women now have university degrees, according to an Oxford Strategic Consulting study, yet they only make up <a href=\"http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/uploads/Womens_Employment_in_Saudi_Arabia.pdf\" title=\"\">15% of the workforce</a>.</p> <p>Ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia remains the only country in the world where women are forbidden from driving. They are currently excluded from holding prominent political positions and will get the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15055066\" title=\"\">vote for the first time in 2015</a>. Women still cannot travel, open a bank account or access health care without male permission. And Saudi Arabia languishes in 131st place out of 135 countries in the <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-2011/\" title=\"\">World Economic Forum's 2011 Global Gender Gap report</a>, and rock bottom among high-income countries.</p> <p>The international firms with Saudi offices are the very same that trumpet diversity credentials and produce slick pamphlets detailing commitments to closing the gender gap.</p> <p>Back in 2010 Freshfields was one of first firms to make diversity a buzzword, with an initiative aimed at increasing retention of female lawyers, earning it a <a href=\"http://www.rollonfriday.com/TheNews/EuropeNews/tabid/58/Id/1662/fromTab/36/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">lovely award from Glamour Magazine</a>. More recently it has been considering quotas to up the number of female partners. Yet since 2008 it has also boasted an associated office in Riyadh, where its only female legal consultant is barred from obtaining a license to practise until the law changes.</p> <p>And there are swathes of other firms in similar positions, enjoying close partnerships with Saudi firms, while making earnest commitments to diversity.</p> <p>According to Freshfields' Middle East and North Africa regional managing partner, Pervez Akhtar, diversity is a \"business imperative that we take very seriously\" and the firm has a \"number of initiatives in place to help women raise their profile and succeed\", including a recent decision to take on two female interns in Riyadh. But, he says, how the legal profession deals with the advancement of women \"needs to be tailored to the many different circumstances and jurisdictions in which our clients and global law firms operate.\"</p> <p>This seems reflected in the slow pace of efforts by international firms in Saudi Arabia to include women. Clifford Chance's Saudi partner firm, for example, has built a separate space for women in its Riyadh office. But as it is only for visiting female lawyers, and not for female recruits, it is hardly a great stride towards equality.</p> <p>Clearly law firms are not charities dedicated to women's rights. They are businesses and it would be na\u00efve to suggest that they should only work in countries with unimpeachable human rights records. Some might even suggest that they are pushing forward women's rights by just being there, but this too seems na\u00efve. How many law firms are piling into Chad or Yemen, countries with a similar disdain for equality?</p> <p>Despite recent progress, those firms with a longstanding presence in Saudi Arabia seem to have made a clear statement that access to riyals comes before concerns about doing business in a place which tramples over women's rights.</p> <p>That is their prerogative, but should we then take their commitments to diversity as much more than lip service?</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>Water is the source of life but almost 800 million people don't have access to clean drinking water. Preventable water-borne diseases, such as dysentery and diarrhoea are a particular threat to the weakest members of society and a child dies from water-related illness every 20 seconds.</p> <p>Unilever is partnering with Facebook and global health organisation PSI to get safe drinking water to more people by leveraging the power of the social graph on Facebook to connect 'people with means' to 'people in need'.</p> <p>Initially launched as a beta pilot, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Waterworks\" title=\"\">Waterworks</a> is among the first Timeline applications for charitable giving. People are being invited to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Waterworks\">sign up to Waterworks</a> and connect the application to their Facebook Timeline. They partner with a PSI-trained Waterworker and choose a small daily donation \u2013 as little as \u20ac0.10. Their funds directly support water-poor communities, where Waterworkers provide education about the benefits of clean drinking water and distribute life-saving Pureit water purifiers and sachets to families in need.</p> <p>In its initial stage, PSI is training 75 Waterworkers who will educate people in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh\">Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India</a> about the need for clean water and its opportunity to improve the health and wellness of their community. They will distribute life-saving Pureit sachets and purifiers to these families.</p> <p>Each Waterworker is given a mobile phone, preloaded with a custom Waterworks J2ME application that allows her to take photos and record stories. She then shares these updates back to her partners on Facebook, demonstrating how their funds are making an impact in her community, and inspiring her partners to continue giving and supporting her work.</p> <p>The Waterworks application makes it easy for Facebook users to discover the big difference their small donations make. The application makes charitable giving more social, more personal and more relevant. It sends personal notifications to donors, enabling a real connection between an individual Waterworker and the Facebook users who supported her.</p> <p>Since the Waterworks app is 'social by design,' a community of support is expected to form around each Waterworker, as powerful stories have the opportunity to impact and influence friends and millions of friends of friends.</p> <p><em>Copy on this page is provided by Unilever, supporter of the </em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-living\" title=\"\"><em>sustainable living hub</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Leading shares slumped again on increasing worries about economic growth, after a number of poor US corporate updates and further fears about the eurozone.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closed 85 points lower at 5797.91, a 1.44% decline, after 3M, Dupont, UPS and United Technologies all added to recent disappointing figures from Microsoft and Google, sending Wall Street sharply lower by the time London closed.</p> <p>On top of that, Greece appeared no closer to resolving its budget deficit, a necessary step for its next bailout paymant, while Spain was hit by a downgrade of a number of its regions by Moody's. Ishaq Siddiqi at ETX Capital said:</p> <blockquote> The prominent theme emerging from the third quarter earnings so far, particularly for industrials, materials and resource sectors, is that the slowdown in the global economy, notably China, is eating away at the bottom line for major corporates in developed countries. <br> We have Facebook after the US close and again, markets are expecting an underwhelming release given that we still don't know how Facebook will monetize itself \u2013 reassurance by management will be needed to restore any confidence for Facebook, but perhaps markets are comfortable with weak numbers as the optimism around the company has faded sharply since the launch of its overpriced IPO before the summer. </blockquote> <p>One technology company to do well however was <strong>Arm</strong>, the UK chip designer. Its shares climbed 45.5p to 640p after better than expected results. Julian Yates at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The 2012 outlook is in line with consensus but we would see modest upside risk. We see Arm as the stand-out tech play, and maintain our buy rating. </blockquote> <p>The only other gainer in the leading index was <strong>Experian</strong>, the credit information business, up 40p to \u00a310.87 after it paid $1.5bn to take its stake in Brazilian business Serasa from 70% to 99.6%. The move comes five years after the company first bought into Serasa, and will be funded from existing bank loans. Robin Speakman at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> This sum is a degree higher than we had anticipated, we had thought it would be closer to $1.2bn. But we note the continued strong performance of the business throughout the current year and its strong future prospects. The statement from Experian suggests that the transaction will be earnings enhancing for the current year to March 2013 and thereafter. With the rise in importance of data services to the global economy, and strong growth prospects in the developing world, we retain a buy stance on Experian. </blockquote> <p>With investors in a risk-off mood, and commodity prices lower on worries about a slowdown in Chinese growth, mining shares were among the biggest fallers. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 35p lower at 721.5p while <strong>Antofagasta </strong>fell 44p to \u00a312.65.</p> <p>A downturn in China was also blamed for a profit warning from luxury goods group <strong>Mulberry</strong>, down 314p to \u00a310.06. Larger rival <strong>Burberry</strong> was hit by the Mulberry news, losing 38p to \u00a311.34.</p> <p>Lower down the market defence group <strong>Chemring</strong> - which makes flares and explosives - dropped 31.4p to 314.9p after it parted company with its chief executive, in the middle of a bid situation. US private equity group Carlyle has until 9 November to decide whether to make a formal offer, and analysts said a change at the top at Chemring could make a deal less likely. Guy Brown at Oriel Securities was less certain:</p> <blockquote> The move potentially flags that the deal is collapsing. It would appear odd to appoint a new chief executive with the belief the group is going to be taken over within a matter of weeks. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Trinity Mirror</strong> lost more than 10%, down 7.25p at 64.5p after the news that the Daily Mirror publisher was being sued over alleged phone hacking, the first move for damages against a company other than Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Analyst Johnathan Barrett at N+1 Singer said:</p> <blockquote> The shares have been very strong and buoyed by an improved nationals advertising market and the likelihood of greater cost savings in 2013. The shares moved slightly above our target price yesterday although we note that on the expectation of a full 3p dividend or more there is still a small positive upside on a total return basis. The claims will weigh on the shares, in part because many had assumed the subject was fading away as an issue. <br> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere Irish drinks group <strong>C&amp;C</strong> added 1.5% to \u20ac3.82 after buying US cider business Vermont for $305m. The move takes the company into the fast growing US market for ciders, and should help offset weakness in the UK. Sales of C&amp;C's Magners brand fell 17% in the first half following the wet summer, but grew by 16% in the US. Vermont is the maker of Woodchuck, the largest domestic cider brand in the country.</p> <p>C&amp;C also reported a 2% decline in revenues in the six months to the end of August, and a 2.7% fall in operating profits to \u20ac65.6m. Analyst Wayne Brown at Canaccord Genuity issued a sell note, saying the company's core UK business was weakening, and it had paid too much for Vemont:</p> <blockquote> Whilst we appreciate the need to diversify away from the UK and republic of Ireland, the cost of doing this, is too high in our view. Our first glance suggests that not only is 20.8 times EBITDA too high, but the acquired business is going to require an increase in capital expenditure of $30m, and marketing costs are likely to rise from 2% of sales to a more normalised 10% as competition rises in the US. On the basis that the EBITDA contribution should be around $15m, this is offset by $2m-$3m of depreciation and around $8m of interest expense. </blockquote>",

It's disgusting. They've put us through all this, promised they're going to sort out the problem and then at the last minute they give up.\"</p> <p>For once, people on both sides of the debate agreed. Whether they were for the badger cull or opposed to it, they tended to agree the policy had been badly botched. \"I can't believe that at the very last moment they've said it's not going ahead,\" said Wainwright, who farms in the planned cull area in Gloucestershire. \"It's a disgrace.\"</p> <p>Steve Jones, a farm manager in the Forest of Dean and a vocal <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">critic of culling</a>, said he had thought the shooting would at least begin. \"I thought it would be derailed. But I thought the train would at least get out of the station,\" he said. \"This just goes to show how flawed the cull was. Public opinion is against it, science is against it, common sense is against it.\"</p> <p>Jones feels hugely sorry for the farmers who are having to cope with bovine TB but believes they need to do more \u2013 and be helped to do more \u2013 to improve animal husbandry and biosecurity on their farms. \"Dairy farmers have a really big problem. The price of milk is so low that these farms are becoming more and more impoverished. They can't afford to look after the animals in the way they need to be looked after,\" he said.</p> <p>Roger Yeates, a Forest of Dean farmer and Conservative councillor, said the planned cull had been badly handled. \"I didn't think shooting badgers was the way to go \u2013 that would mean killing the healthy ones that were running about; the infected ones tend to stay underground. I'm pleased it's off.\"</p> <p>The Forest of Dean district council had voted to ban badger culling on its land and was calling on all landowners within its boundary to do the same.</p> <p>Jackie Fraser, the Labour councillor who proposed the motion to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/01/badger-activists-prepare-for-cull\" title=\"\">ban culling</a>, gave a tentative welcome to the government's move \"I'm pleased but cautious. I hope the government is going to look seriously at other ways of tackling bovine TB, like vaccinating cattle and improving biosecurity.\"</p> <p>The campaign group <a href=\"http://glosagainstbadgershooting.webs.com/\" title=\"\">Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting</a> expressed delight. Liz Gaffer, a spokeswoman, admitted she had tears in her eyes when she heard. \"We are so, so pleased to hear this news. We hope the government will not just delay but will decide not to pursue a cull as the evidence is clear that culling badgers is not the most effective, efficient or humane way of reducing bovine TB.</p> <p>\"People in Gloucestershire have voiced their concern over the rationale behind it and the safety issues involved. We believe the government may have taken this on board and we will continue to campaign for a vaccination programme of cattle and badgers that we believe will really support farmers who are faced with this awful disease.\"</p> <p>For now, the saboteurs, who had been ready to get out into the cull zones wearing in high-visibility jackets and carrying horns and rape alarms, can stand down.</p> <p>Over the last few months experienced saboteurs have been joined by many newcomers to the animal rights scene, keen to map setts and disrupt the cull.</p> <p>Kayleigh, an activist who took the Guardian out on a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/19/badger-activists-setts-fightback-cull\" title=\"\">sett-mapping expedition</a>, spent the morning handing out leaflets outside a supermarket in Bristol to flag up the fact that it stocked milk from places where badgers were going to be culled.</p> <p>The plan was for a few drinks later to celebrate. \"It's fantastic news; it takes the pressure off us a bit and we can have a bit of a break but we'll continue to survey setts and continue to prepare. We'll also be making sure farmers don't start taking the law into their own hands.\"</p> <p>Jay Tiernan, a leader in the <a href=\"http://badger-killers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stop the Cull organisation</a>, which champions direct action, said he would carry on fighting the cull until the government announced that it had been dropped permanently. \"There are a lot of new people who have come to the movement in the last few months.

The government has been twisting the evidence to fit their policy. We warned for two years that this cull was bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.\"</p> <p>Paterson and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) will have to overcome a series of major problems if the cull is to proceed next year. Scientific and public opinion are strongly against the cull, likely legal challenges remain and the cost and logistics of culling remain difficult.</p> <p>NFU president, Peter Kendall, said: \"For those that have suggested that this cull is irresponsible, I think today's decision shows that this is simply not the case. Postponement is the most responsible thing to do.\"</p> <p>The musician Brian May, whose successful e-petition won the first Commons debate scheduled for this Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/badger-reprieve-abandon-cull\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"This is by no means the end of the line. What we need is a complete abandonment.\" He pledged to work with farmers on a pilot vaccination scheme that \"could come in months, not years.\"</p> <p>Gavin Grant, the RSPCA's chief executive, said: \"Hopefully this marks the beginning of the end for these unscientific, foolish and cruel plans to cull badgers.</p> <p>\"This must not be a temporary reprieve, but must mark an end to all cull plans.\" The RSPB's conservation director, Martin Harper, said: \"Today's announcement suggests that farmers and badgers will be in exactly the same situation next summer.\"</p> <p>The cull delay follows a major U-turn in 2011 by the environment department on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/17/forest-sell-off-abandoned-sorry-caroline-spelman\" title=\"\">the selling off of public forests</a>. It also follows a difficult week for the government with David Cameron being criticised over an apparently bungled announcement on energy bills and the resignation of chief whip Andrew Mitchell.</p> <p>Ministers and farmers have argued that a cull is essential to help stop the spread of TB, while opponents maintain that the main problem is transmission between cattle and warn that a badger cull could result in fleeing badgers spreading the disease more widely. Last year, 26,000 cattle were slaughtered and the disease cost taxpayers \u00a390m, including compensation to farmers.</p> <p>The planned cull had suffered a series of blows recently, including the discovery of up to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">twice as many badgers in the culling zones</a> than expected, driving up the cost and complexity of the cull. Whitehall sources said the department had been in \"panic\" and \"chaos\" over the problems. The cull also faced a legal challenge from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/21/badgers-bovine-tuberculosis\" title=\"\">Badger Trust</a> over costs and public safety around the unmarked cull zones.</p> <p>The government's claim to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">\"science-led\" policy was derided by Lord John Krebs</a>, the architect of a landmark 10-year badger culling trial. He called it \"mindless\" and signed a letter with 31 other eminent scientists demanding the government reconsider its plan. But Paterson said: \"The decision we have taken wholly conforms to the science.\"</p> <p>Opponents argue vaccination and improved biosecurity are better ways of tackling TB. The coalition government cancelled five of its six badger vaccination trials, but work also continues with the Wildlife Trust and the National Trust. A cattle vaccine is in development, but would require changes to EU law to be used. Paterson said: \"Everyone would like to press a button labelled vaccine today, but sadly we don't have one.\"</p> <p>On Friday, ministers announced a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/19/cattle-movement-bovine-tb-testing?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">crackdown on biosecurity</a> measures to take effect from January. But Paterson said such measures could only go so far. \"They [the control measures announced last Friday] are significantly tougher than before but it gets to a point where it is very hard to run the business [ie in terms of cost and moving cattle around].\"</p> <p>A European commission inspection in September 2011 had revealed a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">catalogue of failures on English farms</a>. Mark Jones, a vet at Humane Society International, said: \"Paterson should use the next months to implement genuinely science-led measures including improved testing and compliance, better biosecurity and the development of vaccines for cattle and for badgers. It will be a tragedy if a supposedly protected wild mammal is sacrificed for the sake of political expedience.\"</p> <p>Joe Duckworth, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"At the moment, badgers are on death row for nine months. We need the government to change their policy.\"</p>",
  "<p>When private care group Castlebeck was sold for \u00a3255m in 2006, it was seen as the UK's leading provider of specialist health and rehabilitation services for adults with learning disabilities and complex needs. On 31 May last year a television <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13548222\" title=\"\">expos\u00e9</a> demolished the company's reputation and shredded its value.</p> <p>The BBC's Panorama uncovered a shockingly abusive regime at Winterbourne View, a Castlebeck \"assessment and treatment\" hospital near Bristol. The company was charging an average \u00a33,500 a week for each of up to 24 patients but providing an environment that, in the words of a subsequent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/07/winterbourne-view-abuse-report-failures\" title=\"\">serious case review</a>, \"raised the continuous possibility of harm and degradation\".</p> <p>Eleven former members of staff of Winterbourne View have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/06/winterbourne-view-abuse-staff-guilty?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">convicted</a> of criminal offences of abuse and are being sentenced this week. The unit has been closed, as have two others run by Castlebeck, but Panorama is preparing to broadcast another programme containing further revelations about the scandal, the company and the system that enabled it to boast, as it did in 2006, of its \"five-fold value growth\" in just four years.</p> <p>Restoring Castlebeck's good name may seem like mission impossible, but Sean Sullivan has been giving it his best shot. He is a \"business turnaround\" specialist, brought in last November at the instigation of what he calls the company's stakeholders \u2013 taken to mean not only its owner, <a href=\"https://www.duedil.com/company/LP008676/lydian-capital-partners\" title=\"\">Lydian Capital Partners</a>, an investment club for entrepreneurs including Irish tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus, but also the banks that largely funded the purchase of Castlebeck six years ago.</p> <p>Sullivan, 51, is a no-nonsense character with an earlier career in utility management, whose past assignments have included sorting out the wholesale electricity market in Tbilisi, Georgia, and the water corporation in South Australia. But his family runs care homes and he was responsible for turning <a href=\"http://www.carehomesguide.com/GroupDetails.aspx?gp=96\" title=\"\">Care Principles</a>, another leading UK provider, around, as well as large efficiency projects in the NHS. So he reckons he knows poor care practice when he sees it \u2013 when others may not.</p> <p>So what did he find at Castlebeck when he was initially appointed as the company's chief restructuring officer?</p> <p>\"A lot of half-blind people,\" Sullivan says, referring to managers who weren't seeing what was wrong.</p> <p>In March, having drawn up a detailed action plan, he was made executive chairman and told to go ahead and implement the 51-point plan. Since then, he has swept through the organisation, spending \u00a38m, instituting new practices and clearing out most of the management. He thinks his task is almost complete.</p> <p>\"Since March we have had a full-on, A-to-Z turnaround of all and everything that Castlebeck involves to get it into some sort of shape that is attractive for [care] commissioners, right for patients and has some commercial reality to it,\" he says. \"It's not 100% yet \u2013 you can't change every unit immediately \u2013 but we have turned around now in over 80%, perhaps 90%, of the units. I think we reached that point about three or four weeks ago. It is a repaired business.\"</p> <p>Many will be sceptical of his claims. It is an open secret that Lydian and/or the banks are seeking a buyer for the company and there will be suspicions that the makeover is only skin-deep. But the company is being unusually transparent about the transformation it says it is undertaking, and some influential voices in the care sector are impressed.</p> <p><strong>Support and endorsements</strong></p> <p>\"Can we put our hand on our heart and say they are changing? Yes, we can,\" says Ann Chivers, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.bild.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Institute of Learning Disabilities </a>(Bild). Her organisation is working with Castlebeck to offer support on advocacy and last-resort use of physical restraint, but it remains opposed in principle to the assessment-and-treatment model of care by which people with challenging behaviour are taken out of the community for indeterminate periods. This is still practised at some of the company's remaining 20 units. \"We have a reputation to protect and we had to really think about whether we should get involved,\" Chivers stresses. \"But they are definitely in turnaround mode. There is some very solid and robust stuff going on there.\"</p> <p>Another endorsement comes from Sukhvinder Kaur-Stubbs, a trustee of the <a href=\"http://www.scie.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Care Institute for Excellence</a>, who has joined Castlebeck as a paid independent non-executive director. \"I've been impressed with the approach that has been taken and the speed with which change has been made,\" she says. \"I think there is some learning from it for the care sector as a whole around what good governance should look like.\"</p> <p>Kaur-Stubbs sits on a Castlebeck board that has been revamped radically: Sullivan says that half its members now have a medical or nursing background. These include Debra Moore, brought in as director of nursing and patient safety, who was a learning disability nurse adviser to the Department of Health and joint lead of Valuing People, a programme for learning disability. Lee Reed, who had recently been appointed as the company's chief executive at the time of the Winterbourne View scandal, and who declared himself \"personally ashamed\", remains on the board as group director responsible for the separate mental health business.</p> <p>Moore has taken the main responsibility for quality, audit, clinical risk and compliance across the organisation. But Sullivan sees the unit managers as the key to the success of his action plan \u2013 built on the findings of consultants PwC, called in after the scandal broke \u2013 and he has felt it necessary to take drastic measures. \"Probably 70% [of managers] have exited the business,\" he says euphemistically.</p> <p>\"You have got to have people who used to be a commissioner, or a senior nurse, and who are able to engage with commissioners in that same field. Suddenly they click and they get it.\" He found some familiar faces among the managers he inherited. \"There were individuals that I had let go at other organisations I turned around,\" he says. \"They have moved on again.\"</p> <p>Sullivan is poor management was at the root of Castlebeck's malaise. \"Winterbourne View was a photograph in time,\" he says. He describes the abuse as \"appalling\" but says that culture \"had been allowed to build up over a long period\". He says he has found some \"stars\" among the 1,100 staff, who have been rewarded with promotion, but he has relied heavily on bringing in experienced interim managers (\"I have a little black book\"), about half of whom he expects to stay on permanently.</p> <p>All 20 remaining units in England and Scotland operating under the Castlebeck brand, and with a total capacity of about 350 people, have been refurbished and re-equipped from top to bottom at a cost of \u00a33m. More importantly, though, all users of services are now reassessed regularly, with the involvement of their families and care commissioners, to try to make sure they do not languish in the system. Some, Sullivan admits, ought to be receiving different care elsewhere. Various outside organisations, including Bild, have been contracted to offer support on a range of issues.</p> <p>Occupancy of the units, which dropped sharply after the revelations, has been rising again and, Sullivan says, is exceeding his target of 80% at 12 of the sites. For the first time in 16 months, care professionals are said to be calling unprompted to inquire about job openings, while internal satisfaction ratings by commissioners and families, shared with Society Guardian, show a positive score \u2013 though complaints about standards persist.</p> <p>The unanswered question is whether Castlebeck will wholly abandon the assessment-and-treatment model, as critics demand. Sullivan, who expects to remain at the company for only a few more months, says part of the turnaround involves placing the units on <a href=\"http://www.clinicalgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/section2/pathways.asp\" title=\"\">care pathways</a> so that they play a clear, time-limited role in an individual's progress. He cites Thornfield Grange, formerly what he calls a \"generic learning disability\" facility in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, which has been converted into a rehabilitation unit for people with autism moving on from the company's service near Darlington.</p> <p>However, he believes there is a continuing need for long-stay units for some people who have been in hospital-type settings for most of their lives. \"It's a very difficult area, but we do have people in the UK, perhaps aged 60, who have a 40- year background in these services and may have been heavily medicated for much of that time,\" Sullivan says. \"What is the future for them if we do not provide a safe and supportive home for life?\"</p>",
  "<p>Chris Rogers, the incoming boss of Costa Coffee, has said the chain is yet to see any firm evidence of customers defecting from its chief rival, Starbucks, in the wake of damaging tax avoidance allegations.</p> <p>Last week it emerged that years of aggressive tax engineering had left the US group paying minimal tax in the UK for 14 years.</p> <p>Rogers, who next month shifts from his current role as finance director of Costa's parent group, Whitbread, suggested the furore had, if anything, been bad for all corporations with well-known brands. \"If I was to be honest with you all this noise around Starbucks probably isn't good for big-branded businesses full stop.\"</p> <p>Asked about repeated calls from tax campaigners and politicians for a Starbucks boycott, Rogers said there was no evidence yet of a significant shift. \"Some days are up some days are down.

We make losses overseas. We're not in a position where we're thinking cleverly about doing things like that. The brand isn't held in Switzerland or anything like that.\"</p> <p>Whitbread reported a 10.6% rise in underlying pretax profit for the six months to 30 August, to \u00a3193.4mTurnover was up 14.2% to \u00a31.02bn.</p> <p>The group benefited from the \u00a313.5m unwinding of part of a series of provisions relating to disposals made as long ago as 2004. Underlying profit at Costa was up 29.9% to \u00a336.1m.</p> <p>Rogers said he expected the group's general trading environment, already described as \"tough\", to deteriorate slightly. However, he reiterated his view that strong, well-invested brands such as Costa and the group's hotel brand, Premier Inn, were likely to outperform competition should conditions worsen.</p>",
  "<p>Palador, in collaboration with SAP, Samsung Mobile and the Guardian Media Network have released the first in a 12-month series of video shorts that will follow the experiences of one leading mobile executive, Benjamin Robbins, as he attempts to work for an entire year using only his smartphone and a range of native and web-based applications.</p> <p>The video shorts \u2013 which will see Mr. Robbins undertake a range of tasks in a mobile-only fashion, from the mundane and everyday to the exotic and bizarre - are written, filmed, edited, and published exclusively using a smartphone device. The first short, entitled Mobile Only \u2013 Lost and Found, chronicles the adventures of an executive who's lost his pink rhinestone phone in a Chicago cab and needs to get it back, quick.</p> <p>In future shorts Mr. Robbins will jet all over the world to film the vignettes on location, and will include him running for 8 hours without stopping on a treadmill whilst conducting a \"normal working day\" at a business conference. The series will also see Mr. Robbins creating a presentation while underwater, running a marathon while communicating with the office, and spending a day and night working remotely from the wilderness \u2013 always using only his smartphone.</p> <p>Mr. Robbins is one of the top 50 Twitter Mobile Influencers, and writes one of BizTech's Top 50 Must Read IT Blogs. He speaks regularly on the subject of Enterprise Mobility and blogs weekly on remotelyMOBILE, the Enterprise Mobility Forum, and The Guardian Media Network.</p> <p>The shorts will be distributed via the Guardian Media Network, an online community for media, tech and mobile professionals, and will feature a range of SAP mobile applications used on Samsung Mobile devices. The series is scheduled to run one short a month for the next year. These shorts will be supplemental to the already popular Mobile Only blog series which will be syndicated on the Guardian Media Network.</p> <p>Commenting on the project, the Guardian Media Network's editor Robin Hough said: \"We're delighted to be working with Palador, SAP and Samsung Mobile to promote growth and uptake in mobile-only working. Working via mobile devices is one of the fastest moving areas in digital right now and it's only fitting that we should be creating an innovative content-led project to reflect this exciting new frontier.\"</p> <p>Mr. Robbins, a principal at Palador, the mobile consultancy added: \"Why wouldn't you want to work mobile-only?

  "<p>Eurotunnel says a post-Olympics effect should see revenues continue to increase in 2013 after summer trading rose 16% on the previous year.</p> <p>The shuttle service in the Channel tunnel saw 10% more passenger traffic and 17% more trucks from July to September 2012 than a year earlier.</p> <p>Despite a slight drop in passengers using Eurostar train services, overall revenues increased 13% to \u20ac274m (\u00a3223m).</p> <p>Groupe Eurotunnel's chairman and chief executive, Jacques Gounon, said: \"This summer, on the back of a dynamic first half-year, Eurotunnel again set new traffic records.

The group now accounts for 43% of the total cross-channel market of tunnel and ferry services.</p> <p>Gounon said: \"The strong figures aren't just the direct deliveries and visitors but the indirect effect the Olympics had in generating interest in London.

In a comment article, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/badger-cull-policy-bovine-tb\">Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, says Paterson should abandon the policy for good.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Michael Gove has accused Ed Miliband of being a \"small-c conservative\" because of his resistance to modernisation.</strong> In a speech, Gove said that Miliband's \"one nation Labour\" speech illustrated not a move to the centre but an \"explicit disavowal\" of the centrism practised under Tony Blair's leadership. Gove also said that the \"blue Labour\" philosophy favoured by Miliband was \"anti-globalisation, explicitly anti-liberal and proudly protective of the past\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Blue Labour thinking - Ed Miliband's thinking - is not then a continuation or refashioning of Blairism, it is a critique and rejection of Blairism.</p> <p>It's an attempt to repudiate the period in the party's recent past when wealth creation was welcomed, when spin doctors argued education reform would mean a move away from the bog-standard comprehensive, when the director's box at the Emirates was preferred to the Durham Miners' Gala.</p> <p>That is why it is a fundamental mistake ... to see Ed Miliband's One Nation speech as a move to the centre.</p> <p>It was an explicit disavowal of the centrism practised under Tony Blair and a celebration of an older, more solidaristic socialism of the kind which would have found favour with Tony Crosland or even Tony Benn.</p> <p>Where Tony Blair used his speeches to identify the forces of conservatism and declare war on them, Ed Miliband has used his speech to celebrate the forces of conservatism and declare he wants to become their leader.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Gove has said that he is writing to MPs in areas of \"concentrated educational under-performance\" to encourage them to support his bid for more primaries to become academies.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want the MPs in those cities to work with me to persuade their local authorities and their local communities that we need rapidly to improve their schools. They have a simple choice: stand with those in the academies and free schools movement who want to put children first; or stand with the adults who are blocking school improvement.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/oct/23/suspects-remanded-shortage-court-interpreters\">MPs have been told that suspects are being needlessly remanded in custody and denied a fair trial because of a severe shortage of qualified court interpreters</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20040340\"> The European parliament has voted for a 6.8% increase in the EU's budget</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/23/london-2012-olympics-paralympics-cost\"> Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, has published figures showing that the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games came in \u00a3377m under budget</a>.</strong> The overall cost of the Games is now forecast to be \u00a38.921bn from a budget of \u00a39.298bn.</p> <p>That's all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:25:46.012Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086a68958f96784ee2909e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T14:25:06.348Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's an afternoon reading list.</p> <p><a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/10/by-paul-goodman-leave-the-row-about-the-eu-budget-and-swoop-on-a-sentence-in-a-speech-that-william-hague-will-give-in-berlin.html\">\u2022 Paul Goodman at ConservativeHome says it is now possible to imagine David Cameron supporting Britain leaving the EU.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What will the Prime Minister do [if other EU member states refuse a renegotiation]? After all, he is adamant that he wants Britain to remain within the E.U. There are two possibilities. The first is that he sticks to his view. The second is that he shrugs his shoulders and recommends that Britain pull out. Extraordinary as it may seem, the latter course is now possible. I am not sure that the significance of the Gove intervention - the Education Secretary's admission that he would vote to pull out of the EU were there an In-Out referendum today - has been fully grasped. It marked the moment when a view held by roughly half of party activists and a significant percentage of Tory MPs was backed without reproof at Cabinet level - and by the Government's most successful senior Minister at that, and one who may yet be, for all his protestations to the contrary, a future party leader.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://nottspolitics.org/2012/10/22/do-government-chief-whips-have-an-afterlife-2/\">\u2022 David Butler at Ballots and Bullets writes about what happens to chief whips after they move.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Few ex-Chief Whips however became very important on the political stage.

We have all worked tirelessly to prepare for the delivery of this government policy to see us finally get on top of this terrible disease.</p> <p>But there have been a series of obstacles, not least the appalling weather, delays because of the Olympics and Paralympics, and the legal challenges from those against the policy. And let\u2019s be clear, the numbers from the badger population survey last week, which demonstrated just how large the badger numbers are, have left us with a huge challenge to ensure we achieve the targets needed for disease control.</p> <p>We have always said that this has to be a science-led policy to reduce disease and we have to be confident of achieving the numbers needed for disease reduction. As we rapidly approach winter the odds of achieving that number decrease. This is why, reluctantly, we have taken the decision, with the companies involved, to delay until late spring next year.</p> <p>For those that have suggested that this cull is irresponsible, I think today\u2019s decision shows that this is simply not the case. Postponement is the most responsible thing to do. We have said all along that this has never been about killing badgers; this has always been about eradicating disease. It has been about the battle to get on top of the TB on our farms that strikes at the very heart of our beef and dairy herds.</p> <p>This has been a very tough year for farmers, which has lent its own set of challenges. In preparing to deliver on this government\u2019s TB eradication policy we have met with delay after delay; challenge after challenge. But I am proud of the way that farmers have worked together and shown great resilience in the face of not inconsiderable opposition - and for that I want to thank them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T13:35:02.519Z\">at 2.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086955ac0e343ef1abc7f4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T13:02:19.008Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The statement is now over.</p> <p>So much for one nation.

It used to be isolated. But it has spread extensively through the west of England and Wales. Cases are doubling every nine years. Last year some 26,000 cattle were slaughtered at a cost of \u00a3100m. Over the next 10 years it could cost \u00a3500m, he says.</p> <p>Last week the government announced plans for a new testing regime.</p> <p>Cattle and badgers can transmit the disease to each other. Culling badgers can cut transmission to cattle if it is carried out over a large enough area and for a significant length of time.</p> <p>That is why the government thinks culling badgers can make a significant contribution.</p> <p>The NFU has taken the lead in preparing the pilot culls.</p> <p>Paterson says he has been \"immensely impressed\" by the work done by the NFU. And he thanks the police for their help.</p> <p>The severe bad weather this summer has caused problems.</p> <p>Legal problems, and the police request for the cull to start after the Olympics, mean the government has missed the best time to start the cull.</p> <p>New figures also show that there are more badgers in the pilot area than thought.</p> <p>For a cull to be successful, 70% of badgers have to be culled.</p> <p>Farmers now say they cannot be confident of culling 70% of the badgers, partly because of the higher numbers and the delays.</p> <p>The companies due to carry out the culls have written to Paterson asking him to delay the culls until next summer.</p> <p>Paterson says he has placed a copy of the letter in the library of the Commons.</p> <p>Starting next summer will ensure that the culls can conform to the scientific criteria and the evidence base.</p> <p>This will be disappointing, Paterson says. But he fully supports the decision of the NFU.</p> <p>The government is still committed to the policy. But it wants to work with the NFU to get the policy right.</p> <p>It wants to have a TB-free England.</p> <p>Vaccination would be another option. But it will be some years before a viable cattle vaccine is available, he says.</p> <p>Paterson says he is utterly convinced that culling is the right thing do to.</p> <p>He wants the culls to be delivered safely next summer.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T11:50:07.906Z\">at 12.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50867f9bc0e343ef1abc7f21\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T11:29:32.057Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Adam Vaughan has been speaking to <strong>Brian May</strong>, who has been one of the leaders of the anti-culling campaign.

The suggestion you\u2019re making is absurd.\u201d Posed the inevitable question last weekend, Theresa May answered: \u201cWe have a first-class leader at the moment [my italics]. David Cameron is dealing with the issues that he was left by the last government very well indeed.\u201d This fell short by some distance of the grandiloquent encomium required.</p> <p>There can be no doubt about it. The Home Secretary is, as Tory MPs would put it, \u201con manoeuvres\u201d \u2013 discreet ones, to be sure, but unmistakable for all that ...</p> <p>It is not as though Mr Cameron has an obvious successor. The three front-runners to succeed him are Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and George Osborne. The first claims not to want to do so. The second lacks the means (since he isn\u2019t an MP and will still be Mayor of London if he becomes one after the next election). And the third will lack the capacity if the Conservatives fail to win a majority next time round: he will go down with Mr Cameron, his friend, in such an event \u2013 one still more likely than not, given the collapse of the boundary review.

He arrived just as the door was closing, forced his way through and voted.

The way in Britain Lisbon was ratified without any consultation of the voters has played a part in that. People feel that the EU is a one way process, a great machine that sucks up decision-making from national parliaments to the European level until everything is decided by the EU. That needs to change. If we cannot show that decision-making can flow back to national parliaments then the system will become democratically unsustainable. Subsidiarity must really mean something.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that \"public disillusionment with the EU in Britain is the deepest it has ever been\".</strong> (Actually, I'm not sure that's true. <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2435&amp;view=wide\">The proportion of British people wanting to leave the EU, or the Common Market as it then was, was much higher in the early 1980s than it is now.)</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that in future some countries should be allowed to integrate more with the EU than others.</strong> Resurrecting a phrase from the John Major era, he said there should be \"variable geometry\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Eurozone countries must do what they must to resolve the crisis, but the way forward for the EU as a whole is not more centralisation and uniformity but of flexibility and variable geometry, that allows differing degrees of integration in different areas, done in ways that do not disadvantage those that do not wish to participate in everything, and preserves the things we all value.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T11:31:45.413Z\">at 12.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508655c458f96784ee290959\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T08:31:00.509Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are four polls around today - three state-of-the-parties ones, and one from the Corby byelection.

  "<p>The future of nuclear power in the UK is hanging in the balance, the chief executive of the company charged with building new reactors has said.</p> <p>Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, told MPs at <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=11579\" title=\"\">a select committee hearing</a> on Tuesday that he had still not made up his mind whether to go ahead with a construction programme that would see the first new nuclear power stations in the UK for decades.</p> <p>He said the company was waiting for further reassurances from the government on what assistance the company will receive. This includes assurances on the disposal of waste and the decommissioning of plants at the end of their life, and a regulatory regime that should favour nuclear power through the provision of long-term <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">\"contracts for difference\"</a> that will penalise fossil fuels in favour of low-carbon forms of energy.</p> <p>\"We are on the brink of delivering an infrastructure project similar in scale to the London Olympics. We are poised to deliver immense benefits in terms of jobs, skills and economic growth \u2013 locally and nationally,\" said de Rivaz, appearing before the parliamentary select committee on energy and climate change. \"But like all investors in capital intensive infrastructure projects we need to have a compelling business case. In this respect our final investment decision requires more progress to be made.\"</p> <p>This new regulatory system, known as <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/markets/electricity/electricity.aspx\" title=\"\">electricity market reform (EMR)</a>, has been criticised by renewable power companies as unwieldy and overly complex. They fear it will favour big companies and squeeze smaller players out of the market.</p> <p>The French state company EDF is the government's best hope of having new nuclear power stations built in the UK, because two German utilities \u2013 RWE and E.ON \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy\" title=\"\">pulled out of plans to build new nuclear power stations earlier this year</a>. Their consortium, called Horizon, was put up for sale but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/03/new-uk-nuclear-power-station-setback\" title=\"\">failed to garner the expected interest</a>.</p> <p>Companies are understood to be concerned that new plants will face protests and will be expensive to build and run, while the electricity regulatory regime has been subject to drastic changes from successive governments in recent years, generating uncertainty and raising the risks to investors.</p> <p>EDF owns and operates eight of the UK's 10 existing nuclear power stations, and any new reactors are likely to be built on or next to existing sites. If de Rivaz does decide to go ahead, the first new plant to be built will be at Hinkley Point in Somerset.</p> <p>Another prospective nuclear consortium, NuGen \u2013 owned by Iberdrola of Spain and GDF Suez, another French company \u2013 is considering new reactors in Cumbria, but is unlikely to make a final decision soon, having said it could wait until 2015 before proceeding. A further setback to the proposed \"nuclear renaissance\" in the UK came this month, when three councils in Cumbria <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/03/three-month-delay-nuclear-waste-burial-cumbria\" title=\"\">delayed a decision</a> on whether to allow new nuclear waste sites to go ahead.</p> <p>But a Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) spokeswoman said: \"There is strong interest in UK nuclear from a number of potential investors. We are confident that UK's stable policy environment and the measures in the energy bill to be published next month, will provide the detail and certainty that investors need.</p> <p>\"We are in the midst of a commercial negotiation with EDF so it is not appropriate for us to comment on the details of it. In our discussions with new nuclear investors, our focus will be on delivering a fair deal for consumers, which is affordable, provides clear value for money, and is consistent with the coalition agreement's commitment to no public subsidy for new nuclear power. And we will be transparent around any agreement reached\".</p> <p>EDF's main concern is to make sure that the \"contracts for difference\" under EMR are arranged in such a way as to benefit nuclear power generation. Rival utilities and opponents of nuclear power have argued that these contracts will be effectively a form of subsidy to the nuclear industry, a charge the government has denied. In the European parliament, the Green grouping of MEPs is challenging EMR as a form of state aid.</p> <p>De Rivaz told MPs a decision would be made within months: \"We have workers in high-visibility jackets, standing ready to go to work on our site. The responsibility now is on the government and us to deliver the [contracts for difference] and transitional arrangements, the framework to make it possible for our project to move to the next stage around the end of the year.\"</p>",
  "<p>When we shared the most detailed and comprehensive data on UK online news we showed clearly that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/07/gender-media-best-data-available\">women play a small role</a> in speaking to the nation. In a year, the Daily Mail, Telegraph, and Guardian recorded less than 30% of articles written by women.</p> <p>In this post we are going to dig deeper into some of the trends in supply and demand. Are newspapers simply giving us what we want when they publish more male voices? </p> <p>While UK newspapers publish much more content by men, audiences share content by women in different proportions. In our <a href=\"http://natematias.com/medialab/uknews-gender/\">interactive ranking</a> we compare how women's writing was published and shared across a year of the Guardian, Telegraph, and Daily Mail.</p> <p>Our data shows surprising differences between newspapers. Readers of the Guardian and Daily Mail tend to share a greater percentage of women's writing than the proportion of what the newspapers publish. Guardian opinion articles by women are 35% of what gets shared, compared to 30% of what is published. Only 21% of the Daily Mail's opinion articles are by women but those women generated 35% of the opinion section's shares and likes. <br>Telegraph readers don't share articles by women as much as the other two papers. While women write 20% of its opinion articles, their articles are only 13% of what Telegraph readers choose to share.</p> <h2><strong>The decline of the front page?</strong></h2> <p>Gender data on what newspapers publish can't tell us who gets heard. Last week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/15/women-newspapers-front-pages\">report on sexism in UK front pages</a> offers data on what readers are most likely to see on newsstands. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/janemartinson\">Jane Martinson</a> offers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/oct/15/shocking-dearth-of-women-in-journalism\">an insightful analysis</a> on the Guardian Women's blog. The <a href=\"http://womeninjournalism.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Seen_but_not_heard.pdf\">Women in Journalism report</a> acknowledges that front pages are shrinking in importance. Yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> estimated that <a href=\"http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2012/10/british-newspapers-five-years.php%22\">UK print circulation has shrunk</a> by 27.4% over the last five years.</p> <p>Online, who gets heard is determined by an ecosystem of actors: individuals sharing on Facebook and Twitter, <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/187078/a-journalists-quick-guide-to-reddit-the-next-thing-you-have-to-learn/\">link-sharing communities</a>, <a href=\"http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/automatic-personalization-and.html\">personal algorithms</a> on Google News, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/04/andy-carvin-tweets-revolutions\">citizen media curators</a>. Newspapers only offer part of the information supply; we readers decide who's heard every time we click, share or use our own voice.</p> <h2><strong>A year of UK news social network data</strong></h2> <p>To find out how articles by women are shared on social media, we downloaded an entire year of the Guardian, Daily Mail, and Telegraph. Our collection ranges from July 2011 through June 2012, a total of 261,190 articles. </p> <p>Common sections across newspapers are bundled into similar groups. We used <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/anna-powell-smith\">Anna Powell-Smith</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/apr/25/baby-names-data\">baby name database</a> to assign a gender to most articles. During the first week of August, we used Knight-Mozilla fellow Cole Gillespie's <a href=\"http://www.mozillaopennews.org/code.html\">amo project</a> to download the likes, shares, and links for every article.</p> <p>In our interactive UK news gender ranking, you can sort newspaper sections by the number and percentage of women writing, compared with the performance of women's writing on social media. You can also view a gender time series for each newspaper section throughout the year's news. Of course, the reach of an article is much more complicated than likes and shares. What gets seen is often <a href=\"http://giladlotan.com/blog/pdf12-keynote-networked-power-what-we-learn-from-data/\">dependent on the time of day</a> and the influence of who shares a link. </p> <p>The definition of likes and shares also changes. Since our measurements in early August, Facebook's counters have been changed to track<a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2012/10/04/facebook-confirms-it-is-scanning-your-private-messages-for-links-so-it-can-increase-like-counters/\"> links sent within private messages</a>. This year, newsrooms experimented with <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/173100/why-facebook-frictionless-sharing-apps-are-suffering-and-what-it-means/\">Facebook social readers</a> and <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/2012/08/10/guardian-sees-2-1-percent-of-ipad-readers-pay/\">tablet apps</a> to grow their audiences. Bernhard Rieder's <a href=\"http://thepoliticsofsystems.net/2012/10/the-guardians-facebook-page-as-a-network/\">network diagram of the Guardian's Facebook page</a> illustrates yet another social channel for news. Publishers sometimes can't agree on <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbuchanan/theres-less-dark-social-than-meets-the-eye\">what their own data means</a>.</p> <p>Despite these limitations, data on likes and shares offer the best outside picture of audience interest in women's writing in the news.

  "<p>\"What do you want to be when you grow up\"? That is probably the most common question I was asked in my childhood from any family member, friends of family and adults in general. I enjoyed answering that question. The possibilities were endless. But I also wondered why adults liked asking that question. Did they like keeping up with our fleeting, crazy answers, or did they need to reminisce on 'what could have been' for themselves?</p> <p>As I went through the next 19 years of conscious adult life, I understood that it was the latter. Something (call it the education system, parents or the economy) during our 'educated years' has 'uneducated' us from our sense of selves. It promoted conformity instead \u2013 often towards prescribed paths to making a living, not designing a life.</p> <p>While a certain level of conformity is needed for national progress, the danger of blind and excessive conformity is one of unfulfilled lives. Six years ago, as a rebellious young adult, I left Singapore because of this. Singapore is a city nation whose wealth and modernity have been attained in an impressive four decades (it is predicted to be the wealthiest nation in the world by 2050). Some would argue that it funded its speedy national progress through a general loss of individualism. I would argue that it is an innovative nation trying to find a balance of both.</p> <p>Ever since then, I have been obsessed with cracking the conundrum of what it takes to enable individual honesty in its highest form \u2013 to oneself; and the ecosystem factors needed to enable that to flourish in not only a permissible way, but a celebrated way. While the self part mostly revolves around self-introspection, the ecosystem part is much more complicated. Self-emergence, I found is highly dependable on the outer surrounding: family, school, neighbourhood, city and country.</p> <p>During my MBA year as a Skoll Scholar at the <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Said Business School</a> in Oxford, I had the opportunity to mainstream the field of social entrepreneurship. Working closely with Pamela Hartigan at the <a href=\"http://www.skollfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship</a>, I realised that an environment that allows people to come alive includes a concentration of intellectual content, stimulating conversations, role models, permission to experiment, tolerance for different personalities and ideologies, and a community of like-minded people.</p> <p>This was further heightened when I came across <a href=\"http://bayarea.the-hub.net/\" title=\"\">The HUB in San Francisco</a>. It was then a 10,000 sq ft space in the old San Francisco Chronicle building. In that space were about a hundred entrepreneurs and non-profit leaders, impact investors and ecosystem builders, co-working on their own ideas, building ventures that have positive impact on the world. Some were chatting animatedly, others were attending start-up workshops. At one corner, an investor was being pitched to, and at another, a team was having a conference call with Ghana. Collectively, it was a kind of energy that could make anyone believe that anything is possible, and that it is fine to live by your passion and do some good for the world, even at a young age. I soon found out that The HUB is a global network of community, co-work space and events platform for individuals and teams who are using entrepreneurial approaches for sustainable impact. It existed in 30 cities, but there was none in Asia. Shocking.</p> <p>After 400 coffee chats and eight months of endless hours of space-finding, fund-raising and community-building, Asia's first HUB was founded in May 2012, in Singapore. I picked Singapore because of its hunger to be innovative and more so, to be a hub for social innovation. Also, if done well in Singapore, the region will follow. More personally, I wanted to address the pain point I felt in Singapore six years before.</p> <p>The doors of The HUB Singapore have been opened for five months to a throng of what we call 'purpose-driven individuals'. They range from technicians to social entrepreneurs, film makers to bankers, Googlers to Linked-Iners. It is not a space for any one discipline, but for any discipline. The 'intention' becomes the main filtering question to be a Hubber \u2013 not status, educational qualifications, wealth or profession. The 5,400 sq ft space in the middle of Orchard, Singapore's main lifestyle and entertainment street, has quickly become the home for the outliers. At 200-membered strong, companies, foundations and government agencies are starting to come to The HUB for entrepreneurial ideas, to meet with 'Hubbers' and to have a casual chat over Chris' coffee. The best part is that we are working with the government (National Youth Council) and this is how potential large scale change can happen.</p> <p>The vision is for the community to grow to 1,000 members in two years. That is 0.0002% of the five million strong population. A drop in the ocean, perhaps, but most movements, ecosystems and innovations start with a small group of individuals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://singapore.the-hub.net/\" title=\"\">The HUB Singapore</a> seeks to be that micro-ecosystem where individuals can pursue their passions and be celebrated for it. On a national level, it is that incubator of new thinking models, unconventional career paths, novel solutions and big ideas, a safe place for both failures and successes. It is where new options are experimented daily because the common curse of conformity is the assumption that choices are finite to the availability of existing choices, when the advancement of progress and humanity relies on choices that have not yet been imagined.</p> <p><em>Grace Sai is the co-founder of </em><a href=\"http://singapore.the-hub.net/\" title=\"\"><em>The Hub Singapore</em></a><em>, a community and space for purpose-driven individuals, and the founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.booksforhopeworld.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Books for Hope</em></a><em>, a social enterprise in the field of childrens' education.

  "<p>\u2022 First of all, an apology for some gremlins which have been disrupting Guardian Weekly email addresses since the weekend \u2013 we are trying to eradicate them as quickly as possible. If you have emailed us and your message has bounced back, please try resending it to us again.</p> <p>The US presidential debates are over and, with less than two weeks before the election on 6 November, it's time for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to hit the hustings in earnest. While Obama continues to enjoy great popularity around much of the world, at home the candidates are neck and neck in a race that looks set to go right to the wire.</p> <p>Doubtless if the election were opened up globally it would be settled quickly. But, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/garyyounge\" title=\"\">Gary Younge </a>writes in our cover story, would all that international faith in President Obama be justified? As Younge points out, Monday's final debate laid bare how little variation exists between Republican and Democratic foreign policy. When all is said and done, the outcome may not alter the world beyond the US as much as many people imagine.</p> <p>Inside the paper, as ever, we bring you the sharpest news and insights from around the world. In Europe a new report highlights the social and political danger of a \"lost generation\" of 16- to 25-year-olds not in education, employment or training (often referred to as \"Neets\"), even claiming this disenfranchised youth movement could soon incite the continent's own Arab spring.</p> <p>Life in the Arab spring nations themselves shows depressingly little sign of settling down. A year after the death of Muammar Gaddafi, Guardian correspondent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chris-stephen\" title=\"\">Chris Stephen</a> finds Libya still gripped by chaos and disenchantment. In Lebanon, meanwhile, the assassination of a security general has pushed sectarian tensions to the very brink.</p> <p>More encouraging news from Somalia, though, where civil war has raged for 20 years but where Mogadishu's football stadium is once again being used for playing football, and not as an army base.</p> <p>On the western side of Africa, Nigeria's authorities have embraced the Afrobeat pioneer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti\" title=\"\">Fela Kuti</a> \u2013 one of the country's most anti-establishment figures \u2013 by funding the conversion of the late musician's old house into a museum.</p> <p>Many outsiders look at the growing discord between Japan and its neighbours and wonder why the country still provokes such hostility in east Asia. The harrowing stories of those like South Korea's \"comfort women\", forcibly conscripted into Japanese army brothels during the second world war, go some way to providing an answer. Seventy years on, reports <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/justinmccurry\" title=\"\">Justin McCurry</a>, the surviving women are still campaigning for formal acknowledgement of their plight from the Japanese government.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Richard Leiby from our partner publication The Washington Post was among a small group of reporters given a military escort to the Swat valley school attended by Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl who was shot in the head by the Taliban earlier this month. While Pakistan's authorities were keen to convey a sense of calm, the students Leiby spoke to were less convinced.</p> <p>From the UK, the Observer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm\" title=\"\">Toby Helm </a>reports on a week of resignations and policy reversals for the Conservatives, while we also reveal how several big multinational firms manage to avoid paying much tax in Britain.</p> <p>In Review we have a report on where the next global killer pandemic might emerge from (clue: think twice before exploring remote African caves filled with bats). In Culture, London's V&amp;A opens an absolutely fabulous exhibition of iconic cinema costumes. In Books, the BBC's business editor <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/correspondents/robertpeston/\" title=\"\">Robert Peston</a>, who was one of the first to foresee the credit crunch, has a new book detailing how it all went wrong (but which is less specific on how to put it all right again).</p> <p>It all adds up to another Guardian Weekly full of diverse news and viewpoints.

  "<h2>Sophia Oliver, director, Open Government Partnership, and Transparency, Cabinet Office</h2> <p><strong>Share and adapt data:</strong> we have a responsibility to put the data out so that others can use it, adapt it, combine it with other information and share it and, hopefully, provide feedback on it. Part of the transparency agenda has to be about asking: are we holding the right data? Are we publishing the right data? If we don't hold it, should we collect it and publish it?</p> <p><strong>The Independent Reporting Mechanism isn't exactly voluntary:</strong> countries don't have a choice about being reviewed by the mechanism. And the mechanism will draw on views across government, civil society and independent researchers to develop assessments. So we certainly intend for the IRM to have teeth.</p> <p><strong>Government does not necessarily have the best understanding: </strong>of how to make an effective app, or develop a useful visualisation of the data and others might be better at that. CSOs, businesses or other organisations may have a better understanding of who needs or wants to access what data and how to help them use it \u2013 and can develop products and services to meet those requirements. We definitely have a responsibility to put the data out so that others can use it, adapt it, combine it with other information, share it \u2013 and hopefully provide feedback on it. But we still need to think more about where government role lies in enhancing participation \u2013 sometimes it will be best done by government but sometimes it won't be \u2013 and in those cases we don't want to crowd out others that can do it better.</p> <h2>Marija Novkovic, project manager, United Nations Development Programme, Montenegro</h2> <p><strong>Raw data must be relevant data:</strong> as citizens are now being given access to raw data sets on many facets of public sector performance. But do citizens care about [spread]sheets? Probably not. Do they wish to know which hospital has the biggest survival rate in complex surgical procedures, [or] which bus routes are more reliable than others? Probably yes. Data should be used to tell stories; ideally it would be interpreted by \"infomediaries\" so that the citizens can relate to it. [But] does open data empower the already empowered? Do marginalised, vulnerable groups have access to the internet? Are they aware of open data portals? Will they help them access healthcare, join the labour -market, access social welfare?</p> <p><strong>The basic premise of the OGP is empowering the citizens:</strong> and that was the intent behind the design of the consultation process. Citizens understand the problems in their communities best, but they need to be given an avenue to voice their concerns, and governments should listen. As the McKinsey centre on government recently pointed out, \"the strongest governments will be those that serve the people.\" Citizens are best placed to identify the problems, but also to come up with solutions. Co-production of services would be the next big thing, the new form of outsourcing. Governments should not miss out on the opportunity to tap into the wisdom of the crowd.</p> <h2>Heather Savory, chair, Open Data User Group (ODUG)</h2> <p><strong>Community engagement:</strong> the ODUG has been set up to represent the views of the open data community to government. The way ODUG is engaging is to open the door wide for members of the community to come forward with their thoughts on how we can best serve their data needs. [It] already has about 50 new requests.

  "<h2>Israel and the Palestinians</h2> <p>For decades a focal point of US foreign policy, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a notable absence in Monday's presidential debate.</p> <p>The only mention came when Mitt Romney was listing Barack Obama's supposed lack of progress in his first term: \"Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?\" the Republican candidate asked. \"No. They haven't had talks in two years.\"</p> <p>The lack of discussion reflects an agenda that is changing, partly as a result of upheaval elsewhere in the region and partly as a result of conscious efforts by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to talk down the local conflict and talk up the threat from the Iranian nuclear programme. But it will deepen the disillusionment of many Palestinians with the commitment of the US to resolve the conflict, and perhaps increase their resolve to pursue alternative strategies, such as the bid for enhanced status at the United Nations.</p> <p><strong>Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>The candidates restated long-held positions. Asked by the moderator, Bob Schieffer, whether an attack by Iran on Israel would be considered an attack on the US, both said they would stand by Israel. (The more pertinent question \u2013 what would be your response if Israel unilaterally launched an attack? \u2013 came later, and got no answer.)</p> <p>Obama highlighted the difference between his position and Romney's: \"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign he has often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake.\"</p> <p>Romney spoke of the need to tighten sanctions and take further steps to isolate the Iranian regime diplomatically. \"Of course, military action is a last resort,\" he said. \"It is something one would only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent.\"</p> <p>In a cutting riposte, Obama said: \"There have been times, governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you would do the some things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference.\"</p> <p>Volume, tone and perception count, of course. But on substance there may be little to choose between the two candidates.</p> <p><strong>Harriet Sherwood</strong></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>Romney <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/mitt-romney-china-currency-manipulator\" title=\"\">renewed his pledge to label China a currency manipulator \"on day one\"</a>, arguing that the US was losing a silent trade war with the world's second-largest economy.</p> <p>Overall, the Republican candidate took a milder stance towards Beijing, telling viewers on Tuesday night: \"We can be a partner with China; we don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.\"</p> <p>But asked if he was formally accusing China of manipulating the yuan, and sparking a trade war, he replied: \"There's one going on right now, which we don't know about it. It's a silent one, and they're winning.\"</p> <p>\"We have to say to our friend in China \u2026 you can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, [and] counterfeiting our products [and] selling them around the world, even to the United States.\"</p> <p>The US has not labelled China a currency manipulator since 1994, though successive administrations have considered doing so. Some observers doubt whether Romney would actually follow through on his claims.</p> <p><strong>Tania Branigan in Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>As expected, the 49 countries of sub-Saharan Africa hardly registered in the final US presidential debate.</p> <p>\"Africa\" came up only once, when Barack Obama said: \"Our alliances have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.\"</p> <p>The sole reference to South Africa was to the era of white-minority rule, two decades ago. It came when Mitt Romney said, of Iran: \"I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah[s] they are around the world, the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.\"</p> <p>There was also a brief mention of Somalia, when Obama remarked: \"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.\" The US has carried out drone strikes, and provided equipment and training to the African Union peacekeeping force that drove al-Qaida-linked militants out of their strongholds in Somalia.</p> <p>At one point Romney noted: \"Mali has been taken over \u2013 the northern part of Mali \u2013 by al-Qaida-type individuals.\"</p> <p>But after four years in which a president whose father was Kenyan raised hopes but failed to set Africa alight, the slim pickings came as little surprise on a continent accustomed to being far down the global agenda.</p> <p>Daniel Silke, a political analyst based in Cape Town, South Africa, tweeted: \"#Africa barely exists in final #Obama #Romney Presidential debate last night.\"</p> <p>Another tweeter, named Bevan, posted: \"Africa only mentioned twice in whole debate (Obama/Romney),hope fellow Africans took note. Only Africans can n will develop Africa for all.\"</p> <p>Jacques Sibomana, an entrepreneur, tweeted: \"And Africa yet became a forgotten Continent during the debate #Romney and #Obama.\"</p> <p>Last week, two analysts, Witney Schneidman and Andrew Westbury, <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201210191196.html\" title=\"\">issued a plea</a> for Schieffer to ask the candidates about Africa. They wrote: \"We urge you to use your privilege as moderator to direct the country's attention to a part of the world that has never been more important, but seemingly never so neglected as it concerns American foreign policy priorities: sub-Saharan Africa.\" It appears Schieffer failed to heed them.</p> <p><strong>David Smith in Johannesburg</strong></p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>As with many other parts of the foreign policy debate, there was no daylight between the two candidates on Pakistan, with Mitt Romney using his time to try to demonstrate that he has some understanding of the country.</p> <p>He listed all the well-worn problems that, in the eyes of many US foreign policy experts, make Pakistan a troublesome country, albeit one the US can never afford to ignore.</p> <p>\"It is not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the road to double that at some point,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Repeated reference was made to Pakistan's nuclear stockpile, including to the prospect of the country, of 180 million people, one day having more nuclear weapons than Britain.</p> <p>He also noted the presence in Pakistan of the Haqqani network, an Afghan insurgent faction allied to the Taliban that has recently been designated a terrorist group by the US, and the threat that Taliban-sympathising ethnic Pashtuns in Pakistan may pose to Afghanistan after the end of the US combat mission, in 2014.</p> <p>He said: \"This is a nation which, if it becomes a failed state \u2026 there are nuclear weapons there, and you have terrorists that can grab those nuclear weapons.\"</p> <p>With the stakes so high, Romney was never going to forgo any tools for dealing with Pakistan, including the supposedly secret drone programme run by the CIA. Although the unmanned aircraft are a major source of friction between Pakistan and the US, Romney said the US must use \"any and all means necessary\" to target terrorists. \"I support that entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that policy,\" he said.</p> <p>For his part, Obama simply let his record stand, using his time during the Afghanistan and Pakistan section to turn swiftly back to domestic policy, saying his strategy of building up the Afghan security forces would allow the US to divert resources to \"nation-building\" in the US.</p> <p><strong>Jon Boone in Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Obama attempted to paint Romney as out of touch by recalling his Republican challenger's statement that Russia was the United States's \"number one political foe\". He upped the ante a bit by saying Romney had called Russia the country's number one political \"threat\". Romney corrected him on that later in the debate: the main threat, he insisted, was Iran.</p> <p>\"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\" Obama said, recalling Romney's words. \"Because the cold war has been over for 20 years.\"</p> <p>That's what some Russians have been saying all along. Shortly after Romney made the statement, earlier this year, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's prime minister, advised the candidates to \"check their clocks from time to time. It's 2012, not the mid-1970s.\"</p> <p>The hardliners inside Russia, including Vladimir Putin, instead welcomed the statement as \"blunt\" and \"straightforward\". They are likely to do the same with the thoughts Romney aired during the debate.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to wear rose-coloured glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr Putin,\" Romney said, noting that \"Russia does continue to battle us in the UN, time and time again\". He also noted Moscow's recent withdrawal from the Nunn-Lugar agreement on arms clean-up as a sign of receding US influence in the world.</p> <p>With US-Russian relations spiralling to new post-cold war lows, it will be hard for Russia's leaders to disagree with any of that. Many will probably be happy simply to know that someone in Washington DC has noticed.</p> <p><strong>Miriam Elder in Moscow</strong></p> <h2>Europe </h2> <p>\"Our alliances,\" said Obama, \"have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.\"</p> <p>And for Europeans, that was it. The sole reference to Europe in the debate was a perfunctory passing remark from the president; the word Europe did not cross the lips of Romney at all.</p> <p>There was no eurocrisis, despite the Obama administration's worries about how the sovereign debt troubles might affect his re-election prospects, and despite the transatlantic pressure, on the Germans especially, to get to grips with the crisis.</p> <p>Germany was not mentioned once, and France just once, along with Britain, in another throwaway remark, contrasting high US defence spending with the thriftiness of others.</p> <p>The special relationship? The UK warranted one further single mention, Romney simply noting that Pakistan will soon have more nuclear warheads than Britain.</p> <p>But failure to mention Europe may be just the way the Europeans want it. After talking to French and European diplomats, Lib\u00e9ration's <a href=\"http://washington.blogs.liberation.fr/great\\_america/\" title=\"\">Washington blog</a> sensed they were OK with the fact that Europe had \"disappeared from America's radar\", happy that Obama was not blaming the eurozone crisis as a source of US economic woe, and that Romney had stopped riffing on the dangers of \"European socialism\" (in other words, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande).</p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/dossiers/monde/election-presidentielle-americaine-2012/le-troisieme-debat-romney-un-obama-bis-23-10-2012-1519983\\_539.php\" title=\"\">Le Point</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections-americaines/2012/10/23/01040-20121023ARTFIG00278-face-a-romney-obama-l-emporte-sans-creuser-l-ecart.php\" title=\"\">Le Figaro</a> felt that Romney had passed the test of leadership stature by keeping calm and succeeding in coming across as a plausible possible president.</p> <p>In a taster of its front-page editorial, Le Monde said: \"Point taken: foreign politics plays no role in the American election. On 6 November, voters will decide on one issue alone: the economy.\"</p> <p>Despite the irrelevance of Europe to the campaign, European elites are, of course, keenly watching the US election. Support for Obama is overwhelming, even if disappointment with the last four years is palpable; wariness of Romney is widespread.</p> <p>A BBC opinion poll released on Monday showed sweeping support in Europe for Obama, with France, perhaps surprisingly, returning stronger backing for the incumbent than anywhere else in the world, 72% to 2% for Romney. Two-thirds of British and Germans supported Obama, while Romney enjoyed 7% and 8% levels. The poll was conducted last month.</p> <p>Romney's highest European support came from Poland. But even that was a niggardly 16%, probably because of the Republican contender's relatively hard line on Russia.</p> <p><strong>Ian Traynor in Brussels and Angelique Chrisafis in Paris</strong></p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>It may be next door to the US with a population of 590 million people and some of the world's fastest growing economies, but Latin America barely received a mention during Monday night's debate.</p> <p>Obama failed to refer to anything on the continent south of the Rio Grande. Romney briefly accused the president of showing weakness towards Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and failing to take better advantage of the trade opportunities in the region, but the total time devoted to Latin America in the 90-minute-long debate was about 20 seconds.</p> <p>The sense of rejection was evident in the regional and Hispanic media.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Politics/obama-romney-care-latin-america-mexico-brazil-cuba/story?id=17508488#.UIZBmmka8eY\" title=\"\">Obama and Romney Don't Care About Latin America</a>,\" said ABC-Univision, a major Spanish-language media group. Online commentators noted there was no mention of the drug war raging just across the Rio Grande in Mexico, insecurity in Central America, or free trade with Colombia.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/internacional/em-ultimo-debate-candidatos-tentam-conquistar-indecisos\" title=\"\">Nobody loves our Latin America very much</a>,\" wrote Caio Binder, a correspondent for Brazil's Veja magazine. Binder said Romney also got his numbers wrong in his brief mention of the region.</p> <p>In a positive description of the trade opportunity that the US had so far failed to take advantage of, Romney said: \"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We're all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2013 time zone, language opportunities.\"</p> <p>Binder commented acidly: \"Wrong, governor: According to the IMF, the GDP of Latin America (and the Caribbean) in 2011 was $ 5.6tn, while that of China was $7.3tn.\" Nonetheless, he said Romney had scored a point among Latin American voters for at least mentioning the region.</p> <p>The lack of attention to the region may disappoint the 21 million eligible Hispanic voters in the US, who are seen as potential deciders in three swing states \u2013 Florida, Nevada and Colorado. In Florida, they are particularly strongly represented with 16% of eligible voters.</p> <p>Nationwide, polls suggest Obama has the support of about 65% support of this group, compared with 35% for Romney. In Florida they are almost level.</p> <p>But Romney's mentions of Ch\u00e1vez, Castro and trade prompted his supporters to claim he had made the case to Hispanic voters.</p> <p>\"I was very gratified that it was Mitt Romney who brought up Latin America, who talked of doing more trade with the region, and was the one who said we have issues in Venezuela, we have issues in Cuba,\" Hector Barreto, who chairs a Romney support group, told NBC.</p> <p>Obama's team claimed the president's actions spoke louder than his words. \"Two passing references to Latin America in a debate does not change the fundamentals of the president's record on Latin America: No president has visited the region more times, in his first four years in office, exports are up more than 50%, we have new free trade agreements with Colombia, and Panama, and all of that is a function of his leadership,\" said Dan Restrepo, who was the administration's top Latin America adviser.</p> <p>The oversight of Latin America was largely due to the moderator Bob Schieffer who choose not to raise related issues, such as regional diplomacy, trade, drug control and immigration. But language may also be a partial explanation. Although Romney talked of Latin America's \"language opportunities\" for the US and although most Hispanics in the US speak English, the two candidates were less enthused to raise Latin American issues in this debate in English compared to interviews they have given to the Spanish language media.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Watts in Rio de Janeiro</strong></p> <h2>Asia </h2> <p>Neither Obama nor Romney mentioned anywhere in Asia but China during the debate, despite the fact that America's presence in the region has involved a considerable number of south-east Asian nations in recent months, and that only looks set to increase.</p> <p>The US secretary of defence, Leon Panetta, visited Vietnam in June to promote greater ties between the former foes and stabilise a move whereby 60% of America's naval ships will be based in Asia Pacific by 2020. Then, last month in Jakarta, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, encouraged a regionally unified code of conduct for the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) in dealing with China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea (Clinton later went on to visit both Timor-Leste and Brunei).</p> <p>And in the US, Obama met Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, who was allowed for the first time in two decades to visit the US, and was awarded Congress's highest medal. That meeting was followed by the easing of many of the travel restrictions and sanctions against the former pariah nation, and, just last week, the US military's invitation to Burma to participate in a joint Thai-American military drill involving south-east and east Asian nations. That invitation was the US's first such engagement with Burma since 1988.</p> <p>With some analysts expecting the region to be at the centre of any US-Chinese disagreements over shared geopolitical interests, such as the South China Sea, one may very well expect to hear more about south-east Asia in the near future.</p> <p><strong>Kate Hodal in Bangkok</strong></p>",
  "<p>When Rio Ferdinand rebelled against the instruction of his boss and refused to wear the Kick It Out campaign T-shirt in the warm-up to Manchester United's Premier League match on Saturday, Alex Ferguson threatened to take action.</p> <p>The matter has now apparently <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/22/sir-alex-ferguson-rio-ferdinand-t-shirt\" title=\"Sir Alex Ferguson has 'no issue' with Rio Ferdinand over T-shirt\">been resolved and put down to a \"communication issue\"</a>, but not before the Professional Footballers' Association promised to defend the player's \"rights as a human being, never mind as a footballer\". But what about his rights as an employee? Can an employer insist that you comply with the company's uniform or dress code? And what steps can be taken if you do not comply?</p> <p>In Ferdinand's situation, his non-wearing of the campaign T-shirt was more a case of undermining Alex Ferguson's authority in fairly unusual and specific circumstances. In most employment relationships, however, your expected dress code and appearance will be set out in your contract of employment or employee handbook.</p> <p>An employer can legitimately tell their employees to dress in a certain way at work, and workers generally do have to comply with this \u2013 as long as there is a good reason for such a code. If you are in an environment where you are meeting others and therefore represent the \"public face\" of your employer, then it is entirely in order for the code to specify that you dress smartly.</p> <p>Similarly, you be may required to dress in a certain way for health and safety reasons \u2013 wearing hard hats on a building site is the obvious example. In other cases, a uniform will be a necessity, for example, if you work for a transport firm or shop. In each case, a minimum standard of dress will be justified by employers to project a professional image or promote a sense of recognition or identity as part of an employer's team.</p> <p>Employers do, however, have to be consistent in their approach and ensure that any dress code is proportionate to what they are trying to achieve. Non-compliance with your employer's dress code can be a disciplinary offence, and ultimately you could be dismissed for not complying with the request if you have no good reason for refusing - unless you have been given no prior warnings or adequate time to comply.</p> <p>There will always be the thorny issue over whether being disciplined because you do not fit in with your employer's dress code or \"look\" can amount to a breach of your human rights, or even sex or race discrimination. In 2009, a disabled worker <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/aug/13/abercrombie-fitch-employee-case-damages\" title=\"\">won a tribunal claim against the flagship London store of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</a> after accusing the company of \"hiding\" her in a stockroom at its London store because her prosthetic arm didn't fit with the firm's \"look policy\".</p> <p>In the case of Eweida v British Airways, however, an employment tribunal found that a Christian employee who was sent home when she insisted on wearing a cross visibly, in breach of the employer's uniform policy, did not suffer indirect discrimination. The case is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/02/christian-rights-cases-strasbourg-court\" title=\"\">going through the European court of human rights</a>.</p> <p>The guiding principle in relation to an employee's standard of dress should, if possible, be based on the impact of that person's dress upon their ability to do the job, after the reasonable expected standards of the employer are taken into account. There will always be a divergence of opinions and this, of course, is only to be expected.</p> <p>Are you expected to dress in a certain way at work, and do you agree with it? Or have you cast a surprised eye over how some of your work colleagues dress?</p> <p><em>Philip Landau is an employment lawyer at </em><a href=\"http://www.lzwlaw.co.uk/documents/philip_landau.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors</em></a></p>",

The notion of the silent ocean having a voice seemed so improbable. It wasn't until the second world war and the advent of underwater acoustics that science discovered how vocal whales really are.</p> <p>Initially it was thought that these sounds were seismic shifts in tectonic plates. Only later was it realised that cetaceans such as blue, fin and sperm whales were the loudest animals on Earth. A fin whale vocalising on one side of the Atlantic can be heard by another fin whale on the other side of the ocean.</p> <p>Noc, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/talking-whale-named-noc-revealed\" title=\"\">the beluga whale who finds himself newly if posthumously famous after reports that he once told a diver to \"get out of the water\"</a>, hails from the most vocal of all cetacean species: belugas have been dubbed the canaries of the sea. What today's story tells us is nothing new. But it does underline the fact that such whales are not only still kept captive in oceanaria in Europe, Asia and North America, but that <a href=\"http://www.wdcs-na.org/story_details.php?select=331\" title=\"\">they are actively being hunted in Russian waters for sale to such facilities in the United States</a>.</p> <p>The great whales provide great problems: it is difficult to study them in the field. Smaller, captive cetaceans such as belugas and dolphins offer easier (if less comfortable) opportunities for investigation. The stagers of such marine entertainment often justify their captive cast with scientific studies. Yet historically, this is where much of the still-nascent work on cetacean science was carried out. Some experiments even came out of the military use of cetaceans, which have been trained to lay underwater mines and even kill human divers.</p> <p>Out of the US Navy's post-war whale programme \u2013 much of it still secret \u2013 came the most sensational story: that of John C Lilly in the 1960s, whose work included the creation of a 24/7 facility in which researchers could live full-time with their subjects. Lilly's outlandish conclusions on dolphin communication prompted him to declare that they spoke \"dolphinese\", and in fact constituted an alien race living among us. Lily was later discredited by experiments in which he injected LSD into dolphins' brains. In doing so he set back scientific work on cetacean communication by decades. Only now is it becoming respectable again, shrugging off its anthropomorphic past.</p> <p>Yet we are human, and sometimes we can only comprehend by seeing the world as our mirror. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2012/oct/23/talking-whale-mimicks-human-speech-video\" title=\"\">Noc's plangent, if unmusical, venture into attempted human \"speech\"</a> also emphasises the greater distance between our species. The disjuncture between human and cetacean underlines this vexed relationship. The whale has represented industrial resource, environmental barometer, and entertainment. It has been co-opted into the human world.</p> <p>Even the apparently benevolent techniques of modern researchers in tagging whales has been shown to have an adverse effect. We try to assimilate their behaviour \u2013 from making them into roving GPS transmitters to furnish nice clean convenient data sets \u2013 to \"interpreting\" their communications in human terms.</p> <p>Recently, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Herman\" title=\"\">Lou Herman</a> has used more benign ways of establishing cetacean capabilities. Working with two captive dolphins, Phoenix and Akeakamai, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, Herman has created an artificial language of signals and gestures to establish that his charges can even understand nuances of grammar and tenses, answering questions and displaying predictive and abstract cognition.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://science.dal.ca/RESEARCH/Faculty%20With%20Named%20Chairs/Whitehead,_Hal.php\" title=\"\">Hal Whitehead</a>, of Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, has also used less intrusive methods \u2013 the hydrophone \u2013 to identify no fewer than five different sperm whale clans in the Pacific Ocean, each distinguished by communicatory \"click\" sequences which are as discrete and unique to each clan as a regional accent is to a human being. Like us, whales appear to be defined by the way they speak. For them, it is their cultural expression, their essential sense of self.</p> <p>Yet the oceanic environment is pumped with anthropogenic noise fit to deafen them. The effect of shipping lanes on the highly endangered right whales of the north-east coast of the US was only discovered after the enforced silence in the days following 9/11, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/08/shipping-noises-chronic-stress-whales\" title=\"\">researchers realised</a> that the whales were vocalising much more loudly \u2013 apparently resuming their natural voices in the way that the birds around Heathrow airport seemed to sing louder when the Icelandic volcanic eruption of 2010 gave them the window of opportunity.</p> <p>Noc's pathetic squeaks echo through the fog of noise, a sea canary singing in the mine. We can hear the whale; but are we listening? It's a bit late to tell us to get out of the water.</p>",
  "<p>Politicians are sometimes driven to flout public opinion and sometimes to flout scientific opinion. But flouting both simultaneously is for the foolhardy alone. Such folly has led to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/22/badger-cull-plans-major-setback\" title=\"\">delay, and quite possibly abandonment, of the controversial cull of badgers</a> in England \u2013 despite Owen Patterson, the environment secretary, declaring that the policy is intact and will go ahead next year.</p> <p>The plan had two simple aims: curb rising tuberculosis infections in cattle and cut the cost to taxpayers of dealing with TB, \u00a390m in 2011 and rising too. Yet the failure of the proposed cull to do either was obvious from the start. No scientific expert I have found outside the government payroll backed the cull. Worse, they derided it in extraordinarily outspoken terms.</p> <p>Lord John Krebs, a careful and eminent scientist who designed a landmark 10-year trial of badger culling, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">called the cull \"mindless\"</a>. The vet who ran the trial, Prof John Bourne, said it could make TB \"a damn sight worse.\" And with deadly understatement, the government's chief scientist, Sir John Beddington, would say no more than: \"I am content that the evidence base, including uncertainties and evidence gaps, has been communicated effectively to ministers.\"</p> <p>On costs, the initial government impact assessment showed the culls would cost more than they would save, and another veteran of the landmark trial, Prof John McInerney, called it a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/17/badger-cull-taxpayers?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">bad deal for taxpayers</a>\". Matters worsened when on-the-ground surveys, costing almost \u00a31m, discovered up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">twice as many badgers</a> in the first cull areas in Gloucestershire and Somerset. As the shooters were to be paid a bounty per dead badger, that meant costs and logistical problems were soaring.</p> <p>The British public's great love of animals was also a big factor. More than 150,000 people signed a government e-petition begun by Brian May, leading to a six-hour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/16/badger-cull-commons-debate\" title=\"\">debate in the House of Commons</a> due this Thursday: the first time MPs could vote on the issue. And despite the government seeing off an earlier high court challenge, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/21/badgers-bovine-tuberculosis?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">renewed legal assault</a> over issues including public safety around the unmarked killing zones promised more pain for ministers.</p> <p>This assault from all sides caused panic and chaos inside the environment department, with Paterson holding daily morning crisis meetings. The farmers, led by Peter Kendall, the NFU president, got cold feet last week, but were bounced into hanging in there by Paterson and Downing Street, the latter terrified of another U-turn in the week that saw David Cameron flounder on an energy bill pledge and his chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, resign. But the pressure was unbearable, and finally broke today.</p> <p>The badgers have a reprieve, but the problem of TB in cattle, which saw 26,000 slaughtered in 2011 at a cost to taxpayers of \u00a390m, remains unchanged. Farmers continue to suffer the financial and emotional trauma of losing their herds. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/19/cattle-movement-bovine-tb-testing?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">belated crackdown on the TB testing and cattle movement regime</a> comes into force from January and will make a difference, given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">England's poor record</a>. Bourne says only better biosecurity from farmers can ultimately solve the TB problem. But telling farmers they are bad at their job is a tough message at any time.</p> <p>Vaccination research will continue, both for badgers and cattle, but precious time has been lost. The coalition cancelled five of the six badger vaccine trials, throwing its weight behind the cull.</p> <p>The 32 eminent scientists who wrote to the Observer calling for the cull to be abandoned called it a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/oct/14/letters-observer\" title=\"\">costly distraction</a>\". They were right. Stubborn ministers, who became so close to the NFU that their communications have been designated as \"internal government communication\", were wrong. Farmers, cattle, taxpayers and anyone who values science-led policy are worse off as a result.</p>",
  "<p>Our school is a large mixed comprehensive in <a href=\"http://www.deepingschool.org.uk/\">Lincolnshire</a> that prides itself not only on academic success, but also on creating a school ethos with relationships and community at its heart. As part of this, we actively encourage all students to get involved in fundraising activities for both local and international charities. Although our starting point was altruistic, we've found that at the same time as raising money for others we're reaping rich rewards as a school.</p> <p>Our involvement with <a href=\"http://www.comicrelief.com\">Comic Relief</a> is a case in point. Three years ago we teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.theposh.com/\">Peterborough United</a> for a Sport Relief event that proved a massive success. Seeing the enthusiasm and energy generated by this, we decided to make the Comic Relief causes a central part of our school year.</p> <p>Since then students have increasingly stepped up to take the lead in organising events and coming up with fundraising ideas. For this year's Sport Relief, a working group of five boys led the way in enthusing and encouraging students and staff, creating a buzz and excitement that lasted throughout a whole week of activities. As a teacher, it's a joy to see students happily stepping out of their comfort zone for a good cause \u2013 memorable moments included watching some of the now coolest students in school donning tutus for a unique version of the Sport Relief dance.</p> <p>Positive role models have been one of the main, and unexpected, benefits to emerge from our fundraising efforts. The working group students were transformed from geeks to heroes. They became hard working, conscientious learners that others now aspire to become. New groups of students have come forward to take the lead next year, building a legacy for the future.</p> <p>Similarly, watching people coming out of their comfort zone (and making idiots of themselves by any ordinary standards) has set a great example for some of our less confident students, who have learnt to worry less about how others perceive them. Fundraising has proved a liberating context for individuals to develop in new and exciting ways.</p> <p>Each year, we see a growing number of students with the confidence to come forward with their own fundraising ideas. Seeing these ideas through to fruition involves determination, planning, negotiation, hard work and risk taking. However, the elation students experience when they succeed and the pride they feel when they realise the impact they've made are palpable.</p> <p>Staff have seen this increased confidence and can-do attitude carried through into students' attitude to learning. Although evidence is only anecdotal at this stage, teachers, pastoral leaders and senior managers all reported improvements in students' behaviour and engagement during last year's Sport Relief week. The genuine buzz created by fundraising events improved the atmosphere in school without at any point detracting from learning. We are planning to analyse behaviour data in the future to confirm this feedback.</p> <p>But is this effect just temporary, or can it have longer term benefits? I think it can. For me, the engagement and enjoyment created during Comic Relief weeks is some of the greatest I have ever experienced as a teacher \u2013 not just since joining Deepings, but at any school. As a result, relationships with students are strengthened and improved. We are reminded how much they are capable of, and they see us in a different light as we share in some of the sillier moments. In my view, the long-term effects can be renewed energy, enthusiasm and enjoyment, on the part of both teacher and student.</p> <p>In terms of classroom learning, we have found that organisations like Comic Relief make it easy for fundraising to be about raising awareness and understanding, as well as money. Building geography and PSHE schemes of work around the key Comic Relief goal, a just world free from poverty, has strengthened our curriculum. Students have gained a better understanding of, national and global organisations and have benefited immensely from the expertise and experience they offer. We have found that parents are particularly positive about this partnership working, actively encouraging their children to get involved and, in turn, supporting fundraising initiatives themselves.</p> <p>So what's the upshot of all this? I guess it's that with some effort, fundraising can mean so much more to schools than just raising money for a good cause. We are extremely proud, as a school, that over the past three years we have raised in excess of \u00a325,000 for Comic Relief. Less tangible perhaps, but just as real, is what we have gained as a school.

  "<h2><strong>Antiquated dogmas</strong><br></h2> <p>Although it has been 22 years since the reunification of Germany there is still only limited interaction between East and West and, as a resident of Cologne (far in the West), I have hardly visited the East at all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/west-east-germany-split\" title=\"\">(After the Wall, 12 October)</a>. I decided to try to rectify this a few weeks ago when I stopped off in Magdeburg, a historic town in what used to be in the old East Germany.</p> <p>Since reunification a lot of work has been done to modernise Magdeburg. Beside the renovated communist monoliths there is a liberal scattering of hypermodern monoliths, mostly shopping centres, with funky names such as City Carr\u00e9e and All\u00e9e Centre containing the usual suspects of mainstream retail.</p> <p>Living in Cologne, I have become used to a city containing a whole range of small cafes, restaurants and quirky shops, so these were the things that I went looking for during my stay in Magdeburg. However, after almost an hour wandering around, I realised that I was not going to find these and all that central Magdeburg had to offer were empty streets and the usual chains that I could find anywhere in the world.</p> <p>My wanderings turned into a type of \"aha\" moment, as it became clear that the current trend towards corporate capitalism is not so different from old-style communism. Yes, communism had very few consumer products to offer and capitalism has a mind-boggling variety, but despite this difference the structures are remarkably similar, with both systems causing a high level of alienation.</p> <p>For example, under communism citizens were pawns of the state and would be set to work in factories or on collectivised farms without much of a say in anything. Eldorado for these people was the west with its access to seemingly endless consumer goodies.</p> <p>But this is not much different to our version of capitalism, where citizens are pawns of the corporations, condemned to dance to the tunes dictated by corporate employers. Both worlds have one very dark feature in common: the total disenfranchisement of the individual.</p> <p>Cologne may be chaotic but the people running the little toy-shop in the Z\u00fclpicherstrasse or the Literature-Cafe in Ehrenfeld are taking risks and are working all hours to make their dreams a reality. These things may exist somewhere in Magdeburg but this does not detract from the sterile, almost Orwellian impression that I got there. The truth is that you can be just as lost under a capitalist system as you can under communism.</p> <p>We should be digging out E&#xa0;F Schumacher's book Small is Beautiful and finding ways to engage in small-scale commerce, serving communities rather than being serfs to corporations or slaves to shareholder value. Neither full-blown capitalism nor full-blown socialism is the solution so we need to add another dimension to our discussions, which sadly seem to be stuck in a range of antiquated dogmas.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br>Cologne, Germany</p> <p>\u2022 Let's get this in proportion: one West German in five has never been to the East: how many southerners in Britain have never been north of Birmingham?<br><strong>Beryl Nicholson</strong><br>Newcastle upon Tyne, UK</p> <h2><strong>Guatemala land grab</strong><br></h2> <p>It is disturbing, if not surprising, to see that the oppression of indigenous populations and cultures is still rife in Guatemala <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/04/guatemala-palm-industry-locals-uncertain-future?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Guatemala's palm industry leaves farmers facing an uncertain future, 12 October)</a>.</p> <p>Rigoberta Mench\u00fa's graphic 1980s account of the genocidal onslaught by the ladino elite on the Quich\u00e9 Indian people seems to continue today. The appropriation of the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples by multinational companies is a blight on modern society, but so long as it brings growth and jobs the concept seems to be widely embraced.</p> <p>Except that it doesn't. The means of gaining a livelihood for most rural dwellers in developing countries is through agricultural production. Taking away this means of survival by duping farmers into selling their plots with the promise of permanent, well-paid, work is both a despicable deceit and a catalyst for tipping more people into poverty and despair.</p> <p>Plantations such as palm oil monocrops are also notoriously unfriendly to the environment. Biodiversity is decimated at a stroke as indigenous species of plants and animals are eliminated and prevented from returning.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Guatemala is not alone. A similar phenomenon is occurring in several African and Asian countries. In many developing countries the so-called land-grabbers are corrupting local governments and clearing productive land of local inhabitants and biota in order to grow export crops in an attempt to feed the world.

  "<p>Russian prisoners' lexicon is colourful and full of historical references. Soon, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, the two members of the rock band Pussy Riot who are still imprisoned, will discover the inside of a \"Stolypin wagon\", a special windowless railway carriage, divided internally into a series of iron-barred cells. These carriages, named after the Tsarist prime minister who introduced them in 1906, have been used for over a century to transport prisoners to penal colonies, many in the remote geographical margins.</p> <p>This week Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were told they will serve the rest of their two-year terms at women's prison camps in Perm, Siberia, and Mordovia respectively. The band called them <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/pussy-riot-remote-prison-camps\" title=\"\">\"the harshest camps of all the possible choices\"</a>.</p> <p>Like most convicted prisoners in Russia, they will not be within easy reach of their families. The majority of women convicted in Moscow courts are taken to correctional colonies located between 200km and 500km from the capital. The south-west corner of Mordovia, one of the constituent ethnic republics of the Russian Federation, is 400km away and I visited its three women's correctional colonies on a research trip in 2007-8.</p> <p>Journeys to prison in Russia can follow meandering routes criss-crossing Russia as convicted prisoners \u2013 men, women, juveniles \u2013 are collected from remand and transit prisons over a wide area. It is for good reason that prisoners refer to the transportation as the <em>estafeta</em>, or relay-race.</p> <p>To all intents and purpose, prisoners disappear into a black hole during transportation, re-emerging only when they arrive at their destination colony. One girl we interviewed in L'govo, a juvenile colony south of Moscow, described how it had taken three months to transport her from Ukhta in the remote European north, during which time she was out of contact with anyone on the outside. Her parents learned of her whereabouts only two weeks after she had arrived in L'govo.</p> <p>Deep in the taiga, the Mordovian colonies are well away from prying eyes. Svetlana Bakhmina, imprisoned for her part in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukos\" title=\"\">\"Yukos affair\"</a> that saw oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky being sent to a colony in the Russian Far East, was taken to Mordovia. With 14-15,000 prisoners and 17 penal colonies, this is one of the largest penal complexes in Europe.</p> <p>Russia's \"correctional colonies\" are unlike any prisons in the west. High wooden fences are topped by razor wire and watch towers. When Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova arrive in their colony they will be taken immediately into a quarantine block to be assessed to determine which <em>otryad</em>, or detachment, they will join for the duration of their sentence. At this point, they will surrender their civilian clothes and exchange them for the blue or grey serge prison uniform and headscarf that has to be worn at all times of the day.</p> <p>The <em>otryad</em> has been the basic building block of Russian penal institutions for eight decades. It refers both to a physical space \u2013 communal dormitory, common room and washroom \u2013 and the 100-120 women occupying it. Prisoners spend roughly half of any 24 hours in the block where their detachment is housed. Each has her own bunk bed and bedside cabinet with little spare floor space between. The two Pussy Riot members can expect to be allocated the top of the two or three-tier bunks, where it can be stuffy and uncomfortable in the crowded dormitories. They will have to earn the right within the detachment to \"move down\". Their fellow prisoners will be a mixture of first-time offenders and seasoned recidivists, convicted for offences ranging from petty theft to murder. Around one-third will be imprisoned for drug-related offences. Sentences are long by European standards; the average for women is 5.4 years.</p> <p>Russia has long used the principle of \"prisoner self-organisation\" to get jobs done around the detachment blocks and to organise prisoners' daily lives. A woman, usually with a long sentence, is designated by the administration as \"head monitor\". Her job is to keep order in the detachment, make sure domestic tasks are done and to liaise with the prison authorities. She is supported by various prisoners' committees responsible for health and safety, cleanliness, energy saving, and also psychological counselling. Cultural and social activities are also organised on a detachment basis, including the annual beauty contest (variously called \"Miss Colony\", \"Miss Spring\", \"Miss Personality\"). Everyone is encouraged to participate and this is essential if a prisoner can be expected to be successful in a bid for early release.</p> <p>Penal authorities insist that self-organisation helps rehabilitation by giving prisoners responsibilities. But not all the prisoners see it like that. Some of the women we spoke to said that the so-called \"activists\" use their position to bully other prisoners and complained about the constant \"pressure to participate\" and \"incessant\" competitions. Trust levels in women's colonies are low, with everyone suspecting each other of being an informant. But the most common complaint is lack of privacy: the inability to find any place to be alone. Raisa, three years into a seven-year sentence, told me that she was a sociable person on the outside but that in the colony she just wanted to withdraw: \"I usually try to hide behind a book or embroidery or I try to escape to somewhere. There are 120 people in the <em>otryad</em>. You can't even be alone in the toilet! And sometimes you think \u2013 God, will there ever be peace? Isn't there anywhere I can be alone?\"</p> <p>When not in the detachment block, prisoners are at work. These jobs are compulsory for anyone who is able-bodied and not a pensioner. Every morning after the first roll call on the colony parade ground women divide up into work brigades to be escorted to the colony production zone. In Mordovia, women inmates make uniforms for the emergency services and armed forces and decorate <em>matrioshki</em> (nested dolls) and other toys for the tourist industry. The working day is long, breaks short and the rewards small, for although the women earn a wage, most is paid over to the colony for their upkeep. The most sought after jobs are in the canteen, laundry and library, but they are reserved for the most reliable inmates.</p> <p>Some women's correctional colonies have nurseries for infants under the age of three. There are currently about 750 babies in Russia's penal colonies living in mini-detachment blocks. Their mothers return to their own <em>otryad</em> soon after giving birth, visiting their infants in their spare time or at set intervals if they are breastfeeding. Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova's children are both over three and so will stay at home with their carers. In theory, Filipp and Gera can be taken to see their mothers but prisoners' entitlement to visits is not generous (four long and six short visits a year). Yet for most prisoners the question of visits is academic. According to the prison service's own census, nearly three quarters of all women receive no visits at all. Family breakdowns and loss of contact with children is frequent among women prisoners. In many cases, the long journey to the penal colonies is simply too expensive or too difficult for ageing parents, partners or young children to make. The penal service recognises that the remote location of its correctional colonies is a problem; its most recent solution is to suggest that prisoners talk with their loved ones by Skype.</p> <p>The arrest and trial of Pussy Riot was seen as a barometer of the direction in which Russia under Putin is moving. The Federal Penal Service rejected a request from Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova to serve their remaining time in Moscow; given the high profile nature of their case, they are afraid for their safety in the communal environment of a correctional colony. It seems there will be no reprieve from the \"relay-race\", a journey undertaken by far too many women before them, and one that must surely confirm the gloomier predictions about Putin's Russia.</p> <p><em>Professor Judith Pallot is professor of the human geography of Russia at the University of Oxford.</em></p> <p><em>Gender, Geography and Punishment: Women's Experiences of Carceral Russia by Judith Pallot and Laura Piacentini is published by Oxford University Press.</em></p>",
  "<p>Allow me to confirm every prejudice you've ever held about Guardian columnists by lamenting that I will never experience the sweet, cinnamon-y taste of a soy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/26/britain-resist-pumpkin-spice-latte\" title=\"\">pumpkin latte</a>. Alas, Reuters robbed me of that indulgence when it revealed that Starbucks has paid a mere <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19967397\" title=\"\">\u00a38.6m in tax in the last 14 years</a>. Now a Starbucks cup feels like a megaphone with which I announce my political apathy to the world. I just can't do it.</p> <p>Wait \u2013 I'm being facetious. In truth, I rarely drink Starbucks because I don't like coffee. I've probably been accidentally boycotting it for years. It's interesting though, that it's a dislike of coffee I blame for not buying Starbucks. It suggests that if I drank the stuff, I wouldn't particularly mind about <a href=\"http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Starbucks-spars-over-union-1300300.php\" title=\"\">Starbucks' illustrious history of union bashing</a> or its part in the organisation that opposed the right to allow Ethiopian coffee farmers to make money by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6086330.stm\" title=\"\">trademarking their own beans</a>. Judging by the amount of lefties I know who shop with equally dubious companies, I'm probably right. We may boycott the things we won't miss, but at the end of the day very few of us seem to stay loyal to our principles if they require us to give up too many of our daily conveniences. As Daniel Diermeier wrote in the Harvard Business Review, \"The first thing to note is that while boycotts can be effective (Greenpeace's boycott of Shell in 1995 reduced sales in Germany by up to 40%) most fail to have any noticeable impact.\" He notes that <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/when_do_company_boycotts_work.html\" title=\"\">\"the cost of participation [to consumers] must be low\"</a> if a boycott is to be widespread.</p> <p>So here's my question: when we find out about companies behaving badly, how do we get them to change? The established pattern seems to be an expos\u00e9, a subsequent furore, defensiveness or contrition from the company, and then everything carries on as normal. Remember the leader of Birmingham city council urging a boycott of BMW after it sold Rover for \u00a310 in 2000? A year later, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1317398.stm\" title=\"\">BMW's global sales rose by 8%</a>. On the blog Liberal Conspiracy, tax campaigner Richard Murphy notes that Starbucks' reputation is at an <a href=\"http://liberalconspiracy.org/2012/10/19/starbucks-is-evidence-that-tax-campaigning-works/\" title=\"\">\"all-time low\" following revelations of its tax arrangements</a>. But is the company ever likely to change, if that has no effect on its profit margins?</p> <p>Of course the glaring omission from my angst-ridden ponderings is UK Uncut, a movement I have played a part in for nearly two years. It is frustrating to have sat outside tax-avoiding shops for hours on freezing cold winter days, and to still be reading tax avoidance stories two years later. But if there's one thing UK Uncut has taught me it's that campaigning is sometimes inconvenient, and it takes time to see results. I remember the first time I met someone from the Tax Justice Network: he talked to me about campaigns in terms of decades, rather than months. In an age of ultra-convenience, it was a shock \u2013 and, I felt, an injustice \u2013 to have to wait that long for something I wanted. But what I realise now is that the continuing presence of tax avoidance isn't a sign that UK Uncut has failed: it's a sign that the campaign isn't yet finished.</p> <p>There is a certain irony to all of this: instant gratification \u2013 perhaps in the form of a latte grabbed on the way to work \u2013 is made possible in an age of tax avoidance and massive profits, and yet it makes us more impatient as campaigners, more unwilling to give up that gratification for the things we know are right. Perhaps we have also been infected with the consumer bug: we want our victories instantly, at our convenience, and with a vanilla shot (sweetener, not sugar). It feels unnatural in our lustrous, capitalist world to have to persevere for long-term gains. But it is worth it, and \u2013 I believe \u2013 one day companies like Starbucks will no longer be allowed to avoid tax. We need to keep talking about tax avoidance, keep emphasising what a black-and-white issue of injustice it is, and keep reminding our MPs that it is <em>their</em> responsibility to take action.</p> <p>Remember those Ethiopian coffee farmers <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/development/ethiopia-starbucks-campaign-anatomy-win\" title=\"\">who were denied the right to trademark their beans</a>?

  "<p>When Skyfall, the 23rd entry in the James Bond series, finally hits UK screens on Friday, the British public will be divided into two factions: those planning to see it, and those assuming it had been out months ago. Even by the unsubtle standards of studio tentpoles, the marketing push for Skyfall has been a long-haul assault, stretching far beyond the standard (if especially ubiquitous) bus-side billboards, and trailers that have been on rotation since the spring.</p> <p>Though not a man averse to material pleasures, Bond himself might balk at the amount of promotional tie-ins being attached to his name this time around. The new film raises the bar for onscreen product placement, from 007's <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2012/09/25/tom-ford-on-daniel-craig-james-bond-skyfall-wardrobe\" title=\"\">Tom Ford-tailored suits</a> to Q's <a href=\"http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/sony-007-edition-vaio-tx-series-notebook\" title=\"\">Sony Vaio</a> hardware, as well as offscreen alliances ranging from Coke Zero to perfume retailers. (Yes, if you've always wanted to smell like Bond \u2013 presumably not after an intense chase sequence \u2013 the option is yours.) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/apr/17/bond-taste-for-beer-skyfall\" title=\"\">His new tipple of choice, Heineken</a>, has proved an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/shortcuts/2012/apr/02/james-bond-product-placement\" title=\"\">ongoing sticking point</a> with fans, particularly after a big-budget ad that actually roped Daniel Craig into the action.</p> <p>However, with the Dutch beer having stumped up over \u00a328m for the privilege of seeing Bond sip from a green bottle in an early scene \u2013 coolly covering almost a third of the film's estimated \u00a393.7m ($150m) production budget in the process \u2013 the producers are willing to endure that indignity. Craig himself has been a diplomatic spokesman on the issue, acknowledging that their <a href=\"http://news.moviefone.com/2012/04/16/daniel-craig-skyfall-heineken-sponsor_n_1429567.html\" title=\"\">reliance on brand associations is \"unfortunate,\"</a> before countering: \"This movie costs a lot of money to make [and] nearly as much again to promote, so we go where we can.\"</p> <p>That quote is about as close as we're going to get to learning the film's actual marketing budget, given Sony Pictures International's customary reluctance to divulge such details. It would be a grey area in any case, since it's more difficult than usual to tell where this film's marketing begins and ends \u2013 particularly in this year of the Bond films' golden anniversary, when any number of external forces are collaborating to sanctify the franchise as a great British institution. 007 practically received a knighthood in his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AS-dCdYZbo&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">amiably goofy skit with the Queen</a> in July's Olympic opening ceremony \u2013 a stunt that may not have had Skyfall's enigmatic name anywhere on it, but pointedly raised awareness of the agent's return to a global audience of a billion.</p> <p>Indeed, while few of Bond's brands of choice \u2013 the venerable Aston Martin notwithstanding \u2013 are British, much of the marketing has worked towards underlining his UK heritage. Most prominent in this regard is a joint campaign with <a href=\"http://www.visitbritain.com/en/Things-to-do/Culture/Live-like-James-Bond.htm\" title=\"\">VisitBritain</a>, which will be using the film to hawk British tourism to international audiences through viral and print advertising, as well as its first ever cinema ad, all united under the slogan \"Bond is Great \u2026 Britain.\"</p> <p>That's hardly an incidental affiliation for a film that, unusually for latter-day 007 entries, was largely shot on home soil in the wake of budget cuts at MGM, which filed for bankruptcy in 2010: climactic scenes may take place in London and the Highlands, but keen-eyed Londoners will also notice the capital doubling for Shanghai elsewhere. It may not look it, but the high-gloss, name-heavy Skyfall came in significantly cheaper than 2008's \u00a3125m <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\" title=\"\">Quantum of Solace</a>.</p> <p>The budget may be lower this time around, but the stakes are arguably higher. With a UK gross of almost \u00a351m and a global total of around \u00a3369m, Quantum of Solace fell short of the numbers attained by the series' first Craig-led outing, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/103963/casino.royale\" title=\"\">Casino Royale</a>, in 2006. It was far from a flop, but it disappointingly failed to build on its predecessor's gutsy brand reinvention \u2013 except, that is, in China, where it significantly outpaced the previous film. <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com/reports/features/reaching-for-the-sky/5047681.article\" title=\"\">Industry journalist Ian Sandwell</a>, who recently studied the film's release strategy for trade magazine Screen International, describes the film's Shanghai-set sequences as the film's \"ace in the pack\": given the vast Chinese market's sympathy toward blockbusters with local involvement, the decision to locate a major stretch of Skyfall's action there is no accident.</p> <p>With Skyfall looking to right the ship and exceed Casino Royale's global gross, the marketing materials haven't taken many chances, with posters chiefly highlighting the 007 brand and not bothering to name its starrier-than-usual cast or its unusually <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/oct/21/skyfall-sam-mendes-daniel-craig\" title=\"\">A-list director Sam Mendes</a>, the first Oscar-winner to helm a Bond film. Sandwell believes this focus on fundamentals is the right approach: \"This could be a reaction to the perception of the Craig era to date, where perhaps the grittiness might have attracted the Bourne fans, yet alienated the Bond diehards. Skyfall's marketing has primarily been aimed at reassuring the traditional audience that they haven't been forgotten.\"</p> <p>So far, Skyfall is tracking well enough to suggest that the approach has paid off, buoyed by one factor the marketing men couldn't control: the overwhelmingly positive reviews that greeted its first screening nearly two weeks ago, which had some excitable journalists even predicting Oscar glory. The Guardian's box office expert, Charles Gant, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlesgant/statuses/257055289000480768\" title=\"\">tweeted a prediction</a> that the film will top Casino Royale to become the highest-grossing Bond film at the UK box office. That appears to be the expectation in the US too: the number-crunchers at <a href=\"http://www.boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2012-09-long-range-forecast-skyfall\" title=\"\">BoxOffice.com are forecasting a Stateside gross of $216m</a>. As it turns out, the lyrics of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/02/adele-bond-theme-review\" title=\"\">Adele's theme song</a> (another marketing coup, as the series' first chart hit in years) aren't strictly accurate: the film's standing tall, all right, but the sky isn't falling.</p>",

We're not going to have the ball. We're not going to be able to play through them, we're going to have to have an out ball at some stage which is why Samaras is going to be important at some stage, and all my forward-thinking players. </p> <p>\"Samaras will be very important because of his physical attributes as well as the football he brings to the team.

He went so far as to suggest he actually feared Celtic's attacking pace and power. Now that could of course be a typical pat on the head, but it sounded sincere enough. </p> <p>Vilanova said: \"Celtic will wait for us at the back and then hit on the break. They proved against Spartak in Moscow that when they do this, they do it with real pace. They showed that again in their game at the weekend.

But... I think he can be exposed a bit at a higher level defensively, more so at left-back than centre-half from what I have seen. His delivery, as you allude to, is excellent which makes him a valuable attacking weapon.</p> <p>Wilson has recovered from a shaky start at Celtic to impress me this season. The early signs on Ambrose suggest he could be a real find.

Celtic's current one, which is relatively young, seem to play confidently and without fear away from home. Now they have got into the habit of doing well on their travels they can build on that.</p> <p>Regardless of tonight, Hooper is guaranteed to be on the radar of English clubs. He was outstanding in Moscow.

It would depend again, of course, on how long a lot of these players (Wanyama, Kayal, Hooper, Forster etc) hang around for and the level of success Celtic have with replacements as and when they move on. This is quite a promising example of a young team which has developed and continues to develop together.

  "<p>The biggest-ever overhaul of the public health system in England becomes a reality in six months. Local authorities, most without any history of public health management, will take over responsibility for improving the health of local populations. Money currently spent on the delivery of drug, alcohol and sexual health services will contribute about 60% of the funding. But, as of April 2013, money previously ringfenced for those services will be lumped together with money for other public health services.</p> <p>No one really knows how clinical commissioning groups, responsible for commissioning local services, and local&#xa0;health and wellbeing boards will work together. There are fears that, with&#xa0;an emphasis on localism, access to&#xa0;drug and alcohol services could suffer. Will councillors turn their backs on electorally unpopular services? Or will it lead to joined-up locally led responses that address issues across sectors and tackle the determinants of health and wellbeing?</p> <p>When galvanised by political will, cities act quicker and more comprehensively than governments. With the identification of Aids in the mid-1980s, several cities in the UK and overseas, including Liverpool, San Francisco and Amsterdam, swiftly provided condoms and syringes to high-risk populations. In Liverpool, the <a href=\"http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2010/04/29/harm-reduction-conference-remembers-liverpool-s-role-in-reducing-those-infected-with-hiv-99623-26339675/2/\" title=\"\">Mersey harm reduction model</a> involved the NHS, communities, primary care, police, church leaders, drug users and sex workers. It led to one of the first needle exchanges in the UK, extensive outreach and an expansion of drug treatment.</p> <p>Cities can also deliver public health prevention. Community-based alcohol projects of the kind implemented in <a href=\"http://css.dev2.999design.com/playsafe/whats_new.html\" title=\"\">Glasgow</a>, Birmingham and Cardiff can reduce alcohol-related problems. The projects work best when there is a range of local actions that change the drinking environment, such as promoting responsible serving of alcohol in bars and shops, training bar staff, enforcing licensing laws, and working with transport and fast-food outlets (often a source of friction late at night). In&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/6/1/2\" title=\"\">Stockholm</a>, community involvement, bar staff training and stricter enforcement of existing alcohol laws has led to a 29% decrease in violent crimes.</p> <p>But cities can also get it wrong. In <a href=\"http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/10/15/getting-a-new-lease-on-life/\" title=\"\">Vancouver's Downtown Eastside</a>, large numbers of drug users with serious physical, mental and social problems were concentrated into an area the size of six blocks, with little or no services.</p> <p>In the UK, the regeneration of inner cities has concentrated bars and clubs into small areas, with competition for customers leading to unhealthy drinking incentives, overcrowding, lack of public toilets, and large numbers of people leaving at the same time and vying for scarce transport.</p> <p>Cities need to bring together expertise and powers across local planning, policing, licensing, urban design and transport, and environmental and public health in order to reduce alcohol-related issues. The changes being ushered in for public health provide huge potential to both maintain and improve alcohol, drug and sexual health services, and also to develop truly integrated responses.</p> <p>The evidence is in \u2013 we would be foolish to ignore it as English public health takes its first steps towards a new brave world.</p> <p>\u2022 Professor Gerry Stimson is former executive director of the International Harm Reduction Association and director of Knowledge-Action-Change, co-organiser, with the London Drug and Alcohol Policy Forum, of the <a href=\"http://www.cityhealth.org.uk\" title=\"\">City Health 2012 conference</a></p>",

  "<p>Food activist and best selling author Anna Lapp\u00e9 is fastidious about protecting her children from increasing levels of toxins created by the agro-chemical industry.</p> <p>But even she was shocked to be told recently that the organic rice milk she had been giving to her older daughter was likely to be laced with arsenic.</p> <p>\"In my mind I thought my family was hermetically sealed and then the Consumers Union released their study on the large levels of arsenic in US organic rice,\" says the 34-year-old author of Diet for a Hot Planet, who this week launches a new campaign to challenge the marketing might of the large corporations who supply pesticides and antibiotics.</p> <p>\"One of the reasons for this is livestock factory farmers use arsenic-based drugs which should not be happening. It was such a reminder that we are all connected in this. Even though I don't buy factory farmed meat or dairy, those practices still affect my family so I need to do as much as I can to change these practices,\" she says.</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9's mission is to not only confront the industrialisation of our agriculture but also to show that there is a more natural and sustainable way of feeding the world's growing population.</p> <p>While she does not see the big agro-chemical companies as being inherently bad, she sees their destructive behaviour as the natural consequence of an economic system that places profits ahead of wellbeing.</p> <p>\"It is not about some evil person in a corporate office twiddling their thumbs working out how to bring down the world,\" Lapp\u00e9 explains.</p> <p>\"This is the inevitable outcome when you have consolidated corporate control on the food system. A few companies are profiting heartily from industrial agriculture and their mandate is to deliver the highest returns to shareholders on a quarterly basis and the way that they are doing that is through pushing products that are not good for our health or the planet.</p> <p>\"Look at a company like Bayer CropScience, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Its recent sustainability messaging says it is helping feed the world. But when you look at their core products, they are one of the biggest providers of antibiotics into the livestock industry. Antibiotics and factory farms are one of the leading reasons behind a major public health crisis of antibiotic resistance, yet they are lobbying heavily to ensure there are not stricter regulations on antibiotics in farming in the US.</p> <p>\"One of their most profitable products is a pesticide that covers 90% of corn seed in the US and new studies have just come up linking that particular pesticide with the disappearance of bees.\"</p> <p>Not only do big corporations have large budgets to play with, but they have political leverage through their lobbying activities. Lapp\u00e9 points out that for every elected politician in Washington there are approximately three dozen lobbyists acting on behalf of corporations.</p> <p>This is why she believes it is so important to create an alternative narrative. While campaigning over a 12-year period and taking part in more than 700 events, she kept hearing the same questions being asked: can we feed the world with sustainable agricultural techniques? Is organic really better? And wasn't she just being an interfering food nanny?</p> <p>\"Then I paid a lot of attention to the communications coming from the food industry and realised that the questions people were asking were the talking points that were coming from the food industry,\" she says.</p> <p>\"There is a deliberate effort on the part of the companies that are profiting from chemical agriculture to shape the narrative.</p> <p>\"Our modestly budgeted <a href=\"http://foodmyths.org/organizers/\" title=\"\">Food Mythbusters</a> campaign is an attempt to expose people to the scientific literature and help people understand the truth behind the marketing messages.\"</p> <p>Global studies, she argues, from organisation such as the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\" title=\"\">OECD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/\" title=\"\">the UN</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\" title=\"\">World Bank</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight\" title=\"\">UK's Foresight report</a>, are making an increasingly compelling case for the need for sustainable agriculture.</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 also says increasing numbers of people are experiencing personal transformations about the need to change their eating habits.</p> <p>But aren't products such as organic food, with their higher price tags, the preserve only of the middle classes? Lapp\u00e9 disagrees: \"I have met many people who are struggling to put food on their table and work two jobs and have had the biggest epiphanies. People are painfully aware of the crisis in their communities, such as around diabetes.</p> <p>\"You realise that once people have that shift in consciousness, you cannot unlearn this. So it is encouraging that more people understand that this is not just about me changing my practices but we are in this together.\"</p> <p>While recognising that some of the companies she targets have CSR programmes in place and individuals who would like to do more, she says their hands are tied by the core business model.</p> <p>She focuses in on Coca Cola, pointing out that while it has \"all these fancy sustainability reports, what is its core product? A sweetened beverage that is bad for your health, that is dehydrating, that uses large amounts of water and that science has shown is linked to the obesity epidemic.</p> <p>\"We cannot expect the corporations profiting from the system to be the drivers of change. The drivers have to come from outside and we have to work to create a policy and regulatory environment that levels the playing field, so that those actors who are truly sustainable are able to get in the game.\"</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 says there are few incentives to help farmers introduce sustainable practices and that this is highlighted by the fact that only 5% of the research budget from the US Department of Agriculture goes into this arena.</p> <p>In the past, she believed it would take a real crisis to wake people up to the reality of our destructive agricultural practices but now she is not so sure, pointing out how little has changed despite the terrible drought of the summer that saw half the counties declared as disaster zones.</p> <p>The proposed farm bill on Capitol Hill which plans to create a new government-funded crop insurance programme does not even require farmers to take any steps to make their farms more resilient.</p> <p>\"We know from the science that in 40-50 years industrial agriculture based on mined minerals, high energy demands for synthetic fertiliser and huge amounts of water will not be viable,\" she says. \"My concern is we will wait that long before we change.\"</p> <p>So doesn't Lapp\u00e9 despair that so little progress has been made? She admits that the world is moving rapidly in the wrong direction, represented by the rise of genetically modified produce and the fact that only 1% of US corn is eaten directly, with the majority going to feed livestock or create fuel.</p> <p>But that only convinces her more of the need for civil society to come together to confront the power structures that maintain the status quo.</p> <p>She highlights the victories that have been achieved. A decade ago there was not a single programme linking farmers to public schools but now they exist in every state.</p> <p>Thirty years ago there were only a few hundred farmers markets in the US, but now there are more than 7000.</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 says: \"We have been called Pollyanas and na\u00efve with our head in the clouds. But if you look back at what has been successful and where we have seen real success, it's when people come together to organise on two fronts; to make policy change and organising around forcing corporations to do the right thing.</p> <p>\"We can really see where we have made some big strides. Before we stepped in, for example, the original proposed organic standard would have allowed farmers to use sewage sludge, genetically engineered seeds and to irradiate their food and call it organic.\"</p> <p>What also keeps her committed is seeing how other activists have kept going even when the odds have been stacked against them. She mentions Indian eco-feminist Vandana Shiva, who has just launched a campaign against seed slavery, and Kenyan environmentalist and political activist Wangari Maathai.</p> <p>\"I met Maathai when President Moi was still in power,\" says Lapp\u00e9. \"She had just lost one of her biggest funders and been threatened with arrest for her organising and she was struggling to keep the organisation together in the face of this dictatorship. If you had told her at that point she would win the Nobel peace prize she would have fallen off the chair laughing.</p> <p>\"I look at my colleagues trying to transform the food industry. I think we do it from a place of feeling we have no choice but to keep trying and to take real pride in the wins we do achieve.\"</p> <p>The greatest influence in her life has been her mother, who has spent the last 40 years campaigning against the chemical industry.</p> <p>The two of them were looking at some of her old notes recently and recognised how the warnings about the dangers of industrial agriculture she was making back in the 1970s still resonate as strongly today.</p> <p>\"I am saying what my mother said 40 years ago but there are two reasons why I am not depressed,\" she says. \"Firstly it is proof of the staying power of the science.</p> <p>\"Secondly, do you think the members of the board of Coca Cola are sitting around at their annual meeting looking at a presentation about how many billions of dollars the company is going to spend telling people yet again to drink Coke this year and saying 'I can't believe we are saying the same thing we did 100 years ago.' They know that they are in the business of shaping consciousness and that is an ongoing process that never ends.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>It's surprising to learn that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/jennifer-lopez\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lopez</a> had never headlined her own tour&nbsp;before <a href=\"http://jenniferlopez.com/blog/cat/tour-feed\" title=\"\">her current jaunt</a>. Most divas&nbsp;in her glittery league consider an&nbsp;occasional sweep of global arenas essential for keeping fans on side, but then again, J-Lo has always given the impression that her pop career is fairly low on her list of priorities. She's better known as an actor, entrepreneur and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4HDbENGAQw\" title=\"\">emblem of Hispanic America</a> than she is for any of her albums. Banks of empty seats at this show suggest she may have left it too long.</p> <p>Now that she's finally got around to it,&nbsp;though, she's giving it the 1,000% customarily demanded by talent show judges. The theme of the set is New York, alluded to by a backdrop showing the Statue of Liberty's crown studded with diamonds, and Lopez's every atom is permeated with the city's go-getting confidence. She's not the strongest vocalist in the world, and too many of tonight's 18 or so pop-R&amp;B tracks leave no aftertaste, but Lopez could teach Madonna a thing or two about self-belief. Thundering around the stage, shaking hands with overwhelmed fans (\"Don't cry!\" she sternly instructs), she's warm, funny and, despite the gloss, very \"real\".</p> <p>\"I'm just a simple girl from the Bronx,\" she informs us with a figurative wink and nudge. The show takes the girl-from-the-hood idea and runs with it. Ushered on by a troupe of dancers dressed in Broadway-inspired top hats and tails, she immediately rips off her floor-length skirt, revealing a sequined leotard. Thus dressed for battle, she steams in and roars through Get Right, Love Don't Cost a Thing and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wvQ6kGM6h8\" title=\"\">I'm Into You</a>. These three summarise her musical breadth as well as anything \u2013 skittering hip-pop, bouncy bubblegum and hands-in-the-air club fare \u2013 but they would be so much generic dance-pap if Lopez weren't there, giving them life through sheer alpha-female force.</p> <p>A costume change later, she's in a boxing ring, singing Goin' In; then she clambers into a gold tracksuit to \"go <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/opinion/viewsday-1.3683911/ciolli-jennifer-lopez-reconnects-with-the-bronx-on-katie-couric-s-new-show-giving-preston-high-school-a-boost-1.4000381\" title=\"\">back to the Bronx</a>\", where she leads the dancers through a quickstep Jenny from the Block. We're transported to an old-school uptown theatre for Hold It Don't Drop It, and to the fictitious Club Babalu during Papi. All these vignettes are executed with such moxie that she can be forgiven a five-minute video montage of her with her four-year-old twins. At the end, it isn't J-Lo the mother or even J-Lo the diva who sticks in the mind, but Jenny from the block, who still knows where she came from.</p> <p>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Students of politics at Wadham College, Oxford, between 1965 and 2000 may well have encountered better known or more frequently published scholars than Robert Currie, but few will have had as lasting an impact on them as he did. Dr Currie, who has died aged 72, was that rare Oxford figure: a dedicated teacher and genuinely original thinker, one who made the conventional experts in his field look as if they were missing the point.</p> <p>Let's say the subject was the Sino-Soviet split. He would set a reading list comprised of the key, respected texts. His students would return with an essay dutifully plodding through the theoretical distinctions between Chinese and Russian forms of Marxism. Currie would listen politely \u2013 though loudly clearing his throat to indicate disapproval of, say, a mixed metaphor \u2013 then proceed to strip away the abstract guff and cut to the chase. Who were the men involved? Stalin and Mao. How could global communism possibly contain two such outsized egos? It couldn't. The pair were bound to be rivals, latching on to ideology merely to justify their antagonism.</p> <p>\"This town ain't big enough for the both of us,\" Currie would conclude, the over-theoretical approach of most political science suddenly cast as entirely irrelevant.</p> <p>Power was what mattered, Currie taught from his cosy study in Wadham's front quad. Power, money, sex and religion were the only true motives for human behaviour: the rest was justification. That approach sometimes led Currie to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but a determination to find what his son, Dan, in his eulogy, called \"the real drivers of history\" was what he conveyed.</p> <p>Tellingly, few of his students went on to become practitioners of what Currie saw as \"the dirty game\" of politics. Many became journalists, including, on this paper, Vikram Dodd, Jess Cartner-Morley and me and, on the Times, the columnist Robert Crampton; others included the Booker nominee Monica Ali.</p> <p>He inculcated us all with scepticism, certainly, but not cynicism. His was a kind of disappointed idealism, perhaps inevitable in a child of Communist party members who had once planned to become a Methodist minister. His first book, published in 1968 and hailed as definitive, was Methodism Divided. He published three more books by 1979, but none afterwards, possibly because he was reluctant to narrow his focus. His intellectual interests were unusually catholic: he delivered university lectures on philosophy and literature as often as politics.</p> <p>Born in Bristol, Currie was the son of a postman, a grammar school boy who was the first in his family to make it to university. There he met the love of his life, Pamela, a fellow Oxford don who died just 12 days before he did.</p> <p>They are survived by Dan, their daughter, Lizzy, and two grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>Some strikers regard the word \"stress\" as synonymous with their specialisation but Klaas-Jan Huntelaar sees no need for such introspection, let alone the superstition and psychological ploys that so often accompany it.</p> <p>Bar a couple of brief, slightly unsatisfactory, spells with Real Madrid and Milan, the Schalke and Holland centre-forward has rarely had to suffer for an art he refuses to invest with the usual mystique.</p> <p>\"Scoring goals is like riding a bike,\" says this most no-nonsense of Dutchmen. \"You never forget.\" Naturally there have been the odd drought but, for much of his career, beating goalkeepers has been almost as regular a part of the 29-year-old's routine as brushing his teeth.</p> <p>Envious rivals can only admire \"The Hunter's\" technical gifts. Supremely comfortable scoring with his head as well as either foot, something which means defenders cannot force him on to his \"wrong\" side, he aims to blemish Arsenal's impressive Champions League record at the Emirates when Schalke visit north London on Wednesday.</p> <p>At 6ft 1in Huntelaar cuts an imposing figure but his scoring record alone is sufficiently formidable to mess with defenders' minds. Not content with 34 goals in 59 international outings for the<em> Oranje</em>, he finished Bundesliga top scorer last season, netting 29 times in 34 League appearances. In all competitions, Huntelaar registered an astounding 48 goals in 47 games for Schalke during the 2011-12 campaign.</p> <p>Small wonder Louis van Gaal, the Holland coach, describes his country's latest successor to Marco van Basten and Ruud van Nistelrooy in uncharacteristically gushing terms. \"In the penalty area, Klaas is the best player in the world bar none,\" says Van Gaal.</p> <p>Bernd Schuster, who missed out on managing the former PSV Eindhoven, Heerenveen and Ajax striker at Madrid by a matter of months seems inclined to agree. \"He looks like he was cloned from Marco van Basten,\" says the former Germany international. \"The way Huntelaar moves, shoots with both legs and his powerful headers remind me of Van Basten's all-round ability.\" Admittedly Huntelaar may lack his compatriot Robin van Persie's positional versatility, but orthodox centre-forwards rarely prove as complete, or buy into the \"team ethos\" as selflessly as Huntelaar.</p> <p>The Schalke midfielder Lewis Holtby emphasises his team-mate's extraordinary ability to deploy superior vision and positional sense before ruthlessly exploiting the tiniest chink in opposition armour. Yet if Huntelaar's brain and body are working overtime the overall impression is that he operates on instinct alone.</p> <p>\"I knew the Dutch know the holes in their cheese,\" says Holtby. \"But Klaas finds holes in every opposition defence. I think you could behead Klaas and he'd still score goals.\"</p> <p>While English FA officials lament the fact that Holtby, the son of a Falklands war veteran from Liverpool and a German mother, has abandoned his boyhood dream of playing for England and now possesses two senior Germany caps, certain Premier League clubs are reportedly keen on \"repatriating\" him.</p> <p>Like Holtby, Huntelaar is out of contract at Schalke next summer, and Liverpool's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/23/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool\" title=\"\">Brendan Rodgers is rumoured to be keen on the idea of a prospective double deal</a>. He is far from alone. Although Schalke remain anxious to re-negotiate the contract of the striker they rescued from bench-warming duties at Milan in exchange for \u00a314m two years ago, they may struggle to keep their prize asset.</p> <p>If a combination of politics, personalities and tactical fashion conspired against Huntelaar in Milan and Madrid \u2013 although he did manage eight La Liga goals in 20 appearances during half a season in Spain \u2013 the only factor possibly deterring England's leading lights from pursuing him is age. He will, after all, turn 30 next August. In striker years that represents late middle age and spells little or no sell-on value.</p> <p>Huntelaar's retort is that he was a late developer \u2013 despite playing in every other position including goalkeeper he did not operate as a striker until he was 14 \u2013 and is still to reach his peak.</p> <p>That deceptively slow-burn beginning saw Guus Hiddink, his manager at PSV, question the young Huntelaar's lack of obvious pace before repeatedly overlooking his goal threat. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is unlikely to prove similarly blind on Wednesday.</p>",

  "<p>On 8 December 1999, at 8.23pm, I fell in love with another man. Roy Keane probably wouldn't care much for this revelation, but then I'm pretty sure I wasn't alone. The context was a long-forgotten match between Manchester United and Valencia in the long-forgotten second group stage of the Champions League. Long forgotten, that is, by everybody except those besotted with Roy Keane.</p> <p>For the preceding five months, there was a serious danger that Keane, aged 28 and at the peak of his not inconsiderable powers, would leave United. His contract was due to expire in the summer of 2000, and United were unwilling to break their rigid wage structure to give Keane the \u00a350,000 a week he wanted. Moves to Juventus and Bayern Munich were frequently discussed in the press; the Bosman rule meant that, as of 1 January 2000, Keane could discuss terms with foreign clubs. All that scaremongering about the Millennium Bug had nothing on the millennial angst felt around Old Trafford. The word 'unthinkable' does not begin to do justice to the thought of that United side without Keane. Impasses are usually tedious; this was terrifying.</p> <p>Then, on the afternoon of United's match against Valencia, the club announced that Keane had signed a new contract. It was a match United had to win; they had lost the first group game away to Fiorentina, largely because of a rare and hideous error from Keane. A fortnight later he righted that wrong, slamming in a joyously emphatic opening goal from the edge of the area. Keane had already made far greater contributions for United, most famously away to Juventus in the previous season's semi-final, but the combination of the goal and the earlier defenestration of the desperate thought of a world without him made it a nigh-on perfect moment. The sort that makes you realise that, even when you grow old and doddery, and when you wouldn't recognise your other teenage heroes if they were stood in front of you holding a walking stick, you will still love Roy Keane.</p> <p>There is something about Keane that inspires such extreme devotion \u2013 and also wonder. At the 2012 Soccer Aid event, superstars like Robbie Williams and Will Ferrell were clearly in awe of Keane. Most fans of big English clubs other than United hate him, of course, and in that respect Keane is an uber-Marmite figure: those who love him would generally be willing to go to the ends of the earth for any unspecified Keane-related purpose. As a player, he was of his time by not being of his time: he captured the pre-millennium angst of the outsider who cannot understand the world of which he is part. In doing so he brought to mind a number of pop-culture characters of a similar disposition. Two in particular: Tyler Durden in Fight Club and Tony Soprano in The Sopranos. Like Keane, both raged, raged against the dying of society's light. There are other similarities. The intense adoration Keane receives evokes that of Tyler Durden, while his obtuse charisma, anti-heroism and scattergun frustration is shared by Tony Soprano. Keane, like Soprano, was raging for a better world and a better him. He has always been an incredibly complex man, a compelling fusion of instinctive intelligence and pathological desire.</p> <p>Keane, like Tony Soprano, is a mass of often uncomfortable contradictions. Thank goodness for that. The most interesting people in life are invariably flawed, and Keane has been the most interesting person in British football for the last few decades \u2013 an outsider even down to his Diadora boots, never mind the candour that is so rare in modern football. What kind of hero would you prefer? Prom kings are for dreamers and liars. Having Roy Keane as a hero allows a vicarious ride through life in all its miserable glory.</p> <p>For all his success \u2013 Keane won seven Premier League, four FA Cups and, although he'd tell you otherwise, one European Cup at Manchester United \u2013 football has often been brutally unkind to him. He was booted out mercilessly by a club and manager to whom he had given his soul and body. He missed out on his only European Cup final because of suspension. A year later, when he seemed to be on a personal mission to win the trophy \u2013 he scored six Champions League goals that season, almost half his career total of 14, and played with almost demented purpose \u2013 he then scored an own goal and missed an open goal in the quarter-final defeat to Real Madrid. Having got Ireland to the World Cup in 2002 with arguably the greatest football of his career, he missed out on the tournament because of his infamous row with Mick McCarthy. Keane always defined himself and his teams by global competition; you only have to see his boyish excitement as he stood pitchside for ITV ahead of Milan v Barcelona to realise that. Despite playing some awe-inspiring football for Ireland and for United in Europe, he played just in just one major tournament and no European finals.</p> <p>If this tells us of the essentially cruel nature of football, they will not necessarily be our abiding memories of Keane. We will remember him as somebody who personified leadership, who controlled games with forensic intelligence, who was a grossly underrated passer and who, on occasion, put the fear of God into both opponents and teammates. That was a consequence of an intractable obsession with excellence. Keane combined a higher state of concentration and an inhuman perfectionism to consistently reach a level of performance beyond almost anyone else \u2013 even if that level of performance regularly did not satisfy the critic within. He was not interested in glory. Glory was something that came if you did your job properly. That, nor heroism, interested him. \"You can be a hero \u2013 whatever that is,\" he sniffed in his autobiography.</p> <p>Players of Keane's type are regularly described as 'winners', and with good reason. Keane did not so much have a will to win as a need to win. \"If I was putting Roy Keane out there to represent Manchester United on a one against one, we'd win the Derby, the National, the Boat Race and anything else,\" Sir Alex Ferguson once said. \"It's an incredible thing he's got.\"</p> <p>It was not just winning that interested Keane, however. He was equally concerned with excellence and personal pride; winning was usually the result of the exhibition of those qualities. It was not necessarily a deal-breaker. In his autobiography he talks about the performance that first caught the attention of Nottingham Forest scouts. His team were 5-0 down with a few minutes to go. Everybody else had waved the white flag, but Keane kept doing the right things: demanding possession, moving the ball on crisply, putting out fires when the opposition had the ball. The qualities were in evidence at Forest, too: in 1992-93, the first season of the Premier League, Keane fought a lone, heroic and ultimately doomed battle to keep Forest in the Premier League.</p> <p>Keane detested mediocrity, and sometimes that need for excellence proved overwhelming. It is no coincidence that his infamous foul on Alf-Inge Haaland in 2001 came immediately after Manchester City had equalised at Old Trafford. United were already champions, but they had surrendered feebly in Europe to Bayern Munich earlier in the week and Keane was convinced they were in the comfort zone. When City \u2013 a poor side who would be relegated \u2013 equalised, it all bubbled over. Prawn sandwiches, mediocrity, couldn't even beat City at home, comfort zone, Haaland in possession. \"Alfie was taking the piss\". Bang. Haaland was toppled like a folding deckchair and Keane was the villain again.</p> <p>Keane's detractors say he was little more than a thug who went round booting people at a time when the game's laws had not evolved sufficiently. This is such offensive poppycock that it barely merits mention. The primary weapons in Keane's arsenal, by a distance, were his energy, positional sense and game intelligence. Never was this more evident than during a magnificent performance in the 1996 FA Cup final against Liverpool. The game is remembered for Eric Cantona's masterful late winner, which clinched the Double for United and completed his fairytale; justly so, yet that goal was infinitesimal in the grand scheme. In this game, as much as any others, Keane's footballing philosophy emphatically came to pass.</p> <p>This particular devil has always been obsessed with detail, and the minutiae of football matches. \"They say God is in the detail; in football that's true,\" he said in his autobiography. \"Sometimes games are won by a magical goal \u2013 that's what people remember. But the essence of the game is more mundane. Detail. Wearing down the opposition. Winning the psychological battles \u2013 man on man \u2013 from the moment the ref blows the whistle for the first time.\" Keane called it the Law of Cumulation. \"First tackle, first pass, first touch, everything counts. A lot of little things add up to the thing that matters: breaking the opposition's hearts \u2013 but first their minds, their collective mind.\"</p> <p>Liverpool were a dangerous, free-flowing side who created umpteen chances in the two league games against United that season: a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford and a 2-0 win at Anfield that could have been 8-0 but for Peter Schmeichel. Keane did not play at Anfield, but he grudgingly respected Liverpool's abundant attacking talent: Robbie Fowler, Jamie Redknapp and Steve McManaman all played the most progressive football of their career under Roy Evans. The unpredictable brilliance of Stan Collymore was also worthy of respect. Keane's fear of Liverpool's capabilities was accompanied by loathing. In short, he couldn't stand them. The notion of the Spice Boys was anathema. Lee Sharpe tells a story of him and an \"absolutely smashed\" Keane bumping into the Liverpool players in a bar one Saturday night. Keane went through them one by one, dismissing their England B caps, England under-21 caps and League Cup winners' medals. The gist, frequently expressed, was simple: \"What the hell have you done in the game?\"</p> <p>Then they turned at Wembley in cream Armani suits. The FA Cup final had been turned into fancy dress day, a jolly boys' outing. You can only imagine the unremitting contempt on Keane's face as he looked those sartorial monstrosities up and down. With help from his trusted lieutenant Nicky Butt, Keane shut Liverpool down with remorselessness, concentration and intelligence. They had barely a chance all game. It was one of the great defensive-midfield performances. It meant the game, as hyped as any FA Cup final in the modern era, was a stinker, but are you going to tell Roy Keane that was a bad thing?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lifesapitch.co.uk/order-a-copy-of-the-lifes-a-pitch-anthology/?utm_source=Life\" title=\"\"><em>This is an extract from a chapter in Life's a Pitch: The Passions of the Press Box</em></a><em>, which includes essays from 18 writers, including Dominic Fifield, Jonathan Wilson and Rory Smith, and a cover quote from Rafa Benitez: \"These are the writers as you don't normally see them: when they are fans with pens.\"</em></p>",

The economist Paul Krugman, who has repeatedly called for pressure on China over the renminbi in the past, described its valuation as \"<a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/an-issue-whose-time-has-passed/\" title=\"\">an issue whose time has passed</a>\" in a blogpost on Monday.</p> <p>Labelling China a currency manipulator would be a largely symbolic move \u2013 requiring only negotiations between the countries \u2013 and Romney has not committed himself to following up with concrete measures such as imposing tariffs.</p> <p>\"That might provoke a reaction. Simply saying it was a manipulator would draw an angry reaction from the press but I don't see it would [necessarily] have much more impact than that,\" said Alistair Thornton, senior China economist at IHS Global Insight.</p> <p>Richard Bush III of the Brookings Institution wrote this week that the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2012/10/22-romney-china-bush\" title=\"\">worst-case scenario was a trade war</a> slowing growth and raising unemployment in both countries and raising inflation and interest rates in the US.</p> <p>But he said that was unlikely since China would probably claim the existing strategic and economic dialogue fulfilled the need for negotiations. Even if Romney wished to go further, he would need congressional approval \u2013 and the business lobby would most likely strongly oppose measures such as tariffs.</p> <p>\"China could also impose some kind of tariff on US products as a way of fighting back. The US and China would end up in a lose-lose situation,\" said Gary Liu, the executive deputy director of the CEIBS Lujiazui Institute of International Finance.</p> <p>He argued that the rebalancing of the Chinese economy away from investment and exports and towards consumption, which has long been advocated by its leaders but slow in coming, would be good news for the US and should improve relations.</p> <p>According to figures released this summer by Pew Research, the proportion of people saying they are paying close attention to the presidential race is far lower than in 2008 in most countries \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2012/06/Pew-Global-Attitudes-U.S.-Image-Report-FINAL-June-13-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">but has more than doubled in China</a> (pdf) to 36%.</p> <p>The debate itself, viewable live on the internet but not broadcast by Chinese TV channels, was never likely to notch up a sizable audience in China given that it took place during working hours.

  "<p>Arctic ice is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">melting faster than expected</a>. Five years ago authoritative predictions suggested it would take until 2065 to shrink to the size it reached last month.</p> <p>Drastic action is necessary to reduce emissions from the energy sector if we are to slow the rate of global warming.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the UK government's independent climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/uk-dash-gas-illegal-climate-committee\" title=\"\">called for the carbon footprint of UK electricity to be 50g/kWh by 2030</a>. However, the government has set a standard for new electricity generators that is nine times higher. This is to allow electricity generation from natural gas. But we will not achieve the CCC target if these gas plants are built, because they typically last 30 years. The government claims this \"dash for gas\" will lead us out of recession.</p> <p>Rather than listening to the fossil fuel lobby, the government should look to Germany, now leading Europe out of recession. In today's Nature Materials, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v11/n11/full/nmat3466.html\" title=\"\">I point out, with German and Italian colleagues</a>, that the peak price of electricity in Germany is falling steadily, giving their industry a competitive advantage.</p> <p>The peak price is falling because the amount of solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity is rising exponentially. In summer or winter, PV systems in Germany supply cheap electricity with maximum power around noon, when the sun is highest. The peak demand, and therefore peak price of electricity, also occurs around noon.</p> <p>In the UK, an all-renewable electricity supply would be even easier than Germany because the monthly wind variation and evening electricity demand match. Our evidence suggests the most effective, cheapest and quickest way to achieve the CCC target is to impose their limit on new electricity generation here and now.</p> <p>All the renewable energy technologies are well below the CCC limit. Most of them are already well established. In 2011 the UK had 12.3GW of renewable power which is around 20% of our maximum electricity demand.</p> <p>Many more renewable energy technologies are available now than in 2006. Offshore wind is expanding. My group at Imperial has developed solar cells that are being manufactured with three times the efficiency of current PV panels. Tidal and wave power did not appear in the 2011 figures, yet the UK has one half and one third respectively of Europe's tidal and wave resources.</p> <p>Bioenergy contributes around one quarter of the UK renewable supply. Many types of biogas generator produce electricity cheaper than using natural gas. A fast-rising biogas contributor is anaerobic digestion. This is biogas from bacterial fermentation of food, sewage or livestock waste in closed vessels. Resulting carbon dioxide emissions are much lower than the CCC limit and greenhouse gases from the rotting waste are avoided.</p> <p>Importantly, all biogas fuels are indigenous. A \"dash for biogas\" will mean the price of UK electricity will no longer depend on the whim of foreign governments. There would also be no need for the environmentally unsound and politically unpopular method of \"fracking\" for shale gas.</p> <p>Recovery from recession is hindered by the reluctance of banks to invest in new industry. A large number of first-time investors were prepared to support the UK renewable industry but were deterred <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/28/solar-subsidies-cut-half\" title=\"\">when the feed-in tariff (FiT) for solar photovoltaics was cut in half</a>. The FiT should be more closely modelled on the successful German counterpart. If the Treasury reversed its decision to count the FiT on its books, public expenditure would be reduced at a stroke.</p> <p>An even bigger boost to government finances could result if the CCC limit were imposed now. The government could save much of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/budget-2012-oil-industry-tax\" title=\"\">\u00a33bn tax break they gave the fossil fuel industry in the budget</a>.</p> <p>Adopting the CCC limit now would help the UK emerge from recession. The cost of electricity would fall, new jobs would be created, government debt would fall and, at last, the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">could fulfil its pledge to be \"the greenest government ever</a>.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.barnham\" title=\"\">Keith Barnham</a> is emeritus professor of physics at Imperial College London and author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/id/The_Burning_Answer/9780297869634\" title=\"\">The Burning Answer</a> to be published by Orion Books next year</p>",
  "<p>Neil Smith, who has died aged 58 of liver failure, brought a new dimension to geography by exploring the relationship between cities, the wider world and capitalism. If we want to understand the economic system's workings, he argued, then we have to understand the spaces that make its existence possible. And if we want to live in a saner environment \u2013 natural and built \u2013 we need to revolutionise the ways in which it is produced.</p> <p>As an undergraduate at St Andrews, Scotland, Neil studied the way in which gentrification had become a global force in the shaping of cities. In addition to middle-class people seeking better lifestyles, he pointed to the rent-gap, the difference between the rent a property earns currently and what it could earn if redeveloped for new inhabitants. When the gap is big enough, private capital is attracted by the financial potential, and restructuring follows.</p> <p>By the time of his book The New Urban Frontier (1996), Neil was an academic based in the US and the argument had acquired a political aspect. It highlighted an effect akin to revenge as richer people returned from the suburbs to repossess inner-city areas, their interests combining with those of private capital to the detriment of the poorer people living there. In the process, public policy initiatives such as zero-tolerance policing served to criminalise the marginalised and homeless.</p> <p>Neil's arguments about gentrification were part of a larger examination of how capitalism shapes nature and geographical space, whether land, sea, air or buildings. His PhD dissertation at <a href=\"http://www.jhu.edu/\" title=\"\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, Baltimore, became the book Uneven Development (1984), taking up the term that Karl Marx had used for the emergence of simultaneous concentrations of wealth and poverty. The example of humanly induced climate change demonstrates how we produce nature without being able to control it \u2013 a significant insight for the field of political ecology, studying the flow of environmental benefits and costs.</p> <p>This approach to geography attracted scholars in such fields as anthropology and sociology to the study of space and place. Neil's curiosity as to why pioneering work such as his came comparatively late to geography resulted in a study of Isaiah Bowman, geographer to Presidents Woodrow Wilson during the first world war and Franklin D Roosevelt during the second. American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization (2003), is a biography-cum-political history of America's rise to global power through \u2013 rather than despite \u2013 geographical ignorance.</p> <p>In Neil's view this field of study was bankrupt in the US in large part because that suited the rise of American-led, capitalist liberalism, a theme further developed in his final book, The Endgame of Globalization (2005). The effectiveness of his arguments was recognised by the discipline he so strongly criticised: the <a href=\"http://www.aag.org/\" title=\"\">Association of American Geographers</a> awarded him Distinguished Scholarship Honours, its highest award.</p> <p>Born in Leith, Neil was one of the four children of a schoolteacher and his wife. He grew up in Dalkeith, to the south-east of Edinburgh, where he developed an early passion for birdwatching that he never lost. His ferocious intellect, passionate commitment to socialism and lively Scottish sense of humour made him someone who might be disagreed with but not ignored. You wanted to argue with him, and he wanted to argue right back. \"The battle for ideas,\" he was fond of saying, \"is just too important to leave to others.\"</p> <p>Neil taught at Columbia University (1982-86) and <a href=\"http://www.rutgers.edu/\" title=\"\">Rutgers University</a> (1986-2000), where I was his student, before he was made professor of anthropology and geography at the City University of New York. There he founded and directed the Centre for Place Culture and Politics, where political activists and academics felt equally at home. He made time for his students over a beer or a meal, when, despite commitments that took him all over the world, he devoted himself to our ideas and the ruthless but comradely critique of them.</p> <p>Neil's marriage to geographer Cindi Katz was followed by a partnership with another geographer, Deb Cowen. At their home in Toronto, Neil pursued another of his great passions, gardening \u2013 a production of nature that he fully approved of. Deb survives him, as do his sister, Sheila, and brothers Derek and Harvey.</p> <p>\u2022 Neil Robert Smith, geographer and anthropologist, born 18 July 1954; died 29 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>High and volatile food prices, together with growing concern about climate change, population growth, and other pressures on land and resources, have pushed food production up the international agenda.</p> <p>There is, however, little consensus over the future of farming and the route to global food security.

  "<p>When it comes to exploiting new markets through exporting, Manchester and the north-west generally have had their share of success, the Guardian newspaper being one of the best examples, as panel chair Terry Macalister, the title's energy editor, pointed out.</p> <p>But given that two thirds of growth in global trade comes from new entrants to markets, according to UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) figures, there is a constant demand for business advice and support in breaking into the world's high growth market economies and overcoming the barriers.</p> <p>Graeme Leach, the IoD's chief economist talked about the positives for businesses: falling inflation, an end to the squeeze on real earnings and the cash in the coffers of UK PLC. He highlighted a key indicator, M4X reflecting the broad money supply, which is now growing at a rate that allows some room for optimism.</p> <p>After touching on the problems created by the eurozone crisis, the discussion quickly turned to new export markets for small business.</p> <p>Tony Attard, chair of IoD North West and chief executive of textile company Panaz, called on his own export experience, particularly to Asian markets, to paint an upbeat picture of the scale of the real opportunities that exist.</p> <p>\"This is an incredibly exciting time to be in business; our company grew 12% last year, and will achieve another 15% this year. A lot of our competitors have retrenched, creating some brilliant opportunities for us. Our exports have grown by 72% over the last year, because export markets pick up very quickly,\" he said.</p> <p>The upward trend in exports is being seen across the region, up 12% last year, and still climbing, but with a slight tail off in exports to the eurozone from 52% to 49%, reflecting a shift towards new high growth markets. China has become the region's fourth largest export destination, from its previous position as 12th.</p> <p>Clive Drinkwater, regional director of UKTI, said: \"Two years ago the biggest export commodities to China were scrap metal and chemical products. Now the biggest is luxury cars, which indicates the growth we are seeing in China's consumer spend. Export sales to other emerging markets such as Russia and Turkey are also growing.\"</p> <p>But it was China that was on the minds of many of the delegates, including the export implications of the country's faltering economic growth, ageing workforce, and even whether huge investment in its national infrastructure could be considered growth.</p> <p>Leach explained: \"China needs to maintain 8% economic growth to manage its massive rural urban migration. If it falls below 8% they will stimulate the economy. India will overtake China in terms of population 40 years down the line, but the key thing is that China's rate of growth will be sufficient to manage the demographic change. And yes, putting an infrastructure in place delivers a significant platform for growth.\"</p> <p>Some of the newest and arguably most exciting new markets are emerging in Africa, with countries like Nigeria firmly on the UK export radar. However, as one delegate pointed out, corruption and bribery in some of these new markets can leave British firms in a difficult position, forcing them to walk away from lucrative business opportunities.</p> <p>Attard said focusing too much on emerging markets and overlooking some of the established economies and business models, including those in the eurozone, could be a mistake.</p> <p>\"Italy and Spain are supposed to be having a rough time, but we are doing some great business with both countries. It is harder to get a foothold in China, south-east Asia and South America because the infrastructure isn't there,\" he said.</p> <p>However, for those determined to explore comparatively uncharted export territories, his advice was to attend trade shows, work with trade associations and contact the commercial attaches of the relevant consulates. And physically getting out there, he added emphatically, is a must.</p> <p>If there is one big advantage that UK businesses have over other foreign competitors when it comes to accessing new overseas markets it is 'Brand Britain'. It is regarded as a hallmark of quality, trust and heritage that has continued throughout the recession, no doubt enhanced by the success of the London 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>Malcolm Woodall, international business manager for Lloyds TSB, said: \"British products are very well perceived overseas, but selling them is still hard work.\" </p> <p>\"In some markets, notably China and Asia, you will see union flags everywhere. Made in Britain is incredibly hot, and exporters should be exploiting that,\" Attard said.</p> <p>Many delegates wanted to know what support was available from UKTI to help them gain a foothold in a new market.</p> <p>\"Plenty,\" was Drinkwater's response. The north-west region alone had 40 UKTI advisers helping businesses, and several posts in China handling commercial activity for them. Passport to Export, is a UKTI gateway to growth programme designed for new exporters, while the government's UK Export Finance body can signpost businesses towards export credit, export working capital, and help in understanding the complexities of foreign exchange.</p> <p>Responding to questions, the panel gave some valuable practical advice, for example, businesses should avoid the assumption that their product and packaging will work in every new market; they may need to package for individual countries.</p> <p>Those with concerns over the threat of counterfeiting when launching into a new territory were advised to take expert advice, and when planning markets ensure that IP is protected.</p> <p>The panel concluded that accessing new markets isn't difficult and is extremely rewarding.</p> <p><em>The </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/small-business-network\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Small Business Network </em></a><em>and Lloyds TSB Commercial will run 12 regional seminars, in conjunction with the Institute of Directors. </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/small-business-network/table/2012/aug/17/roadshows-how-to-book\" title=\"\"><em>Click here</em></a><em> to explore the range of different seminars and register your interest now</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Al Gore weighed in, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/algore/status/260565096445644800\" title=\"\">tweeting during the course of the debate</a>: \"Where is global warming in this debate? Climate change is an urgent foreign policy issue.\"</p> <p>The Green party's presidential candidate, Jill Stein, went so far as to label Obama a climate change denier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/22/us-elections-barack-obama-climate-denial\" title=\"\">in an interview with the Guardian</a> for his failure to discuss the issue on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Other commentators argued allowances should be made for Obama's failure to discuss climate on the campaign trail, and his middling support for environmental concerns while in the White House.</p> <p>Since the rise of the Tea Party conservatives in 2010, energy and climate change have emerged as among the most contentious issues dividing Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>The backlash from anti-government conservatives led Obama to downplay his green agenda, delaying and weakening environmental regulations. It also led to the adoption of what Obama called an \"all of the above\" energy strategy, which saw a role for expanded offshore oil drilling and domestic production, due to new techniques in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/22/keystone-xl-obama-fast-track-southern\" title=\"\">Obama also moved to fast-track the southern portion of the Keystone XL pipeline</a>, which will help step up Alberta's huge tar sands production.</p> <p>Administration officials, including Obama, began to avoid the very mention of climate change threats, opting instead to frame the issue in terms of the economic opportunities created by clean energy industries such as solar and wind power.</p> <p>Romney, meanwhile, responded to the rise of the Tea Party by backtracking on his earlier support for climate action as governor of Massachusetts. He also called for phasing out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/17/us-wind-power-mitt-romney-subsidy\" title=\"\">subsidies for the wind industry</a>.</p> <p>By the time of the Republican convention, Romney was using climate change as a laugh line, a way of tagging Obama with grandiosity for his 2008 election promise to help heal the planet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">Obama hit back in his convention speech</a>, pledging to reduce the emissions which cause global warming. \"Climate change is not a hoax,\" he said. \"More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future. And in this election you can do something about it.\"</p> <p>As a number of commentators noted at the time, it was Obama's most high-profile mention of climate change in months, if not years.</p> <p>Even so, the novelist <a href=\"http://90days90reasons.com/27.php\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen argued</a> that Obama \u2013 while a disappointment to campaigners \u2013 was still a better option on the environment than Romney.</p> <p>\"So give Obama a C-plus or even just a C on the environment if you like,\" Franzen wrote on the <a href=\"http://90days90reasons.com/index.php\" title=\"\">90 Days, 90 Reasons</a> blog.</p> <p>\"But consider that Mitt Romney, if he's elected, will nullify soundly based decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); he will continue to pretend that the science of climate change is uncertain; he will open up all federal lands (except, presumably, national parks) to the ravages of drilling and mining; he will roll back sensible regulation of pollution and habitat destruction; and he has shown, with his choice of Paul Ryan as a running mate, that he is serious about slashing funding for every federal program except the military \u2013 and you'd better believe that the EPA and Fish and Wildlife will be the first to be gutted. Mitt Romney will get an F, double-underlined in red ink.\"</p>",
  "<p>Daniel Conn left school at 18 and started work as an administrator for Mercedes-Benz near his home in Brighton. He soon wished he hadn't spurned the idea of going to university and began investigating Open University (OU) courses, but he never quite found the courage to apply. </p> <p>Then he discovered the OU's OpenLearn website, which offers 650 Open University study units free online. After working his way through four in computing and maths (and doing an online Harvard University course on the side) he thought he might as well get a qualification. </p> <p>Now approaching 30, he is studying for a part-time OU degree in computing, which he hopes to finish in 2015.</p> <p>\"The OpenLearn materials give you the gist of what the course is about and whether you can do it,\" he says. \"It definitely gave me a lot of confidence.\"</p> <p>The OU is not the only university that has started offering courses free online. Over the past couple of years increasing numbers of universities across Europe and the US have set up web-based resources known as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). These MOOCs make recorded lectures, course materials and academic discussion forums freely available to anyone who wants to use them.</p> <p>Jonathan Kydd, dean of the University of London International Programmes, which last month began offering free courses in psychology, computer programming and law through the US online education provider Coursera, says the involvement of top-rated institutions such as Stanford and Harvard has made this kind of free distance learning particularly appealing. </p> <p>\"You are going to inspire students because they are going to get [access to] a high proportion of people who are household names and who are both great researchers and great teachers,\" he says.</p> <p>Universities use free courses not only as a shop window for the other courses they offer, but also as a way of sharing good practice with other institutions, experimenting with new technology and of seeing what does and doesn't work in distance education, Kydd says.</p> <p>This is important because the availability of higher bandwidths and progress in developing effective systems of online assessment, combined with increasing demand, means that paid-for distance learning is also booming.</p> <p>According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the number of distance learning students registered at UK institutions grew from 238,800 in 2006/07, to 271,445 in 2010/11.</p> <p>Tony Hopwood, chief assessor for the Open and Distance Learning Quality Council, says the increase is particularly marked in the university sector, which is now competing with dedicated distance learning organisations.</p> <p>Gr\u00e1inne Conole, professor of learning innovation at the University of Leicester, says this is out of necessity. \"We know worldwide that bricks and mortar universities don't have the capacity to deal with the number of students there are going to be in future, particularly in places like India and China, so online learning has to be the way to go.\"</p> <p>The University of Derby is one institution to recognise this, setting up a separate department to focus on online distance learning students with academic systems and tutors dedicated to their specific needs.</p> <p>Joy Rickard, who is studying for an undergraduate certificate in educational psychology at Derby from her home near Bath, says she feels the benefits. For her, distance learning means the flexibility to look after her two young children and work part-time in a school while studying alongside a global student cohort.</p> <p>\"I have met some people online who are doing fascinating things all over the world, which wouldn't have happened if I was attending in person,\" she says.</p> <p>Certainly online learning deepens the pool of potential students. Kydd says London University's International Programmes distance learning model, which allows students to take courses over time and pay incrementally, makes it affordable for students from Africa who would otherwise never be able to take a degree. </p> <p>And the University of Leicester is about to launch an MSc in security, conflict and international development, designed to meet the needs of international development workers deployed in post-conflict countries, who would normally find study impossible. Because access to the internet can be tricky in such countries, the students receive an iPad on which they download the course app and related ebooks, all accessible without an internet connection. They can then download other materials when they find a Wi-Fi&#xa0;connection.</p> <p><strong>Campus life</strong></p> <p>New courses run by Plymouth University are similarly designed for hard-to-reach students. The university is offering undergraduate and postgraduate diplomas, and master's-level programmes in hydrography for students working on oil rigs and survey vessels, sometimes thousands of miles from the nearest university.</p> <p>But what about missing out on campus life? Rickard, who studied graphic design at the University of Wales, Newport before having children, says she feels she has \"done\" student life and is now more interested in developing a career. Conn, who has just started a full-time job as a technology developer off the back of his studies, says his local OU student union and online forums keep him happy. </p> <p>\"You don't feel like you're on your own,\" he says. \"The only thing I'm missing is living in a rundown squat for a couple of years and leaving with masses of debt.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ahead of Apple's expected launch of its iPad mini, one of its key suppliers has jumped sharply following better than expected results.</p> <p>Cambridge-based <strong>Arm</strong> has added 28p to 622.5p after a 22% rise in third quarter profits to \u00a368.1m and an 18% rise in revenues to \u00a3144.6m. The company said its royalty revenues had benefited from it gaining business in digital TVs and microcontrollers, and it had also seen good performances in its smartphone and tablet business (it supplies the likes of Samsung as well as Apple.) Chief executive Warren East said:</p> <blockquote> As we move into an ever more connected world of mobile computing, cloud-based networks and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/08/31/futurists-cheat-sheet-internet-of-things\" title=\"\">the internet-of-things</a>, Arm is seeing increased demand for its high performance and low power technology. <br> This demand is helping to drive Arm's licensing revenues and this quarter we saw market leaders license Arm's advanced processor technology for next generation super smartphones, tablets and mobile and embedded computing applications. </blockquote> <p>He said the company had gone into the fourth quarter with a record order book - it has signed five licenses for its Mali graphics chip with three of the customers new ones for the product - and he expected revenues to be in line with current expectations, despite the overall gloomy global economic picture:</p> <blockquote> Data from our customers suggests a modest sequential increase in Arm's royalty revenue in the fourth quarter. <br> </blockquote> <p>The company said it was always on the lookout for strategic opportunities and had committed \u00a3104.5m towards a possible investment. If the deal does not happen, the money will be returned to Arm. Julian Yates at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The 2012 outlook is in line with consensus but we would see modest upside risk. We see Arm as the stand-out tech play, and maintain our buy rating. </blockquote> <p>Another UK technology business, <strong>CSR</strong>, has also pleased investors, saying it will pay them $285m before the end of the year, the proceeds of the sale of its handset technology to Samsung. Third quarter operating profits rose from $24.3m to $32.2m, and its shares have climbed 13.2p to 351.9p, the biggest riser in the FTSE 250 index. Lorne Daniel at FinnCap said:</p> <blockquote> On the back of these results we are moving from our recommendation from hold to buy, with a 400p target price. <br> </blockquote>",
  "<p>After years on the sidelines of higher education policy, postgraduates are finally getting their moment in the spotlight. In July 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/hlscience\" title=\"\">House of Lords Science and Technology Committee</a> recommended that the government create a new loan scheme for STEM postgraduates. The review of <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/latest_news_detail.aspx?title=UK_must_champion_investment_in_science_and_research&amp;pPK=017cea38-d0cb-4a69-8ae7-919b9a1f04ee\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrat science policy</a> led by Julian Huppert came to the same conclusion. And just last week, the government's social mobility czar, Alan Milburn, called postgraduate study a potential time-bomb and urged the government to commission an independent report to develop proposals for a loan system.</p> <p>Next week, the <a href=\"http://www.hec.gov.pk/Pages/HECMain.aspx\" title=\"\">Higher Education Commission</a>, a cross-party group of senior leaders from industry, parliament and the education sector will add their voice to this call, publishing a major report on the future of postgraduate education. The report looks at the health of the postgraduate sector, identifies a number of challenges the postgraduate sector will face in the years to come, and considers in detail how a postgraduate loan scheme might work.</p> <p>It is the final output of an eight-month inquiry chaired by Graham Spittle, vice president of IBM and former chair of the <a href=\"http://www.innovateuk.org/\" title=\"\">Technology Strategy Board</a>, the UK's innovation agency. It draws on scores of interviews \u2013 with students, academics, employers, industrialists and vice chancellors \u2013 and thousands of pages of written evidence.</p> <p>The commission warns that a perfect storm is on the horizon for postgraduates. Many institutions are increasing their tuition fees \u2013 either because of greater awareness of costs, or because of the flawed view that universities cannot possibly justify charging \u00a33-4,000 fees for advanced education when undergraduates are paying \u00a39,000. Such high fees will put already stretched funding schemes under greater pressure.</p> <p>We conclude that the existing scheme of professional and career development loans for taught postgraduates is inadequate. Last year only 44% of those applying for a PCDL were successful, and the terms of such loans have been described by consumer finance experts and others as uncompetitive. It is clear that the status quo is not sufficient.</p> <p>There is a widespread concern amongst employers and universities that students starting undergraduate courses this autumn, at a cost of \u00a39,000 per year, will be less willing to enter postgraduate education when they graduate in 2015. A worrying number of current postgraduate students interviewed during the inquiry were unsure they would have entered further study had they studied under the new undergraduate finance system.</p> <p>The report also highlights the growth in the number of international students over the past decade \u2013 the number of non-EU students has increased by 200%, while home and EU student enrolments have only increased by 18%. The proportion of British students progressing into postgraduate study within two years of completing a first degree is among the lowest in Europe. Only three countries in the Bologna higher education area have a progression rate below 10% \u2013 the other two are the Republic of Kazakhstan and the micro-state of Andorra.</p> <p>Noting that most international students quickly return to their home countries, the commission warns that high numbers of international students cannot compensate for poor take-up of postgraduate education among the home-domiciled population. We call for an emphasis on up-skilling the UK population, which will involve dismantling some of the current barriers to participation.</p> <p>Postgraduate skills are becoming increasingly important for entry to the labour market; there are a number of areas in which postgraduate study is becoming a de facto requirement for finding employment. There is a risk that existing inequalities in access to postgraduate study will multiply into inequalities in access to the professions. One vice chancellor giving evidence to the inquiry described postgraduate education as the \"next frontier of widening participation.\"</p> <p>The report looks beyond our borders, at the educational and industrial strategies which are being pursued by our competitors, and asks what labour market our country will need in the years to come. As global competition intensifies our focus will have to shift even further up the value chain. This will inevitably require a more highly-skilled workforce and more investment by industry, universities and government into research, development and training. We will need to tackle the UK's skills utilisation problem by better matching the skills and training people will need with the postgraduate courses available.</p> <p>The commission concludes that urgent action is required to correct failures in conventional credit markets. Given the substantial wage premium from which the average postgraduate benefits, it should be possible to design a loan scheme in which the vast majority of money loaned is repaid. The commission calls upon the government to immediately establish a taskforce to develop proposals for such a system.</p> <p>Such a scheme should be targeted rather than universal, and the report identifies three principles for prioritisation. The key principle is maximising value-added \u2013 the loan design should seek to minimise deadweight cost and should not crowd out existing streams of funding. We might wish to target loans at areas where we are currently underinvesting and which are strategically important to our future competitiveness. Alternatively we could prioritise funding on the basis of improving access to the professions \u2013 targeting loans at courses which are de facto requirements for entry into employment, or as Universities UK have suggested, identifying and targeting students that may not otherwise pursue postgraduate study.</p> <p>There is a growing groundswell of support for a postgraduate student loan scheme. The challenge now, for the sector and policymakers alike, is developing a model which works.</p> <p><em>Joel Mullan is senior researcher to the </em><a href=\"http://www.hec.gov.pk/Pages/HECMain.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Higher Education Commission</em></a><em> \u2013 the commission's report on postgraduate education will be launched in UK parliament on 29 October</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Every year, thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people contact Stonewall Housing for help and advice. Most tell us that the housing problems they're facing are related to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Today, many more LGBT people are having to rent their homes from a private landlord, thanks to a lack of affordable housing and because local authorities have a requirement to discharge their duty to house only the people in most acute need. But how safe is the private rented sector for LGBT people?</p> <p>For many, it simply isn't. Even though LGBT people living in private rental accommodation are more likely to be in full-time employment, more than 40% tell us they still feel insecure in their homes or are facing eviction.</p> <p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are not just private issues, they are at the core of someone's identity. Unfortunately, LGBT people still face daily harassment and abuse simply because of who they are. Sometimes, that abuse comes from a landlord.</p> <p>Gay residents may also face discrimination from neighbours or those who they share a home with. They may have to deal with inappropriate language from letting agents, and landlords have even told potential renters that they are not welcome because they may upset other tenants.</p> <p>Safety is one issue, and security of tenure is another. Tenancy agreements tend to be weighted in favour of the landlord: for LGBT tenants, this can mean their housing is even more insecure. If an LGBT tenant is being abused, and is unable to leave because of the length of notice period, they can become effectively imprisoned within their home.</p> <p>We are also concerned about LGBT living in private rented homes and receiving benefits. More than one in three people who contact us for advice can no longer afford to pay their rent. We expect those numbers to grow as welfare reform is introduced.</p> <p>We're concerned about the impact of some of these new benefit rules on our community. From April 2013, young people under the age of 35 will only be entitled to claim housing benefit at the shared accommodation rate, meaning claimants will be forced to share with others, whatever their personal needs or background.</p> <p>Transgender people going through gender reassignment may find themselves sharing with complete strangers who may be openly or aggressively intolerant. At a time when they most need a supportive, welcoming environment, these tenants will be placed at risk of transphobic abuse.</p> <p>One issue that is not confined to LGBT tenants is the quality of homes in the private rented sector. Over one in ten of LGBT people who are renting privately call us because of the poor standard of their home. Just as the Decent Homes initiative helped to improve the quality of social housing, so there needs to be a drive to improve the quality of private rented accommodation. It must become a tenure of choice, and not just because it is the only option available.</p> <p>So what do we want to see happen? There are some basic changes that private landlords can make to create a safe space for LGBT tenants:</p> <p>\u2022 Rent deposit schemes must be more accessible and the private rented sector should be made more affordable for all communities</p> <p>\u2022 Tenancy agreements must be more flexible yet offer security: if abuse or harassment happens then tenants should be able to escape without financial penalties, and if they find safe accommodation they should be able to remain there for a significant period of time</p> <p>\u2022 More landlords should be encouraged and supported to accept LGBT people who are receiving benefits</p> <p>\u2022 Private landlords and agents should be offered training and guidance so they can be more aware of LGBT issues</p> <p>\u2022 We need a more careful regulation of the quality and management of properties in the private rented sector</p> <p>I want to work with landlords so they can understand the issues that LGBT people face on a daily basis, and in their search for stable and secure accommodation. Stonewall Housing is already working with <a href=\"http://www.shelter.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Shelter</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.hqnetwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Housing Quality Network</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cih.org/\" title=\"\">Chartered Institute of Housing</a> to drive up standards and promote good practice in the social housing sector. The same should happen for the private rented sector, so all LGBT tenants can feel safe and secure in their homes.</p> <p>We would also welcome working with other support and advice agencies to deliver specialist services for LGBT communities. Stonewall Housing already offers support to LGBT people as part of the East London Housing Partnership's Single Homelessness Project, where the group has successfully helped a number of LGBT people sustain their tenancies in the private rented sector.</p> <p><em>Bob Green is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.stonewallhousing.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Stonewall Housing</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice \u2013 and the latest job vacancies in your area</strong></p>",

For several years they recorded its spontaneous sounds while it was underwater and when it surfaced.</p> <p>An acoustic analysis revealed the human-like sounds were several octaves lower than typical whale calls. The research was <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2812%2901009-3\">published on Monday in the scientific journal Current Biology</a>.</p> <p>The authors wrote that Noc was even able to be <a href=\"http://download.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/PIIS0960982212010093.pdf\">trained to \"speak\" on cue [PDF]</a> and they were able to study how he adjusted the pressure and \"phonic lips\" in his nasal cavities to make sounds much lower than ordinary whale squeals and clicks.</p> <p>\"The whale was exposed to speech not only from humans at the surface \u2013 it was present at times when divers used surface-to-diver communication equipment. The whale was recognised as the sources of the speech-like sounds when a diver surfaced outside this whale's enclosure and asked: 'Who told me to get out?' Our observations led us to conclude the 'out' which was repeated several times came from Noc.</p> <p>\"We interpreted the whale's vocalisations as an attempt to mimic humans.\"</p> <p>After four years of copying people, Noc reached maturity and apparently either lost the capacity to make human noise or lost interest in doing so. He went back to sounding like a whale, emitting high-pitched noises, and died five years ago.</p> <p>Dolphins and parrots have been taught to mimic the patterns of human speech, but it is rare for an animal to do it spontaneously.</p> <p>The study is not the first time a whale have been identified making human sounds. Scientists who have studied sounds of white whales in the wild sometimes heard what sounded like shouting children.</p> <p>Caretakers at the Vancouver Aquarium in Canada once claimed they heard one of the white whales say its name, Lagosi. His other utterances were indistinct and described as a garbled human voice, or someone speaking in Russian or Chinese.</p>",
  "<p>At the last Guardian Sustainable Business event, chair Jo Confino heroically tried to get four sustainability managers to reveal their personal feelings about the state of the global environment. His challenge was simple: \"How can you stay positive when every indication suggests that we are making no progress curtailing global carbon emissions?\"</p> <p>In response we got detailed answers about the impressive initiatives that were being implemented in their companies; we learned that change has to be incremental, that the business case has to be thoroughly argued and that progress is definitely being made. In short, each manager felt they were doing everything they possibly could within their business. The bleak wider global picture didn't figure highly.</p> <p>We have heard this same view at <a href=\"http://globalactionplan.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Global Action Plan</a>. At the start of the year we put together a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/LkEKMf\" title=\"\">slideshow \u2013 sustainability: luxury or necessity? \u2013</a> which is an attempt to present the sustainability case to business managers.</p> <p>We sought advice from more than 50 companies on the content and their comments were consistent: we were urged to take out the imaginary content, showing the devastating impact of global floods, drought and intense storms, and focus instead on the financial implications for companies and examples of positive steps that companies are taking. They told us that employees would switch off from images of destruction and that it would not resonate within the company.</p> <p>Their views reflect a trend in the way that sustainability is communicated. The belief that you \"must prove the business case\" is embedded like words through a stick of rock.</p> <p>As a result the language around sustainability has become sanitised. Carbon foot-printing and carbon reduction targets are set with little connection to the global imperative to act. They are now part of the everyday language of business of another target to hit and report against.</p> <p>On one level this has to be a good thing; sustainability is being embedded into everyday business life and is a part of people's roles against which they are measured and must report progress. This is something towards which we aspired and we should be celebrating the fact that it is happening.</p> <p>But is this really the case? I have a nagging concern that the removal of emotion could create complacency.</p> <p>At the launch of the new <a href=\"http://world-you-like.europa.eu/en/explore/\" title=\"\">European Climate Change campaign A world you like with a climate you like</a>, EU climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard pointed out that 2011 saw the biggest ever increase in global carbon emissions and that this would mean the biggest increase in the bill for future generations.</p> <p>The stark reality is that the incremental approach we are currently taking is simply not having the desired impact on global emissions. We need something far more transformational. Perhaps this level of transformation can only be achieved if we emotionally engage in the debate by understanding that the decisions we are taking today will have a profound impact on the choices and opportunities faced by our children and future generations.</p> <p>It could be argued that it is not the role of business to engage at this emotional level. Surely this is a role for civil society to play? Shouldn't they be the ones setting the tone for the debate, forcing business and governments to face the sobering reality? The answer is almost certainly yes, but in the UK I can't see this happening in the near future. The campaigns that have been run recently have either run out of steam or failed to get mass engagement.</p> <p>Given this situation, I think we are now reaching a crunch point. If we carry on with the current incremental model of change the chances are that insufficient emission savings will be made. Alternatively we could seek to create new collaborations where leading businesses work much more closely with communities and NGOs with a view to bringing together their pragmatic approach to change with a more highly charged emotional message.</p> <p><em>Trewin Restorick is chief executive of Global Action Plan</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Turkey's press freedom situation has reached a crisis point, with the country assuming the world's top spot for the number of imprisoned journalists, says the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).</p> <p>\"The Turkish government is engaging in a broad offensive to silence critical journalists through imprisonment, legal prosecution and official intimidation,\" says a special report by the New York-based press freedom watchdog.</p> <p>The CPJ has identified 76 journalists imprisoned in Turkey as of 1 August this year. At least 61 of them were being held in direct relation to their work or news-gathering activities, the highest global figure in the last decade. </p> <p>The CPJ's 53-page report featured letters sent from imprisoned journalists and government responses to CPJ inquiries. About 70% of those jailed were Kurdish journalists charged with aiding terrorism by covering the views and activities of the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) and the Kurdish Communities Union (KCK). </p> <p>Over three-quarters of the imprisoned journalists have not been convicted of a crime, but are being held as they await resolution of their cases. Up to 5,000 criminal cases were pending against journalists at the end of 2011. </p> <p>\"Articles in the penal code give authorities wide berth to use journalists' professional work to link them to banned political movements or alleged plots,\" said the report. </p> <p>\"Some of the most frequently used articles criminalise basic news-gathering activities, such as talking to security officials or obtaining documents.\"</p> <p>Joel Simon, the CPJ's executive director, said: \"Turkey's tendency to equate critical journalism with terrorism is not justified by the country's security concerns. </p> <p>\"Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan should cease his attacks on the press and instead provide justice for journalists while pursuing reforms that guarantee freedom of expression.\"</p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/144069/free-press-in-crisis-in-turkey-cpj-says.html\">Turkish Weekly</a>/<a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/reports/2012/10/turkeys-press-freedom-crisis.php\">CPJ</a></p>",
  "<p>The veteran Bollywood director, Yash Chopra, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/21/yash-chopra-bollywood-mogul-dies\">passed away this week</a> at the age of 80. His death came just weeks before his much anticipated new release, Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012) was due to hit the big screen. Yash Chopra may have been one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of Indian cinema, yet he will always be remembered as his country's king of celluloid romance.</p> <p>During a career of 53 years he launched some of Indian cinema's most iconic and commercially successful films. Smash hits such as Waqt (1965), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabhie_Kabhie_(1976_film)\">Kabhi Kabhie&#xa0;(1976)</a>, Silsila (1981), Lamhe (1991) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veer-Zaara\">Veer-Zaara&#xa0;(2004) </a>captured the essence of Yash Chopra's sensibility \u2013 a highly-stylised presentation of the emotional dilemmas of the super-rich. If Yash Chopra's heroes were handsome fighter pilots or brooding poets, then his heroines were magnificently groomed in their chiffon saris. And when love was declared, usually in a song and dance sequence, it was done in a suitably scenic setting - amid the snow-capped Swiss Alps, in the tulip fields of Holland or on the rolling hills of the Lake District. </p> <p>Chopra recognised the sense of excitement, escapism, adventure and aspiration that an exotic location could bring to a film, particularly one with romance at its heart, and so exotic backdrops quickly became his trademark.</p> <p>Historically in Indian films, it was the mountainous region of Kashmir, widely regarded as 'heaven on earth' which represented idyllic surroundings for falling in love. Kashmir's scenery and landscape became so popular that lakes, trees and mountains became synonymous with romance in Bollywood. But when the terrorism threats of the late 1980s made the region difficult and then inaccessible, Yash Chopra began the trend of seeking substitutes overseas.</p> <p>Consequently, Bollywood today plays a leading role in introducing alluring overseas destinations to India, currently the <a href=\"http://www.euromonitor.com/tourism-flows-outbound-in-india/report\">fastest-growing outbound tourist market</a> in the world. Getting your country featured in the latest Bollywood blockbuster is as good as it gets when it comes to product placement.&#xa0;No wonder then that Bollywood personalities are courted by tourism agencies worldwide. Yash Chopra for instance, singlehandedly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SvO-hxaH29s\">boosted tourism in Switzerland</a> by regularly featuring the country's lakes, misty valleys and snow-capped mountains as the backdrop for his song and dance sequences. So grateful were the Swiss Tourism Authority that they named a lake after him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398202458\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2010/7/23/1279884414110/An-Ullswater-steam-boat-m-006.jpg\" alt=\"An Ullswater steam boat moored at Glenridding in Cumbria\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What better setting for cinema romance? An Ullswater steamer on a calm day at Glenridding pier. Photograph: photolibrary.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: photolibrary.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director also played a part in promoting Britain as a glamorous destination. His classic film Lamhe (1991) was shot in London and the Lake District. When he produced <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YMLlXMbqxWs#!\">Mujhse Dosti Karoge</a> a decade later, Chopra again returned to Ullswater to film aboard one of the steamers which ply between Glen Ridding and Pooley Bridge, reveling in the twisting lake, rolling fells and narrow, winding roads of the national park. </p> <p>Yash Chopra's unique visual aesthetic has also influenced an entire generation of film makers. The 1995 film, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plT9rLUrV6I\">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge </a>(which Chopra produced), not only marked his son Aditya's directorial debut, but it went on to become Indian cinema's longest-running blockbuster. Not only did the film feature some of London's best known tourist spots, but it was also one of the first to feature British Asians in its storyline \u2013 non-resident Indians (NRIs) as they're known in Bollywood terms. </p> <p>One of Bollywood's hottest directors, Karan Johar, who is a goodwill <a href=\"http://www.visitbritain.org/aboutus/recentactivity/highteakaranjohar.aspx\">ambassador for VisitBritain's four-year global 'Britain You're Invited' campaign,</a> also cites Yash Chopra as a major influence. Although his recent films have been set in America, Johar's first two releases were extensively shot in Britain. To capitalise on this, VisitBritain, the national tourism agency responsible for marketing Britain overseas, published a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2007/may/29/puttingbollywoodonthebriti\">Bollywood Movie Map</a>, to encourage Indian fans to visit these British locations popularised in their favourite films. The map highlighted old and recent Bollywood productions and included Karan Johar's 1998 film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, whose <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cy150z8Bz4\">title track alone was filmed </a>at Glencoe, Ross Priory and Loch Lomond in Scotland. The list of British locations in his second release, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSRJHh47b0\">Kabhi Khushie Kabhie Gham&#xa0;(2001) </a>was even more exclusive \u2013 one song alone features King's College, Cambridge, Blenheim Palace, Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and the British Museum's Great Court.</p> <p>Chopra remained faithful to his favourite British locations until the very end. The video for one of the songs for his final film, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q5duWVfDJo&amp;feature=relmfu\">Jab Tak Hai Jaan</a> (due out on 13 November, to coincide with Diwali) features one of the most extravagant displays of London's tourist destinations ever witnessed in a Bollywood film. </p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/irnaqureshi\">Irna Qureshi</a></strong> is an anthropologist and writer on British Asian culture.

  "<p>With the final debate between Obama and Romney in the 2012 US presidential election campaign behind us, we can expect another inevitable onslaught of debate analysis, opinion polls, extreme scrutiny and hilarious Twitter hashtags. So I'd feel remiss if I didn't add to this. </p> <p>This wealth of data arguably is a good thing: it suggests that there is a demand for it, and this in turn suggests a large number of people are actively interested in the politics that directly affects their lives. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/voterapathy\">Voter apathy</a> is often a concern (in UK politics at least), so anything that gets people interested should be encouraged.</p> <p>However, so much analysis, discussion, dissection, interpretation and opinion is produced over every debate or other high-profile (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19631430\">or not</a>) political event, it risks becoming largely meaningless. I'm not in charge of a global superpower (yet) so I can't say for certain, but I'd have guessed that articulately defending your policies in front of an audience (albeit a <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/election-2012/audience-60-million-watched-presidential-disaster\">very large one</a>) is not the most important facet of the job. </p> <p>And yet, the debates are portrayed as a crucial test of candidate suitability. The actions of animals in <a href=\"http://jab.sagepub.com/\">behavioural science</a> labs don't come under this much scrutiny. When every sentence, gesture and stance (physical and ideological) can potentially result in a level of meticulous analysis that <a href=\"http://www.jic.ac.uk/microscopy/intro_em.html\">an electron microscope</a> would consider \"a bit invasive\", what chance does any normal human have of getting an honest and accurate assessment of the useful facts in order to make a rational decision? I'd argue that it's \"very little\", bordering on \"zero\". They're likely to end up filtering the data in some way, and focussing on things that conform to their own views and principles, and if such a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/c/confirmation_bias.htm\">confirmation bias</a> is used (by necessity) can a balanced decision based on the facts really be likely?</p> <p>This is undoubtedly going to get worse as time and technology progress. It's bad enough now with 24-hour news channels and the internet with all its inlets and outlets. Most media, seemingly terrified of the audience's attention wavering, focus on sound bites and brief clips, which risk losing the context and nuance of a 3-hour debate. Twitter is hardly any better in this regard. </p> <p>Who knows how bad it's going to get when more advanced technology becomes available? One can imagine the depth of analysis we'll have to deal with for the 2020 election debates.</p> <p>\"At the 2 hour mark, the perspiration detection laser sweep revealed the Democratic candidate has 1.54 times the number of beads of sweat on his forehead than his rival, implying that he is over 50% more nervous than the opposition candidate when discussing the economy. However, when the Republican candidate belched at 94 minutes, the olfactory detection scanner in the podium revealed that he had recently eaten bacon, which is likely to lose him support among undecided Jewish voters.\"</p> <p>As facetious as this may sound, the reasons people actually vote for who they do can often be no more sophisticated and superficial. In a way, it's something of a contradiction to actively decide who will make decisions for you. Democracy is a relatively recent occurrence in terms of <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5843/1360.full\">human cognitive evolution</a>. If we're not adapted to make logical decisions based on the extensive socio-economic factors and variables we're presented with, how do we decide who we want in charge?</p> <p>Because humans do seem to always want someone in charge. Humans (and other primates) are social creatures and instinctively form <a href=\"http://anthro.palomar.edu/behavior/behave_2.htm\">groups with a hierarchical structure</a>. The need for hierarchies and social standing are potentially <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430590/\">hard</a> <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/news/health/apr2008/nimh-23.htm\">wired</a> into our brains, and our position in the hierarchy can <a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.94.1.82\">affect our health and well being</a>. And with any hierarchy, there is inevitably someone at the top.</p> <p>For more primitive societies, the leader is likely to be the one who can control most others by being the biggest or strongest, the one you <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-alpha-male.htm\">don't want to cross.</a> But as any society gets more widespread and complex, so must the mechanisms to control the society by its leader. Religion undoubtedly played a part in this, making it possible to invoke an invisible deity who will punish those who break the social rules when nobody is around, via some ineffable methods. And anyone who can claim to represent the deity must be obeyed, for they are supposedly capable of things beyond you. </p> <p>In such tightly regulated hierarchies as religions and militaries, who ends up in charge is not a democratic decision; in these cases, membership of and acceptance by the organisation usually requires discipline and strict adherence to the rules, so who gets to lead is not a matter for debate.</p> <p>The sort of free-thinking, intellectual types who read the Guardian science section may think themselves above such mindless adherence to authority figures, but that sadly may not be the case, even for more \"enlightened\" types. <a href=\"http://www.stanleymilgram.com/pdf/attribution.pdf\">Milgram's infamous experiment</a>, where everyday volunteers from normal backgrounds told to supply painful (but simulated, although they didn't know that) electric shocks to an unwilling victim, actually did so if commanded by a recognised authority figure (in this case, a scientist). </p> <p>One theory as to why this happens is that the subjects enter an \"<a href=\"http://aspsychology101.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/1-6-agency-theory.pdf\">agentic state</a>\", where they feel responsibility for their actions rests with the authority figure, not them, no matter how distressing. This is one theorised mechanism for why people obey commands that lead to genocide.</p> <p>But it's not a straightforward process. Give someone a uniform and a position of authority and they don't instantly get respect and obedience, as any traffic warden will tell you.</p> <p>Context appears to play a crucial role in the designation of someone as a 'good leader'. For example, <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/leadership/f/autocratic-leadership.htm\">authoritarian leaders</a> tend to do better at times of crisis, which is why the more right wing establishments tend to try to convince people that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/12/war-on-terror-corrupting\">crises are ongoing</a>. During peaceful times, people tend to be more resentful at having their individual rights stripped from them when there's no imminent danger to justify this. </p> <p>Even on the minor level , context matters. Ministers trading criticisms of each other's records is usually dismissed as childish name calling. But <a href=\"http://gulfnews.com/news/world/australia/gillard-poll-boost-after-sexism-speech-1.1092609\">Julia Gillard's blistering attack on her opponent's sexism</a> has done her no end of good, politically.</p> <p>There is an extensive<a href=\"http://psgleadership.scripts.mit.edu/2012IAP/pdf/1_required_reading/Scientific views on Leadership.pdf\"> body of research</a> on the social and psychological factors that determine who and what makes a good leader. There are many conflicting theories, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Levels_of_Leadership_model\">one major one</a> mentions the importance of 'presence', that vague but essential quality that makes someone more likely to be obeyed and followed without objection. Exactly how you'd quantify this is anyone's guess.</p> <p>Social psychologist <a href=\"http://www.infed.org/thinkers/robert_freed_bales.htm\">Robert F Bales</a> posited two classes of leaders: task leaders (who excel at initiating and directing behaviour to get a job done) and socio-emotive leaders (who lift spirits and provide psychological well-being to a group). Seeing as politicians need to be elected in order to start directing behaviour and completing the jobs of governing, they invariably fall into the latter category. </p> <p>Whatever you think of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/19/george-osborne-inspector-train-ticket\">George Osborne's fare dodging </a>or <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9619433/Police-probe-Nick-Griffin-Twitter-rant-against-gay-BandB-couple.html\">Nick Griffin's alarming Twitter behaviour</a>, the fact remains that a significant number of people felt comfortable enough with them to elect them into office. Feel free to find this alarming, I know I do.</p> <p>It's worth pointing out that much of the leadership research cited in the literature is from a Western society perspective, and focuses on narrow areas such as business and small groups (both easily accessible to research). So any conclusions made may not be readily applicable to society in general, which is obviously far more complex and chaotic than any one group</p> <p>With so many variables in play, perhaps it is na\u00efve to expect any one politician to be able to effectively control and direct the extensive and ever-changing needs of a society of millions. Even religions recognise this, typically referring to an omnipotent deity who is running things. Monotheistic religions keep it vague with some omnipresent super being, but I prefer the Hindu approach, where they believe the world is run by thousands of gods, with about six arms each. Makes sense, India is a busy place after all.</p> <p>But modern politics essentially asks voters to consider all the potential ramifications of one individual or group of individuals being in charge of a society and all the variables and complications this entails. The human mind is unlikely to be able to do this without years of study in the area, so will inevitably revert to what it knows; deciding according to <a href=\"http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Group_Influence\">group influence</a>, personal ideology, even physical preference like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/oct/18/world-leader-heights-tall\">height</a>, <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/multimedia/player.xml?auto_play=true&amp;section=mm-featured&amp;videopath=/main/news/archive/S21/78/78M51/index.xml\">facial expressions</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wcffoundation.org/pages/research/women-in-politics-statistics.html\">gender</a> . </p> <p>You may argue that the latter isn't such a big deal, that you could probably<a href=\"http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/\"> fill binders </a>with the number of powerful women you can think of, but the sad fact is that positions of authority in numerous fields are still male-dominated. Perhaps men have been in charge for so long that most people see it as the norm now, and assume there must be a logical reason for it? Damned if I know what it is, though.</p> <p>So it's no wonder that, when confronted by a bombardment of facts and data that mean little or nothing about issues they can't really relate to, people will vote according to things they can grasp. Politicians know this, the media know this, which is maybe why so much time and effort is spent on seemingly irrelevant details like photo opportunities and correct phrasing; these are the things many people will relate to, and so could win an election. Ergo, they're not irrelevant after all.</p> <p>If we ever are visited by aliens and they utter the classic request \"Take me to your leader\", I hope they are the patient sort, because that's going to take some working out.</p> <p><em>Dean Burnett prefers to interact with his puny minions via the medium of Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Recent surveys have shown a dwindling in community spirit with more than 70% of people having no contact with their neighbours. The combination of the jubilee celebrations and the Olympics showed a different picture, with 12 million adults taking part in local events and meeting on average five neighbours they didn't know before. This suggests that people are not only willing, but keen to connect with their community when given a reason or opportunity.</p> <p>This community spirit is borne out by the rise in online networks over the last decade with people coming together over a shared interest or issue. From fan fiction sites, such as <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/\">Fan Fiction</a> where people share and get feedback on their stories, to online support groups such as <a href=\"http://www.netbuddy.org.uk/\">Netbuddy</a>, which offers advice for carers of those with disabilities and special needs, people are coming together in their millions to share knowledge and experiences, get support and mobilise action.</p> <p>While one of the characteristics \u2013 and strengths \u2013 of many online networks is that their members can live thousands of miles apart, there is a growing interest in using online networks to bolster physical communities, to address local issues and galvanise local action. Some examples include <a href=\"http://www.streetbank.com/splash\" title=\"\">Streetbank</a> which allows neighbours to share tools, books, DVDs as well as exchange skills; <a href=\"http://www.ecomodo.com\" title=\"\">Ecomodo</a> which supports local lending circles; <a href=\"http://www.fixmystreet.com/\" title=\"\">Fix My Street</a> which encourages people to report and discuss local problems from fly tipping to broken street lighting; <a href=\"http://www.tyze.com/\" title=\"\">Tyze</a> which is creating personal, local online networks to support those requiring home care and <a href=\"http://www.transitionnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">Transition Network </a> which supports and trains communities to come together and reduce CO2 emissions. At <a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Nominet Trust</a>, we are particularly interested in how these and other online networks are tapping into and reorganising resources in local communities, using online to mobilise offline action in the physical world.</p> <p>The rise of online networks, ranging from the global to the hyperlocal, helps us to think differently about what community means in the 21st century. Communities of interest and practice can be created between people living next door or on the other side of the world to each other. The only requirement is shared motivation, a common concern, mutual interest. Already millions of people are creating and using digital technology to come together to help each other and to shape the world around them. They may not always be as visible as the bunting of a jubilee street party but online networks are fostering powerful new forms of community and enabling collaboration for social good on a significant scale.</p> <p><em>Annika Small is chief executive of Social Investor, </em><a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Nominet Trust</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

He seemed to relax when the subject shifted to the economy, education and tax.</p> <p>One of the most vivid moments was when Obama, in a flash of arrogance, patronised his opponent, treating him as if he was a child. Lecturing him on military history after Romney complained the navy had fewer ships, Obama said: \"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\"</p> <p>Will this debate make a difference? Probably not. Although Romney was poor, he was not disastrously bad. And he got across his message that he is not belligerent. Talking about Iran, he said the US \"can't kill our way out of this mess\". That is what a war-weary America wants to hear. An attack on Iran would be a last resort, Romney said. He made peace a central part of his closing speech.</p> <p>Neither Obama or Romney made any serious gaffes or produced any zingers.&#xa0;The first debate in Denver, where Obama was overwhelmed, was a game-changer. But neither this one nor the one in New York have had the same impact or are likely to. The debates in New York and Florida have seen Obama climb back aboard the campaign but his performances have not been strong enough to determine the election outcome.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:54:49.367Z\">at 3.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086042c58f96784ee29093d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:42:53.145Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well that was easily the worst debate of the four we've had.

Nothing also on the EU or the euro-zone crisis, unless you count Mitt Romney's silly claim that America is going to end up like Greece unless he's elected.</p> <p>Anyway, I'd say Romney won it because he just lashed away at Obama without regard to subject or logic, showed that he knew enough about what passes for foreign policy that he's not going to fart in front of the Queen or whatever. And Obama did what he did in the first debate: lay out Romney's multiple positions and expect that would be enough.

Romney got into trouble in the Long Island debate when he got caught up in detail of the Benghazi consulate attack.

He will speak about how al-Qaida is still strong and five weeks after the attack on Benghazi we are still not getting the true story.\"</p> <p>Romney wants to talk about the economy rather than foreign affairs, awkward given the 90 minutes are devoted to foreign affairs.

  "<p>More than two-thirds of people would rather have a wind turbine than a shale gas well near their home, according to a new opinion poll published on Tuesday.</p> <p>Asked to choose between having the two energy sources within two miles of their home, 67% of respondents favoured a turbine, compared to just 11% who would support the gas development.</p> <p>The findings of the UK-wide ICM survey shows that only nuclear power and coal are less popular than shale gas developments.</p> <p>The ICM poll, together with a second new poll from YouGov, show public opinion is against George Osborne's push for a new \"dash for gas\" as the central plank of the government's energy policy.</p> <p>The polls come at a critical time for the government's energy bill, which aims to deliver the \u00a3200bn required to replace and develop the nation's ageing energy infrastructure, due to be published on 5 November. The investment required will be added to household energy bills that are already rising and proving a political headache for David Cameron.</p> <p>\"This [ICM] poll puts to the sword the myth that the public are set against onshore wind and wish to rush into a second dash for gas,\" said Paul Monaghan, head of social goals at the Co-operative, which commissioned the ICM poll for the launch of the Co-op's <a href=\"http://www.uk.coop/energymanifesto\" title=\"\">Manifesto for a community energy revolution</a> which it is backing with \u00a3100m of investment.</p> <p>The poll showed 49% of people would support a wind turbine being erected within two miles of their home, with 22% against. But if the project were community-owned, support rose to 68% and opposition plummeted to 7%. In Germany, where 65% of its huge renewable energy capacity is community-owned, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jun/04/wind-farm-power-opposition\" title=\"\">opposition is much rarer than in UK</a> where community ownership is less than 10%.</p> <p>Onshore windfarms have become an increasingly divisive issue, with 100 backbench Conservative MPs demanding subsidy cuts from Cameron earlier this year. Negotiations over the energy bill have been severely hampered by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/17/energy-policy-coalition-green-agenda\" title=\"\">a feud between Osborne and the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey</a>.</p> <p>But new energy minister and Tory MP, John Hayes, told the Guardian the onshore wind controversy has cast a shadow over the wider energy debate and that it could be resolved by the <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_105/pn12_105.aspx\" title=\"\">current consultation over community benefits from renewable energy projects</a>, which could see local people getting lower bills, for example.</p> <p>\"Appropriately sited onshore wind has a role to play, but if we're to make this work in a way that garners popular support, we've got to see a big improvement in how developers engage with local communities, new ways of ensuring a sense of local ownership and more obvious local economic benefits,\" said Hayes, when launching the consultation.</p> <p>\"The new research demonstrates we need to see a stronger deployment of community-owned projects, especially in those parts of the country where a small, but highly vocal, minority are blocking progress,\" said Monaghan. \"The UK has made massive strides in recent years with its renewables generation capacity, and it's essential this continue.\"</p> <p>In his battle with Davey, Osborne won a commitment to a new gas strategy, also due to be published on 5 November. But the chancellor's enthusiasm for gas is not shared by the public, according to the poll.</p> <p>Natural gas was the most preferred energy source of just 7% of people polled by ICM, behind solar, hydro and offshore wind power, although ahead of onshore windfarms.</p> <p>The YouGov poll showed that 55% of people want more windfarms, compared to just 17% who want more gas power stations. It also showed that less than one in three people thinks the government should give the go-ahead to fracking. RenewableUK's deputy chief exective, Maf Smith, said: \"Support for renewable energy is consistently strong, in this and other independent polls. One stark message from this survey is the public's evident disenchantment with fossil fuels, including the unpopularity of fracking.\"</p> <p>Osborne announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shale-gas-tax\" title=\"\">recently \"generous\" tax breaks for fracking</a> and the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/09/owen-paterson-labour-badger-cull\" title=\"\">pledged to make licensing as simple as possible by setting up a \"one-stop shop\"</a>.</p> <p>Independent experts argue that shale gas may make a small contribution to UK energy supply in a decade or so, but say it will not have the dramatic impact it has in the US. Former energy minister Charles Hendry, sacked in September's reshuffle, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/21/energy-policy-david-cameron-shale-gas\" title=\"\">said on Sunday</a>: \"Our future can't depend on gas alone \u2026 betting the farm on shale brings serious risks of future price rises.\"</p> <p>The energy bill will also attempt to make building new nuclear power stations sufficiently attractive to investors, while attempting to keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/20/coalition-u-turn-nuclear-energy-subsidies\" title=\"\">the coalition's pledge not to subsidise the reactors</a>. But nuclear power remains deeply unpopular with the public, with the poll showing it is by far the least preferred energy source.</p> <p>The poll showed significant differences between younger and older people, with 19% of those over 65 choosing nuclear power as their most preferred energy source compared to 6% of those aged 18 to 34. The over 65s showed far less support for local wind turbines (38%) versus those in the 18-34 age group (64%) and more enthusiasm for local shale gas rather than local wind (19% of over 65s, 10% of 18-34s).</p>",

Go 0-5, go get 'em tomorrow. Blow a save, get 'em tomorrow. Botch a few plays get 'em tomorrow. The San Francisco Giants and St Louis Cardinals have run out of tomorrows, game sevens are far less forgiving. Falter tonight, play golf on Tuesday - there's no get 'em tomorrow.&#xa0;</p> <p>Luckily for these teams, they have their best pitchers on the mound. Kyle Lohse has been insane this season, yet some were&#xa0;surprised&#xa0;when Cards skipper Mike Matheny picked him to start the wild-card game against the Braves. He pitched well, then held the Nats to a run over seven innings in the NLDS, and beat the Giants in Game Three of the NLCS - allowing one run over 5.2 innings of work.</p> <p>Who did he beat? Matt Cain, tonights Giants starter, who allowed three runs in 6.2 innings, taking the loss on the road. Now Cain gets to pitch in front of what should be a rather loud AT&amp;T Park with an entire city behind him. Lohse goes to work in a war zone.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Giants have cleaned up on Cards pitching over the past two games, and St Louis have had no answer for the San Francisco's arms, including a tremendous effort by Ryan Vogelsong on Sunday. They have momentum, and many think the are Cards cooked. Are they? Well, Earl Weaver once said that \"Momentum&#xa0;is the next day's&#xa0;starting pitcher\" and I think Matt Cain hasn't quite been himself lately, while Kyle Lohse has been pitching like someone else all year - an ace.</p> <p>I've got the Cardinals busting out tonight and doing what they do, win games they're not supposed to.

  "<p>If the world could vote on 6 November, Barack Obama would win by a landslide. A global poll for the BBC World Service revealed that 20 out of 21 countries preferred the president to his challenger. But when you watched the presidential debate on foreign policy on Monday night you had to wonder why. Not because Mitt Romney was better, but because on matters of policy, Obama was almost as bad. It takes a friend to reveal the harsh truth to the global community, so here it is: \"Obama's just not that into you.\"</p> <p>No one could love Israel more, care less about the Palestinians, put more pressure on Iran or be a greater fan of drone attacks or invading Libya. Both candidates agreed that America's task was to spread freedom around the world: nobody mentioned Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Abu Ghraib or rendition. \"Governor, you're saying the same things as us, but you'd say them louder,\" said Obama. It was a good line. The trouble was it condemned them both.</p> <p>It was one of many lines Obama delivered that sought not just to correct Romney but belittle him. \"When it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.\"</p> <p>When Romney complained that America had fewer ships in the US navy than in 1916, Obama answered: \"We also have fewer horses and bayonets.\"</p> <p>Obama's task was to cast his opponent as an opportunist out of his depth, not waving at the electorate but drowning before them. Promising to be \"strong and steady not wrong and reckless,\" he painted Romney at every opportunity as a flip-flopper.</p> <p>Romney had a tougher task. With the race tightening and just two weeks to go until polling day, he had to focus the national imagination on the prospect of a President Romney. His problem was that Obama had left no room to the right on foreign policy that would not have left Romney sounding like Herman Cain (who would probably bomb Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan if only he had known where it was).</p> <p>So after a month of shape-shifting, fact-mangling and question-dodging Romney finally morphed into a peacenik. \"But we can't kill our way out of this mess,\" he said, with a plausibility that would have had him booed off stage in a Republican primary.</p> <p>He spoke of promoting peace and democracy as though that had been the idea all along, and America's benevolent instincts had been blown off course by some freak wind. He parried Obama's slights as though they were beneath him. \"Attacking me is not an agenda,\" was one retort. \"I've got a policy for the future,\" was another.</p> <p>But there are only so many times you can shake an Etch A Sketch before its capacity to form an image starts to falter. Romney was less than convincing. And while Obama's put-downs were well-rehearsed, they also worked. He came out on top although it's difficult to imagine he changed any minds or converted any waverers.</p> <p>Both men, when given half a chance, tried to steer the debate back to the central issue in the election \u2013 the economy. Viewers could be forgiven for thinking the answers to issues relating to Iran, Afghanistan, the Middle East, Iraq or China were Obamacare, educational reform, tax rates and loopholes.</p> <p>This was the last set-piece of the campaign. After the primaries, conventions and two previous debates, all that's left now are doors to knock, phones to ring and rallies to attend. On the ground and in the heartland there is still everything to play for. But from the podiums and the spin rooms the campaign has played itself out.</p>",
  "<p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, will announce on Tuesday that the government is delaying its plan to cull thousands of badgers, probably until next year at the earliest, amid growing concern about the cost and effectiveness of the controversial scheme.</p> <p>Paterson has been forced to return from an official trip abroad to oversee the U-turn, which represents another setback for the government. It is the latest in a string of embarrassments for No 10 which culminated in the resignation last week of the chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, for swearing at a police officer \u2013 prompting Conservative party grandee, Lord Tebbit, to lambast David Cameron's operation as a \"dog of a government\".</p> <p>The decision will be welcomed by leading scientists who have expressed severe doubts about whether the cull will work and by animal rights and welfare activists who have continued protesting throughout the long process. The depth of public feeling was also highlighted by a 150,000 e-petition started by the musician Brian May.</p> <p>The shadow environment secretary, Mary Creagh, welcomed the delay. She said: \"We warned the government that this cull was bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife. The badger cull showed how out of touch the government is and this delay shows ministers are too weak and incompetent to deliver it.\"</p> <p>The go-ahead for the controversial badger cull was given by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) nearly a year ago. Farmers believe a cull is essential to stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis which is leading to the slaughter of many of their cattle; opponents claim the main problem is transmission between cattle and that a badger cull could make matters worse because fleeing badgers spread the disease more widely.</p> <p>Last year, 26,000 cattle were slaughtered and the disease cost taxpayers \u00a390m, including compensation to farmers.</p> <p>As the final preparations for the cull were made, a census showed there could be twice as many badgers as were originally thought. Farmers complained this would increase the cost of the cull and they could not afford to foot the bill if required to kill at least 70% \u2013 the proportion that scientists say must be achieved for the cull to succeed because escaping badgers would spread TB more widely and increase, not decrease, cattle infections.</p> <p>Ministers will also have been aware of a tricky week ahead as the emotive issue is scheduled for its first full debate in the House of Commons on Thursday \u2013 with the strong chance of a government defeat \u2013 and a serious legal challenge has been mounted by the charity, the Badger Trust. It filed a \"pre-action\" letter over the weekend, the final step before seeking judicial review, citing costs, public safety around the unmarked cull zones and uncertainty over whether the cull would kill enough badgers to be effective.</p> <p>After reports of tense negotiations over the weekend, Defra is thought to have decided that it could not afford such a risk of failure.</p> <p>Announcing the delay is a blow to the government: ministers, led by the former environment secretary Caroline Spelman, have spent months insisting the cull could work in the face of bitter opposition.</p> <p>The government and especially the prime minister's team in Downing Street are already under fire for a series of U-turns, botched announcements and embarrassments.</p> <p>Along with the drawn-out Mitchell saga, Cameron has created a mess over energy policy, plans for House of Lords reform have fallen apart, a major boundary change is in jeopardy and the chancellor, George Osborne, has had to drop a series of unpopular policies announced in his budget.</p> <p>Paterson has strongly backed a badger cull since he replaced Spelman last month, but is likely to escape the worst of the embarrassment because he is new to the job and will be seen to have acted decisively when the problems emerged.</p> <p>The planned cull had suffered a series of recent blows including the discovery that there were up to twice as many badgers in the culling zones as had been expected. That sharply increased the cost of hiring the marksmen required as they were to be paid a bounty per badger killed.</p> <p>Whitehall sources told the Guardian that spiralling costs and other complications had left farmers wanting to pull out of the cull: \"Paterson and No 10 had to persuade the National Farmers' Union to continue with the cull to avoid another U-turn.\"</p> <p>On Friday, the NFU president, Peter Kendall, said: \"We are working bloody hard to make sure this is deliverable. The latest numbers are making this more challenging.\"</p> <p>The government's claim to a \"science-led\" policy was derided by Lord John Krebs, the architect of a landmark 10-year badger culling trial. He called it \"mindless\" and signed a letter with 31 other eminent scientists demanding the government reconsider its plan.</p>"
