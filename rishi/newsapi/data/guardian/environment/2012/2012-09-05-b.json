  "<p>Turn the clock back three-and-a-half years. It is early 2009 and the world economy is in freefall. The shock waves from the collapse of Lehman Brothers are still reverberating and the economic indicators - trade, industrial production, unemployment - are comparable to the early stages of the Great Depression in the early 1930s.</p> <p>Central banks have slashed interest rates to the bone and finance ministries have allowed budget deficits to widen. Yet policymakers believe more is needed to arrest the slump and so they delve into the history books to come up with something known as quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England decide that they will buy large quantities of bonds from the financial markets to supplement the boost to activity provided by cuts in short-term interest rates.</p> <p>QE is designed to be a double-whammy. Firstly, the price of a bond moves inversely to the yield (interest rate) that it generates. Taking bonds out of the market reduces supply and pushes up the price. The interest rate comes down, making long-term borrowing cheaper for companies and householders with fixed-rate mortgages. Secondly, the institutions that hand over their bonds to the central banks get money in return, and they can use this to buy other assets such as shares. Rising equity prices help to restore business and consumer confidence.</p> <p>In one important respect, QE did the trick, because without it there is no telling what would have happened to the global economy in the winter of 2008-09. By the summer of 2009 there was clear evidence that the decline in output had bottomed out. Fears of a Great Depression 2 were scotched.</p> <p>And yet, QE was supposed to be a temporary measure, with the process reversed once the global economy returned to normal. Far from that happening, central banks kept on buying bonds. The Bank of England is on its fourth round of QE; the Fed is about to embark on its third. Despite an unprecedented stimulus, the global economy is losing momentum.</p> <p>Some argue that the harmful side-effects of QE are partly to blame for this, since the money created by bond buying has led to speculation in commodity markets, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/02/era-of-cheap-food-over\" title=\"\">driving up the price of food and fuel</a>, and hence hitting the spending power of consumers. Others wonder whether QE is now bumping up against the law of diminishing returns, with each round of bond buying less effective than the last. Certainly, if QE does not work soon then more radical measures - such as so-called drops of \"helicopter money\" on to the economy - will be canvassed.</p>",
  "<p>So much for \"the greenest government ever\". When David Cameron made that pledge, just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">days after moving into Number 10</a>, he had a string of commitments he could point to. In the two years since, the former cyclist has furiously backpedalled on those and many others. Jonathan Porrit's admirable <a href=\"http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Sustainable Development Commission</a> has been axed. The much-touted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-investment-bank\" title=\"\">green investment bank</a> will now not be a bank. Forests and woods have been threatened with privatisation. Energy policy has been reduced to flag-waving for nuclear. Perhaps the greenest thing left about the Conservatives is the voters who took their environmental promises seriously.</p> <p>But the most dramatic turn away from environmentalism has come with this week's cabinet reshuffle. First there was the promotion to environment secretary of Owen Patterson: a Conservative who <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=132\" title=\"\">opposes windfarms</a>, loves airports and supports fracking for shale gas (although his website does <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/text.aspx?id=6\" title=\"\">list \"trees\" as an interest</a>). More pressingly, there is the issue of the expansion of Heathrow. Justine Greening, who was just last month vehemently defending the government's official opposition to a third runway, has been moved from the transport brief; her replacement, Patrick McLoughlin, will start talks on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/cross-party-heathrow-airport-talks\" title=\"\">a cross-party commission reopening the subject</a>. To cap it all, the prime minister has refused to make it clear that he will oppose a third runway beyond this parliament. We may thus assume that the way is being cleared for the aeronautical equivalent of the U-turn manoeuvre.</p> <p>However appalling this may be, it should not be a surprise. Even the most lackadaisical student of this government can tell you that <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf\" title=\"\">the coalition agreement</a> states baldly: \"We will cancel the third runway at Heathrow. We will refuse permission for additional runways at Gatwick and Stansted.\" What they omit to mention is just where those policy commitments are made: not in the sections on transport or economic policy but under climate change. Like a lot of this government's green commitments, this one was never synthesised with its economic ideology: it was, from the outset, just so much garnish. Nick Clegg might well believe that \"going green has never made so much sense\"; but George Osborne is certainly closer to Tory convictions when he argues against \"saving the planet by putting our country out of business\".</p> <p>This does not disguise the speciousness of the economic arguments for a third runway at Heathrow. Even if the cabinet gave the green light tomorrow, the project would not create a significant number of new jobs for years to come. That goes double for Boris Johnson's dream of a new airport on an island in the Thames estuary. However hard the right may argue for more airports as an immediate economic boost, it is no such thing. The argument that Britain will be crippled by somehow stunting Heathrow is also disingenuous: as if the perpetual expansion of what is already the world's largest airport will somehow magically add points to GDP growth.</p> <p>The case for Heathrow has always been less about the arguments than the lobby behind it: big business and the aviation industry. The concessions BAA and others typically offer are not worth much. A few years ago, they claimed that a snazzy Terminal 5 would put an end to all talk of new runways. We can take just as seriously the current promises to limit the planes taking off from any new runway.</p> <p>But the policy arguments are likely to be rehearsed all over again in the next few months and years. The significance of this week lies in the politics. Mr Cameron has signalled that even if it means losing an able transport secretary in Ms Greening; even if it means Tory environmentalist Zac Goldsmith <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9518329/MP-threatens-by-election-over-Heathrow.html\" title=\"\">forcing a by-election</a>, he appears minded to support a policy he previously fought hard.</p> <p>Lib Dems such as climate secretary Ed Davey, party president Tim Farron and deputy leader Simon Hughes must surely be dismayed by this U-turn. They owe it to themselves and to all of us to give voice to that dismay.</p>",
  "<p>The powerhouse of the government, the Treasury, is without a female minister for the first time in at least 16 years, as it deals with the biggest economic recession since the second world war.</p> <p>The decision to move the economic secretary, Chloe Smith, to international development and appoint a raft of new men to the ministerial team under George Osborne was strongly criticised on Wednesday night by the shadow leader of the house and former Treasury minister Angela Eagle.</p> <p>\"If there's no female minister there, there's very little chance of women's perspectives on spending being taken account of,\" said Eagle. \"Public spending is so skewed towards matters that are really important to women that having a woman at the Treasury to make those points where there's the most power in government is really important.\"</p> <p>David Cameron continued his reshuffle on Wednesday, with six appointments to the cabinet and four sackings, and appointing a group of ministers below cabinet level.</p> <p>In total 29 ministers were sacked or asked to return to the frontbenches in the reshuffle. Sir George Young, who lost his job as Leader of the House, is to be made a Companion of Honour while other departing ministers \u2013 James Paice, Edward Garnier, Nick Harvey and Gerald Howarth \u2013 will receive knighthoods. <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/09/how-cameron-made-ministers-cry/\" title=\"\">The Spectator reports</a> on Thursday that three of the demoted ministers cried when they were told the news. Lady Warsi, pictured, was reported to be so cross about being stripped of the party chairmanship that she went home to Yorkshire and carried on negotiations from there.</p> <p>The influx of at least 14 of the 2010 intake of MPs, including four women and two non-white MPs as junior ministers \u2013 Sajid Javid and Helen Grant \u2013 will go some way to addressing concerns that both groups in the cabinet had become less represented.</p> <p>Cameron also appointed a black MP, Sam Gyimah, his parliamentary private secretary; and more women were moved into the whips office by both parties. The Liberal Democrat's promoted two women ministers.</p> <p>The new ministers with responsibilities for the environment \u2013 Nick Boles to planning and John Hayes to energy \u2013 added to concerns the new government would take an even less green line on key policies: Boles called the National Trust \"latter-day Luddites\" for objecting to building on greenbelt land; and Hayes has a deep concern about wind energy.</p> <p>A Lib Dem source vowed they would not let the new appointments change the government's course, pointing out that policies on energy and climate change were detailed in the coalition agreement and set in law. The source said: \"We have got the coalition agreement and legally binding targets and while we are in government those two things stand.\"</p> <p>Other appointments that raised eyebrows were Greg Knight's move to the whips office, despite having rebelled eight times in two years; and former Labour deputy leader John Prescott claimed on Twitter that the new team under education secretary Michael Gove was \"86%\" educated at private school \u2013 while Gove went to a state school before winning a scholarship to an independent private school.</p> <p>The promotion of Jo Johnson, one of the 2010 intake, from a PPS to the whips office was also welcomed as an astute move: the MP is the brother of London mayor Boris Johnson, who is increasingly the biggest thorn in the side of the prime minister, and has claimed much airtime over the last two days with his strident opposition to the government's apparent move towards a U-turn on its pledge not to expand Heathrow.</p> <p>Another late announcement was the promotion of Hugh Robertson \u2013 credited with much of the success of the government's handling of the Olympics and Paralympics \u2013 from a junior to a middle-ranking role at the department for culture, media and sport. Lord Ashcroft, who in the past has donated millions of pounds to the party, was appointed veterans' tsar.</p> <p>Despite the promotion of new women, the ministerial line-up was still dominated by men: there are five women out of 31 attending cabinet and, by late afternoon on Wednesday, eight women out of the 44 newly appointed ministers, resulting in fewer than one-in-six women in government. In fewer than three years, Cameron has said the number should be one-third.</p> <p>With the enlarged cabinet having tilted the bias slightly to the south, the picture continues lower down in government, where 13 MPs represent constituencies in the north and Wales (approximately Birmingham and above on the map), compared to 29 with seats in the south.</p> <h2>Appointed on Wednesday</h2> <p><strong>Tom Brake</strong></p> <p>Deputy leader of the House</p> <p><strong>Hugh Robertson </strong></p> <p>Minister of state in culture department</p> <p><strong>Lady Randerson </strong></p> <p>Junior minister in the Wales Office</p> <p><strong>Don Foster </strong> Junior minister for local government</p> <p><strong>Mark Simmonds</strong> Junior minister in the Foreign Office</p> <p><strong>Lynne Featherstone</strong> Junior minister in the Department for International Development</p> <p><strong>Brandon Lewis</strong> Junior minister for local government</p> <p><strong>Jo Swinson </strong> Junior minister in business department</p> <p><strong>Lord Marland</strong> Junior minister in business department</p> <p><strong>Andrew Murrison</strong> Junior defence minister</p> <p><strong>Edward Timpson </strong> Junior minister in Department for Education</p> <p><strong>Stephen Crabb</strong> Lord commissioner in the Treasury and junior minister in the Wales Office</p> <p><strong>Nick Boles</strong> Junior minister for planning</p> <p><strong>Greg Knight, Jo Johnson, Nicky Morgan</strong> and <strong>Desmond Swayne</strong> were appointed government whips</p>",
  "<p>Poor Paul Ryan. Ever since <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7419860n\">his speech at the Republican National Convention last week</a>, the GOP vice-presidential nominee has been accused of telling Big Lies. From <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/opinion/Krugman.html\">Paul Krugman of the New York Times</a>, to <a href=\"http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/08/30/krichert/paul_ryans_big_lie_omission\">Kevin Richert of the Idaho Statesman</a>, to <a href=\"http://downwithtyranny.blogspot.com/\">DownWithTyranny.blogspot.com</a>, commentators have piled onto Ryan for his mendacity. FoxNews.com contributor Sally Kohn described his performance as \"an apparent attempt to set the world record for the greatest number of blatant lies and misrepresentations slipped into a single political speech.\"</p> <p>But let us be cautious about our allegations. We are, after all, talking about a man's reputation.</p> <p>First of all, nobody keeps records of political lies, as computer memory is not equal to that task. Second, to paraphrase the unimpeachable Bill Clinton, it depends on what a lie is.</p> <p>Everyone understands that there are lies, white lies and Big Lies. A lie is, \"No, I am not sleeping with my yoga instructor.\" A white lie is, \"Your baby is just so beautiful!\" The two biggest Big Lies of modern times are \"the Jews are destroying you\" and \"global warming is an invention of the left.\" Plus, maybe, \"Lose weight without diet and exercise.\"</p> <p>Big Lies are hard to get going, requiring as they do obvious falsity, almost unimaginable ruthlessness and a premise so enticing to masses of bigots and fools that they eagerly suspend reason and disbelief. Many conspiracy theories aspire to the Big Lie, but they can't get traction \u2013 because when you start alleging that Bush blew up the twin towers, even morons think you're a nut job.</p> <p>And vice versa.</p> <p>So, no, Paul Ryan told no Big Lies. What he told, in quick succession, was an astonishing number of Medium Lies.</p> <p>The Medium Lie has all the characteristics of the Big Lie \u2013 a shocking allegation, inherent pandering to bigotry and self-evident untruth \u2013 but lacks the high stakes and therefore tends to be more ephemeral. The Medium Lies of 2012 will be mainly forgotten in 2013.</p> <p>No, Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2011/may/25/kathy-hochul-republicans-medicare\">has no intention of \"gutting Medicare\", as Republicans have alleged</a>. But by spring, there will be other fish to fry \u2013 just as Massachusetts prison furloughs slipped out of the public consciousness shortly after <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/02/13/120213fa_fact_mayer\">Willie Horton got George HW Bush elected</a>.</p> <p>Once again, I don't want to sell Paul Ryan short. His command of the Medium Lie is indeed breathtaking. His anecdote about the Janesville, Wisconsin factory that candidate Barack Obama promised to save, but which <em>President</em> Obama let fail had a certain magnificence to it \u2013 because Obama never did promise to save the factory, and because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/paul-ryans-speech-audacious-untruths\">he wasn't yet president when it closed down</a>.</p> <p>Ryan may not win his race, but he sure hit the Daily Double. He also quickened my heart when he attacked the president for discarding the recommendations of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.</p> <p>\"He created a bipartisan debt commission,\" Ryan declared. \"They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way and then did exactly nothing.\"</p> <p>Oh, snap! What a powerful anecdote \u2013 one that gets even more powerful when you know that Ryan was a commission member whose deciding vote <em>against</em> the report <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/aug/30/ryan-and-simpson-bowles-commission-full-story/\">prevented it from being presented to Congress</a>. Or that the president's attempt at a \"grand bargain\" with House Republicans exceeded the commission's recommendations for spending cuts.</p> <p>Not to say that only Republicans trade in the Medium Lie. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/14/swiftboating-mitt-romney-disgraces-barack-obama\">As noted in this space previously</a>, Obama's proxies at the Priorities USA Action Super Pac all but accused Republican nominee Mitt Romney of murder in the cancer death of a woman whose husband lost his job at a Bain Capital-shuttered steel mill, and with it his family healthcare coverage. What the Medium Liars never mention is that the woman had her own health insurance and was not diagnosed with cancer until 5 years later. So Romney has no blood on his hands. And when the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/08/team-obama-says-they-dont-story-of-man-who-stars-of-131462.html\">Obama campaign claimed to have had no knowledge</a> of the Super Pac's activities, <a href=\"http://newmediajournal.us/indx.php/item/6402\">they were lying about that, too</a>.</p> <p>But let us not bend over too far backwards here. Yes, Democrats have been caught in many a lie, but the current GOP presidential campaign is the proverbial tissue of Medium Lies: that Obama plans to gut Medicare; that federal bureaucrats will make healthcare decisions for patients under \"Obamacare\"; that the administration's seeks to remove the work requirement from \"welfare to work\" policies and plenty more.</p> <p>Luckily, we have the media to protect us. For so long, cowed by charges of liberal bias, the US press declined to be arbiters of truth. News organizations simply transcribed each lie and balanced it with the protests of the opposing party, leaving it to the public to evaluate truth or falsity. Such craven neutrality, of course, served nothing but to politicize reality \u2013 as if the truth of all assertions was merely a question of viewpoint. As such, facts and lies both came to be seen as political spin \u2013 which is why approximately half the US electorate believes that manmade global climate change is a boogeyman invented by leftwingers.</p> <p>Now, of course, many news organizations have fact checkers who vet speeches, ads, soundbites and online videos for veracity. They actually do a marvelous job of providing context for political claims, especially to show how during <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/30/paul-ryan-fact-checking-media_n_1844085.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular\">the \"opposition research\" process a nominal fact can be twisted into naked prevarication</a>. Good for them.</p> <p>But then, having finally fulfilled their basic function as gatekeepers, they immediately denature their own efforts by softening language to the consistency of boiled linguine. There is no talk of lies White, Big or Medium. The words employed are \"misleading\", \"deceptive\", \"mostly false\". If you are discovered, as Ryan was, spewing unadulterated bullshit, the penalty will be four Pinocchios, or the designation \"Pants on Fire\".</p> <p>Because, I suppose, Fibberific is just too hard-edged.</p> <p>So yes, politicians are ever more emboldened to just invent whatever outrages they need to agitate the base. A few Pinocchios will not slow them down. On the contrary, as a Romney-Ryan pollster put it, \"We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact checkers.\"</p> <p>Or, this time to paraphrase Marshall McLuhan, the Medium Lie is the message.</p>",

  "<p>The world has been in financial crisis since 2008 and I have always wondered why no really drastic measures (such as splitting retail from investment banking or introducing a financial transaction tax) have been taken to rein in the banks and finance industry (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/osborne-failed-battle-for-alternative?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Osborne's failed</a>, Comment, 5 September). My confusion was resolved when I went on an extremely informative \"lobby walk\" around the EU district in Brussels, organised by <a href=\"http://www.lobbycontrol.de/blog/index.php/about-us-english/\" title=\"\">LobbyControl</a>, which works with the <a href=\"http://www.corporateeurope.org/\" title=\"\">Corporate European Observatory</a>. We stopped outside various locations to hear how powerful lobby groups use a raft of techniques to manipulate the laws that are drafted and passed in Brussels. Since the signing of the Lisbon treaty, Brussels has become so central to law-making that lobbyists have swarmed in great numbers.</p> <p>As for the finance lobby, it ranges from individual banks (such as Deutsche Bank), through various agencies, associations and groupings (eg International Swaps and Derivatives Association), to bodies that are directly incorporated into EU governmental structures (eg the European Parliamentary Financial Services Forum). Each of these well-financed players works to put intense pressure on EU officials to reject regulation and to create the most favourable conditions possible for their interests. It is therefore not surprising that no effective regulatory measures have been imposed on the banking sector despite the ever more serious nature of the crisis.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br><em>Cologne, Germany</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008\"The aviation industry has mounted the most expensive US-style lobby ever witnessed in the UK,\" writes John McDonnell MP (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/27/resist-lobby-third-runway-heathrow?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 28 August).

It is now impossible to retain such a view: a man is promoted to major office \"because of his communication skills\"; a successful transport minister is moved because she sticks to her party's manifesto; a man who resigned in connection with his expenses returns to government; a man known not to believe in climate change becomes environment secretary\u2026. <br><strong>Chris Hunt</strong><br><em>Cannock, Staffordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The former energy minister Charles Hendry, though faulty on his support for new nuclear reactors, was an enthusiastic supporter of renewable energy and engaged reasonably with environmental groups.

The new environment secretary, Owen Patterson, is similarly opposed to onshore wind energy, , and strongly endorsed by arch climate change sceptic Nigel Lawson, and Lord Deighton has been enobled to try and force through new nuclear reactors that will cost the taxpayer dear.

  "<p>The Obama campaign will be hoping to capture a bit of political magic when Bill Clinton makes his <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/05/usa-campaign-clinton-idUSL2E8K4EQY20120905\">keynote speech to the Democratic national convention</a> in Charlotte. Clinton can evoke an era of prosperity that seems like a distant dream in today's bedraggled economy.</p> <p>Apart from his powerful abilities as a speaker and advocate for the independent voters the Obama team need to win over, as president Clinton presided over eight years of strong economic growth, alongside falling unemployment, 21 million jobs added and an almost miraculous bull market in stocks and house prices. US manufacturing staged a recovery. Personal incomes rose dramatically. For those reasons his time in the White House is remembered with a rosy glow, rather than for his affair with an intern and his subsequent legal contortions.</p> <p>It's worth remembering, though, when Clinton takes the stage at the DNC in Charlotte, that he was also extraordinarily lucky \u2013 and lucky in a way that Barack Obama has not been.</p> <p>Clinton's 1992 election victory itself was rather lucky, a combination of a retrospectively mild economic downturn, an uninspiring incumbent, GOP voter fatigue and \u2013 perhaps more than anything else \u2013 the insurgent third party candidacy of Ross Perot. Having said that, Clinton also made his own luck on the campaign trail, especially in the Democratic primaries when he was dogged by evidence of extramarital affairs.</p> <p>Once in office he benefited from a golden business cycle and the rising economic tide it brought with it. That buoyancy enabled him to strike deals on raising taxes and reforming welfare without suffering the fallout that usually attends. Economic growth spurred years of bumper tax receipts, allowing the federal government to turn back time and pay off its debts. And the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan nodded its approval with long periods of generous monetary policy.</p> <p>He also was lucky in another respect: the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and collapse of the Warsaw Pact ushered in a peace dividend unheard of the end of the Vietnam war, enabling the US to trim its enormous military budget. His predecessor George HW Bush had vanquished Saddam Hussain in the first Gulf War, so that even the Middle East was relatively quiescent for most of Clinton's reign. Oil prices fell and remained low.</p> <p>Domestically, he benefitted from demographic good fortune. A baby boomer himself, Clinton's time in office saw his generation enjoy their years of maximum earning potential. In 1996 \u2013 the middle of Clinton's time in office \u2013 the eldest of the baby boom generation hit 50 years old while the youngest were 32. By 2012, that aging demographic bulge is reaching retirement age of 65.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the emerging economies of Asia were entering the global marketplace. China's economic reforms were resulting in cheaper imports and new markets for the US, but before the spurt of growth that has since catapulted China into a global rival.</p> <p>Then there was technology. The internet arrived and transformed computers from office equipment into domestic appliances. The dotcom boom of the later 1990s became a breathtaking global bubble, fed by Greenspan's low interest rates and Panglossian optimism. It burst almost as spectacularly \u2013 but Bill Clinton's luck meant that happened as his presidency ended.</p> <p>Clinton's eight years in office weren't entirely without incident, even aside from Monica Lewinsky. He did face some difficult economic decisions. But in each case, the resilient growth and bumper surpluses of the US economy gave him leeway that Barack Obama has never been afforded.</p> <p>In 1994, Mexico suffered jarring currency turmoil \u2013 nicknamed the \"Tequila crisis\" \u2013 the details of which need not concern us. But Clinton and his Treasury secretary Robert Rubin battled through congressional opposition to give Mexico $50bn in assistance, enough for the peso to weather the crisis. The US government even made a $500m profit on the loans, which were repaid.</p> <p>In 1997 there was a far more dramatic series of events, starting with the Asian financial crisis that saw the \"Asian Tigers\" endure a crash of great severity, with knock-on international consequences. Russia defaulted on its debts and the collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund caused a credit crunch similar to that seen in 2008. But the underlying strength of the US economy and ever-looser monetary policy via Greenspan saw the crisis contained.</p> <p>And there were wars, most notably in the former Yugoslavia, and ill-fated interventions in Somalia. But nothing on the scale of those launched after 9/11 and inherited by Obama. </p> <p>Of course, luck isn't everything. Although it would have been difficult in the circumstances, Clinton could always have made things worse through policy errors. It's worth remembering that economic inequality rose alongside incomes, while the property boom and easy credit that many enjoyed would blow up a decade later. The Clinton-era financial deregulation would also come back to haunt America. But those consequences were well in the future when Clinton left office.</p> <p>It's also worth remembering that the golden years weren't enough to give Clinton's vice president Al Gore the White House in 2000 (although Florida's voting processes and the Supreme Court probably robbed Gore of a narrow victory). But Clinton is more popular with voters now than his last months in office \u2013 and Obama will be hoping that memories of the good times rub off on his campaign tonight. But what Obama really needs is some of Clinton's luck.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> I was ripped from my sleep at 7.27am this morning. Not sure why my alarm setting was so precise but there you go. It was a decent sleep, just under eight hours with only a couple of brief interruptions. My eyemask slipped off again; that always seems to happen. I'm not entirely sure what I dreamt about, but I think an ex and a Diesel shop were involved. Not diesel as in petrol; I wouldn't have used a capital letter had that been the case. I had some toast for breakfast (dry; I must remember to add Marmite to the list of things I must remember to buy) and then finished some work. I started to watch Clueless but got restless after 10 minutes so I replied to some emails before coming into the office.</p> <p>As those of you who have got this far without switching over to The Competition would surely concur, talking about No1 has a limited appeal. It's a lesson us cricket types should remember. Since England became inexplicably useful in all three formats of the game, every match has been framed in the context of being No1. When England hammered South Africa on Sunday, it was suggested by a few people that today's fifth and final ODI barely mattered because England would remain top of the rankings until the near year regardless of the result.</p> <p>In the parlance of our time, sod that! There is a series to be won here. England lead 2-1, and if they win/tie/no result today's match they will have won eight consecutive ODI series at home for the first time ever. The rankings are emphatically a good thing, but it's time we got back to the humble, self-contained joy of winning matches and winning series. Then \u2013 30 points in cricketclichebingo \u2013 the rankings will take care of themselves.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>England have won the toss and will bat first</strong></p> <p><strong>England</strong> Cook (capt), Bell, Bopara, Bairstow, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Woakes, Tredwell, Anderson, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Smith, Amla, Elgar, de Villiers (capt/wk), Duminy, du Plessis, Ontong, Parnell, Peterson, Steyn, M Morkel.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>You. Have. Mail.</strong> We know that the internet has pretty much killed society, exposing the narcissistic sociopath in us all. But once upon a time it was a sweet, innocent thing, <a href=\"http://yfrog.com/mmc1ejsj\">as this amusing report from 1992 shows</a>. (The headline is a fake, apparently, but the rest is the real thing.)</p> <p>What are your early memories of the internet? I remember <strike> the puce-faced horror of being caught by mother </strike> the phrase \"information superhighway\", and 'watching' Ian Healy hit a momentous series-winning six at Port Elizabeth on some newish website called 'Cricinfo'.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 5-0 (Cook 4, Bell 0)</strong> Dale Steyn's first ball of the match swings dangerously back in to Alastair Cook. This is Trent Bridge, after all. The third ball also shapes back in but Cook times it sweetly down the ground for four. An off-side wide completes the scoring for the over.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 10-0 (Cook 8, Bell 1)</strong> The left-arm spinner Robin Peterson is going to open the bowling. Bell takes a single from the first ball and then Cook sweeps round the corner for four.</p> <p>\"My mind has wandered this lunchtime,\" says Peter Harmer, \"and I'm wondering, if you were only allowed to pick players whose surname began with one letter, which letter would you chose.\" That's a great question. Off the top of my head I'd go for H (Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond, Hadlee, Holding) or W (Waugh, Waugh, Warne, Weekes, Worrell, Walcott, plus Wasim and Waqar if you're allowed them as Ws).</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 19-0 (Cook 12, Bell 6)</strong> Steyn's first ball is too straight and eased off the pads for four by Ian Bell. A similarly errant delivery later in the over is pinged to the midwicket boundary by Cook. A fine start for England. In other news, here's your daily statgasm. If England win today they will set a new record for win/loss ratio in ODIs during one calendar year: they would have won 13 and lost one. Not just that, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;orderby=win_loss_ratio;template=results;type=team;view=year\">their current win/loss ratio of 12 is almost double the next best.</a> England 2012: the greatest one-day team ever. End of and fact.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 23-1 (Bell LBW b Peterson 10)</strong> Bell, who is always so light on his feet against the spinners, Travoltas back in his crease to late cut Peterson for another boundary. And now he's gone! He played defensively outside the line of a delivery that went straight on from around the wicket and was given out LBW by Kumar Dharmasena. He's going to review it. I suppose there's a slight chance he got outside the line but I reckon this decision will be upheld. He's out! There wasn't even an 'umpire's call'. It hit him in line and would have hit leg stump four-fifths of the way up.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 23-1 (Cook 12, Bopara 0)</strong> Demon seamer Ravi Bopara has been promoted to No3. What a strange place he's in. Two months ago he seemed to have finally cracked it when he slapped Australia to all parts; now he can't buy a run.</p> <p>\"My first internet memory is of gathering round an acorn computer at school and slowly watching as the current weather was downloaded through the phonelines,\" says James Grinnell. \"It took 20 mins and looked like a particularly unartistic four-year-old had drawn a weather map that vaguely resembled the uk. We thought it was amazing obviously.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 24-2 (Bopara c de Villiers b Steyn 0)</strong> A golden duck for Ravi Bopara. He felt outside off stump at a good delivery from Dale Steyn and edged a straightforward catch to AB de Villiers. There was a sad inevitability to Bopara failing, although I'm not sure anyone expected a first-baller. He looks shot to bits mentally, almost as bad as Mark Ramprakash back in 1995.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 24-2 (Cook 12, Bairstow 0)</strong> Jonny Bairstow is beaten second ball by a storming delivery. Steyn appealed on his own for the caught behind but there was nothing in it. The next ball goes past the edge as well to complete a sensational over.</p> <p>\"My early internet memories include all the hype about 'working from home',\" says Dr Ian Hawke. \"Which brings the question: why do you go into the office to OBO from one screen to another? Is it the great office company, or your love of public transport?\" I love my colleagues dearly, and it's got nothing to do with the fact we can't use the OBO publishing system from home. Nothing at all.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 30-2 (Cook 14, Bairstow 4)</strong> Morne Morkel replaces Robin Peterson. Bairstow crunches him classily through midwicket for four. \"Does the fact that the Sun article was written by Dot Comme,\" begins Simon Pennington, \"and the 'riddle of 'E' mail' is also referenced at the end suggest this might have been an April 1 story?\" I've been had. I'm King Patsy. I've been played for a fool again, and this time there wasn't even a kooky broad with a love of geek pop involved. Darn it. Still, it's a decent excuse for us to reminisce about when the internet was good, eh? Eh?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 30-2 (Cook 14, Bairstow 4)</strong> Steyn is bowling straight and trying to shape it back into Cook, who is vulnerable to that angle of attack. After five balls on the stumps, he angles one across Cook and past the outside edge. A maiden.</p> <p>\"Well, the H-team (Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond, Headley, Harvey, Hill, Hadlee, Healy, Holding, Hall, Harbhajan (if he's allowed)) has probably the greatest batting line up,\" says Josh Robinson, \"and Clive Lloyd's side (Lawry, Langer, Lara, Leyland, Lloyd, Lindsay, Lindwall, Larwood, Laker, Lohmann, Lillee) has a fantastic attack, but I'd like to go out on a limb and say that this is perhaps the strongest of the lot: Hanif Mohammad, Arthur Morris, Phil Mead, Javed Miandad (c), Stan McCabe, Keith Miller, Rod Marsh, Malcolm Marshall, Ted McDonald, Muttiah Muralitharan, Glenn McGrath (arguably with Mushtaq Mohammad coming in for Marsh). It could be that I'm not old enough to have seen many of the greats, but I find it hard to argue with any side containing Marshall, McGrath and Murali.\" And Keith Miller first change. That's an awesome team. Then again, Larwood, Lillee and Lohmann...</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 39-2 (Cook 18, Bairstow 9)</strong> After 12 consecutive dot balls, Bairstow cuts Morkel crisply for four. It's a good over for England in fact, with nine from it when Cook pulls the last ball handsomely over midwicket for four. </p> <p>\"I first started using e-mail and the internet at university \u2013 this inevitably involved a 10-minute walk late in the evening from my dorm to the school's computer lab, sending a few e-mails and then popping in <a href=\"http://www.retrocpu.com/dos/games/0-9/1-0_soccer_manager\">a copy of One-Nil</a> into the floppy disk drive and staying up into the wee hours, watching Luc Nilis bang goals in for fun at the head of my strike force,\" says Darren Kilfara. \"What a game that was\u2026never mind that said floppy disk became infected by a prototypical virus which ultimately wiped out at least one of my family's PCs back at home. Totally worth it.\" And to think some people leave university with regrets.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 41-2 (Cook 19, Bairstow 10)</strong> Bairstow is put down by de Villiers, although it was an exceptionally difficult chance. He inside edged a sharp delivery from Steyn, which meant de Villiers had to change direction and then try to get his left hand down to take the ball at instep height. He got down in time but couldn't hang on. As Sir Ian Botham says on Sky, we should really probably him with saving four runs rather than putting it down as a dropped catch.</p> <p>\"That team of Ms is pretty good,\" says Rob Lee-Davey, \"but someone is going to have to make way for McCague.\" Especially if they have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McCague\">team-bonding trips to Dublin</a>.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 42-2 (Cook 20, Bairstow 10)</strong> \"The B side is pretty good too,\" says Steve Hudson. \"The B side is pretty good too: Boycott, Sid Barnes, Bradman, Barrington, Border, Botham, Benaud (capt), Bedser, SF Barnes, Bishop, Bedi.\" And Colin Bland as 12th man.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 48-2 (Cook 25, Bairstow 11)</strong> Cook tries to cut the new bowler Parnell, but it's a bit too full for the shot and he bottom edges it on the bounce to de Villiers. He nails the shot later in the over, however, savaging Parnell for four. </p> <p>\"I was first aware of people actually using the internet in my sixth form at school (93/94),\" says Tim Davis. \"The small band of computer literate <strike> geeks </strike> fellow students back in those days would use the school computers in the library to email each other at lunchtime. 'But\u2026 why not just talk to each other?' I'd cry, somewhat mockingly. They're probably all happily married, rich, successful businessmen now. Whereas I'm still enduring the puce-faced horror of being caught by mother\u2026\" Was the web widely available in 1993-94? Crikey. When I recall the Borden Grammar School sixth form of 1993-94, the only W that springs to mind rhymes with ledgies.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 48-2 (Cook 25, Bairstow 12)</strong> The left-arm spinner Dean Elgar is on for Morkel. His fourth ball is a dipping full toss that Bairstow fails to put away, and there's just a single from the over. Cook has 25 from 32, Bairstow 12 from 27.</p> <p>\"My earliest memory of the Internet is the moment I finally had access, via my Dad's work laptop, an suddenly realising I had no idea what I wanted to read,\" says Brad McMillian. \"The term 'surfing the net' was in use by that time, and had conjured in my mind the idea that I would simply be taken on a random voyage of exciting discovery as soon as I logged on. Fifteen-plus years later I still have no idea what I want to read/discover, so I simply stick to what I used to rely on newspapers and magazines for: news and sport etc and so on...\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 53-2 (Cook 26, Bairstow 13)</strong> Parnell shrieks for LBW against Bairstow, who walked across his stumps. That looked pretty close but there were doubts over where it pitched and perhaps height. Hawkeye shows it did pitch fractionally outside leg. Everything else is bunkum.</p> <p>\"Barrington?\" says Alex Netherton. \"Does he means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/21/golf.theopen200711?INTCMP=SRCH\">Barrington 'Biscuits' Barrington</a> (see 5pm)?\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 60-2 (Cook 28, Bairstow 17)</strong> Bairstow gives Elgar the charge and drags an inside edge for a single. Later in the over he premeditates a lap for a couple \u2013 and then Elgar bowls a big front-foot no-ball. That's criminal, especially when the punishment is a free hit, although he redeems himself with an excellent curving yorker that Bairstow can only block. Seven from the over.</p> <p>In other news, who wants to help an OBOette in distress? \"Perhaps somebody can help we find a game called 'Money, Money, Money' that I played on my grandfather's Vic-20 in 1981 or thereabouts,\" says Sara Torvalds. \"There are Commodore 64 games you can buy, but I've yet to see any of the really crude stuff for the Vic-20 available anywhere. Anyone? It was a stick man that you had to guide across the screen, avoiding asterisk 'snow flakes' while fetching a 'bag' of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 money and getting back safely.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 63-2 (Cook 30, Bairstow 18)</strong> Parnell continues to feed Cook's cut, which on the Dunderhead Scale is right up there with informing Francis Begbie that's he the epitome of androgyny \u2013 but this time he rifles it straight to a fielder. Three from the over.</p> <p>\"My earliest memory of the internet is on the day that I got my A-level results,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"My Dad was a university lecturer at the time and had an early version of email with which he was able to contact my preferred university - some place in Staffordshire - to check I had got in. This was after he rang me at work with my results and got them wrong.\" The internet existed in the 1960s? Honk! Ho-honk! Come on, honk with me now.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 69-2 (Cook 31, Bairstow 22)</strong> South Africa take their bowling Powerplay at the first opportunity and give the ball to Robin Peterson. He concedes just one from the first five deliveries; then, with fine leg and square leg up, Bairstow sweeps between the two men for four.</p> <p>\"My highlight of the summer?\" says Luke Dealtry. \"Thanks for asking. I think it's the celebration unveiled by Ravi in the last few ODIs where he offers a strong-armed handshake just above waist height to whomsoever is nearest; none of this hugging or whooping rubbish. Think it'll ever catch on? I hear he's going for cotton slacks, a button-up shirt and a neckerchief if he plays in India.\" <br>Great point. Has there ever been a more chappish gesture on a cricket field <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-south-africa-2012/content/image/580423.html\">than the Bopara handshake</a>?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 73-2 (Cook 32, Bairstow 24)</strong> Morne Morkel is wided for a leg-side short ball to Bairstow. Four from the over. \"Steve Hudson's 'B' team looks very strong but would lose every game due to the number of byes it concedes,\" says Martin Duckworth. \"So may I suggest a 'Keeper, namely Boucher? And tell SF Barnes he's on the twos this week.\" You can have that pleasure. (And then reinstate him ahead of Ian Bishop.)</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 75-2 (Cook 34, Bairstow 25)</strong> Peterson puts down Cook, a very sharp return chance as he dived low to his left. He took a similar but probably more difficult chance to dismiss Ian Bell (I think) in the World Cup last year. He didn't close his hands at the right time which suggests he might have thought it was a bump ball.</p> <p>\"I was going to regale you with tales of meeting up with like-minded Star Trek: Deep Space Nine fans in 1995 thanks to the internet while everyone else in the country was making out to Lush B-sides, but instead you may want to take a peek at Ravi Bopara's wiki page,\" says my colleague James Walsh. \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bopara\">It's got a lot more duck-related lately</a>.\" It's really sad. He was in fantastic form before his personal problems. How many setbacks can a bloke cope with before he decides some things just aren't meant to be?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 79-3 (Bairstow c Ontong b Morkel 29)</strong> Bairstow has flicked Morne Morkel straight to deep midwicket. He seemed to time it extremely well, and I thought it was clearing the ropes, but in fact he pinged it straight to Justin Ontong. He was aiming towards square leg rather than midwicket. That's a frustrating dismissal because he was looking good and had swivel-pulled the previous delivery superbly for four.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 79-3 (Cook 34, Morgan 0)</strong> Stop whatever you're doing and acquaint yourself with the F5 button: the new batsman is the in-form Eoin Morgan.</p> <p>\"What is a good score on this pitch?\" says Andrew Hurley. \"270? Strange Finn is not playing, for all that I think it's good to finally see Woakes. The dryness of the pitch should really help Patel and Tredwell.\" I'm hopeless at judging pitches, but you'd think anything above 250 would be competitive. As ever, so much depends on Morgan. I'm not sure why they left Finn out as he's been England's best one-day bowler by a distance for the last 12 months, although he hasn't been quite at his best in this series.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 82-4 (Morgan c Amla b Duminy 0)</strong> Get back to work: Morgan has gone second ball for nought! AB de Villiers brought mid-on up a few yards and Morgan took the bait. He tried to drill the new bowler JP Duminy over the top but screwed it straight to Amla at mid-on. That's a mighty wicket for South Africa, and a triumph for the captain de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 82-4 (Cook 37, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Clue 1: it has four letters. Clue 2: England are in it.</p> <p>\"My earliest internet memories: the year was 1995, I was in grade 5 and we purchased a newfangled invention called a dial-up modem,\" says SB Tang. \"Applications and websites I remember using: Hotmail, ICQ (remember that?), and a plethora of crummy search engines, including but not limited to, Altavista, Lycos and Yahoo. But, above all, I remember an incredible discovery made independently and simultaneously by both me and my mate Alex \u2014 Cricinfo. Truly, the cricketing gods' gift to our generation. Long may it prosper.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 86-4 (Cook 41, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Cook edges a cut at the new bowler Parnell through the vacant slip area for four. This will be a good test of the new batsman Craig Kieswetter; in his one-day international career he has usually started his innings in the first 10 overs or the last 10. This is a good chance to show he can rotate the strike and build an innings.</p> <p>\"Just tuned in to see wicket four go down,\" says Hannah Marsh. \"I'm going back to the Paras...\" Being quite stupid and all, for about 30 seconds I genuinely thought that was a reference to writing, and that the kids were now calling writing \"going back to the paras\".</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 88-4 (Cook 42, Kieswetter 0)</strong> \"First memory/use of internet: first job in 1998 (!) \u2013 told to research things on the internet, I spent 15 minutes staring at a blank Netscape Navigator page before a kindly colleague showed me where to type the url\u2026\" says Guy Mavor. Nowadays you could avoid human contact by emailing someone to ask how to do it.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 91-4 (Cook 45, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Three from Parnell's over. For the second time in the innings, England are rebuilding after the loss of two quick wickets.</p> <p>Do you mind if I have a drink of water before going back to the paras? Thanks. It's Buxton, a 500ml bottle. I buy them in packs of eight to save money. It makes sense to do so because I like to bring one each day for the hour train journey into London. It's so important to keep hydrated, especially in the summer. There are myriad benefits to drinking water.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 96-4 (Cook 49, Kieswetter 1)</strong> Cook drives Peterson off the back foot for a couple, helped by a misfield from Elgar at short extra. Kieswetter gets off the mark from his ninth delivery, driving to long off. His nurdling has improved since he started but there is still plenty of work to do. It'll be really interesting to see how he goes today.</p> <p>\"Hope all well?\" says our old friend Sam Collins before getting down to brass tacks. \"The bad news is I'm here again to ask you for another plug. The good news is I hope it will be worth watching. It's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=O-gQiC1iHA0\">the promo</a> for the documentary Jarrod and I are making on the future of Test cricket \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.deathofagentlemanfilm.com\">Death of a Gentleman</a>. It's not a trailer, as we haven't cut the film yet, but more something we are showing to distributors and money men to help us finish the film, to prove that we haven't been filming ourselves taking pictures of food for the last nine months. This promo features guys like Strauss, Pietersen, Modi, Holding, Clarke, Srinivasan, Nicholas, Chappell, Dravid and Ed Cowan. Mostly with their clothes on. Lord Selve and Mike Brearley are among the many others we've canvassed too, and should make the final cut that we are hoping to release in May/ June 2013. As independent filmmakers we need to keep asking people to spread the word, so please visit <a href=\"http://www.deathofagentlemanfilm.com\">www.deathofagentlemanfilm.com</a> for further details on the film and investment opportunities.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 99-4 (Cook 51, Kieswetter 2)</strong> A single off Parnell brings Cook to a strong half-century from 69 balls. It's a bit excessive to say he needed a score, but after 32 runs in the first four matches he'll be pleased with this. And, as he showed against Pakistan earlier this year, he knows how to bat through when the side are batting first. If England are going to win this they may well need a century from Cook.</p> <p>\"If it's any small consolation,\" says Michael Hunt, \"I spent more than a couple of seconds after reading Over 21 not understanding how you could have made that mistake, but also not really understanding Hannah Marsh's decision to get over the loss of wickets by returning top being a paratrooper.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 99-5 (Cook ct and b du Plessis 51)</strong> Dear oh dear. Francois du Plessis's part-time legspin has brought a wicket second ball. A batsman has 99 problems at the crease but a low full toss should never be one. Cook could have done pretty much anything with it, but he popped a low return catch that du Plessis claimed gleefully. That brought to mind Jacques Rudolph's dismissal of Nasser Hussain at Headingley in 2003; a real WTF moment. Du Plessis hardly ever bowls in ODIs; in fact, that wicket has halved his average of 115.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 101-5 (Kieswetter 3, Patel 1)</strong> A chap called 'Smylers' informs us that Steven Finn has a back injury, hence his absence. The advantage of that is that England now have Chris Woakes coming in at No8.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 111-5 (Kieswetter 10, Patel 2)</strong> Wayne Parnell bowls consecutive front-foot no-balls. The first free hit is squirted for a single by Kieswetter, the second driven for a single by Samit Patel, who was almost run out off a free hit the other day. Kieswetter shows his class with a stunning extra-cover drive for four, holding the pose at the end of his follow through, and then he bottom edges a wild cut stroke on the bounce to de Villiers. What a strange player he is. He uses the sublime and ridiculous as starting points to go further east and west.</p> <p>\"I'd love to send you an email about my first internet memory,\" says Alex Netherton. \"Sadly I am at work and am a bit distracted. I got into work for about nine in the morning (I set my alarm for half seven but got up at 6.59 and had a longer shower than usual instead) and got the bus to work. I've had two lunches today, because I'm going for a run in a bit and want to run further than usual. I had a salt beef baguette, and then some kedgeree a couple of hours later. I'm going to try to run seven miles, running from Highbury to Barbican then back again. Then I'm going to watch Breaking Bad. I think the most recent series has been the best so far, though I'm confused why people say it's good as the Sopranos, when it's not as memorable and far less clever scriptwise. I'm using the internet to send this though, which is apposite, I suppose.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 117-5 (Kieswetter 11, Patel 7)</strong> A bit of rubbish from du Plessis is cut crisply for four by Patel. Six from the over. \"You are inviting opprobrium with your purchasing of bottled water,\" says James Galea. \"In the Guardian's pages, indeed. You know those bottles are refillable? I've still got one at home with Ali Cook's lovely face on one side, Matt Prior's less lovely face on the other.\" Refillable with what? <em>Tap</em> water. Eugh!</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 118-5 (Kieswetter 12, Patel 7)</strong> A nice, aggressive move from AB de Villiers, who brings back Dale Steyn in the hope of some hot boot-on-throat action. A good over costs just one. Kieswetter has 12 from 30, Patel 7 from 8.</p> <p>\"I remember seeing the 'internet' on our library PCs at Sheffield Uni in 1993,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"Eager to delve in, I started up Netscape and stared at the gruesome flashing colours of Yahoo's homepage (for a couple of weeks I thought it was the homepage of the entire internet until I found the settings) and created my cc mail account so I could email stuff to other students from a floppy disk. That whole last sentence would mean almost nothing to anyone under 30 would it? I still remember fondly playing Doom on my 'Maths DX 66 co-processor' (8mb RAM!!!) and thinking it was the best thing in the world. I blame my 2:2 in Geography on Championship Manager though. That and my 56k modem. God pictures downloaded slowly in those days.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 124-5 (Kieswetter 16, Patel 8)</strong> Kieswetter dances down the track to the new bowler Elgar to blast his second ball sweetly to long off for a single. He plays some bloody good shots for one, but he still doesn't play enough shots for one. There are mitigating circumstances, of course, but 62 per cent of his deliveries in this innings have been dot balls. </p> <p>\"Still drooling over which openers to select for the G-men: Greenidge, Gooch, Gayle, Gavaskar?\" drools Michael Wilbur. \"We should find a place somewhere for WG Grace, of course, and I'd like Gower coming in the middle order under no pressure at 400-2. Our keeper Gilchrist should have some licence to play his shots. We might perm one of Ganguly, Greig, Gambhir, Gatting to complete the batting places, but I'm struggling to come up with a strong bowling attack beyond Garner, Gillespie and Gibbs. I think Gary Gilmour doesn't quite have the gravitas required to mix along with his team mates here, or maybe Greig has a role here? Any thoughts on our third quickie?\" It's between Charlie Griffith and Darren Gough I'd say. Or you could whistle up Roy Gilchrist to make things a bit lively. Tony Greig has to play at No6; he's streets ahead of the others.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 124-6 (Patel c de Villiers b Steyn 9)</strong> Brilliant work from Dale Steyn, who has hoodwinked Samit Patel with the slower bouncer. Patel leered at it for a few seconds with the befuddlement of a man whose space/time continuum had just been broken before gloving it gently on its way to the keeper AB de Villiers. It's another triumph for de Villiers, who brought back Steyn for precisely that purpose. I wonder if Roy Gilchrist ever used the slower bouncer.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 124-6 (Kieswetter 16, Woakes 0)</strong> A wicket maiden from Stale Deyn, brother of Agyness. \"I'd love to tell you about my internet memories too, but I'm at work too and a bit bored,\" says Robert Armes. \"I got up at 7.30 this morning, woken by my wife opening the curtains pointedly loudly.

I had a sandwich for lunch but am unsure what I'll be eating this evening.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 130-6 (Kieswetter 21, Woakes 1)</strong> Kieswetter pulls a filthy delivery from Elgar for four and then pushes a single, his 1000th run in ODIs. His figures (average 31; strike rate 91) are pretty good for a man whose place does not always seem entirely secure.</p> <p>\"In other fascinating/mildly interesting/boring/utterly useless internet-related news, WWW is the only initialism that takes longer to say than what it stands for: World Wide Web,\" says Nick Barrett. \"Before you ask no that will not get you the ladies in bars. i know, I was shocked as well.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 132-6 (Kieswetter 22, Woakes 2)</strong> Robin Peterson is back. Chris Woakes is a decent man to have at No8; at the age of 23 he has six first-class centuries (though oddly he has never reached fifty in a one-day match, even for Warwickshire). He is taking time to play himself in, as he must with England six down, and there are two from the over.</p> <p>\"Our household got online in 1996, when I was 13,\" says Niall Harden, \"and I remember typing in http://www.sex.com, just to see what was there. I then panicked, deleted most of the information on my dad's hard drive, and for a while I steamed open all the bills which came in the post, in the belief that our itemised phone bill would have a detailed browser history.\" Now this is more like it. Come on, some of you must have stories of being caught with your browsers down.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 135-6 (Kieswetter 24, Woakes 3)</strong> Duminy replaces Elgar, the 35th bowling chance of the day. Three singles from the over. \"Lot of talk on Sky about low totals and cagey cricket creeping into 50-over cricket (and this series in particular),\" says Harry Tuttle. \"God forbid the Test match will die out, but as it gets rarer our attitude to the different types of LO cricket will evolve. T20 has clearly accelerated thinking about run-scoring, risk-taking and bowling tactics \u2013 not all of it attacking, as is the caricature (for example, top-level T20 is an environment where a dot ball is just as valuable as a wicket). This has clearly had a trickledown (or up) effect on ODIs \u2013 they're no longer sped-up Tests, but slowed down T20s.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 140-6 (Kieswetter 27, Woakes 5)</strong> Woakes almost offers a return catch, pushing the ball <em>just</em> past his left hand as he dived low to his left. Five singles from the over, and now England have to take the batting Powerplay.</p> <p>\"Tell Nick Barrett (32nd over) that VW is another example, as it George W (Walker) Bush,\" says Steve Hudson. \"And tell him I've pulled loads of birds with this stuff, it's catnip to them.\" They love the word 'birds' too, I've heard. As for the first bit, I've been had again! It's the day of the patsy.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 149-6 (Kieswetter 32, Woakes 9)</strong> Morne Morkel bowls the first ball of the Powerplay, and Craig Kieswetter smashes it over the covers for four. Then Woakes, beaten for pace, top-edges a hook over the keeper's head for four more. That almost went for six.</p> <p>\"Tell Steve Hudson that if it takes him longer to say 'Dubya' than 'Walker' then he's doing it differently,\" says Josh Robinson. I've been had again!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 155-6 (Kieswetter 33, Woakes 14)</strong> England probably need to get up to 220 to give themselves any chance. Woakes adds four to the total with another top edge, this time as he attempts to cut Parnell. </p> <p>\"A post about accessing internet porn sent by 'Niall Harden'?\" says Sean Moore. \"Really?\" Arf. A quick browse through the Guardian search engine will tell you he's an OBO regular. Then again I may have been inventing emails from him for the last five years, all the while building up to this moment. Just wait till you see what the punchline is for 'Gary Naylor'.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 156-7 (Kieswetter c Amla b Morkel 33)</strong> Craig Kieswetter's useful innings ends in frustration fashion. He tried to smash Morkel back over his head but sliced it miles in the air, and Hashim Amla backpedalled from mid-off to take a comfortable catch. It might have been a slower ball. Either way, Kieswetter probably didn't need to play that shot at that time; it's all part of his education. Not that this is of any consolation to England just now, because they are going to lose this game and draw the series 2-2. There have been so many soft dismissals today. Sometimes it happens.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 157-7 (Woakes 16, Tredwell 0)</strong> \"As your reader seems to be fascinated by your exemplary first person narrative detailing everything (a student of Russian formalism could give you the correct term for this, but I always got the fabula and syuzhet confused even when I was teaching it), I thought I would let him/her know there is a short story based on a minute by minute update of goings on during a day (an MBM short story no less) by Leonhard Thoma,\" says Ian Copestake. \"Unfortunately it's in German but its called 'Verlieren'.\" A short story about nothing?

I think Nasser just said that's the 17th bowling change of the innings. England continue to potter along in singles for the time being. If Woakes is still there in around four overs' time he will start to tee off.</p> <p>\"I remember coming home from boarding school aged about 14 and getting on the web the first time my parents went out with all the filthy intentions you might expect,\" says David Sherwin. \"I opened the browser history (why, I'm not sure) to discover that one of my parents (and it wasn't hard to guess which) shared all my filthy intentions.

Bit of a frosty dinner table that evening.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 175-8 (Tredwell b Peterson 6)</strong> Tredwell is done completely in the flight by Peterson, bowled off the inside edge as he tries a vile smear across the line.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 175-9 (Anderson c M Morkel b Peterson 0)</strong> Two in two balls. Anderson plays a strangely ambitious shot, mistiming a big drive high in the air to mid-off. He was done in the flight as well. Anderson should have just played for Woakes at that stage.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 177-9 (Woakes 29, Dernbach 1)</strong> The batsmen crossed, which means Woakes will face the hat-trick ball. He inside edges it safely round the corner and then drives a single down the ground. Dernbach also takes a single off the final ball; an odd move as it means he rather than Woakes will face Dale Steyn.</p> <p>\"Not a first memory of the internet, but the very latest tale of how far it has come,\" says Dom Price. \"Today The Telegraph puts up a story on its website about a potential cure for cancer that is stalled through lack of funds; someone in the comments sections suggests a crowd-sourcing web page; <a href=\"http://www.fundingjar.com/projects/130/project-info/\">it's set up immediately</a>; and they are already 1% of the way to their total within a few hours. Well done The Internet.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 181-9 (Woakes 32, Dernbach 2)</strong> Dernbach somehow survives Steyn's first three deliveries before getting a single off the fourth. Woakes keeps the strike with a single off the lat ball.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 182 all out (Dernbach c de Villiers b Parnell 2)</strong> Another poor stroke ends an innings of soft dismissals. Dernbach top edges a pull to the keeper and South Africa will need just <strong>183 </strong>to ensure the series ends 2-2. The Is are already dotted, and you'd expect them to care of the Ts.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>The good news</strong> is that England defended an even feebler total against South Africa at last year's World Cup. The bad news is that they are not going to do so today/night. The series is going to end 2-2. Go home. Play on the internet.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 8-0 (target 183; Amla 7, Smith 1)</strong> You want two things in one-day cricket: lots of runs and close finishes. As such, this series has been a bit of a stinker. Jimmy Anderson is going to bowl the first over. He usually makes the ball swing here. It's not enough to make it talk; if England are to win he needs to make it sing like a canary. He does get a bit of swing, but his second ball is far too straight and Amla wrists it through midwicket for four.</p> <p>\"Evening Smyth <strike> , evening everybody </strike>,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Just out of interest: what odds would you give on an England victory this evening?\"</p> <p>I'm not giving odds as a I'm poor man who needs every last copper in that jar, but you can choose any forfeit you like if England win, so long as it won't end up with me having a stint in the clink.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 8-1 (Smith c Tredwell b Dernbach 1)</strong> Prepare the forfeits. It's on! Smith has gone, caught by Tredwell at second slip off Dernbach. He launched himself towards a very wide delivery that raced off the edge towards Tredwell. He dropped a couple on Sunday but was able to grab this at the second attempt after it bounced off his chest.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 11-1 (target 183; Amla 7, du Plessis 3)</strong> The out-of-form Faf du Plessis has been promoted to No3. Get Ravi Bopara on.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 11-2 (du Plessis c Kieswetter b Anderson 3)</strong> Crikey. That's right: <em>crikey</em>. South Africa are two down, and du Plessis's miserable trot has continued. He got a nice healthy edge to a beautiful lifting delivery from Anderson, and Kieswetter took a routine catch. Anderson punches the air with the zeal of a man who thinks England can win this.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 11-2 (target 183; Amla 7, Elgar 0)</strong><br>Anderson's first ball to Elgar is a beauty that swings back, rams into the thigh and gets stuck between his legs. Anderson is charging in at the moment. His last ball goes the other way and beats Edgar's nervous push. Brilliant stuff.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 13-2 (target 183; Amla 8, Elgar 1)</strong> If England get Amla soon they might start to fancy this, because South Africa don't have that strong a batting line-up. Elgar is beaten again, this time by Dernbach.</p> <p>\"Forfeit,\" says Keith Flett. \"If England win, Smyth doesn't shave until January 1st...\" It's a deal.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 14-3 (Elgar c Kieswetter b Anderson 1)</strong> This is sensational bowling. Anderson gave Elgar an emphatic working-over, beating him with consecutive deliveries before putting him out of his misery with another cracker that lifted and seamed away to take a thin edge on its way through to Kieswetter. That really was outstanding. Elgar goes for one from 10 balls, and he played and missed at five of those.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 14-3 (target 183; Amla 8, de Villiers 0)</strong> Anderson swerves another cracker past the new batsman AB de Villiers. A dot ball means that Anderson has bowled consecutive wicket maidens. This must surely be his favourite ground. He is the only man to <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=11;ground=34;template=results;type=bowling\">take more than 50 wickets in international cricket at Trent Bridge</a>.</p> <p>\"I was having a conversation during the Test series (pre-Strauss retirement) on the England XI for the first Ashes Test next summer\" says William Hardy. \"He had no Strauss or Bell, Trott opening, Prior at No6 and Woakes in. Personally, I can't see either England moving away from their formula, or Bell being dropped. But I wondered what you thought the side would be, and if you see any major changes?\" These are really difficult. I did one of these in March 2008, ahead of 2009, and it was completely wrong (it had Vaughan, Panesar, Ambrose I think). But if I was guessing I would say: Cook, Carberry, Trott, Pietersen, Bell, Morgan, Prior, Swann, Broad, Anderson, Finn. Groundbreaking stuff, eh. Obviously Carberry, KP and Morgan are the iffy three there. I also wouldn't be shocked if Swann didn't make it, though obviously we hope he does.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 19-3 (target 183; Amla 9, de Villiers 4)</strong> Pressure? Arf. De Villiers leans into a delicious back-foot drive at Dernbach that races through the covers for four.</p> <p>\"Do you share the nagging feeling that while Amla's still at the crease, none of this matters?\" says professional mindreader Brad McMillan.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 26-3 (target 183; Amla 11, de Villiers 9)</strong> de Villiers plays a beautiful stroke, timing Anderson to the left of mid-on for four. Then he plays a defensive shot into the ground, from where it kicks to hit him in the grille.</p> <p>\"Surely the only response to a beard related forfeit from Flett is for him to shave off his whiskers should SA still win this,\" says Peter McKean. \"Or at least pare it back to some mutton chops.\" Keith Flett has a beard?</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 35-3 (target 183; Amla 11, de Villiers 17)</strong> South Africa have plenty of overs to work with but de Villiers only plays one way, and he pulls majestic consecutive boundaries off Dernbach. The strike rate for each length of delivery on Dernbach's fledgling pitch map is pretty instructive: full (150.00), good (0.00), short (233.33). Next stop, the science of rockets.</p> <p>\"I thought the forfeit was supposed to be for you,\" says Jamie Jermain, \"not for everyone else...\"</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 38-3 (target 183; Amla 13, de Villiers 18)</strong> Another good over from Anderson costs just three. He'll probably have one more because a wicket here could decide the match.</p> <p>\"Forfeit: Smyth to end every sentence, spoken or written, with 'LOL' for a year,\" says Tom Bowtell. \"LOL.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 43-3 (target 183; Amla 17, de Villiers 19)</strong> Chris Woakes replaces Jade Dernbach. His first over goes for five and includes a good yorker that Amla digs out.</p> <p>\"I did indeed shave my beard off last year to raise money for Right To Work,\" says Keith Flett. \"In the end I got more money from people demanding I immediately grow it back....\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 44-3 (target 183; Amla 18, de Villiers 19)</strong> Morgan at point saves four when Amla clatters Anderson high to his right. One from the over. </p> <p>\"I remember it before it was the internet, when you had to be in the US armed forces or at a research university, to use Arpanet, then Janet (Joint Academic Network) and my first actual use was for Chemical Abstracts including all the formulae which were a real bugger, or the patent or legal databases, and esa-aerospace,\" says John Starbuck. \"Then the newspapers woke up and started going electronic and there were loads of competing systems.

The next ball is checked in the air but short of mid-on. Amla is clearly starting to feel the pressure, as he shows with a <em>stunning</em> back-foot cover drive for four. What a shot.</p> <p>\"Can't believe no-one's mentioned the bane of early internet geekery, the modem!\" says Alex Book. \"More specifically, the 1200 or 2400 baud modem (I never did find out what 'baud' was \u2013 all I know is that was bloody slow).

Dial-up! Text-based! Modem! I can imagine the day I try to explain to my infant son about any of this \u2013 his incomprehension will be absolute.

His fourth ball turns a mile, pitching well outside off stump before spitting past Amla's left leg. Two from the over.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 61-3 (target 183; Amla 29, de Villiers 25)</strong> A piece of rubbish from Woakes, short and leg stump, is whirled emphatically round the corner for four by de Villiers.

Amla dances down the track to thrash a glorious cover drive for four.</p> <p>\"Hi Rob, I just finished my run,\" says Alex Netherton. \"It was actually seven and a half miles as I felt quite energetic. Probably due to my two lunches (one salt beef baguette and then a kedgeree a couple of hours later).

Tomorrow I think I'll have a smoothie for breakfast, and I'll be keeping the alarm set to 7.30, though I can't be sure I won't wake up before then!

England need a wicket here, and they almost get it when Amla, on the back foot, inside edges onto the pads. That could easily have hit the stumps.</p> <p>\"Alex Book reminded of something I miss about the early days of the internet,\" says Brad McMillan, \"namely hearing my mum say 'they're on the Internet again,' after finding my Grandparents' phone was engaged.\" Ha, I'd forgotten all about that.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 76-3 (target 183; Amla 39, de Villiers 30)</strong> England are waiting for a mistake, which is understandable in the circumstances but also risky given the quality of these two batsmen. They can eschew risk and work the ball around for singles, as they do in that Patel over. There is a token run-out referral against de Villiers, but he was comfortably home. Five from the over.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 82-3 (target 183; Amla 44, de Villiers 31)</strong> Amla is playing wonderfully. When Tredwell tries to tempt him with a bit of flight, Amla launches a gorgeous drive over mid-off for a one-bounce four.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 85-3 (target 183; Amla 45, de Villiers 33)</strong> With England needing a wicket, it's a good move to bring Ravi Bopara into the attack. That is not a sentence that has ever been typed before. He has a <em>huge</em> LBW shout against de Villiers first ball that is turned down by Richard Illingworth. It might be going down leg but this is really close. I would have reviewed that, although Alastair Cook has decided not to do so. Alastair Cook is a wise man; it was swinging down leg side. The second ball goes the other way to beat de Villiers' outside edge. A good first over from the new George Lohmann.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 87-3 (target 183; Amla 46, de Villiers 34)</strong> Amla miscues a couple of reverse sweeps off Tredwell.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 90-3 (target 183; Amla 48, de Villiers 35)</strong> Bopara is getting some useful inswing, if gentle, and an LBW b Bopara is probably England's best chance of a wicket just now. Three from the over. South Africa need 93 from 29 overs.</p> <p>\"It must have been around 1978 when I was helping some techies test early communications via computers,\" says John Starbuck. \"They had invented a way of swapping screen images and modifying them but were stuck for something to use in our communications with the Open University, so I took the light-pen (as it wasn't then called) and drew a noughts &amp; crosses grid, with a cross in the centre. I won, but was this the first multi-player game?\"</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 100-3 (target 183; Amla 49, de Villiers 44)</strong> England take the bowling Powerplay and go back to Dernbach. De Villiers leans into a drive that is in the air for a while but perfectly bisects extra cover and mid off before scooting away for four. The next ball is timed gloriously down the ground for four more. Those two shots were a thrilling snapshot of his exceptional talent.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 108-3 (target 183; Amla 50, de Villiers 50)</strong> Jimmy Anderson is back. This is the game, right now. England have to take a wicket. Amla pushes a single to reach another lovely fifty from 63 balls. His scores against England this summer are 311*, 9, 28, 13, 121, 150, 43, 45 and now 50*. At the moment he's actually being overshadowed by de Villiers, who is playing some sublime strokes. When Anderson overpitches, de Villiers times another straight drive for four, a shot so pristine you could eat your dinner off it. A single off the last ball takes him to a brilliant half-century, his first of the international summer, from only 54 balls.</p> <p>\"Keith Flett made the rookie mistake of failing to stipulate which part of your body you have avoid shaving,\" says Tom van der Gucht. \"When Amla wins this for SA you can duck out of growing a beard by claiming that you were referring to your armpits or feet!\" Hang on, so I have to do the forfeit even if I win the bet? Not even George Costanza would put up with that.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 118-3 (target 183; Amla 55, de Villiers 51)</strong> Ten from Dernbach's over, none in boundaries.

I might have some chicken for tea when I get home, although I probably won't get in till 11 so maybe I should get something from the canteen.</p> <p>\"After the three T20s here, we next face Afghanistan in Sri Lanka,\" says Wayne Trotman. \"Superb that such conflict-filled countries are represented, I think. I thought others might like to know that, at least overseas, Eurosport are broadcasting the whole competition.\" Are they the ones who've hired KP, or is that ESPN?</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 126-3 (target 183; Amla 57, de Villiers 57)</strong> Four more to de Villiers, pinged behind square on the leg side off Anderson. \"This is painful now,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Which reminds me, I've got the dentist tomorrow and I'm not looking forward to it. Appointments at 2.30. Last time I went he said my teeth were OK but my gums might have to come out.\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 132-3 (target 183; Amla 60, de Villiers 60)</strong> De Villiers leading edges Woakes over point for two, a rare false stroke. This partnership has been a great example of mature, high-class batsmen not so much averting a crisis as ignoring it. Their experience allows them just to go out and play, whether the score is 14 for three or 140 for three, and they have calmly taken the game away from England. Kieswetter loses Tredwell's throw from the deep in the lights and, with Bopara daydreaming behind him, South Africa can steal an overthrow. South Africa have taken 42 runs from the bowling Powerplay.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 138-3 (target 183; Amla 64, de Villiers 62)</strong> On Sky, Shane Warne says Alastair Cook has done a \"pretty good job\" as captain in this series. Coming from one of cricket's great lost captains, that's pretty high praise. Ian Bell at mid-on makes a great diving stop when Amla pushes Anderson to his left. That saved three runs, and that might just be the difference between a six-wicket defeat and a seven-wicket defeat.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 141-3 (target 183; Amla 65, de Villiers 64)</strong> De Villiers survives a run-out referral after an excellent piece of work from the bowler Woakes, who raced de Villiers to the non-striker's end and broke the stumps with an underarm throw.</p> <p>\"Things are looking bad for England, but the Aussies let Pakistan beat them by 7 wickets (with 31 balls remaining) in the first T20 in UAE,\" says Sara Torvalds. \"So that's all to the good, right?\" Whisper it \u2013 ssssshhhhhh \u2013 but I've never really done the whole Australia schadenfreude thing. No idea why.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 145-3 (target 183; Amla 68, de Villiers 65)</strong> Bopara on, Anderson off with fine but futile figures of 9-2-41-2. South Africa are coasting. </p> <p>\"If you're hungry, and nobody else can help you, and if you can find them (in your canteen), I strongly recommend Pepperami, specifically the red-packeted 'hot' variety,\" says Brad McMillan. \"I'm presently addicted, 2-3 per day, having replaced cigarettes with them last September. Not sure what the health police would have to say though.\" That sounds lovely, but aren't they \u2013 what's the phrase I'm looking for \u2013 absolutely disgusting?</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 149-3 (target 183; Amla 69, de Villiers 67)</strong> \"For supper I had boerewors, pap, gravy and peas and a small glass of red wine,\" says Simon Pamphilon. \"For pudding I had a mild heart attack, after the TV news reader said England were on the ropes all out for 182, and then, in passing, mentioned that we were 11 for 2 before cutting to the weather. I ran to the computer, called up the OBO, and superstitiously began reading from the preamble. Took until the 23rd over before my pulse rate returned to normal. Amla!!! If we weren't a republic he would be Sir Hashim by now.\"</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 153-3 (target 183; Amla 72, de Villiers 68)</strong> Bopara beats Amla with a good delivery outside off stump. South Africa need 30 from 114 balls. \"'Send your emails in on any subject you like',\" says Phil Sawyer. Really? You really want to hear my well rehearsed rant about how Marvel Comics went so badly wrong with the Spider-Man 'One More Day' story line and how I've never forgiven them since? You really are desperate for emails. Almost as desperate as I am for human company following my room emptying rants about how Marvel Comics etc and so on.\" Man, I thought I was the only one.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 163-3 (target 183; Amla 80, de Villiers 70)</strong> For those who do enjoy Australia's misfortune, I think I'm right in saying that today's defeat drops them to 10th in the ICC T20 table \u2013 below not only Bangladesh but also Ireland. Tenth! Anyway, enough of that, there's cricket going on at Trent Bridge, and Amla has just blitzed an outrageous six over extra cover off Tredwell. He ran down the track to turn it into a half volley and then launched it all the way. This is now a record fourth-wicket partnership for South Africa against England in one-day cricket.</p> <p>\"The xx,\" says Dan Lucas. \"Anyone heard this yet? I was more entertained waiting for the iTunes updates to download than I was listening to it. Most boring band ever?\" Pretty much. Almost as boring as The Wire.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 176-3 (target 183; Amla 92, de Villiers 70)</strong> Amla is ending this in a hurry. He drives Dernbach for four, edges another to third man and then smashes a cut stroke for the third boundary of the over. This is lovely, selfless batting from Hashim Amla, who realises I have only one train an hour from St Pancras and wouldn't mind getting the 2055.</p> <p>\"Re: 24th over, it's ESPN, not Afghanistan, who've hired KP. But never say never when mercenaries are involved,\" says Eamonn Maloney. \"and re: 28th over, the reason that you don't 'do' Australia schadenfreude is probably that you're not a prick.\" Well...</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>34.3 overs: South Africa 186-3 (Amla 97, de Villiers 75). SOUTH AFRICA WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS TO SQUARE THE SERIES 2-2</strong> Hasim Amla hits the winning boundary off Jade Dernbach. South Africa have <em>battered</em> England, with seven wickets and 93 balls to spare, and a slightly muted series ends 2-2. It's the right result. The remarkable Amla has averaged over 100 in both the Test and one-day series. Right here, right now, there is no better batsman on earth. The result ends England's run of seven consecutive one-day series wins at home, but they remain top of the rankings and, as I said at the start, that's all that matters.

  "<p>Local news firm Journal Register Company, championed by some of the biggest names in new media as it made a much-trumpeted shift to digital, has filed for bankruptcy for the second time in three years.</p> <p>The firm, which serves 992 communities across the US and owns titles including the New Haven Register and Michigan's Oakland Press, blamed falling revenue and said the move would allow it to cut \"legacy obligations\" including pensions and leases.</p> <p>JRC said it planned to sell itself to a firm linked to its current venture capital backer, Alden Global Capital. The moves appeared designed to allow the JRC to continue in business with the present ownership structure, but shorn of burdensome financial obligations that it was struggling to meet.</p> <p>The development left the company's thousands of JRC employees, who have endured a swift but sometimes tumultuous transition from legacy print businesses, with questions about their pensions. <a href=\"http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/financial-maneuvers-wont-slow-digital-first-progress/\">A Q&amp;A issued by the company</a> said staff could be reassured about their jobs and salaries but made no mention of pensions.</p> <p>In a letter to staff titled <a href=\"http://jxpaton.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/another-tough-step/\">Another Tough Step</a>, John Paton, chief executive of parent company Digital First Media, said digital revenues were growing fast but were not enough to keep up with declining print revenues. He said the money made from print made up more than half of the of the company's revenues.</p> <p>\"From 2009 through 2011, digital revenue grew 235% and digital audience more than doubled at Journal Register Company. So far this year, digital revenue is up 32.5%. Expenses by year's end will be down more than 9.7% compared to 2009,\" he wrote.</p> <p>However print advertising revenue at the JRC declined 19%, more than the overall newspaper industry's decline of 17% over the same time period, as measured by the Newspaper Association of America. </p> <p>Paton has championed a \"digital first, print last\" philosophy at the Journal Register. Its advisory board includes new media luminaries including Emily Bell, director of the Tow center for digital journalism at Columbia University; Jeff Jarvis, media critic and director of the Tow-Knight center for entrepreneurial journalism at Cuny; and Jay Rosen, professor of journalism at New York University.</p> <p>Last year the company launched \"project thunderdrome\" \u2013 an attempt at \"engaging audience and creating content across all platforms and geographies\". Jim Brady, former executive editor of The Washington Post's website and founder and general manager of TBD, a short-lived Washington-based local news site, was hired to oversee the project.</p> <p>Paton said the company could no longer afford \"legacy obligations incurred in the past\".</p> <p>\"Many of those obligations, such as leases, were entered into in the past when revenues, at their peak, were nearly twice as big as they are today and are no longer sustainable. Revenues in 2005 were about two times bigger than projected 2012 revenues. Defined benefit pension underfunding liabilities have grown 52% since 2009,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"And while I get this news may make some of you nervous, don't let it. Concentrate on the job at hand and we will work through this. This really is the right decision for Journal Register Company,\" Paton wrote.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan has given foreigners working for Save the Children a week to leave the country after becoming convinced that the aid organisation was used as cover by US spies hunting Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>The aid group had been under suspicion from authorities ever since a doctor accused of assisting the CIA in its search for the al-Qaida leader claimed that Save the Children had introduced him to US intelligence officers.</p> <p>But now Pakistani officials claim they have \"concrete proof\" backing up the story of Shakil Afridi, the doctor from the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan who confessed to the ISI, the country's military spy agency, after being arrested last year.</p> <p>Although Save the Children and the US government have always denied any relationship between the CIA and the aid organisation, Pakistani officials say they are fully justified in expelling the few foreign staff still working in the country.</p> <p>According to a foreign diplomat the six foreigners will have to leave by next Wednesday.</p> <p>A Pakistani intelligence official said evidence had been found showing \"spies\" at the NGO had \"engaged\" Afridi, who is currently serving a 33 year jail term. \"Pakistan carried out a thorough investigation involving all our leading agencies,\" he said. \"It was one of the longest investigations in our history.

  "<p>Not for the first time, one of David Cameron's PMQ insults offers us an unappealing glimpse into his brain.</p> <p>In comparing his relationship with his chancellor with that of the two Eds, Cameron was initially on to something: Balls and Miliband famously do not get on, and the discord on the Labour frontbench is certainly worth exploiting. But then, with the schoolboy triumphalism that undermines even his better lines, he said of Milliband: \"He's got his third choice as shadow chancellor and apparently he still has to bring him his coffee every morning! <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2012/sep/05/cameron-reshuffle-pmqs-live-blog?newsfeed=true#block-50473ee558f9fdbb0b8fc712\" title=\"\">That's how assertive and butch the leader of the opposition is!</a>\"</p> <p>Butch?

  "<p>More than 3,000 striking South African miners marched through the streets of Marikana on Wednesday, threatening to kill colleagues who continued working and to burn down a Lonnmin mine shaft.</p> <p>It was the biggest protest since last month's police massacre which claimed 34 lives, the bloodiest incident involving security forces since the end of racial apartheid in 1994.</p> <p>Tensions ran high as the workers, waving sticks, knobkerries and tree branches and easily outnumbering police, marched on the Karee mine and vowed to bring Lonmin to its knees.</p> <p>The striking miners gave working colleagues a deadline of 1pm to leave Karee mine or face deadly retribution. \"After one we don't want to see anybody in the shaft,\" said one striker who refused to give his name. \"Those who come to work tomorrow we will kill them.\"</p> <p>Another man shouted: \"There will be more blood if we do not get 12,500 rand.\"</p> <p>Following an intervention by two Methodist ministers, a delegation of seven workers were led past armoured police cars and a water cannon truck to the Karee mine. The group \u2013 all black \u2013 conversed through a barbed wire gate with mine managers and security guards \u2013 all but one of them white.</p> <p>After the brief meeting, one of the workers, Samkele Mpapani, 36, said: \"We told the management to please close the shaft by 1pm. I don't want more guys to die. This shaft has not been listening to the employees.\"</p> <p>Jan Thirion, a senior manager at the shaft, claimed the men had threatened to kill everyone there. \"The delegation from the strikers told me that if I didn't get all the workers out of the shaft by 1pm they would burn down the shaft,\" he said. \"We want to talk peace; they want to talk war.</p> <p>\"I pleaded with them to come back to work. Let us sign the peace accord that's being worked on now because it's not to anybody's advantage to do what they're doing.\"</p> <p>The strike was setting a dangerous precedent, Thirion added. \"It's like putting a gun at someone's head, saying, 'Pay us first, then we'll come back to work.' From here on, if you say that, you might as well close all South Africa's mines.\"</p> <p>A line of police armoured personnel carriers stood between the green-roofed Karee mine complex and the throng of singing, dancing strikers and their supporters. Riot police armed with teargas and assault rifles kept watch while police helicopters hovered overhead.</p> <p>One man at the front of the column waved a placard that said: \"We want 12,500 or nothing else,\" a reference to the group's demand for a hike in base pay to 12,500 rand (\u00a3935) a month, more than double their current basic salary.</p> <p>Some waved a photograph of a young man they named as <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/he-died-fighting-for-workers-rights-1.1371907#.UEeRgb8pRqe\" title=\"\">Noki Mgcineni</a>, who was killed in the police massacre. Xolani Mzuzu, a striking miner, said: \"We consider him a hero, like Chris Hani,\" \u2013 a reference to a murdered leader of the anti-apartheid struggle.</p> <p>The marchers retreated after a two-hour standoff and proceeded through the town of Marikana, watched by shopkeepers, schoolchildren and other curious onlookers. There was no violence.</p> <p>Demonstrators interviewed by the Guardian insisted the dispute was not about politics or union rivalry but simply pay. Noima Jack, 29, said: \"Lonmin is undermining the workers. They say they are transparent and respect the workers but they do neither.\"</p> <p>The strike by rock drill operators and other miners is now in its fourth week and is threatening to cripple London-based Lonmin. Only 4.2% of its shift workers reported for duty on Wednesday. Lonmin has warned that the strike could cost 40,000 jobs if it continues.</p> <p>Both Marikana and Karee, about 80 miles north-west of Johannesburg, have been closed since thousands of rock drillers went on a wildcat strike and protest nearly four weeks ago that led to the 16 August police crackdown.</p> <p>Marikana accounts for the vast majority of the platinum output of Lonmin, which itself accounts for 12% of global supply of the precious metal used in jewellery and vehicle catalytic converters.</p> <p>The strike has raised fears that the labour unrest which has hit the platinum belt this year could spread to the gold sector. South Africa is home to 80% of known platinum reserves and is the world's fourth-largest gold producer.</p> <p>Talks between Lonmin management, unions and the government to ease tensions and get the striking miners back resumed in the nearby city of Rustenburg.</p> <p>About 50 miners charged with murder after the tragedy were freed on Monday. Around another 220 still in police custody are expected to be released on Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>It has taken two decades for the City's chief regulator to tell the banks, building societies, insurers and investment firms that they fleece their customers and that they do it systematically.</p> <p>Martin Wheatley, managing director of the FSA and boss of the soon-to-be-created Financial Conduct Authority, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/05/fsa-crackdown-incentives-bank-sales-staff\" title=\"\">says he will take personal charge of reforms that will put an end to bonus schemes that encourage mis-selling</a>.</p> <p>The FSA ignored the warnings for many years. In 2003 a former Lloyds TSB financial adviser recounted how she was trained to trick customers into buying expensive products that meant most of their savings were diverted into her bonus package.</p> <p>The following year Barclays was found to be making 10% of its global profits from the sale of payment protection insurance (PPI) in the UK. The cost of the insurance was deliberately disguised and most claimants were told they failed to qualify for a payout. A plea to then FSA boss John Tiner for an investigation fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>Wheatley has warned firms they risk huge fines if they continue with the old sales tactics.</p> <p>But there are some extra incentives he missed out. The FSA should name and shame the companies in its latest investigation that were found to be mis-selling. It may seem unfair to highlight the poor practices of the 22 firms visited by FSA officials when there are probably hundreds of other firms doing the same thing, but finance companies need to live in fear of an FSA investigation.</p> <p>And there is still at least one investigation the FSA has sidestepped. All the major banks and insurers conspired to fix PPI premiums and prepared collective responses to difficult questions from the media and regulators. Bank executives regularly flew to Dublin where they ran their PPI operations as a tax scam, doubling up the profits from selling the insurance in the UK. There will be records of who went and what their instructions were. It doesn't matter if some are now retired, they should be hauled before the regulator and asked to explain their actions. If the Libor scandal is worth a full-blown investigation then so is the PPI scandal.</p>",
  "<p>Professor Christopher Potten, who has died aged 71, was a pioneer in a topic that, 40 years after his first studies, remains central in human biology: the organisation of cellular renewal in the epithelial tissues that line our body surfaces. The surface of the skin and the lining of the gut shed hundreds of millions of cells each day, cells that must be replaced by the multiplication of the stem cells that lie beneath the surface.</p> <p>Potten was fascinated by this process and its consequences for cancer research. In the early 1970s, following the finding that the epidermis had an ordered structure, he proposed that the skin was organised into \"epidermal proliferative units\" in which single stem cells lay at the bottom of larger, organised columns of daughter cells, which matured into flattened dead cells as they moved towards the surface and were shed.</p> <p>This led Potten to the concept of a discrete set of stem cells rather than a homogeneous population of cells of equal potential. With his colleagues at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in Manchester, his rigorous work laid the basis for the present concept of the stem cell niche, the environment in which stem cells are found and which regulates stem-cell fate.</p> <p>Potten next turned his attention to the intestine, where again he was able to demonstrate a discrete population of stem cells. He showed that a few of these were exquisitely sensitive to radiation, preferring to \"commit suicide\" by a process known as apoptosis, rather than attempting to repair damage to their DNA. This suicide response required the activity of a protein called p53, subsequently dubbed \"the guardian of the genome\". Potten hypothesised that it was an altruistic response in which the cells died, rather than expose the organism to the cancer risk of incompletely repaired genetic damage. This helped to stimulate research interest in the apoptotic process in the development of new cancer treatments.</p> <p>Potten was born in Calcutta. His father was in the Indian navy and captained a minesweeper. At the end of the war, the family returned to the UK. Potten studied for his BSc in botany and zoology at Queen Mary, University of London, before moving into radiation biology, with an MSc at Guy's hospital, a PhD at the University of London and a DSc at the University of Manchester.</p> <p>In 2000, after 30 years as head of the department of epithelial biology at the Paterson Institute, Potten retired and founded a company, <a href=\"http://www.epistem.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Epistem</a>, to continue his research and take it into practical clinical and therapeutic applications. He had the satisfaction in 2002 of using his accumulated knowledge to design and publish a series of experiments to provide strong support for another stimulating but controversial idea, the \"immortal strand\" hypothesis, on which he had worked with its originator, John Cairns, in the 70s.</p> <p>This stated that the stem cells renewing a tissue protect the organism against cancer by always partitioning the DNA strand containing the errors that result from copying to the daughter cell that will be shed from the tissue. This work both completed the circle of Potten's earlier ideas, and opened new possibilities for further study.</p> <p>Potten was awarded a life fellowship from the Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK), and the International Marie Curie and Weiss medals for services to radiation research. From 1988 to 2003, he served as chief editor of the journal Cell and Tissue Kinetics, which in 1991 was renamed Cell Proliferation. He was a generous and supportive colleague, whose opinion was often sought. He was always ready to help colleagues with their own research and was especially helpful and encouraging to young people.</p> <p>Potten married Sarah Chasmar in 1964. Five years after her death in 2002, he married Carol Griffiths. She survives him, as do three sons and two stepdaughters.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Christopher Stanislaus Potten, biologist, born 30 November 1940; died 3 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>The Office of Fair Trading has opened an inquiry into claims of unfair competition at the pumps amid widespread concerns about soaring petrol and diesel prices.</p> <p>The British examination of a market said to be worth \u00a332bn a year follows similar investigations in Germany and Spain, which both found evidence of a lack of competition in the road fuel sector.</p> <p>The OFT has asked industry, motoring groups and consumer bodies to submit information over the next six weeks and said it planned to publish its findings in January 2013. Claire Hart, a director at the OFT, said: \"We are keenly aware of continuing widespread concern about the pump price of petrol and diesel, and we have heard a number of different claims about how the market is operating.</p> <p>\"We have therefore decided to take a broad-based look at this sector, to provide an opportunity for people to share their concerns and evidence with us. This will help us determine whether claims about competition problems are well-founded and whether any further action is warranted,\" she said.</p> <p>The OFT's investigation was welcomed by a variety of groups that have expressed alarm after the petrol price rose 38% since June 2007. Diesel has gone up by 43%.</p> <p>Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation motorists' group, said: \"We have always argued for pricing transparency and this review promises to provide it.

In 1990, there were some 18,000 forecourts. Now there are fewer than 9,000.\"</p> <p>The campaign group FairFuelUK, was also pleased. Quentin Willson, a former Top Gear presenter and FairFuelUK campaigner, said: \"There is a widespread feeling that when oil goes up, pump prices rocket immediately but when the oil price falls, pump prices don't reflect that fall. This causes a sense of complete exasperation and anger.\"</p> <p>Major oil companies and supermarkets are allegedly making it hard for independent road fuel providers to compete and are slow to pass on lower crude costs.</p> <p>In a separate development, a House of Commons energy committee revealed a survey showing that half of householders blamed profiteering by the Big Six energy suppliers for high domestic fuel costs.</p> <p>The survey of householders showed that 50% blame energy company profits and only 23% attribute it to fossil fuel price rises. Just one in 20 of those questioned blamed high prices on the subsidy for renewable companies.</p> <p>Tim Yeo, chairman of the energy and climate change committee, said a range of changes were needed to ensure that householders did not feel ripped off.</p> <p>\"If consumer trust in energy companies is to increase, there needs to be more competition in the market and more transparency about profits,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>What does it take for a woman to have children and a successful career? At a panel organised by the Evening Standard yesterday, a journalist I've long admired said something so dispiriting in answer to this question that it took my mind off the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/reshuffle-cameron-blair-osborne-brown\" title=\"\">awful reshuffle</a>. \"Behind every alpha woman\", said Lucy Kellaway, \"lies a beta man\".</p> <p>Forget the slightly irritating ethology to describe ambitious people for a moment, the message is clear: girls, if you want a good job and a family, pick a partner who is less ambitious than yourself. So, as though reduced to the animal world, there's only space for one top dog among parents. So much for equality, eh?</p> <p>Surprisingly perhaps on a day when women were yet again left off a top table, a more uplifting answer came from two political wives. In a speech that was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/michelle-obama-renew-vows-president\" title=\"\">just as emotional and stirring</a> as that given by her husband four years ago, Michelle Obama was credited with reviving the president's flagging electoral campaign. She may have used the language of love and relationships, but it was pure power she evoked. Few US election watchers could resist talking about her plea to the electorate to \"renew their vows\" to her husband or for them to \"commit\" themselves the way she had. Feminists may have shuddered at her description of her most important role as \"mom in chief\", but most voters probably won't. And who wouldn't give the quaintly titled \"first lady\" a job after that barnstormer? She may be a \"mom\" first, but this community activist and lawyer can pick up just whenever she wants, thanks very much.</p> <p>This brings me to Cherie Booth QC. The wife of the former prime minister, who has continued to work as a human rights lawyer despite the small matter of a career-minded husband and four children, said she was \"intrigued\" by Kellaway's assessment of what it took to be an \"alpha woman\" last night. \"What we all need\", she said, \"is a supportive spouse\", adding that \"there will be times in your life when one or other of you take a back seat\".</p> <p>That's it, isn't it? Men and women, if they want to progress at work and have children, need to support each other to do so. And not just by staying at home and doing the housework, but by truly believing that their partner has a valid role to play. Of course fridges need filling and children need looking after at the same time as money needs to be made, but it doesn't always have to be done by the same person. Or the same sex. Whatever you may think of Denis Thatcher, he was a successful businessman before he allowed himself to be seen as an old duffer in slippers while his wife's career soared.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, a serious straight A student when the future president met her, told one interviewer that Bill was the first man she met who <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/02/when_bill_met_hillary/\" title=\"\">wasn't afraid of her</a>. I'm not judging the Clintons marriage here, but given the length of their relationship and the diversity of their ambitions, it seems safe to assume there has been a bit of mutual support involved along the way. It is these political partners that Helen Fraser should have referenced when, earlier this year, the chief executive of the Girls' Day School Trust got so much stick for <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9330117/School-for-husbands-girls-should-be-taught-how-to-find-supportive-man.html\" title=\"\">telling the trust's annual conference</a> that girls should learn to be just as \"ambitious\" in their relationships as they are in their careers. This was twisted by the press to mean that she was advocating that these wealthy girls found rich husbands. She wasn't. She was just pointing out that if they had ambitions to combine a good job with children, they should find a supportive partner to start a family. Whether we like it or not, this is the conundrum facing many women and is the cause most often given to explain why women, who do better at university and earn more immediately after, end up with a more \"beta\" role after having given birth.</p> <p>This is not just the answer for the so-called \"high-flyers\" \u2013 we can't all be global leaders. Two-thirds of mothers with dependent children now work. Having children with a partner who supports you and your ambitions \u2013 that's the alpha and omega, isn't it?</p>",
  "<p>Today one of the biggest corporates in the world announced <a href=\"http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2202988/salesforce-won-t-trademark-social-enterprise\" title=\"\">it would abandon a major workstream</a> in which it has invested significantly. We are talking, of course, about the application by tech company <a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/uk/\" title=\"\">Salesforce</a> to trademark the term \"social enterprise\", which has been withdrawn following <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/news/victory-global-campaign-protect-social-enterprise\" title=\"\">a five-week campaign by the worldwide social enterprise movement</a>. The campaign had no direct costs, it included no face-to-face meeting time between the organisations executing it, and it was entirely digital in its execution. Along the way we went into very polite combat with <a href=\"http://www.virgin.com/\" title=\"\">Virgin</a> and <a href=\"http://uk.burberry.com/store/\" title=\"\">Burberry</a>, saw the national media take an interest and even got the support of \"national treasure\" Stephen Fry and worldwide social finance hero Muhammad Yunus.</p> <p>We must acknowledge the maturity and integrity of Salesforce in publicly admitting its mistake and abandoning its attempts to trademark the term \"social enterprise\" , as well as striking out references to the term in its marketing materials. It has acknowledged our belief that its misuse of the term was confusing audiences and was therefore damaging to the real social enterprise movement. This was no small gesture \u2013 Salesforce has invested major resource in its efforts to promote its own version of \"social enterprise\". And other tech companies are using it too. Salesforce mustn't lose out because it acted with integrity.</p> <p>But it is also important to acknowledge the unity, energy and commitment that emerged internationally over this desire to protect the social enterprise movement. I believe this has been a watershed moment for our sector. It has highlighted just how much latent power is in the social enterprise movement. Social enterprises are often too busy walking the walk to have time to talk the talk. But no matter how big and bold social enterprises are getting all over the world, the grass roots of our movement are strong and widespread. This is what makes the sector truly sustainable.</p> <p>The question \"what next?\" is on the lips of many, and we mustn't underestimate how much there is left to do to protect our good name. Others will want to appropriate it, inevitably, because of the increasing good will it is attracting around the globe. We will be talking to other leaders in the UK and abroad about the smartest ways of doing this.</p> <p>Social enterprise is a young movement and, until now, many of its proponents have wanted to ensure it keeps its arms open to the world. We have been wary of legal parameters emerging that may damage our inclusive, collaborative and innovative nature.</p> <p>But social enterprise is entering the mainstream consciousness \u2013 despite our worries there is plenty of evidence to support this claim. We must give it as clear a passage as possible as it takes hold in consumer, government and business-to-business markets.</p> <p>Confusion of our name and our cause at this time is dangerous to our businesses and our stakeholders. So while the #not in our name campaign objectives we almost entirely met today, the last one \u2013 which is protecting our good name from misappropriation in future \u2013 remains outstanding. I have no doubt this won't last long.</p> <p><em>Celia Richardson is director of campaigns at </em><a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Social Enterprise UK</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>A new index to measure and track the prosperity of cities has been unveiled by UN-Habitat, the UN human settlements programme, in a bid to encourage a more upbeat view of the world's rapid urbanisation.</p> <p>Cities should be seen as drivers of economic growth and human development, according to the agency's flagship State of the World's Cities report, published on Wednesday at the sixth <a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672\" title=\"\">World Urban Forum (WUF) in Naples</a>, Italy.</p> <p>\"A fresh future is taking shape, with urban areas around the world becoming not just the dominant form of habitat for humankind, but also the engine-rooms of human development as a whole,\" said the report, which called on city planners, particularly in developing countries, to see urbanisation in a positive light. In 2010 the agency announced that, for the first time, more people live in cities than in rural areas.</p> <p>\"Cities have been perceived as the 'engines' of national economies and there is no reason to depart from that view,\" said the report, pointing to numerous examples, from the US to Kenya, where urban areas contribute disproportionately to national wealth.</p> <p>\"A critical mass of people, ideas, infrastructure and resources acts as a magnet of development, attracting migrants, private firms, investors and developers. All of this enhances the prospects for more employment opportunities, wealth creation, innovation and knowledge, which are all major factors of prosperity.\"</p> <p>However, the report echoed previous attempts to recalibrate measures of progress and called for a view of prosperity that goes beyond a narrow focus on economic growth.</p> <p>\"A lopsided focus on purely financial prosperity has led to growing inequalities between rich and poor, generated serious distortions in the form and functionality of cities, also causing serious damage to the environment \u2013 not to mention the unleashing of precarious financial systems that could not be sustained in the long run,\" said the executive director of UN-Habitat, Joan Clos, in a foreword to the report.</p> <p>The new city prosperity index will attempt to track progress across five key issues: productivity, infrastructure, quality of life, equity, and environmental sustainability. This should help urban policymakers pinpoint problem areas, it says. Low scores on the equity component of the index, for example, push South African cities Cape Town and Johannesburg from the tier of cities with \"solid\" prosperity rankings to those with \"weak\" or \"very weak\" values.</p> <p>\"Highly unequal cities are a ticking timebomb waiting to explode,\" warned the report, adding that the size and quality of public space is a good indicator of a city's \"shared prosperity\". Urban planners must defend public spaces such as parks and pavements against the \"menace of ever-expanding private interests\", it argues.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Clos called on national governments to adopt national urban policies to proactively manage the expansion of cities, while also handing local authorities greater power and resources. The report identified decentralisation of authority and fiscal devolution as key strategies for urban prosperity.</p> <p>However, critics said UN-Habitat had failed to prioritise issues related to rights and the global housing crisis.</p> <p>Raquel Rolnik, UN special rapporteur on adequate housing, said the agency had played a pivotal role in pushing a paradigm that favours the \"commodification of housing, and now the takeover of housing and urban sectors by finance, its logic and structure\".</p> <p>Rolnik criticised the agency's <a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=11433&amp;catid=7&amp;typeid=6&amp;AllContent=1\" title=\"\">new manifesto for cities</a>, launched on Monday, for adopting the language of finance, referring to land and housing as \"assets' and championing \"competitive cities\".</p> <p>\"One of the pillars of this paradigm has been the idea of 'competitive cities', entrepreneurialism, and the idea that, since states are not able to provide infrastructure and services for all, the new role of the state is as an 'enabler','\" she said. \"But the right to adequate housing is not the right to own a structure \u2013 four walls and a roof. The concept is an entry point to all other human rights \u2026 it has nothing to do with housing as a commodity or a good that you can buy in the market.\"</p> <p>Activists also questioned the agency's decision not to renew the mandate of its advisory group on forced evictions, which expired in 2010. Previous UN-Habitat reports included a \"secure tenure index\", tracking issues related to land and housing rights. This year's report makes little mention of tenure and has no reference to the UN-declared right to adequate housing.</p> <p>Organisers say 6,000 participants from 151 countries are on-site in Naples for the WUF, the world's premier meeting for city planners and urban policymakers. Held every two years, the WUF is not a decisionmaking forum, but helps inform the agenda of UN-Habitat's governing council.</p>",
  "<p>If you work in the world of sustainability then it's a good bet you already know last week was <a href=\"http://www.worldwaterweek.org/\" title=\"\">World Water Week</a> (especially if you are regular reader of Guardian Sustainable Business).</p> <p>For academics, consultants, scientists and sustainability execs, the annual gathering in Stockholm is an important time to grapple with the freshwater issues that loom over global growth and prosperity.</p> <p>After all, as you no doubt know, some 2.6 billion people lack improved sanitation and around 800 million people lack access to safe drinking water. You probably also know that agriculture uses 70% of fresh water worldwide.</p> <p>And that's the problem isn't it. You, as sustainability professionals, are informed and care deeply about making a difference. Many of you are also working on water resource strategies and implementation policies or partnering NGOs and global groups to put those plans into effect.</p> <p>But one big question remains: how do you communicate this commitment to a diverse audience \u2013 including both fellow employees and customers?</p> <p>In recent years a number of companies, including brewer <a href=\"http://www.sabmiller.com/\" title=\"\">SABMiller</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unilever.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Unilever</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepsico.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pepsico</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cat.com/cda/layout\" title=\"\">Caterpillar Inc</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nestle.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nestl\u00e9</a> have announced awareness raising projects concerned with freshwater. SABMiller has been particularly proactive, working with <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WWF</a> on a global partnership on water risk called <a href=\"http://www.sabmiller.com/index.asp?pageid=174&amp;mediaid=309\" title=\"\">Water Futures</a>, while both Pepsico's charitable foundation and Caterpillar (along with actor Matt Damon) have worked with the NGO <a href=\"http://water.org/post-v/building-the-future-promise/\" title=\"\">Water.org</a> to support projects in India and Haiti respectively.</p> <p>But despite the presence of Hollywood's A-List or slick, feel good <a href=\"http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Recipe-for-the-Next-Billion.html\" title=\"\">animated storytelling</a>, and perhaps because of too many well-meaning corporate suits going to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxvYe4A4EIE\" title=\"\">YouTube</a> to explain sustainability commitments, the pressing issue of failing freshwater resources still doesn't resonate outside the larger sustainability and environmental community.</p> <p>Admittedly, convincing a drenched British public that freshwater scarcity is an immediate threat might be a harder sell than, say, in the drought-plagued American southwest. But, as this year's <a href=\"http://www.worldwaterweek.org/\" title=\"\">World Water Week</a> made clear, it is the inter-connectedness \u2013 the nexus \u2013 of water to food security that affects all of us, wherever we are. We may not yet know the impact this year's drought will have on global food prices, but all of us will be affected in one way or another, even if it just a few pence or cents on the price of bread, corn or fresh vegetables.</p> <p>It is the very global reach of the fresh water-food nexus that offers a clear opportunity for sustainability professionals to communicate through social media the worthy yet sometimes abstract lessons of freshwater awareness.</p> <p>And that's where World Water Week comes in. No really. While no one but sustainability geeks wants to sit through <a href=\"http://www.watermedia.org/\" title=\"\">the live-streaming</a> of last week's Stockholm discussions, the information, examples and case studies coming out of the event provide the raw materials that social media communicators can use to enable a more responsible society.</p> <p>To achieve this, communicators have to cut through the worthy fog of so many \"We believe in\" executive statements and \"We support this developing world programme\" microsites. They need, instead, to draw on the thinking and examples being shared at Stockholm.</p> <p>In many ways, social media is a reflection of the people who use it. So social media sustainability content has to resonate with its audience: it has to mean something to them. Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.recyclebank.com/\" title=\"\">Recyclebank</a> have demonstrated this by crafting gamification strategies to build community and marketshare. And, increasingly, content marketers are looking to create editorial strategies that talk directly to the needs of customers rather than take them on the journey of an artificial marketing campaign. This focus on personalisation and understanding what motivates your customer should be important tools, not just in selling more things to them but in helping create a more responsible and sustainable marketplace.</p> <p>Water is a fundamental challenge facing every major company, especially if they are in the business of food production. But it's a challenge that no company can meet without the help of its own customers, many of whom, frankly, have been conditioned through decades of marketing by those same companies to consume more and more in an unsustainable manner.</p> <p>Now is the time to show them, not tell them, how you and they can make a difference.</p> <p><em>Matthew Yeomans provides editorial consultancy for many companies.

  "<p>Coverage of the US drought and the run-up in corn, soybean, and wheat prices has been extensive and welcome. It has also been prone to the repetition of falsehoods and the perpetuation of myths about the causes of the food crisis \u2013 and the solutions. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/02/era-of-cheap-food-over\" title=\"\">A recent Guardian article, \"The era of cheap food may be over,\"</a> is a case in point. Specifically, it perpetuates the myth that the main driver of food price increases is demand for meat in fast-growing developing countries. This effectively downplays the full impact of biofuels and ignores two problems underlying price volatility: financial speculation and the lack of publicly held food reserves.</p> <p>Give Larry Elliott credit for posing the issue in terms of the difficult policy choices the world faces. He's certainly right to pose the challenge. \"The current assumption seems to be that the world can have a rising population, ever-higher per capita meat consumption, devote less land to food production to help hit climate change targets and eschew the advances in science that might increase yields\" he writes. \"This is the stuff of fantasy.\"</p> <p>It sure is, but so his framing of the problem. First of all, the trend toward meat-based western diets is certainly worth resisting, for health and environmental reasons. But it's been pretty clearly shown that rising demand for meat-based protein, particularly in India and China, is not the main cause of recent price increases. An <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE-price-volatility-and-food-security-report-July-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">FAO study</a> documented conclusively that cereals demand rose more slowly since 2000 than it had in previous decades. So demand in India and China may have grown, but it did not create a \"demand shock\" that precipitated more recent price surges.</p> <p>What is the demand shock that has occurred since 2000? The dramatic expansion of biofuels production, under a range of government incentives, particularly in the US with corn-based ethanol and in the EU with biodiesel. This has truly been a shock to tight commodity markets. US ethanol consumes 40% of the country's corn, fully 15% of global corn production. Estimates vary widely on the impacts, but <a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13105\" title=\"Renewable Fuel Standard\">the National Academy of Sciences concluded</a> that 20-40% of the price increases in 2008 were due to biofuels expansion.</p> <p>That impact couldn't be clearer than in today's looming food crisis, triggered by the widespread drought in the US. Corn output is down dramatically, but ethanol refiners keep gobbling up the corn, driving global prices to new records. Elliott for some reason discusses this as a supply-side issue, but it's pure demand, created by government programmes that seemed good at the time, as he points out, but are now a disaster. Or, more to the point, a set of recurring disasters as the world suffers its third price spike in five years.</p> <p>To be sure, there has been one other demonstrable boost in demand since 2000, and it does implicate the rising demand for meat-based diets. Chinese demand for soybeans has jumped dramatically, mostly to feed its own growing meat production. This puts pressure on agricultural land and certainly contributes to rising food prices. But not on the order of magnitude accounted for by biofuels expansion in general and US ethanol expansion in particular.</p> <p>As Elliott points out, it is not easy to reduce the rising demand for meat-based diets in developing countries. And he calls on the west to \"reassess the wisdom of biofuels\". That should be a priority in the current price crisis. Unlike changing global dietary patterns, it is an area in which government policy can have a quick and decisive impact. The biofuel boom began largely as the product of government policies.</p> <p>Stop the further expansion of biofuels and you've saved millions of tons of grain for food and feed.</p> <p>Reverse its recent growth, by introducing more flexible mandates that are triggered by tight supplies, and you've placed people over cars in the great global food chain.</p> <p>Elliott's solutions ultimately focus on the false choice between hi-tech industrial farming to produce more meat or having the world eat less meat so we can live from what he says are \"lower yields\" from organic agriculture. We can feed the world, even China's growing number of meat-eaters, and increasing agricultural R&amp;D is an important part of the solution. But first we should stop putting food into our cars.</p> <p>We should also consider four other straightforward and proven policies:</p> <p>1. <a href=\"http://triplecrisis.com/spotlight-g-20-grain-reserves-and-the-food-price-crisis/\" title=\"\">Expand food reserves</a> \u2013 US reserves are virtually non-existent thanks to government policies to just let the market do its magic. The market's magic has given us three price spikes in five years, and the absence of food reserves has left us no flexibility to handle a drought as severe as the current one.</p> <p>2. <a href=\"http://triplecrisis.com/food-price-volatility/\" title=\"\">Regulate financial speculation in commodity markets</a> \u2013 The financial sharks are circling as prices spike, hungry to play the volatility for their benefit. Regulations are still not in place to get them out of our food. Governments can act to reduce speculation-driven food price volatility.</p> <p>3. <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/mb060e/mb060e00.pdf\" title=\"\">Address waste</a> \u2013 An astonishing one third of food is wasted all along the food chain. Public investments \u2013 in water systems, storage, roads, and markets \u2013 can save more food for the hungry. The impact would be even greater than reducing biofuels use. (So, too, would the related goal of more equitably distributing the food we produce.)</p> <p>4. Expand sustainable smallholder food production \u2013 The current consensus recognises that the \"yield gaps\" are greatest among small-scale farmers, and that they can expand their food production through \"<a href=\"http://www.julespretty.com/Sustainable_Ecological_Agri.html\" title=\"\">sustainable intensification\"</a>.</p> <p>Elliott puts his finger on the urgent crisis facing the global community in the ongoing food crisis, but he misses the mark on his diagnosis and the cures.</p> <p><em>Timothy Wise is the policy research director at Tufts University's Global Development and Environment Institute. He is the author, with Sophia Murphy, of </em><a href=\"http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/policy_research/resolving_food_crisis.html\" title=\"link to the full report\"><em>Resolving the Global Food Crisis: Assessing Global Reforms Since 2007</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>Not since Viscount Whitelaw shuffled off this mortal coil can there have been so much discussion of willies in this paper's Comment section as first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/heathrow-third-runway-big-willy-politics\" title=\"\">Simon Jenkins</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-big-willy-politics\" title=\"\">Anne Perkins</a> bemoaned the return of \"big willy politics\".</p> <p>The prime minister, we must presume, either hasn't noticed or doesn't care \u2013 I suspect the latter. If he were at all concerned about a perception that his core cabinet has become yet more male (not to mention yet more white and socially privileged) it is unlikely he would have used the platform of PMQs to hurl a gendered jibe at Ed Miliband. In the ritualistic opening exchanges, Cameron alluded to a tacky slice of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2196541/The-Ed-Ed-feud-wreck-Milibands-No10-dream.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail gossip</a>, suggesting that when the leader of the opposition and shadow chancellor drink coffee together, it is the former who does the fetching and carrying. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2012/sep/05/cameron-reshuffle-pmqs-live-blog?newsfeed=true#block-50473ee558f9fdbb0b8fc712\" title=\"\">Not very assertive and butch of the leader of the opposition, is it</a>?\" asked David Cameron.</p> <p>Even by the standards of the PMQ pantomime, it was a bizarre and revealing outburst. Perhaps in David Cameron's world the task of carrying beverages is undertaken only by underlings, butlers, school dormitory \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagging\" title=\"\">fags</a>\" or women, but thankfully that's not a world most of us inhabit. However it is the word \"butch\" that really catches the attention.</p> <p>The linking of political competence with masculinity is rather problematic. Feminists will be rightly annoyed by the implications \u2013 our political class is less healthy for its uniformity and throwaway jokes like this only reinforce the perception that parliamentary democracy is a club for boys. Men too should be perturbed that the prime minister thinks masculinity is a function of hierarchical status \u2013 real men don't fetch coffee. Actually Dave, yes we do. Men who carry coffee, make coffee, work for a boss or unthinkingly volunteer to conduct routine chores for ourselves and our colleagues are no less manly for that. Elsewhere on Comment is free, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/real-women-skinny-models-brigitte-no-contest\" title=\"\">Sali Hughes rightly castigates</a> the media for using the phrase \"real women\" to validate some female physiques over others, but the \"real men\" trope is in many ways as harmful and, in fact, far more pervasive (<a href=\"http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=%22real+men%22&amp;word2=%22real+women%22\" title=\"\">definitive proof here</a>). If \"real\" women are expected to conform to specific physical ideals, \"real\" men are expected to adhere to a constricting and damaging gendered model of behaviour and lifestyle \u2013 domineering, aggressive and, of course, strictly heterosexual.</p> <p>I don't know about the language old Etonians use by habit, but in my experience the word \"butch\" is now almost exclusively used by either homophobes when discussing lesbians, or gay men when discussing each other. It is either \"butch v femme\" or \"butch v camp\". Consequently, and ironically, Cameron saying \"not very butch, is it?\" came across as really quite camp \u2013 one could easily imagine it tumbling from the lips of Alan Carr or Julian Clary. That is not in itself a problem of course, but I very much doubt it was the intended effect. I've seen PMQs descend into many indignities, but rarely has it sounded so much like an internal squabble among the Village People.</p> <p>Miliband, probably wisely, didn't rise to Cameron's bait. Had it been me up there, I'd have probably said something like \"Well unlike the party opposite, my front bench not only has eight women, it also has Balls.\" That at least might have raised a laugh, even if the sexual politics are not much better. Then again, one reason I'm not in politics is that I have a bad habit of saying inappropriate things at inopportune moments. It seems this is not necessarily a disqualification.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Owen regards football as a vocation but remains resolutely unsentimental about the game which has shaped his life. This paradox disturbs those fans, and some managers, who suspect the former England striker is not sufficiently in love with his profession.</p> <p>Perhaps Owen's biggest problem is that he is not a hypocrite. A man who claims \"I was born to score goals\" does not bother to disguise his belief that there is more to life than hitting the back of the net. As he once said: \"Scoring gives you a 10 second buzz but I would not describe it as joyful.\"</p> <p>Such rare honesty sometimes obscures the pride and understated pleasure Stoke City's new striker derives from his craft while diminishing the determination and professionalism of a player who has recovered from the sort of serious injuries and major surgeries which have ended many other careers.</p> <p>To his critics, though, the 32-year-old's willingness to spend the past three seasons as very much a fringe player at Manchester United somehow offered confirmation that he was more interested in funding his racing stables than starting matches.</p> <p>Until last year, the nearest anyone had ever come to spotting a tear in Owen's eye was when his wife, Louise, was pictured crying at St James' Park shortly after he joined Newcastle United from Real Madrid in 2005.</p> <p>Then, last summer, Brown Panther, not only one of Owen's beloved racehorses but the offspring of an adored family pet, won the King George V Stakes at Ascot and, suddenly, a striker infamous for his ice cold detachment could not stop sobbing. \"No, I have never cried after scoring a goal,\" he agreed later. \"But racing is my passion, I am so keen. It's a different thing to win with a horse bred from a mare which is a family pet. My kids pat her every morning and love her so much.\"</p> <p>Those words grated with many Newcastle fans who noted Owen's failure to engage with both them and the wider north-eastern community during that largely ill-starred spell on Tyneside. If frequently commuting to his home \u2013 within easy reach of those stables \u2013 in Cheshire by helicopter constituted a minor public relations disaster, at least he was not as disingenuous as certain team-mates whose protestations of love for \"The Toon\" soon rang horribly hollow.</p> <p>Moreover, by then, students of Owen's history would surely have forgiven him a slightly cynical streak. As the teenager who scored \"that goal\" against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup he had contended with England's manager Glenn Hoddle telling the press he was \"not a natural goalscorer\".</p> <p>Back home at Liverpool his blistering change of pace and uncanny penalty area precision won countless games but Owen still found himself rotated with Emile Heskey by G\u00e9rard Houllier. As he entered his 20s and his hamstrings began feeling the strain of possibly playing too many matches too young a worrying search for treatments took him to that Mecca of hobbling stars, the Munich clinic of Hans M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt.</p> <p>A depressing cycle of regular injuries, operations and rehabilitation had begun and, partly with Owen's physical frailties in mind, Rafael Ben\u00edtez sold his star striker to Real Madrid.</p> <p>Owen has, intriguingly, revealed that, preferring to deal in \"facts\" and \"reality\", he struggles to read fiction or watch dramas on television and this lack of imagination arguably saw him treat his time in Spain as a business transaction rather than a great adventure.</p> <p>Yet, if he failed to learn the language properly, embrace the culture or even put Ronaldo (the Brazilian one) or Ra\u00fal in their places, he still scored 18 goals in 41 appearances, despite starting only 15 games.</p> <p>Playing under six managers in four years at Newcastle might have made a football romantic a little sceptical but Owen's cause was most harmed by the cruciate ligament tear he sustained playing for England in the opening minutes of the 2006 World Cup in Germany.</p> <p>When, shortly afterwards, the scale of the injury was confirmed Owen texted his then club manager, Glenn Roeder, to apologise for the inconvenience. The subsequent operation necessitated an allograft \u2013 the transplant of a tendon from a dead man \u2013 and took a year to recover from, during which time Owen supplemented his Newcastle training by working privately with John Green, a respected athletics coach.</p> <p>Despite an enduring knack of scoring on his increasingly rare appearances for Manchester United, it has long been evident that Green's best efforts failed to restore Owen's old sprinter's pace, dictating he is no longer best deployed lurking off the last defender's shoulder.</p> <p>If Fabio Capello called time prematurely on the international career of a striker boasting 40 England goals and 89 caps, Tony Pulis may be best advised to use Owen in an attacking midfield role at Stoke. As he has conceded himself, he can no longer \"pull defences all over the park\". Moreover, as Kevin Keegan discovered four years ago at Newcastle, Owen excels linking play in \"the hole\".</p> <p>As England coach, Keegan had seemed to prefer Andy Cole but he soon changed his mind about Owen. \"I didn't realise how good Michael is,\" he said. \"Playing deeper, Michael can keep the ball all day, see a pass and know when to release it. He'll get more scoring chances from deep and I think that, as a midfielder, he can play until he's 36 or 37.\"</p> <p>While Owen should prosper pouncing on knockdowns from Stoke's Peter Crouch and Kenwyne Jones and fastening on to the sort of crosses he has always relished scoring from, the sole note of caution is that Pulis's recent attempt to play Tuncay in a linking \"hole\" role proved an unmitigated disaster. Owen, though, is a far better finisher than the talented Turk.</p> <p>If the former's fitness record and wage demands understandably deterred several managers, it still seems slightly startling that Stoke were Owen's sole serious suitors. Or that, despite his acute striker shortage, Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers was so quick to dismiss the idea of signing him. Most astonishing of all was that, on Monday, one of the finest forwards of his generation tweeted a picture of his boots accompanied by the words: \"The tools of my trade are stacked and ready to go.\"</p> <p>Is Owen \u2013 the subject of a glossy 32-page advertising brochure dreamt up by his management company before joining Manchester United \u2013 a striker we will only start fully appreciating once he finally retires?</p>",
  "<p>There is no \"off switch\" for the internet, says the British inventor of the world wide web \u2013 and that is a good thing, because it could only be undone by governments around the world coordinating to turn it into a centralised system.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/timbernerslee\" title=\"\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, who launched the first web page on Christmas Day 1990, was speaking at the launch of a global league table showing which countries put the web to work best.</p> <p>His \"off switch\" comments came after concerns were expressed last year that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak\" title=\"\">former Egyptian regime led by Hosni Mubarak </a>had suppressed the use of the web to try to damp down the revolution that eventually overthrew it.</p> <p>Berners-Lee, 57, said: \"The way the internet is designed is very much as a decentralised system. At the moment, because countries connect to each other in lots of different ways, there is no one off switch, there is no central place where you can turn it off.</p> <p>\"In order to be able to turn the whole thing off or really block, suppress one particular idea then the countries and governments would have to get together and agree and co-ordinate and turn it from a decentralised system to being a centralised system.</p> <p>\"And if that does happen it is really important that everybody fights against that sort of direction.\"</p> <p>His comments came on the same day that Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of the collaborative online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, gave evidence to MPs about proposals to monitor and store details about emails and other internet communications. Wales has frequently expressed strong opposition to the suggestion of extending government control of the internet; earlier this year he called for a blackout of Wikipedia to protest at a proposed US law which would have been able to shut down non-US sites alleged to infringe copyright.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/17/tim-berners-lee-monitoring-internet\" title=\"\">Berners-Lee told the Guardian earlier this year that the government should abandon the proposals</a>, calling them \"a destruction of human rights\" and warning that \"the amount of control you have over somebody if you can monitor internet activity is amazing.\"</p> <p>The global league table, launched on Wednesday by the World Wide Web Foundation, showed Sweden as the top country for its use of the web, with the US second and the UK in third place. Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Yemen were the bottom three of 61 countries measured using indicators such as the political, economic and social impact of the web, connectivity and use.</p> <p>The league table, which will be updated annually and will also try to measure absolute as well as relative improvements, uses data from the past five years, and compares elements such as the extent to which relevant and useful content is available to citizens; the political, economic and social impact of the web; the speed of connections; and levels of censorship. The UK's scores were lowest for web usage and social impact. China, despite having the world's largest internet population, ranked 29th, and was 42nd in terms of political impact out of the 61 countries examined.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on September 6 as it incorrectly listed Nepal, Cameroon and Mali as being the bottom three countries in the Index.</p>",
  "<p><strong>BG</strong> came under pressure after talk of a share placing went round the market.</p> <p>Traders said Deutsche Bank had placed 41m shares at \u00a312.25 each, although BG refused to comment on \"market speculation.\" Meanwhile analysts at Jefferies cut their target price on BG from \u00a320 to \u00a318 to reflect concerns about its Brazil businesses:</p> <blockquote> BG's Brazil exposure is creating a conundrum. By 2020, Brazil will account for around 40% of BG's production. We believe BG either needs to achieve scale and significance, or take some value off the table. Outside of doing nothing, we continue to see BG with ultimately two decisions relating to its growing pre-salt Brazil production exposure. Either BG needs to divest some Brazil exposure and crystallise value, or we also explore the potential of BG merging or acquiring to create a larger, more capable organisation. </blockquote> <p>The gases group closed 50p lower at \u00a312.21 in another uncertain day for the market.</p> <p>Investors were not keen to commit themselves ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank meeting, which is due to unveil plans to buy government bonds to support struggling eurozone countries such as Spain and Italy. Some details of the plan emerged during the day, but this did little to dispel the cautious mood.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 14.15 points lower at 5657.86, its second day of decline. Tuesday's poor US manufacturing figures raised further fears of a continuing slowdown in the global economy, as did slightly worse than expected Australian growth data. Added to the prospect of weaker demand from China, that put more pressure on the mining sector, despite analysts at Bernstein beginning coverage on a number of companies with an outperform rating. These include <strong>Rio Tinto</strong>, 4p lower at \u00a327.18, and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, down 48.5p to 1778.5p. BHP shares also went ex-dividend.</p> <p><strong>Lonmin</strong> lost another 35p to 529.5p as striking South African miners marched near its Marikana mine, where 34 protestors were shot dead by police last month. There was talk it might need to raise $1.25bn in a rights issue.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> fell 12.75p to 423.85p as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/05/deepwater-horizon-us-bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">the US justice department took a strong position against the company regarding the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010</a>.</p> <p>With relatively little in the way of corporate news, a number of broker comments had an effect on share prices. <strong>Wolseley</strong> rose 58p to \u00a326.20 after JP Morgan Cazenove issued an overweight recommendation on the building materials group:</p> <blockquote> JP Morgan's US strategy team argues that we remain in the early stages of a 3- to 5-year up-cycle in US residential construction. We believe the same is true of the Wolseley investment case; while the stock is up 21% year to date and 69% year on year, we still see significant value, based on 1) its US market exposure, which we estimate could provide more than 13% upside to 2014 earnings per share, 2) a potential capital return announcement near-term; even on our base-case estimates we believe there is scope to buy back almost a third of the market cap over three years, 3) ongoing self-help could provide further mid-single-digit upside, and 4) the valuation remains undemanding. </blockquote> <p><strong>BT</strong> was 1.1p better at 222.4p after the same broker has moved its recommendation from neutral to overweight, and raised its price target from 240p to 250p. Analyst Carl Murdock-Smith said:</p> <blockquote> We upgrade BT due to the relative attraction we see versus European incumbents.

The bank said it believed the first half figures would mark the low point for a number of high street groups, including Home Retail:</p> <blockquote> If Argos can produce broadly stable like for like sales again in the second quarter, its long term sales decline will look more cyclical than structural. If so, the consensus view that the operating companies have no value (net cash plus debtor book equals share price) will look misplaced. The upcoming Argos managing director will also tackle some of the remaining structural issues. <br> Our buy ratings on Marks &amp; Spencer and Home Retail are generally anti-consensus and would benefit both from a further recovery in the UK consumer as well as their own self-help programmes. </blockquote> <p>Despite the generally slow news day there were a couple of bid developments. <strong>Britvic</strong> jumped 41.3p to 369.9p after the soft drinks group said it was in talks about an all share merger with Irn-Bru maker <strong>AG Barr</strong>, up 34.6p at 450.2p. Traders suggested Britvic was now in play and could be attractive to the likes of PepsiCo or Diageo.</p> <p>Lower down the market, luxury jewellery designer <strong>Theo Fennell</strong> roes 3.25p to 15p after saying it was in preliminary bid talks with EME Capital, a group involved in the buyout of London's Soho House club.</p> <p>Finally, in contrast to struggling rival JJB Sports, <strong>Sports Direct International</strong> saw sales surge over the summer.</p> <p>Not only has Sports Direct scored a virtual knockout of JJB, it also received an Olympic boost, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/04/uk-retail-sales-olympics-august?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">unlike many UK retailers</a>.

  "<p>As Andrew Mitchell moves on from his work on international development, first as an opposition spokesman and then as a government minister, he should be proud of some aspects of his legacy. He has focused his energy and determination on results, accountability and transparency (a particular bugbear of his, on which he has led the world), energising certain parts of the international development firmament and illuminating lazy and shoddy practices in the UK and abroad. Something about the Conservative brand of impatience with welfare may also have had a positive influence, coinciding with an emerging insistence from many aid-dependent countries that it is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/04/justine-greening-uk-aid-exit-strategy?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">time to develop exit strategies from aid</a> more actively than has been the case in the past.</p> <p>If you think the main role of rich countries in reducing world poverty is to grow their aid budgets and manage them moderately well, then you may agree with Justin Forsyth, the head of Save the Children UK, that the Tory government <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/9084390/PIC-AND-PUB-PLSSave-the-Children-Global-infant-mortality-rate-falls-nearly-40-says-new-report.html\" title=\"\">should be completely trusted on aid and development</a>.</p> <p>Pandering to power is an inevitable part of being a large international charity or research organisation these days; it's where much of the money comes from. But in reality, aid is not very important for development, as an increasing number of analysts and lobby groups now realise. Poverty reduction is a function of two main drivers \u2013 technological advance and socio-political rebalancing \u2013 leading to a fairer allocation of scarce resources (in which economic growth often plays an important role). While not insignificant in a handful of countries (the poorest and smallest), aid is no more than a drop in the ocean of resources needing fairer allocation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/07/nigerian-indonesian-officials-post-busan-panel\" title=\"\">The aid effectiveness agenda</a> has had some successes in turning the tide of donor arrogance and aligning external funds with domestic endeavours, but its lasting and unfortunate impact has been to divert the world's attention towards technocratic tinkering and away from what really matters: systemic change.</p> <p>Mitchell has contributed to the misleading notion that international development is an apolitical activity. If he had his way, the UK's development scene would more closely resemble a charity auction than a political movement.</p> <p>There's nothing wrong with charity, of course, and it often does a great deal of good. But it is an incredibly limited way to understand the needs of the poor in this era of globalisation.</p> <p>The UK's Conservative party is engaged in a right-wing agenda at home, rolling back the state and inviting the market to engage further with basic services like health and education. Attempts to rebalance a manifestly sub-optimal financial system following the crash have been rebuffed in favour of (broadly) preserving the status quo.</p> <p>The pro-market ideology being foisted on Britain by the Tories is also colouring the government's attitude to development abroad, and globalisation. Better regulation of companies and fairer trade with poorer nations has long since dropped from the agenda in favour of better terms for UK companies and investors. And does anyone remember climate change? Rather than focus on the major issues \u2013 sustainable development and poverty reduction \u2013 we are exhorted to focus on aid, sold as the generosity of a kind-hearted nation.</p> <p>All the major parties in the UK maintain this facade. While developing an increasingly convincing line on cronyism and rapacious capitalism at home, the Labour party has failed to apply such a moderately radical analysis to poverty in the rest of the world, which suffers far more than the UK from this global economic disease. It's a cynical political calculation: the Labour party knows that it is just as important to transform capitalism globally as nationally, but shies away from saying so, preferring the easy apolitical fudge of aid.</p> <p>The irony, of course, is that eschewing politics, or pretending to, whether you are a government minister or a poverty charity, is itself a political act \u2013 it means implicitly supporting the status quo. At least Mitchell and his fellow conservatives really believe in charity rather than systemic change, and are practising what they preach.</p> <p>Interestingly, after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/04/andrew-mitchell-justine-greening-uk-development?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">this week's cabinet reshuffle</a>, commentators are picking over the political leanings of the new ministers for justice, health and transport, but not international development, a department apparently devoid of politics. What kind of politics does the new minister for international development, Justine Greening, espouse? No one asks and no one cares; her job is to manage an aid portfolio apolitically.</p> <p>The battle lines are drawn in the UK. On one side, a right-wing political project seeks to protect those who presently wield economic and political power from the emerging social backlash, entrenching a market-based approach to public service provision; on the other, a tentative left-wing response calls for a more radical overhaul, finally focusing on inequality as a major social determinant. The same battle is being played out the world over. Mitchell's legacy is successfully to have shielded the British public from engaging in such debates by focusing with such brio on the aid budget.</p>",

That option is now thought to be dead: Salmond is understood to be committed to a single question vote in 2014.</p> <p>Salmond's most influential and experienced special adviser, Kevin Pringle, moved last month from his government post to become the SNP's head of strategic communications; on Sunday, the official Yes Scotland independence campaign unveiled its executive team.</p> <p>Salmond said on Wednesday that a date had been pencilled in within the next few weeks for his meeting with David Cameron to agree the terms of the 2014 referendum and the legislation needed to enact it; Downing Street said dates were under discussion, but none had yet been confirmed. The first minister said he believed a deal would be struck when he meets the prime minister.</p> <p>Crawford had been leading the talks with Mundell on the precise detail of the referendum, which is now widely tipped to see votes for 16- and 17-year-olds; supervision by the Electoral Commission; legal approval by the Westminster government; and a single \"yes or no\" question on independence.</p> <p>Salmond said both he and Cameron were keen for that deal to be struck. \"My understanding [is] he's anxious to have the meeting and I'm anxious to have it,\" he said. \"I think progress has been made.

  "<h2>MY DECADE(NCE) IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE</h2> <p>Earlier this year, the Fiver filled out some forms in the hope of competing in this Paralympics shindig that's going on right now. But apparently, according to the pedantic pen-pushers in charge of said contest, Laziness, Cowardice and Eating Loads Of Crisps aren't technically impairments, and our application was rejected. Well, to hell with it, we didn't want to play anyway. In fact, the Fiver is getting heartily sick of all the body fascism going on this summer. Look at the Olympics: if you can run 10,000 metres in under 28 minutes or ride 27.3 miles on a pushbike in 50:39.54, you're some sort of national hero. Fall asleep on the couch balancing a bag of crisps on your belly without once rolling over on the bag and getting small bits of crisp stuck in the fluff of your belly button \u2013 go ahead and mock, but you try it \u2013 and nobody wants to know. Yes, the Fiver is getting, quite literally, heartily sick.</p> <p>So hats off \u2013 and we would take our hat off, if we could have been bothered to put one on in the first place \u2013 to Wayne Rooney. Last week Manchester United finally got rid of Dimitar Berbatov, the man who turned immobile insouciance into an art form, and so now Rooney has taken it upon himself to fill the spiritual gap vacated by a player who could only be enticed away from the chaise longue by a line of Players No6 stretching from Old Trafford to the back of a bike shed near Hammersmith. \"Like most blokes I put on a few pounds after a holiday,\" admitted Lil Wayne today, in an extract from his new cookbook My Decade In The Premier League. Seems the striker once turned up for pre-season training more than half a stone overweight. \"The scales in the club gym tell me I've put on a few more pounds than expected. Seven! Then I remember I drank a few bevvies while I was away. I'm stocky.\"</p> <p>It's the sort of full and frank admission that's almost certainly going to attract criticism, from the sort of tedious churl also no doubt impressed by people who can swim 10km in 10 minutes shy of two hours, or make it all the way to the shops and back for cake without having a quick coronary thrombosis by the bus stop.

How we pine for the more honest, innocent days when Jan Molby could boss the midfield with a hotdog in each hand, Paul Gascoigne dribbled down the inside-right channel with a pint and a fag on, and Micky Quinn could score 20 goals a season without once getting out of his mobility car. Modern football needs fewer fitness freaks, and more people like Rooney, to keep things real. Now, having told it like it is, the Fiver's a bit tired.

  "<p>Personal and stinging attacks in the state media heralded the US secretary of state's arrival in Beijing. \"Many people in China dislike Hillary Clinton,\" said an editorial in the state-run Global Times. \"She has brought new and extremely profound mutual distrust between the mainstream societies of the two countries.\" Such stringent remarks were extremely unusual on the eve of a visit by a US secretary of state, noted Shi Yinhong, an expert on the bilateral relationship.</p> <p>While Clinton's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/clinton-china-differences-syria-sea-row?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">press conference with Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi</a> was more civil, it suggested no sign of movement on key issues. The two countries remain at an impasse over Syria and tension persists over the complicated and long-running territorial wrangle in the South China Sea, involving China and numerous other regional powers.</p> <p>Both sides \u2013 but particularly the US \u2013 were likely to have sought discussion on the intensifying Sino-Japanese row over the Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea, added Shi, who is director of the Centre for American Studies at Renmin University. He added: \"In the past, when the relationship has not been good, they have tried to improve the atmosphere. But even the appearance has not been remarkably improved, let alone the substance.\"</p> <p>Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University, said the relationship appeared to be at its lowest point since Obama came to power. Yan said China wanted the US \"to take a more constructive policy to reduce these conflicts [over the Diaoyutai and South China Sea] rather than allow them to escalate\". Many in China fear Washington is seeking to contain its rival as it grows more powerful, particularly since its decision to refocus foreign policy.</p> <p>\"The US has tried to pivot to Asia. That's a new strategy and has created some suspicions on the Chinese side,\" said Jin Canrong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. \"Fortunately, the mainstream on the Chinese side are rather reasonable ... The result is that although the atmosphere is not good, the structure remains the same: competition and cooperation coexisting.\"</p> <p>Some fear relations could deteriorate if China becomes a high-profile issue in the US presidential race. But Chinese observers are used to candidates talking tough about Beijing during elections before reverting to a more measured stance.</p> <p>\"Despite the bluffing on the campaign trail, from the Chinese perspective we should assume whoever becomes president of the US will have enough composure to realise the stupidity of fooling around with China-US relations, which are the most important bilateral relationship in the world,\" said Victor Gao, director of the China Association of International Studies and a former translator for Deng Xiaoping. \"It's not a zero-sum game, like with the US and the former Soviet Union.\"</p>",

She says: \"The PhD candidate, compared to others in the British higher-education landscape, is most at sea in terms of international opportunity \u2026 PhDs are supposed to push boundaries of knowledge, not encourage acquiescence; however free-thinking an institution may be, it is surely harder to think anew when fixed in one place, among one group of people\".</p> <p>And Tanya is not the only espousing the benefits of global exposure.

  "<p>The man likely to be responsible for the Charity Commission has given a warning over fundraising tactics, particularly \"chugging\".</p> <p>In a pre-appointment confirmation hearing before the House of Commons <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/pasc/\" title=\"\">public administration committee</a> on Wednesday, the new chair-designate of the <a href=\"http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Charity Commission</a>, the writer and broadcaster<a href=\"http://www.williamshawcross.com/\" title=\"\"> William Shawcross</a>, indicated that, if appointed, he would look at the regulatory environment governing fundraising.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.elphicke.com/\" title=\"\">Tory MP Charles Elphicke</a> said that aggressive fundraising by charities in places such as shopping centres was causing a substantial loss of public confidence in charities and asked Shawcross whether he would look at \"chugging\" and consider bringing in new regulations. Shawcross said that such practices \"certainly should be looked at\", adding \"it damages charities\", although he said that the commission should act only if a charity's trustees had failed to address public concerns about fundraisers' behaviour. Shawcross promised that he would address what <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/2012/jul/16/charity-sector-responds-hodgson-report\" title=\"\">Lord Hodgson's recent report</a> referred to as the \"confused self-regulatory landscape\" in relation to fundraising.</p> <p>Shawcross also described Lord Hodgson's suggestion that the Charity Commission could charge charities for filing their returns as \"a sensible suggestion\". He said that such a move would be \"unprecedented and could cause a bit of grief\", but said that \"many other regulatory agencies charge ... and I think it's something we may have to come to\".</p> <p>Asked about his priorities if he were appointed, Shawcross said top of his list would be to learn, saying \"I am very conscious that I have a lot to learn about the charity sector and about the commission\".</p> <p>He praised the job that the <a href=\"http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/About_us/About_the_Commission/commissioners.aspx\" title=\"\">commission's chief executive Sam Younger</a> had done in restructuring the organisation, and said that he hoped to build a close relationship with him.</p> <p>Shawcross said that, in his first year, he would visit all of the commission's offices around country and would speak to small and large charities. He described small charities as \"the backbone of the sector\", and said they sometimes feel left out. He would want to look at the problem of their regulation, saying that some felt \"swamped by regulation\", adding that a small charity from south London had come to him to ask him to help with the regulatory burden.</p> <p>He expressed particular concern about the Hodgson report's suggestion that the income threshold for registration of charities increase from \u00a35,000 to \u00a325,000, saying that small organisations would continue to exist and a \"shadow world of charities who would fall below the threshold\" would be created. Shawcross said that he could see why paying trustees might be necessary in some cases, especially in larger charities, but voluntarism should be the norm: \"I can see why it's thought to be necessary. In some charities, it's very, very time consuming. I can see why, but on the whole it should be the exception not the rule. The voluntary paradigm has been wonderful for hundreds of years and should continue to be the norm.\"</p> <p>Asked by <a href=\"http://www.roberthalfon.com/\" title=\"\"> Robert Halfon</a>, the Conservative MP for Harlow, how his experience in the sector had prepared him for the task of chairing the commission, Shawcross cited his work as a trustee and working pro bono for charities, including serving on the board of the <a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Disasters Emergency Committee</a> and helping to create the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/\" title=\"\">International Crisis Group </a>on whose board and executive board he sat for 10 years, although he admitted that those roles didn't demand the kind of work that chairing the Charity Commission would require.</p> <p>Shawcross also indicated that, at least initially, he would work longer than the two days a week \u2013 reduced from three under Dame Suzi Leather \u2013 that the role demanded, saying: I suspect that it'll be more than two days a week to understand and do it properly, and I'd be more than prepared to do that.</p> <p>On the question of public benefit, Shawcross said that the commission was in a \"difficult place\" as Parliament had not defined public benefit, and that it could not be defined by Parliament to fit every single case and charity.</p> <p>He rejected a suggestion from Labour<a href=\"http://www.paulflynnmp.co.uk/\" title=\"\"> MP Paul Flynn </a>that his attendance at <a href=\"http://www.etoncollege.com/\" title=\"\">Eton</a> would put him in a compromised position, given its charitable status. Shawcross said that many hundreds of schools are charities \u2013 and that education had always been regarded as a charitable function. He said that he was very lucky to go to Eton and said that it \"performs considerable public benefits\".</p> <p>The committee will publish a report in the next few days, giving its views on Shawcross's appointment. If the report, which is voted on by committee members, recommends that the government does not proceed with the appointment, Shawcross could come under pressure to withdraw from the process.

  "<p>Canada's claims of progress on meeting its carbon targets do not add up, according to <a href=\"http://climateactiontracker.org/assets/publications/briefing_papers/2012-09-04_Briefing_paper_Bangkok.pff.pdf\" title=\"\">an independent analysis published on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>In August, <a href=\"http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=714D9AAE-1&amp;news=D59B6AF5-5533-49F7-9CEA-52DE5F3766C5\" title=\"\">the government said</a> it was halfway to its 2020 emissions goal of a 17% cut on 2005 levels, but the analysis \u2013 the first to date \u2013 says Canada's cuts amount to one-third at best.</p> <p>\"They're [Canada] just playing with numbers to pretend they've actually done something to reduce their emissions,\" said Marion Vieweg, a policy analyst working with the <a href=\"http://www.climateactiontracker.org/\" title=\"\">Climate Action Tracker</a> (CAT), an independent science-based assessment that tracks the emission commitments and actions of countries.</p> <p>The Canadian government is taking credit for the emissions declines caused by the 2009 recession and the energy trend away from coal to gas, Vieweg told the Guardian from Bangkok at the close of the <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/meetings/bangkok_aug_2012/meeting/6812.php\" title=\"\">latest UN climate summit</a>.</p> <p>\"There is no information in their reports about their policies that are actually driving emission reductions.\"</p> <p>\"The [Stephen] Harper government has been working hard to reduce emissions,\" said the environment minister, Peter Kent, last month, announcing the government's statistics. Only a year ago the Harper government said it was 25% cent of the way to its 2020 target.</p> <p>A big part of the difference is a change in the UN rules this year that allows Canada to claim emissions credits for its vast forests because they absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. But on the other side of the ledger, Canada is one of biggest logging nations and its forests have experienced massive fires and insect outbreaks that have killed hundreds of millions of trees in recent years. Those emissions are missing in Canada's new numbers and the Harper government assumes there will be few fires or insect problems over the next eight years to 2020, says Vieweg.</p> <p>Meanwhile emissions from Canada's huge tar sands operations will represent 51% of the entire oil/gas sector in 2012, an increase from a share of only 20% in 2005.</p> <p>Canada has been using current data and measuring it against old projections. And it has begun using a methodology previously only used by developing countries, the CAT report found.</p> <p>\"Canada is using accounting tricks to make it look like they are taking action when it's not,\" she said.</p> <p>This week <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ottawa-to-unveil-weakened-emissions-rules-for-coal-fired-power/article4519655/\" title=\"\">Kent is expected to announce tougher regulations for new coal plants</a>. A year ago draft regulations capped emissions from new coal plants at 375 tonnes of carbon dioxide per gigawatt hour of electricity generated. Media reports suggest the actual standard will be relaxed to about 420 tonnes.</p>",
  "<p>The night was already surprising enough before a man in a bathrobe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/quebec-elections-parti-quebecois-minority\" title=\"\">shot someone</a> outside Pauline Marois's victory rally in downtown Montreal. Only a short time earlier, separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ) leader Marois became the province's premier-in-waiting, gathering 54 seats in the National Assembly and a minority government. The shooting will likely go down as a disturbing moment in Canadian political history. But what about the <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebecvotes2012/story/2012/09/03/quebec-election-night-results-2012.html\" title=\"\">election results</a>?</p> <p>As Quebecers woke up this morning to the new world of a PQ minority government (and say goodbye to now-former premier Jean Charest, who was unable to hold his own seat), the rest of the country will equally be wondering what comes next. That includes those just over the provincial border in Ottawa, where the ghost of past national existential nightmares is looming once again. Marois's victory means that, like it or not, the question of separation is back on the table in Canada. In August, Marois told reporters that the government would have final say on any question of sovereignty, but the PQ platform posited that a referendum could be held on any issue that garnered 15% support from Quebecers \u2013 about 850,000 people \u2013 by way of a signed petition. It's ambiguous enough to keep everyone guessing, as it is no doubt designed to do \u2013 especially for those outside Quebec.</p> <p>While the prime minister, Stephen Harper, congratulated Marois in an official statement on her Tuesday night victory, he said that \"We do not believe that Quebecers wish to revisit the old constitutional battles of the past.\" The federal Conservative government, he said, \"will continue to work with the government of Quebec toward our common goals.\" But it might be worth asking at this juncture what those common goals are. The government's recent agenda and its decisions regarding federal gun registry and employment insurance have put it at odds with Quebec. As much as Marois was fighting her opponents in Quebec, she launched a seemingly equal number of jabs at the prime minister and Ottawa, telling her supporters she would fight to regain more sovereignty in ways that are surely not possible, such as the demand that Quebec begin handling its own employment insurance, overseas aid and even citizenship. In each case, Ottawa would be constitutionally forced to oppose, thus leading to further animosity and, Marois must assume, an increased perception that the federal government is acting against Quebec's interests.</p> <p>For the federal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party\" title=\"\">New Democratic party</a> (NDP), Marois's victory is perhaps even more interesting. The party holds 58 seats in Quebec \u2013 far more than the Conservatives, who only managed to hold on to five in the 2011 federal election. Since its groundbreaking result, the NDP has positioned itself as a staunchly federalist party, and its leader, former Quebec Liberal party cabinet minister Thomas Mulcair has already promised that by the time Quebecers go to the polls again, there will be a provincial NDP there, waiting for their votes. Already the NDP has made a serious attempt to position itself as the only federalist choice for Quebecers. Marois's victory may have made that argument even stronger.</p> <p>In the meantime, Quebec might transform. If the PQ fulfils its campaign promises, Quebec public servants will no longer be allowed to wear any religious symbols except for the crucifix (that would include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah\" title=\"\">yarmulkes</a> and head scarves), non-French speaking Quebecers will be barred from public office, and there will be even further restrictions on the use of English in schools and workplaces. Should all of that take place, Quebec is at risk of suffering a population drain, as its citizens \u2013 particularly its Anglophones \u2013 start to look to the rest of Canada for a less discriminatory environment. Which would be an unfortunate and disturbing result indeed.</p>",
  "<p>It's said that you can't polish a turd, but every now and again (like this week) the world of politics suggests that if you get enough turds in one place, you can<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_reshuffle\"> reshuffle</a> them and hope it looks like a polishing.</p> <p>Of course, I mentioned this on Twitter. However, I largely follow, and am in turn followed by, scientists and geeky types, and there's nothing scientist and geek types love more than pointing out that someone is wrong about something/anything. So I was told, several times, that <a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mythbusters/\">Mythbusters</a> have demonstrated that it is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiJ9fy1qSFI\">indeed possible to polish a turd</a>. And just as a heads up, that previous link is NSFPE (Not Safe for People Eating).</p> <p>I don't know what the take home message of this is, except maybe that, when it comes to improving your image, politicians are worse than turds? But then, it seems it doesn't matter what party you're in or what your views are, if you're a mainstream politician you have to work hard to simply not be automatically loathed.</p> <p>I understand relatively little about politics, and for the sake of my fragile sanity I like to keep it this way. I observed the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19475248\">recent reshuffle of the UK cabinet</a> with little interest. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/24/prince-harry-lance-armstrong-psychology\">As is my wont</a>, I was more interested in the general reactions, which ranged from the resigned acceptance of a prisoner observing that the most sadistic guard is wearing a new shirt, to the outright horror of someone who's just noticed their inebriated taxi driver is wearing a necklace made of human ears. Nobody I know of is happy about any of the changes, at any rate.</p> <p>But as a scientist, this confuses me. The general consensus among many is that things will be much worse as a result of this reshuffle, but why would our prime minister actively make things worse? A reshuffle is a typical response to falling polling figures and public disapproval, so making things worse is logically the last thing someone who wants to hold on to their job would do, what with <a href=\"http://www.enotes.com/self-preservation-reference/self-preservation\">self-preservation</a> being such a powerful motivator.</p> <p>So, a thought experiment. As far-fetched as it may seem to many, let's assume that:</p> <p>A. There is a logical rationale behind all of the changes made in the recent reshuffle, and<br>B. Each change is intended to benefit the UK as a whole.</p> <p>It may be quite a stretch, but let's assume David Cameron is acting for the good of everyone. Whatever the reason, let's assume Cameron meant well with even the more controversial changes to the cabinet. </p> <p>As mentioned in the headline, the main concern people seem to have is the appointment of the health secretary. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lansley\">Andrew Lansley</a> has been sacked and replaced by<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt_(politician)\"> Jeremy Hunt</a>. This has a lot of people worried, given Hunt's lack of experience, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/04/jeremy-hunt-nhs-tribute-homeopathy?newsfeed=true\">controversial views on healthcare</a> and previous record of being a<a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2012-04-28/voters-think-jeremy-hunt-should-resign/\"> corporate stooge</a>. Lansley wasn't popular, but many see this as being a case of out of the frying pan and into a worse frying pan, one with a lot of crap still stuck to it from the last time it was used and wielded by a chef who enjoys giving people food poisoning</p> <p>But as suggested, maybe there is a rationale for this. For example, despite his record, Hunt is 10 years younger, noticeably slimmer and has got much darker hair than Lansley. Ergo, he looks healthier, which is reassuring for a health secretary, like having your optician wear glasses. People are <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9516.html\">more approving</a> of more \"vibrant\" looking individuals. </p> <p>But Hunt may also help the health services of the UK, albeit inadvertently. He <a href=\"http://thewall.co.uk/topics/34218-jeremy-hunt-new-health-secretary-called-for-the\">officially doesn't like the NHS</a>, and most people tend to avoid things they don't like. Rather than progress with<a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e709\"> Lansley's chaotic reforms,</a> Hunt may spend three years making excuses to avoid dealing with it at all, thus limiting the damage. </p> <p>Hunt is also seemingly <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100179258/jeremy-hunt-health-secretary-thinks-homeopathy-works/\">pro-homeopathy</a>. I've made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/16/antidote-celebrities-promote-homeopathy\">my views on homeopathy quite clear</a>, but Hunt may wish to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/31/timeline-jeremy-hunt-bskyb-bid\">increase the role of homeopathy in the NHS</a>. Similarly he wanted to increase the role of Sky in the British media, and that <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/rupert-murdochs-expansion-hopes-crushed-after-bskyb-bid-collapse-6421709.html\">didn't end too well</a>. He may well work similar magic with homeopathy during his time in the post.</p> <p>But even if he does go ahead with the expansion of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/may/03/hinchingbrooke-hospital-eyewatering-cuts\">private involvement with the NHS</a>, the main company involved in this so far seems to be<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson\"> Richard Branson's</a> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9176733/NHS-patients-to-be-treated-by-Virgin-Care-in-500m-deal.html\">Virgin</a>, whereas Hunt is unquestionably <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19127427\">Rupert Murdoch's man</a>. There is <a href=\"http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/sky-reignites-public-feud-with-virgin-media/2056673.article\">no love lost between Murdoch and Branson</a>, so maybe with Hunt in charge this feud will extend to private health care? Like pitting an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10817277\">insidious virus against an aggressive cancer</a>, maybe the two companies will spend so much time fighting each other they'll be too depleted to wreak further damage to health service, assuming it's still standing. </p> <p>Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. There's a slim chance that a similar principle is at work here, in that Hunt's failings will help cancel out Lansley's. One can but hope.</p> <p>Perhaps similar logic can be applied to the appointment of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McLoughlin\">Patrick McLoughlin</a> as secretary of state for transport? The main concern is that he will approve the building of a third runway at Heathrow. As a non-Londoner, this is a controversy that has passed me by, but apparently<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19484126\"> it's a big one.</a> It's believed that McLoughlin will approve a construction of a third runway as he has no prior involvement with the matter. </p> <p>However, the quote often used to refer to this is that he \"<a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/update/2012-09-04/mcloughlins-role-to-rethink-airports/\">carries no baggage</a>\" with regards to the matter. He may have been speaking entirely literally. Having no baggage is something that happens a lot after a visit to Heathrow. This would undoubtedly put him off wanting to increase the possibility of this happening with a third runway.</p> <p>A third runway also means more planes, and a man who is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-patrick-mcloughlin-transport?newsfeed=true\">afraid of flying </a>surely wouldn't want that. If anything, if his <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618597000091\">phobia is strong enough</a>, he could irrationally want to reduce the number of planes currently operating out of the UK altogether, perhaps by converting existing runways into ludicrously long basketball courts. </p> <p>McLoughlin may end up inadvertently doing <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/aviation_climate_change.pdf\">more for the environment</a> than an<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/apr/19/eyjafjallajokull-volcano-climate-carbon-emissions\"> Icelandic volcano</a>.</p> <p>There may even be a reason for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Clarke\">Kenneth Clarke</a>, who has gone from secretary of state for justice to minister without portfolio. This seems like a demotion of a popular, established politician, but it may be a calculated move. Clarke is now a wealthy figure with a lot of time in his hands, a taste for dispensing justice and one who has been let down by authority figures. These are ideal circumstances to cause him to become some sort of <a href=\"http://darkanon.edublogs.org/2011/03/23/top-10-comic-book-vigilantes/\">vigilante hero</a>, dealing with criminals using his own resources at no cost to the state. </p> <p>I'll stop this line of thought there though, as it could eventually lead to images of Clarke in<a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=lycra+catsuit\"> tight lycra</a>, and nobody needs that.</p> <p>For obvious reasons, I've focused on the changes that have a potential scientific impact (health, environment \u2026 Batman) but there may be a similar, positive rationale for all of Cameron's cabinet changes. Or, more likely, this whole post is just a jumble of extreme extrapolation and half-baked theorising that would do a conspiracy theorist proud. Either way, it can't be as bad as the reality seems to be.</p> <p>Science is all about challenging boundaries and investigating the new, and I just wanted to see if it was possible to write an article with a positive interpretation of the recent reshuffle and have it put up by the Guardian.<br>If you're reading this, then apparently it is.</p> <p><em>If you're interested, Dean Burnett sometimes manages to sufficiently pad out his knowledge of politics to fill 140 characters on Twitter, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a><br></em></p>",

He added if Cameron really wanted to cut through the dither, there was no place like home.</p> <p>He reeled off statistics to show that previous government pledges to build new roads and social housing had come to nothing. Labour pushed out a dossier claiming major planning decisions are taking longer than under Labour.</p> <p>But the PM hit back, saying the government was \"strong and united\", contrasting coalition unity with the alleged disputes between the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, and Miliband.</p> <p>He cited reports suggesting an imperious Balls orders Miliband to bring him the coffee at shadow cabinet meetings. He claimed \"that is just how assertive and butch the leader of the opposition really is\".</p> <p>Cameron said he wanted every government department to be a growth department.</p> <p>Labour's Dennis Skinner opened the exchanges by claiming the reshuffle \"had not raised a ripple of interest\" in the public, whereas \"the loud boos that greeted the chancellor at the Olympic stadium will haunt him forever\".</p> <p>Balls, the shadow chancellor, reiterated his call for a long term property tax saying he was willing to work with the business secretary Vince Cable to work up detailed proposals. He said he was not interested in the proposal by the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg for a short term tax on the wealthy set out in recent Guardian interview.</p>",
  "<p>We can't escape the fact that maths skills are not only core to our understanding of other subjects but integral to the vitality of a modern economy. This assertion can lead to apprehension among teachers, pupils and parents alike; non-specialist primary school teachers who are concerned about gaps in their knowledge and students who are worried that failing maths will restrict their university and career options.</p> <p>I explain to my pupils that maths isn't there to catch them out. The key thing to impart is that by mastering some of the core principles, they can grasp a multitude of maths problems.</p> <p>Despite mathematics being regarded as a core skill, I still have to contend with parents' laissez faire attitude towards the subject. Parents will often say to me, in front of their children, \"I was rubbish at maths when I was in school\". Pupils can be led to believe that understanding maths is predetermined; you either get it or you don't. I find it interesting that there is a stigma associated with being illiterate but being innumerate can be a badge of honour to some pupils. We need to change this.</p> <p>There can be too much emphasis on memorising past paper questions and formulas, detracting from a true understanding of the rules that underpin certain mathematic theorem. Some GCSE students find it difficult to progress after struggling to grasp rules that were taught in year 9. To address this, it is vital to drum up enthusiasm for maths as early as possible. I make it clear to my students that I am a proud maths geek and that maths is my passion, as well as my profession.</p> <p>I find that appealing to young people's competitive nature can be an effective way of getting them enthusiastic about maths. I occasionally split the class into teams, maybe boys versus girls, and get them to answer arithmetic questions. The promise of sweets or wacky stationery can really motivate them to win.</p> <p>Having an interactive classroom that facilitates lots of discussion can encourage an environment where students aren't afraid to ask questions. You have to be prepared to move away from the lesson plan if important questions arise.</p> <p>Giving students a glimpse of where maths can lead them is important to guide and maintain their interest. Students need to know if their future career may require a maths qualification so they don't rule themselves out of a vocation later down the line. One student was surprised to discover that nutrition-related careers required maths.</p> <p>Mathematics can often be dismissed by pupils as having little relevance to their lives, so I try to include plenty of real life examples in my lessons to counter this. I will give my year 8 students a train timetable from Potters Bar to Cambridge along with cinema listings and restaurant times and get them to plan an evening using the times and distances; what time they need to get the train, what time they will arrive, will they leave enough time to catch the 8pm film? My students get excited about this type of problem-solving and often don't even realise they are applying maths.</p> <p>Not every lesson is going to be full of out of the box thinking - that would be exhausting. There will be times that simply require the students to practice textbook problems and all teachers will admit we get bogged down by paperwork and disheartened if some of our lessons aren't resonating with students. This is when peer support is invaluable and a specialist community of teachers can be an incredible support. </p> <p>As a teacher, there is always room for improvement and I have begged, borrowed and stolen ideas from my peers when I think it will help my class. My membership of the <a href=\"http://www.m-a.org.uk/jsp/index.jsp\">Mathematical Association</a> has given me access to some of the best maths brains in the country including its president, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/marcus-du-sautoy\">Marcus du Sautoy</a>. The meetings and workshops are always a great source of inspiration, prompting new ways of thinking which challenge me and ensure I remain on the path of professional development. This renewal of interest can help invigorate lessons, and it's the energy and passion for a subject that can help to switch students on to it.</p> <p>Whether you are teaching maths to capable A-level students or children who are struggling at GCSE foundation level, you have to keep their interest. Achieving a captivated and interested class can open the door to a deeper understanding of maths.</p> <p><em>Rachael Horsman is a mathematics teacher and assistant head teacher at Mount Grace Comprehensive School.

She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... the Department for Work and Pensions has assessed me as being fit for work. Not only that, but after my WCA, an appointment through which I sobbed as I described how severely my life is limited by my condition, I scored zero points out of the 15 necessary to remain on Employment and Support Allowance (sickness benefit). Despite submitting a lengthy letter detailing how my condition and my meds affect me, letters from my Consultant showing ever-increasing levels of medication, and a medical certificate recording me as unfit for work until at least the end of September, my benefit has been stopped.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>And she adds </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I guess I could wait until my current contract is wrapped up and start looking for another job. Of course an employer would have to be happy with me working just a few hours a day and being slow and stupid in the mornings, and with me not being able to commit to actually turning up from one week to the next, and variably crying or bouncing around manically in the office. But I'm sure there are hundreds of employers out there who would be cool with that, especially in a recession, right?<br>Or I can appeal. The Government's own figures show that that of the large number of appellants against WCA decisions, 40% are successful. For me, an appeal is not even about the money aspect; I am only entitled to ESA until October anyway, as I am on the \"contribution-based\" from which only lasts a year (because that's obviously completely adequate for supporting people with life-long conditions). It's about a system that refuses to tell its subjects who is assessing them and whether the [healthcare professionals] or Decision Makers have any training in mental health issues. It's about a system that requires a horribly distressed person to share the intimate details of how her condition disables her, and takes mere attendance as evidence that she is fit for work.<br>Damn straight I'll be appealing.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 An interesting post on the LabourList blog by Teresa Pearce, Labour MP for Erith and Thamesmead, in which she argues that <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/09/how-to-improve-labours-general-approach-to-welfare-issues/\" title=\"\">Labour should rethink its welfare policies</a>, \"particularly the primacy of the '<strong>tough on scroungers</strong>' line\". She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When that is seen by many as our only message on welfare, we have a problem. The values behind the welfare state our party created; that those that can work should do so, and those that cannot work should be supported, can get lost. 'Tough on scroungers' can slip easily into 'tough on benefits' and stigmatise whole groups of people in the process. The continuation of the 'tough' message is our response to polling data on attitudes towards people on out-of-work benefits, who are frequently categorised as lazy or pretending to be unable to work. If we want to be an electorally successful party, they say, then we need to look at what people think and what they want from a prospective Government. Whilst that is true to an extent, political parties do not exist just to reflect people's attitudes back to them. Political parties should be driven by values and the New Labour obsession with polling as our primary driver needs to take a back seat whilst we look at what, and who, our party stands for ahead of the next election.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A great question from the Same Difference blog, <a href=\"http://samedifference1.com/2012/09/05/why-cant-you-get-wheelchair-basketball-on-playstation/\" title=\"\">why can't you get wheelchair basketball on Playstation?</a> The topic was apparently raised during Channel 4's Paralympic coverage. Blogger Sarah Ismail writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I see no reason why today's children and teenagers shouldn't be able to play wheelchair sports games on games consoles. To me this seems like wheelchair dolls and teddy bears. Just like wheelchair using kids play with dolls and teddy bears, and should be able to have these toys in wheelchairs, they also play with games consoles. Wouldn't it be brilliant if they could see themselves on computer games?<br>Wouldn't it be brilliant if non-disabled children could learn through computer games that wheelchair sport does exist? This seems particularly relevant to today's generation who have games consoles of all makes, shapes and sizes and more interest in computer games than pretty much anything else.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19474239\" title=\"\">Fat 'doesn't have to mean unfit'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074548/fears-offenders-held-adult-prisons\" title=\"\">Fears over young offenders held in adult prisons</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/13294/20-year-old_drugs_prevention_charity_closes\" title=\"\">23-year-old drugs prevention charity closes</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/blogs/childrens-services-blog/2012/09/what-we-need-from-the-new-working-together.html\" title=\"\">'What we need from the new Working Together'</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-still-not-getting-basics-right-8105031.html\" title=\"\">NHS 'still not getting basics right'</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/regulation/sector-warns-housing-minister-has-hard-road-ahead/6523575.article\" title=\"\">Sector warns housing minister has hard road ahead</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106789\" title=\"\">Members reject proposal for Cornwall's \u00a3500m partnership with private sctor</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/spending-review-could-boost-pooled-budgets/\" title=\"\">Spending Review could boost pooled budgets</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9519886/Exclusive-2000-new-building-projects-approved-every-month-since-planning-shake-up.html\" title=\"\">Home builders helped by planning reforms</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1148266/more-half-englands-volunteer-centres-report-cuts-year/\" title=\"\">More than half of England's volunteer centres report cuts this year</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In a cave in south-west France an extinct animal materialises out of the dark. Drawn in vigorous black lines by an artist in the ice age, a woolly mammoth shakes hairs that hide its face and vaunts slender tusks that reach almost to the ground.</p> <p>Those tusks were not dangerous enough to save it. As human hunters advanced on its icy haunts, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120612144809.htm\" title=\"\">mammoths faced extinction between 4,000 and 10,000 years ago</a>. The end of the ice age did for these shaggy cold-lovers, but humans helped: <a href=\"http://donsmaps.com/images23/mammothhousekiev.jpg\" title=\"\">entire huts built from mammoth tusks and bones have been found</a>.</p> <p>We didn't mean to help make the mammoth extinct. The <a href=\"http://www.pechmerle.com/english/introduction.html\" title=\"\">wonderful portrait of a mammoth in Pech Merle cave</a> reveals that early homo sapiens was fascinated by these marvellous creatures. This <a href=\"http://donsmaps.com/images3/mammothpechmerle.jpg\" title=\"\">masterpiece of cave art</a> is as acute as any modern work of naturalist observation. The hunters who painted in caves showed the same passion for the natural world as their descendants do. Their culture must have been bereft when the mammoth vanished \u2013 even as they helped it on its way.</p> <p>In the 21st century the same paradox endures. Human activity endangers entire species, yet human culture is profoundly rooted in nature. The loss of a species is also a loss of the images, stories, symbols and wonders that we live by \u2013 to call it a cultural loss may sound too cerebral: what we lose when we lose animals is the very meaning of life. Those first artists in ancient caves portrayed animals far more than they portrayed people. It was in the wild herds around them that the power of the cosmos and the mystery of existence seemed to be located.</p> <p>No species in modern times embodies that fascination more fully than the tiger, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/09/last-chance-to-save-the-tiger\" title=\"\">one of today's most endangered predators</a>. Since the Romantic age tigers have been endowed in art and literature with the marvellous essence of life itself, a primeval power like the enigmatic strangeness the stone age artist saw in a mammoth. \"What immortal hand or eye,/ Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" wonders William Blake in his 1794 poem The Tyger. That same childlike awe \u2013 Blake's poem appears in his child's eye Songs of Innocence and Experience \u2013 is shared by Henri Rousseau's 1891 painting <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/henri-rousseau-surprised\" title=\"\">Surprised!</a> of an archetypal tiger in a fantastic jungle.</p> <p>These artistic hymns to the tiger are just the noblest expressions of an imagery that pervades modern culture from tigers who come to tea to tigers with neat feet. It just seems unimaginable that a creature so familiar in our shared dreams should vanish from the natural world. Human culture would lose immeasurably from such a disappearance. And what about sharks? More ancient than dinosaurs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/25/sharks-extinction-iucn-red-list\" title=\"\">under threat for the first time in their mind-bogglingly long history</a>, these creatures feed modern culture some of its darkest folklore. Shark films and scare stories are the modern equivalent of stone age hunters telling tales about bears and wolves around the fire. We fear them, but our culture needs them.</p> <p>Cute creatures as well as scary ones inspire the stories and myths that humans cannot live without. Amphibians, most threatened animal group of all, are among the most universal stars of culture. While Blake was marvelling at tigers, the Grimms recorded the folk tale of the frog-prince. Long before that Plato said the ancient Greeks were like frogs around a pond. Aristophanes wrote a comedy called The Frogs. American frogs <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1998.39.1-.20\" title=\"\">were depicted by the Aztecs</a> as well as providing Amazonian peoples with arrow poison. The very naming of poison dart frogs reveals how deeply they are associated with cultures that are themselves on the brink of extinction.</p> <p>In Britain too, the amphibious denizens of threatened waterlands have always inspired imaginations. Could our culture survive without Toad of Toad Hall?</p> <p>Not so long ago British beaches were seasonally covered with \"mermaid's purses\", the eggs of sharks and rays. The name reveals how deeply nature feeds folk culture, in Britain as in the Amazon. Is it possible still to find masses of mermaid's purses on the Welsh rocks where I used to wonder what they were? I have to look for them with my daughter soon, before it is too late. The range of animals and plants threatened by the sixth extinction \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/sixth-extinction\" title=\"\">as covered by the Guardian over this fortnight</a> \u2013 is such that it menaces the foundations of culture as well as the diversity of nature. We are part of nature and it has always fed our imaginations. We face the bare walls of an empty museum, a gallery of the dead.</p>",
  "<p>For years their voices have been among those filling my kitchen every morning and evening: tones so familiar they need no introduction. Radio 4 listeners might never have met announcers Charlotte Green or Harriet Cass but for many of us, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/05/radio-4-charlotte-green-harriet-cass\" title=\"\">news of their departure from the station</a> will still be met with a certain sadness.</p> <p>Cass and Green, who have provided the punctuation to frantic mornings and drowsy evenings for 74 years between them, are to take voluntary redundancy in the New Year. No longer will their melodious tones deliver news bulletins and continuity announcements \u2013&#xa0;and no longer will listeners tune in hoping for a reprise of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/audio/2008/mar/28/charlotte.green\">Green's gloriously inappropriate giggle</a>.</p> <p>Both Cass and Green have beautiful voices, of course \u2013 Green, in particular, has a voice that almosts melts across the airwaves, enveloping you in a rich velvet hug \u2013 but that is not the only reason for the pair's popularity with listeners. Neither is it that their personalities and presenting style have made an enormous impact on their roles.</p> <p>In fact, it's rather the opposite: we enjoy the brief moments where the real Cass and Green are revealed but it's the dependable familiarity of both that appeals. Radio 4 announcers aren't there to be zany and self-promoting. They are part of the fabric of the station \u2013 in lots of ways they are Radio 4 in a way that show presenters never quite can be.</p> <p>Routine plays a big part in radio listening. I don't listen exclusively to Radio 4 (although admittedly, every so often I find myself heading in that direction, and have to remember to reintroduce other stations) but it always provides the backing track to my weekday mornings and early evenings. Sad though it undoubtedly sounds, I probably hear the voices of station announcers and newsreaders more often than I hear those of some friends.</p> <p>Which is perhaps why the departure of Cass and Green feels like more of a loss than rationally I know it should do. But for regular listeners, they have been talking to us for years \u2013&#xa0; and we've been having an, admittedly one-sided, conversation with them for longer than some friendships even last.</p> <p>It's not a situation unique to Radio 4 of course. Radio's intimacy, its often year-round schedule, the fact that presenters and announcers stay in their jobs for a great deal longer than many do in television, means the loss of a favourite voice can prompt surprisingly strong reactions. We adapt quickly enough \u2013&#xa0;and it's not as though Radio 4 doesn't have other particularly lovely voices in announcers Neil Nunes and Corrie Corfield \u2013 but Cass and Green will most certainly be missed.</p>",
  "<p>More than ever, consumers in the west are linked with producers in Africa through their product purchases. This trend is likely to increase as retailers in Europe and the United States look more to small scale farmers in developing nations as environmentally sustainable sources of food supply.</p> <p>When they do, these retailers require high standards of quality, timely delivery and, in some cases, certified sustainability, such as the <a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/\" title=\"\">Rainforest Alliance </a>seal. But small-scale farmers \u2013 the 500 million farmers who have less than two hectares of land \u2013 can struggle to meet these demands. They are often marginalised, both geographically and socio-economically. They tend not to have the seeds, fertiliser or capital they need to sell into more demanding retail markets.</p> <p>Although both smallholders and retailers can benefit from trade with each other, their two different worlds can seem difficult to reconcile. For the past four years, my colleagues and I at the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> have been trying to understand how innovations to business models could bridge this gap.</p> <p>Our project \u2013 a collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org\" title=\"\">Sustainable Food Laboratory</a>, <a href=\"http://crs.org\" title=\"\">Catholic Relief Services</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/\" title=\"\">Rainforest Alliance</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/Paginas/index.aspx\" title=\"\">The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)</a> \u2013 was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In the coming weeks, it will publish its final four reports, each focusing on a different value chain that links small-scale farmers in Africa to consumers in the west. First up, are flowers.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/16037IIED.html\" title=\"\">the report we published today</a>, we describe a new approach to sourcing flowers from Kenyan smallholders direct to UK retailers. We learnt many lessons from this value chain but two stand out.</p> <h2>Bridging the supply chain gap</h2> <p>First, the supply chain needs a good intermediary that can provide farmers with both a route to market and what they need for production. Second, it needs individuals who can act as bridges throughout the supply chain, closing the gaps in communications, standards and delivery to build new relationships between smallholders and retailers.</p> <p>In our study, the intermediary company was <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/tag/wilmar-agro-ltd\" title=\"\">Wilmar Agro Limited</a>. Based in Thika, a two-hour drive from Kenya's capital, Nairobi, Wilmar sells flowers from smallholder growers to European markets.</p> <p>For many years, Wilmar has held contracts with over 2,000 smallholder farmers, from whom it buys flowers each week to sell at Dutch flower auctions. Wilmar has helped the growers set up bank accounts to receive their weekly earnings, and has provided them with low volume inputs and technical advice from trained extension agents in the field. One grower says that, as a result of all of this, he earns more from a quarter acre of flowers than his two acres of tea (another big smallholder crop in Kenya). But this was just a start.</p> <p>By the time our project had begun in 2008, Wilmar's success had made it keen to try new markets that might offer a higher and more stable income for its growers. Around the same time, in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.walmart.com/\" title=\"\">Walmart</a>, which owns <a href=\"http://www.asda.com/\" title=\"\">Asda</a>, had pledged to source an additional \u00a330m of fresh produce from African farmers by 2013. We saw that bringing these two players together could present a real opportunity to get smallholder produce on to the shelves of a leading UK retailer.</p> <p>We were keen to see what lessons could be learnt from this pilot effort to develop a new commercially viable supply chain that was socially and environmentally sustainable. But we recognised that we didn't have the required commercial expertise and relationships to do so. So we brought in two commercial consultants with years of experience in retail supply and an interest in more sustainable sourcing. They were able to build on their longstanding relationships and knowledge in the sector to create the necessary links between Asda and Wilmar. This meant establishing terms of trade beneficial to both parties. It meant developing the product to meet both Asda's consumer demands and the farming systems of the growers. And it meant finding solutions for day to day problems that were appropriate to both commercial and development demands.</p> <h2>Supporting smallholder inclusion</h2> <p>Today, Wilmar supplies flowers to <a href=\"http://www.samsclub.com/sams/\" title=\"\">Sam's Club</a>, a US subsidiary of Walmart, and has interest from a number of UK retailers that want to source their products. Although there were many challenges \u2013 in communications, quality control and timely delivery \u2013 what made this project a success was the role of the intermediary (Wilmar) and the commercial consultants working together to provide a business model that was supportive of smallholder inclusion and responsive to the demands of retailers.</p> <p>Many value chain projects have been set up to meet the development challenges of smallholder farmers and food security. Many of them struggle to find success \u2013 both commercially and developmentally.</p> <p>Proving the development impacts of these projects can be difficult, and take years. Finding a committed retail partner that is willing to ride the ups and downs of a more variable supply base can be tricky. But having in place a strong intermediary and a consultant who can work together to take the noise out of the chain and build strong commercial relationships while guaranteeing benefits to smallholders is a pathway to success and more sustainable sourcing from developing countries.</p> <p><em>Abbi Buxton is a researcher in the sustainable markets group at the </em><a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\"><em>International Institute for Environment and Development</em></a><em>. </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>According to industry sources, including well-respected website <a href=\"http://www.businessoffashion.com/\" title=\"\">the Business of Fashion</a>, Natalie Massenet \u2013 the woman who founded <a href=\"http://www.net-a-porter.com/\" title=\"\">Net-a-porter</a> \u2013 will be the next chairman of the British Fashion Council. While the news has yet to be confirmed officially (an announcement is expected this evening), the Business of Fashion broke the story last night and Twitter has been abuzz with congratulations from fashion insiders since.</p> <p>It's no wonder \u2013 the daughter of a Californian journalist and British model, 46-year-old <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/biographies/natalie-massenet-biography\" title=\"\">Massenet</a> has become a glossy figurehead for online retail. Founding the luxury shopping site in 2000, it went from a business operating out of her Chelsea flat, to a global brand with an ever-expanding workforce based in an aircraft hanger-like space in Westfield, and sales everywhere from Brazil to Barnet. While Massenet sold the group \u2013 which now includes men's site Mr Porter, and discount site The Outnet \u2013 to the Richemont group in 2010 for around \u00a3350m, she still retains an active role in the business. </p> <p>If the rumours are true, she is expected to replace Harold Tillman, the chair since 2008, sometime next year. Tillman, an entrepreneur who has worked with brands including Jaeger and Aquascutum, has become a familiar figure at shows during London fashion week throughout his reign \u2013 often spotted in a dapper three-piece suit. Massenet provides something different. Already a regular on the front row, she's a glamorous, recognisable symbol of stylish, modern success. Massenet has the potential to take the LFW brand \u2013 just like Net-a-porter \u2013 around the world.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> The British Fashion Council has confirmed Massenet's appointment, taking over on 1 January 2013.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's right-tilting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2012/sep/05/cameron-reshuffle-pmqs-live-blog\" title=\"\">reshuffle</a> reminds me of Mitt Romney's selection of Congressman Paul Ryan to be his Republican running mate for the White House. The conservative press did its best to convince itself that Ryan was a great stroke, but couldn't quite manage it. Similarly sober is the mood this morning in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9520235/A-new-team-but-the-problems-dont-change.html\" title=\"\">Tory Fleet Street</a>.</p> <p>That's hardly surprising when the Mail relegates its reshuffle coverage to page six (the couple arrested for shooting a posse of intruders still dominate page one) while both Times and Telegraph make much play of Boris Johnson's outrage that Justine Greening has been removed from the site of Heathrow's prospective third runway.</p> <p>Zac Goldsmith, super-rich Tory MP for under-the-runway Richmond reinforced the negative overnight message by popping up on Radio 4 to remind ministers that, if they do a U-turn on Heathrow he will resign and trigger a byelection which he promises to win. Goldsmiths tend to mean what they say \u2013 and can afford to do so.</p> <p>At least the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/david-cameron-government-reshuffle-cabinet\" title=\"\">Guardian</a>, Indy and FT did Cameron the courtesy of ascribing ideological coherence to the shakeup on the grounds that Chris Grayling (justice), Owen Paterson (environment), Jeremy Hunt (health) and Grant Shapps (co-chairman) are all rightwing free-marketers who itch to do things to criminals, forests, healthcare and Labour voters.</p> <p>As for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-david-cameron-conservatives\" title=\"\">Lib Dems</a>, the coalition's fragility is reinforced. From separate duvets they are now moving to separate beds. \"Who cares?\" say Tory tough guys.</p> <p>I'm not wholly persuaded by this argument \u2013 nor is the rightwing press \u2013 for several reasons. Clearly Cameron wants better persuaders in post (Andrew Lansley couldn't sell gin to an alcoholic) as well as ministers he judges capable of getting things done. No 10 has reached the point all PMs reach where they realise that pulling the levers of power doesn't necessarily make anything happen.</p> <p>So it's all more about delivery than about policy which will remain the familiar batch of messy coalition compromises, prompting the Tory press to focus its dissatisfaction more and more on Cameron himself.</p> <p>In any case new cabinet ministers are inevitably a gamble. Few nowadays have enormous experience either in politics or outside life. I don't know Maria Miller, the low-profile appointment to succeed Hunt as culture secretary, a tricky post. I take that to be a good sign; she was minister for the disabled (another very touchy lobby) and doesn't show off. She was an advertising executive before politics, she has three kids.</p> <p>Does that mean she can do a big job under the spotlight of public and media attention in an impatient, often graceless atmosphere? We don't yet know, which is more than can be said for Hunt because we all saw him wilt in Lord Justice Leveson's witness box about his dealings with Rupert Murdoch. It wasn't a bad defence \u2013 \"I took independent advice as soon as I inherited the BSkyB brief\" \u2013 but he looked and sounded callow.</p> <p>He's been forgiven (moved, if you prefer) because he's deemed a good manager (he was in IT PR and directory publishing, he speaks Japanese) and promoted to a post where Tory ministers are rarely able to relax because the culture of the NHS is collectivist. Hunt seems to be anti-abortion, pro-homeopathy (argh!!) and as keen as most MPs to defend his own local hospital \u2013 in Guildford \u2013 from what might be sensible rationalisation of scarce resources.</p> <p>All the same, let's see what Hunt <em>does</em> as distinct from said in the past. The same goes for Grayling, who was pencilled in to slash the welfare reform programme until Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 unsackable as a hero of the right \u2013 dug his heels in and Grayling went to justice instead. Grayling (ex-SDP by the way) talks a tough populist game (watch out Brussels, watch out civil libertarians!), but can be a bit mouthy in a careless way.</p> <p>Another gamble then. Yet the realities of office and restricted choices, the burdens of vested interests, the caution of civil servants, all serve to restrict a minister's power. Besides, the centre is ever-dominant and cabinet office no longer the great fiefdom it once was. That's why the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">cabinet</a> is restricted by law to the PM and 22 paid members, yet today's revised lists include up to 30 members (in the Times).</p> <p>That's because membership and attendance has become blurred as the cabinet has decayed as a serious forum for policy discussion and decision-making over several decades. It's mostly done in committee and even smaller ad hoc groups, \"sofa government\" if you prefer. So Lady Warsi can tell her friends she's still in the cabinet (she isn't) because she attends it. Sooner or later the lady who brings round the tea and biscuits will be formally included too.</p> <p>In any case the policy on which this coalition will survive or fall \u2013 the strategy of economic austerity as the road to recovery \u2013 remains more or less in tact, with Cameron and George Osborne locked together. If anything the counterveiling forces have been weakened because Vince Cable now has two Osborne allies, Michael Fallon and Matt Hancock, riding shotgun in his department.</p> <p>Indeed the chancellor's spittle can be seen all over this reshuffle. Andrew Mitchell, who used to be a David Davis man but decided (correctly) that DD preferred to be an eccentric, is the new chief whip and an Osborne placeman with better access and clout than his immediate boss, the decent-but-discredited Lansley, now leader of the Commons. Cameron knows he must beef up his Commons operation to quell dissent and keep the troops happy.</p> <p>I can't spot anyone in the new cabinet lineup who is capable of changing the political weather, certainly not Shapps who usually sounds lightweight. Commentators have been saying this week that only Margaret Thatcher's 1981 reshuffles (there were two that year) made an impact by sacking the Tory \"wets\" (ie moderates), as did Gordon Brown's in 2008 when he brought back his old enemy, Peter Mandelson, to keep his flagging regime afloat.</p> <p>Yet Brown lost in 2010 as he was fated to do. The Labour reshuffle that might have changed everything was the one that didn't happen: Tony Blair never reshuffled Brown out of the Treasury to become master of his own house and was eventually reshuffled out of No 10 by Brown. When a governing party loses the mojo of authority not much can save it. One thing that can is lousy opposition \u2013 which is what Barack Obama must be counting on.</p> <p>A couple of mysteries in the reshuffle may be solved in the next day or so. Why did clever Nick Herbert, the police minister who has been promoting elected police commissioners, leave the government? Was it because he refused a sideways move and demanded cabinet rank? Naughty boy if that rumour is true. Or is there something else we don't know about?</p> <p>Secondly, who is Owen Paterson? I know him only slightly \u2013 here's his <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Paterson\" title=\"\">CV</a> \u2014 he seems pleasant enough, but other Tory MPs tend to be dismissive of him. He got sent to Northern Ireland \u2013 a quiet brief these days though he has handed it over to Theresa Villiers (who she?) just as north Belfast explodes into sectarian riot. That appointment could come to haunt Cameron if things get worse.</p> <p>Yet Nigel Lawson \u2013 younger readers may not realise that Nigella's dad used to be chancellor of the exchequer (1983-89) \u2013 popped up on telly on Tuesday to say that Paterson is one of the ablest people around the cabinet table. He also said that Ken Clarke is no threat to Osborne, who consults Ken all the time and will happily pick his brains as new minister without portfolio but with cigar. We'll see.</p> <p>Lord Lawson is no fool, as he would be the first to admit. So have we misjudged Paterson? If so, his climate-sceptic views (Lawson is a prominent climate sceptic, widely scorned for it by the science community) may come to matter. Taken in tandem with clever Nick Boles, newly appointed planning minister, this change of direction could be the one that matters.</p> <p>Bye bye to those huskie dogs Cameron embraced on his detox trip to the Arctic Circle, bye bye chunks of the green belt? That would suit Osborne too because he was never as green as Dave, and the Treasury never is. IDS may still be in place to thwart his \u00a310bn target for further welfare cuts \u2013 another battle to watch \u2013 but there is always somewhere else for the cutters to cut. Timber!</p>",
  "<p>So that's it then. The final shred of credibility of \"the greenest government ever\" has been doused in petrol and ignited with a casual flick of a gold-plated lighter. The appointment of Owen Paterson as environment secretary is a declaration of war on the environment, and another sign that the right of the party \u2013 fiercely opposed to anything that prevents business from doing as it wishes \u2013 has won.</p> <p>Alongside the signs that the government is preparing to renege on its pledge not to build a third runway at Heathrow (transport secretary Justine Greening, who fiercely opposed the idea, lost her job yesterday), this appointment reinforces the impression that Cameron's professed environmentalism is \u2013 and always was \u2013 phoney.</p> <p>Paterson is steeped in the mythologies of the anti-environment movement. A <a href=\"http://www.docstoc.com/docs/24401038/Miss-Nicola-Yates-North-Shropshire-District-Council-Edinburgh\" title=\"\">letter about windfarms</a> he sent to his district council is riddled with schoolboy howlers of the kind that are endlessly repeated by climate change deniers. For example, he expresses the belief that if the capacity factor of a wind turbine is 30%, this means that \"the wind blows sufficiently to generate useful electricity, typically, only 30% of the time\".</p> <p>Perhaps such mistakes are unsurprising: much of the letter was cut and pasted verbatim, without acknowledgement or circumspection, from a document published by an anti-windfarm group called Country Guardian. As environment secretary, Paterson will have to weigh up conflicting claims, and make decisions based on the best available evidence. Though Paterson will not have responsibility for energy policy, this <a href=\"http://www.preservegroup.co.uk/docs/Case%20against.doc\" title=\"\">cutting and pasting</a> should give you a sense of what we're up against.</p> <p>In May, when Owen Paterson was Northern Ireland secretary, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/05/unemployment-is-down-exports-are-booming-but-paterson-hague-and-fox-all-urge-chancellor-to-do-more.html\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a> reported that he set out a three-point plan for economic growth in a cabinet meeting.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 \"Exemption of all micro businesses from red tape, following the model Ronald Reagan pursued in the early 1980s; <br>\u2022 Ending of all energy subsidies and then fast-tracked exploitation of shale gas; <br>\u2022 Urgent review of airport policy to ensure Britain gets its full share of global trade.\"<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps it was sentiments like this that secured his new job. His predecessor at environment, Caroline Spelman, though blighted by some terrible junior ministers (the worst of whom remains in post), and though wildly illogical on certain issues (such as the badger cull), at least appeared to understand that we are in the midst of an environmental crisis, and that action needs to be taken. This could be why she was said to have no voice within the cabinet.</p> <p>The reshuffle pushes the coalition further towards the politics of the Tea Party Republicans: in denial about about the underlying problems, opposed to democratic constraints on business, prepared to treat the planet as a dustbin. Paterson's appointment appears to exemplify the shift.</p>",
  "<p>Mountain biker Graeme McLean has a couple of friends in Canada who never ride off-road without attaching bells to their rucksacks.</p> <p>\"It keeps the bears away,\" he smiles. He's now trying to spearhead a similarly safe and responsible approach to the sport in his home country of Scotland, though it's more likely to be deer, horses or dog walkers that pose the greatest hazard.</p> <p>\"Loads of bikers just don't know what to do when faced with a horse and rider ahead of them. Then there are other animals and of course humans,\" he says, just as we round a bend and find a walker and his two dogs ahead of us.</p> <p>\"OK, we'll keep to the opposite side, reduce our speed and give a big cheery hello,\" advises McLean, an ex-snowboard instructor who you suspect occasionally struggles to reconcile his inner adrenaline junkie with his role as project manager for <a href=\"http://www.dmbins.com/\" title=\"\">Developing Mountain Biking in Scotland</a>.</p> <p>We are riding a short route between <a href=\"http://www.glamis-castle.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Glamis Castle</a> and Station Woods, near Kirriemuir in Angus. It's not a dedicated mountain bike trail, nor even a bridleway, but rather a barely discernible thread of overgrown grass and nettles that snakes from the private grounds of a 14th-century castle to public woodland via a disused railway line. Under Scotland's <a href=\"http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com/outdoors-responsibly/your-access-rights/\" title=\"\">rights of access</a>, it is open to anyone and everyone who is not using a motorised vehicle.</p> <p>\"Our land laws are a huge asset to mountain bikers because it means they can go anywhere walkers can, unlike in England where they are not allowed on footpaths. But we're trying to get the message across that you've only got the right to be there if you're responsible with it,\" says McLean.</p> <p>He recently launched <a href=\"http://www.dmbins.com/files/Do_the_Ride_Thing.pdf\" title=\"\">a downloadable guide called Do The Ride Thing</a>, accompanied by <a href=\"http://www.dmbins.com/riders/do-the-ride-thing\" title=\"\">an online interactive game</a> designed to encourage eco-awareness among Scotland's mountain bikers. They may be surprised to learn that something as simple as braking hard and skidding can cause irreparable damage to the trails they use. And when it comes to horses and riders, the key is to be \"loud and polite as far in advance as possible\".</p> <p>McLean and a team of volunteers also negotiated with farmers and other landowners to produce <a href=\"http://www.dmbins.com/riders/where-to-ride\" title=\"\">a series of route cards</a>.</p> <p>\"Because of our access rights we didn't have to speak with the owners, but it's just common courtesy to involve them. And it's been very useful. Here at Glamis, the Earl of Strathmore was very much in favour, and even let us launch our route cards at the castle.\"</p> <p>Some compromises were made. The route card for Glamis \"recommends\" using the castle's own car park, where charges apply, as opposed to the free parking available elsewhere. And a proposed route across an estate in Perthshire has been delayed to allow the owner to re-introduce black grouse to the wild.</p> <p>After leaving Glamis, our route twists and bucks through dense woodland.</p> <p>\"Sightlines are crucial for the safety of riders and others,\" says McLean after I catch up with him at the bottom of a short but steep ramp. \"On purpose-built trails like those at <a href=\"http://7stanesmountainbiking.com/Home\" title=\"\">7Stanes</a> or <a href=\"http://www.glenmorelodge.org.uk/mountain-biking-courses.asp\" title=\"\">Glenmore Lodge</a>, they create obstacles to slow you down at danger spots, but that's not the case out here, there's nothing to stop you hurtling around a blind bend at speed. Around the corner could be a walker, an animal, or a parent pushing a kid in a buggy. It's all about awareness of potential dangers.\"</p> <p>Later this month, McLean's organisation will host <a href=\"http://www.dmbins.com/developing/conference\" title=\"\">a national conference</a> in Perth at which John Swinney, minister for finance and sustainable growth, will be speaking.</p> <p>\"Mountain biking is a massive asset for Scotland, and the government, medical and tourism agencies are all recognising the health and economic benefits,\" says McLean. \"The challenge now is to develop a sustainable framework for it.\"</p> <p>Sustainability is an issue close to his heart. He has two young children, including a baby daughter who he regularly straps into specially adapted carrier on his bike for rides along \"easy, parkland routes\".</p> <p>\"We have some of the best mountain-biking country in the world, and I want this incredible environment and its wonderful trails to still be there for them when they're older,\" he says.</p> <p>\u2022 Thanks to Steve Smith at Angus Bike Chain, Commerce Street, Arbroath, for the loan of the mountain bike</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's attempts to defuse the growing political storm over airport capacity in London are floundering after renewed criticism from the mayor of London and a threat by a high-profile Conservative MP to trigger a byelection if the government performs a U-turn and decides to go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>Boris Johnson demanded on Wednesday that the Tories make a pledge not to expand Heathrow that would last beyond the next election, while Zac Goldsmith, a former environmental adviser to the prime minister, said he would force a byelection in his Richmond Park and North Kingston constituency if it went ahead.</p> <p>The Conservatives said in their pre-election manifesto they would stop a third runway being built at Heathrow, but the departure in the cabinet reshuffle of Justine Greening, who as transport secretary campaigned vigorously against expansion, was seen as removing an obstacle to a change in policy.</p> <p>The new Conservative co-chair, Grant Shapps, reinforced that impression on Wednesday when he said there would be no expansion during this parliament in line with the coalition agreement, but refused to rule it out in future.</p> <p>\"If we are going to remain a great trading nation in the future, you need to have ports. Airports are particularly important these days and there are a lack of slots in the south-east around London and it must be addressed, otherwise we are dooming ourselves to economic failure in the future,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>Shapps said it would be \"irresponsible\" not to look at how to boost aviation capacity, adding the government would not \"turn a blind eye\" to infrastructure improvements that would help the economy to grow.</p> <p>His promise to consider all options did little to alleviate the impression among critics that the Tories are ready to give a third runway the green light.</p> <p>Johnson, who wants a new airport to be built in the Thames estuary, called for the government to promise there would be no third runway even after the next election.</p> <p>He said: \"There are much, much better solutions that would deliver long-term growth and jobs and I think what we need to do now is end the uncertainty about Heathrow, end this anxiety that's now building up that a U-turn is in progress and say, 'No folks, it's all right, the policy is as it has been, which is to say no to the third runway both now and in the future - ie beyond the next two-and-a-half years.'\"</p> <p>The London mayor had already criticised the demotion of Greening in the strongest terms, citing it as evidence that \"the government wants to ditch promises and send yet more planes over central London\".</p> <p>Johnson was joined in his criticism by Goldsmith, whose constituency lies beneath the Heathrow flight path. \"I think it is impossible to pretend that this isn't a sign,\" he told the Today programme.</p> <p>\"We haven't just lost Justine Greening from this department, we have also seen Theresa Villiers moved out, both of whom were absolutely rock-solid on this issue in terms of defending what is still the government's line officially.</p> <p>\"I think their movement out of the Department of Transport shows the government is at least trying to open the door to the possibility of a third runway.\"</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said the Liberal Democrats stood by the coalition agreement and the promise in its own manifesto not to build a third runway during the current parliament but added: \"The Conservatives can change their stance in whatever way they want.\"</p> <p>He said his view was that building links with growing economies should not be done \"at any old environmental cost\".</p> <p>Shapps also faced questions on Wednesday over whether the appointment as environment secretary of Owen Paterson \u2013 who is opposed to wind farms and reportedly in favour of fast-tracking shale gas exploitation \u2013 would lead to a watering down of the coalition's promises on the environment. But the Tory co-chair said: \"We will be the greenest government ever.\"</p>",

  "<p>It seems there is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/sep/04/organic-foods-no-better-nutrient\" title=\"\">little evidence</a> that organic foods are more nutritious than conventionally grown foods, according to the most comprehensive study to address the question to date. However, the findings by researchers at Stanford University, California, do suggest that eating organic foods can reduce the likelihood of consuming pesticides and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p> <p>Lead author Crystal Smith-Spangler and a team of researchers looked at 240 published studies of the nutrient and contaminant levels in organic and conventionally grown foods, as well as studies of humans consuming the two types of food.</p> <p>The researchers reviewed 17 studies (six of which were randomised clinical trials) of populations consuming organic and conventional diets, and 223 studies that compared either the nutrient levels or the bacterial, fungal or pesticide contamination of various products (fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, milk, poultry and eggs) grown organically and conventionally. The duration of the studies involving human subjects ranged from two days to two years.</p> <p>Smith-Spangler writes in the <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1355685\" title=\"\">Annals of Internal Medicine</a>: \"Despite the widespread misperception that organically produced foods are more nutritious than conventional alternatives, we did not find evidence to support this perception.\"</p> <p>They found no consistent differences in the vitamin content between the two types of produce or that conventional foods pose any greater health risk than organic ones. They also found that the risk of bacteria <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em>) contamination was unrelated to farming method.</p> <p>However, their analysis did find that conventional produce carries a 30% higher chance of pesticide contamination when compared with organic foods.</p> <p>Commenting on these results, Smith-Spangler told me: \"This study is not able to give consumers hard information about the impact of pesticide contamination on health because there are so few human studies available.</p> <p>\"Based on our result people who do not wish to have exposure to any pesticide residues may prefer to choose organic foods for that reason. However people who understand that there are regulations to ensure the safety of our food supply, those people may be less concerned because it is unusual to have pesticide residues exceeding our maximum allowed limits.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, a 33% increase in the risk of consuming antibiotic-resistant bacteria in conventionally raised chicken or pork compared with their organic counterparts was also reported.</p> <p>This research supports the findings of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/29/organic-food-nutrition-fsa\" title=\"\">a 2009 review</a> by the Food Standards Agency, which also concluded that there are no important differences in the nutrition content or additional health benefits of organic food when compared with conventionally produced food.</p> <p>Dr Alan Dangour, a nutritionist at the <a href=\"http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a> and lead author of the FSA study, told me: \"Like our 2009 review, [this study] again demonstrates that there are no important differences in nutrient content between organic and conventionally produced foods. This latest review identifies that at present there are no convincing differences between organic and conventional foods in nutrient content or health-benefits. Hopefully this evidence will be useful to consumers.\"</p> <p>When I emailed Emma Hockridge, head of policy at the <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/\" title=\"\">Soil Association</a>, she replied that organic consumers' concerns about chemicals were well-founded. \"An FSA report earlier this year revealed the presence of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbendazim\" title=\"\">carbendazim</a>, a suspected hormone-disrupting chemical banned in the US, in fruit and vegetables even after washing and cooking. Under organic regulations, these chemicals are banned, making buying organic food a simple solution to avoiding chemicals which remains the top reason for consumers to do so.\"</p> <p>That said, it should be noted that there are currently no long-term studies of the health outcomes for people consuming organic versus conventionally produced food. Given that people who regularly consume expensive organically grown products tend to be more affluent \u2013 a factor strongly associated with better health outcomes \u2013 this might be a tricky study to design.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What do you hope to achieve in your new role at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.rsm.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Royal Society of Medicine</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>I have four immediate priorities. First, I must maintain the RSM's special position in medicine as a centre for education and scholarship both in the UK and globally. The society has members in 92 countries and I need to ensure that all their interests are protected.</p> <p>Second, to nurture two of the RSM's more recent activities \u2013 encouragement of innovation and support for global health \u2013 which are both so important for all our members.</p> <p>Third, I need to broaden our activities to encompass disciplines critical to modern healthcare including pharmacy, biostatistics and health economics but about which doctors know so little.</p> <p>And finally I will seek to do more for the next generation of healthcare professionals so that they are able to take full advantage of the opportunities available to them in the future.</p> <p><strong>Why is it important that RSM engages better with statisticians and health economists? </strong></p> <p>Statistics and health economics are now playing a much greater role in medicine than ever before. But too few of my clinical colleagues understand what these disciplines have contributed in the past, and will continue to contribute, in the future. We need to embrace the disciplines they represent if we are to avoid the tribalism of the past.</p> <p><strong>What challenges are facing the society over the next few years?</strong></p> <p>The RSM has been in existence for 200 years. Its importance and relevance have increased, exponentially, during that time. If the society is to continue to evolve with the changing global demands on healthcare systems, it must recognise and promote both new and emerging technologies as well as the changing patterns of healthcare delivery.</p> <p><strong>What areas could be greatly improved when it comes to education and training for healthcare professionals?</strong></p> <p>All healthcare professionals need to understand the nature of the evidence that underpins \"evidence-based medicine\". Too few clinicians appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of our current techniques; far too few have any idea what terms like \"odds ratios\", \"relative risks\" and \"hazard ratios\" really mean; and too many believe that statistical probability tests distinguish \"truth\" and \"falsehood\".</p> <p>All young healthcare professionals, irrespective of whether they eventually undertake research themselves, need to know how to understand what really constitutes \"evidence\" if they are to practice their profession, to the highest standards, in an ever-changing world.</p> <p><strong>If you could pass one new piece of healthcare policy, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>I would arrange for all citizens of the UK to have electronic healthcare records that are fully integrated with decision-support tools based on Nice's clinical guidelines.</p> <p><strong>You were chair of Nice for over a decade \u2013 how challenging was it to deal with the numerous controversies around drugs approvals?</strong></p> <p>Of course Nice regrets saying no to a particular new pharmaceutical product. Nevertheless, if a product doesn't give value for money, its use in the NHS would deprive other people \u2013 with other conditions \u2013 of cost-effective care. Patients, the professions and the public largely understand, this despite the activities of some sections of the media.</p> <p><strong>What impact do you think health reforms will have on the work of Nice and the RSM?</strong></p> <p>As far as Nice is concerned, the Health and Social Care Act, if anything, increases the relevance of the institute's work to the NHS and re-establishes it under primary (as opposed to secondary) legislation. The new act increases the pressure on the RSM to enhance its educational role so that the quality of care given to patients continuously improves.</p> <p><strong>What has been your greatest professional achievement?</strong></p> <p>Being appointed chair-designate of Nice in 1998, at a time when there was no staff, no premises and no money \u2013 and being allowed to continue in the role for nearly 14 years \u2013 has been the most exhilarating part of my professional life so far. We now have a staff of over 500 people; offices in London, Manchester and Liverpool; and an annual budget of over \u00a365m a year. None of this would have been possible, though, without a committed board and a wonderful staff led by the incomparable Andrew Dillon [<a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/aboutnice/whoweare/board/executivedirectors/sirandrewdillon.jsp\" title=\"\">Nice's founding chief executive</a>].</p> <p><strong>You became professor of clinical pharmacology at 32 \u2013 are you a natural high achiever?</strong></p> <p>No, I'm not. And I have certainly never planned my career. Rather I have \"drifted\", taking opportunities as they arise. I've just been lucky!</p> <p><strong>What's your leadership style and how has it developed?</strong></p> <p>I'm not sure I really know what \"leadership\" is. What I have done, though, is to try to enthuse colleagues and staff about what we're trying to do; explain why it is so important and give praise and credit where it's due. And when things go wrong \u2013 as they inevitably will from time to time \u2013 try to learn from mistakes.</p> <p><strong>If you could take three things to a desert island, what would they be?</strong></p> <p>My harpsichord (which I built from a kit), my laptop (plus solar panel and a 3G receiver) and a copy of Principia Mathematica because, with so much time on my hands, I might at last be able to read and understand it.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Women make up fewer than one in ten (7.3%) of directors of FTSE 250 companies and black and ethnic minorities account for only 4.1% of directors in the FTSE 100, according to a report from <a href=\"http://www.equality-ne.co.uk/downloads/582_boardroom-diverstiy.pdf\" title=\"\">the Government Equalities Office</a>.</p> <p>Social enterprises, however, are performing substantially better: 86% of them had leadership teams with at least one female director, and 27% had directors from ethnic minorities, <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/Publications/Fightback_Britain.pdf\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise UK </a>found.</p> <p>As business models, social enterprises are inarguably more representative of the population than traditional businesses. But some in the sector warn that unless action is taken to promote the model, this could quickly change.</p> <p>Lucy Patterson founded <a href=\"http://jcsp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Jigsaw Care Services Plus</a> in June 2011 with her business partner Lorraine Clements. A social enterprise, it provides personal assistants for families of disabled children. Rather than employing assistants directly, it acts as a recruitment service for families who pay them directly via personal budgets.</p> <p>\"We find that we come across a lot more female-led social enterprises\", says Patterson. \"We'd both worked in the care sector for a long time, had relatively successful careers, and wanted to do something that would put food on our table and pay our bills but also gives back at the same time. It's not been about making money. I think a lot of the time, within a male environment, it is very much about status, whereas in a female environment it is different.\"</p> <p>While this may be anecdotal, there is plenty of quantitative data to show that social enterprises appeal to a broader cross-section of entrepreneurs than simply white males. <a href=\"http:// www.unltd.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UnLtd</a>, the charity that supports social entrepreneurs, reports that, of the start-ups it supports, 53% are male to 47% female, 68% white to 18% black or black British, 9% Asian or Asian British and 5% from mixed or multiple ethnic groups.</p> <p>At more than 30% black and ethnic minority, it is if anything overly representative for a country where such groups make up less than 10% of the population. Similarly at the School for Social Entrepreneurs, between 2007-2011, 21% of its students came from an ethnic minority background; in London, that rises to 32%.</p> <p>Part of the reason is that social enterprises are not evenly distributed across the country. They tend to cluster in urban areas, and particularly in areas of social deprivation. \"Communities who face challenge, prejudice and lack of fairness are forced to take matters into their own hands\", suggests David McGlashan, enterprise officer at the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">School for Social Entrepreneurs</a>, \"and social enterprise presents a model which allows communities to tackle inequality, with the primary aim being social impact, not financial return.\"</p> <p>Nick Temple, director of business and enterprise at Social Enterprise UK, says: \"We should acknowledge that social enterprises are doing a hell of a lot better [than the wider business world] ... I think what it partly reflects is where they're based: roughly 40% of social enterprises are based in the 20% most deprived areas \u2013 it's about three times the proportion than standard businesses in those areas. That tends to mean they are based in more diverse communities as well\".</p> <p>Added to that, he says, \"The flexibility, the way social enterprises operate and the ethical value they have makes them more attractive to a more diverse range of people.\"</p> <p>However, a recent academic paper from the <a href=\"http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/ceedr\" title=\"\">Centre for Enterprise and Economic Development Research</a> paints a less rosy picture. Research into emerging ethnic minority social enterprises in the five east London Olympic boroughs uncovered a significant level of distrust towards the social enterprise model. \"There were a lot of businesses that could be deemed as social enterprises who were actually not using that label,\" says co-author Professor Stephen Syrett, \"it wasn't a label that they were comfortable with. This included voluntary and community organisations that were actually trading.\"</p> <p>The term \"social enterprises\" was largely seen, he says, as being linked to a government policy to cut social and charitable ventures away from state grants and support. It's a point that McGlashan also picks up on. \"There is a concern that lack of available public funding will restrict access to \"big society\" opportunities: during periods of economic downturn, opportunities often become accessible only to the well connected, well educated elite ... The sector as a whole would benefit from a clearer identity, similar to the identity that the Fair Trade movement has created. This would give the general public a better understanding of what social enterprise actually means.\"</p> <p>Temple agrees that it's far from job done in terms of promoting the model to female and black and ethnic minority entrepreneurs. \"We've got a job as the national body to continue to promote our leaders as role models, because we have some amazing ones: Penny Newman at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/mar/09/food.business\" title=\"\">CafeDirect</a>, Sophi Tranchell at <a href=\"http://www.divinechocolate.com/about/inside-divine.aspx\" title=\"\">Divine Chocolate</a>, Karen Lynch at <a href=\"http://www.belu.org/archives/952\" title=\"\">Belu</a>, Victor Adebowale at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/social-care-network/2012/jun/01/day-life-victor-adebowale\" title=\"\">Turning Point</a> or Edwin Broni-Mensah who runs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/mar/06/young-british-entrepreneurs\" title=\"\">Give Me Tap</a>. I could go on at length. And without pigeon-holing and badging people, we need to make sure we continue to promote those individuals who demonstrate what's possible ... there's a lot more that we can do still.\"</p> <p>There are numerous support programmes to find and nurture the next generation of diverse leadership in the sector. Katharine Danton, UnLtd's director of research, impact &amp; policy, offers the example of UnLtd's community entrepreneurship programme <a href=\"http://www.unltd.org.uk/template.php?ID=221&amp;PageName=unltdstarpeople\" title=\"\">Star People</a>, \"which looks to scout out, fund and support talented individuals and groups who are working to make their local area a better place to live\". Part of the wider Big Local initiative, it's a 10-year multi-million pound programme that focuses on 150 areas across England. Such schemes, it could be argued, are central to social enterprises having as diverse a future as they do at present.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>George Osborne may have been booed by the crowd at the Paralympics on Monday night, but Britain's economic performance has received a rare accolade from the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, which says the UK is now the eighth most competitive country in the world.</p> <p>The WEF \u2013 organiser of the annual Davos gathering of business and movers and shakers \u2013 says the UK has moved up from 10th position in its global competitiveness league table, to eighth over the past 12 months, and is now \"settling firmly back in the top 10\".</p> <p>However, the WEF points out that the UK's \"macroeconomic environment\" \u2013 the general health of the economy \u2013 remains weak, with the country ranking 110th in the world, down from 85th in 2011.</p> <p>Economic growth in the UK has been negative for three successive quarters, according to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/24/uk-gdp-revised-economy-double-dip\" title=\"\">the latest official statistics,</a> and although Olympics-related spending is expected to have boosted output in the third quarter of the year, business groups including the CBI are now predicting growth in 2012 as a whole will be negative.</p> <p>In its annual <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2012-13.pdf\" title=\"\">Global Competitiveness Report</a>, the WEF scores each country according to 12 \"pillars of competitiveness\", from the state of its infrastructure to the effectiveness of its health and education systems.</p> <p>The UK's flexible labour market \u2013 making it easier for firms to hire and fire workers \u2013 is singled out as a strength by the WEF, which says \"the country improves its performance in several areas, benefiting from clear strengths such as the efficiency of its labour market, in sharp contrast to the rigidity of those of many other countries\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://widgets.weforum.org//global-competitiveness-index\"> <iframe src=\"https://widgets.weforum.org//global-competitiveness-index\" width=\"460\" height=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Treasury welcomed the WEF assessment: \"The UK is becoming more competitive thanks to this government's reforms \u2013 creating a more flexible and educated workforce; simplifying our tax system, and reducing the main rate of corporation tax as well as and scrapping burdensome regulation and simplifying planning rules.\"</p> <p>Switzerland, the WEF's home country, comes top of its Global Competitiveness Index, praised for its sophisticated scientific research; high-quality training for workers; and stable political institutions. Singapore, currently the country of choice for bankers fleeing the City for a lower-tax regime, comes in second. Finland is third.</p> <p>The schism within the crisis-hit eurozone is also laid bare by the WEF's analysis, which ranks Germany as the world's sixth most competitive country, and France at number 21, while bailed-out Greece comes 96th, down six places from last year, and far behind Cambodia (85) or Kazakhstan (51).</p> <p>The WEF's economists argue that the lack of competitiveness in southern European countries, including Greece, but also Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy, has been at the heart of the sovereign debt crisis. It calls for \"a holistic set of competitiveness-enhancing measures\", including \"introducing labour market reforms, fostering competition, and making more and better investments in growth-enhancing areas such as education, technology and innovation\".</p> <p>Among the major emerging economies, China scores best, at 29th, while India is 59th, and Russia, where the Putin regime has been tightening its grip on the levers of economic power in recent months, 67th, down one place from last year.</p> <p>However, the WEF expresses concern about the business climate in China, where it argues that \"insufficient domestic and foreign competition is of particular concern, as the various barriers to entry appear to be more prevalent and more important than in previous years\". China has dropped three places in the index since 2011.</p>",
  "<p>Thomas Brocklehurst, a Victorian banker who lived at Henbury Park in Cheshire, has a lot to answer for. In 1876, he decided to release into the wild a pair of grey squirrels he had brought back with him from a business trip to America. Other landowners, viewing the non-native species as a fashionable garden novelty, soon followed suit.</p> <p>More than a century later, up to 5 million greys are now estimated to inhabit much of the woodland across the UK. But their success as an \"alien\" species has been to the great detriment of the native red squirrel, say conservationists. If the population of greys is not urgently and radically reduced, they say, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/sep/25/british-mammals-red-squirrel-extinction\" title=\"\">then the reds will be driven to extinction in the UK within 20 years</a>. There are an estimated 120,000-140,000 reds in the UK, with 75% of the population in Scotland.</p> <p>\"If you want reds, you have to kill greys. It's a fact,\" says Natasha Collings, project co-ordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.cornwallredsquirrels.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cornwall Red Squirrel Project</a> , a scheme aiming to reintroduce captive-bred reds back into the county over the next five years.</p> <p>Standing beside the caged squirrel enclosure at <a href=\"http://www.trewithengardens.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">Trewithen House</a> near Truro, she explains why the two species cannot live together harmoniously: \"Greys don't actually kill reds themselves, as is commonly believed. They spread a deadly pox, causing distinctive ulcerations on their eyes and nose, which kills reds within five to seven days.\"</p> <p>Greys are destructive in other ways, too, says Collings. \"They are causing about \u00a350m a year's worth of damage to commercial forestry across the UK and incalculable damage to ancient woodlands. They take the tops off trees and will also 'ring bark' the trunks, whereby they strip the bark away which ultimately kills the tree. They also eat bird eggs.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http://www.gwct.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust</a> <a href=\"http://www.gwct.org.uk/about_us/news/3487.asp\" title=\"\">published research</a> that claimed that greys are having a \"significant effect on certain woodland birds' fledging success\", particularly species such as the great tit, nuthatch, chaffinch and blackbird.</p> <p>Prince Charles, the patron of the <a href=\"http://www.rsst.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Red Squirrel Survival Trust</a> who has led efforts to see reds reintroduced into Cornwall, formally opened the enclosure at Trewithen earlier this summer. He released a buck that joined the two sisters already settled inside and it is hoped that the breeding trio will soon add to the \"national stud book\" of reds that is used by conservationists to ensure a healthy genetic pool of captive-bred reds. Reds have also been bred for release over the past 16 years at <a href=\"http://www.paradisepark.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Paradise Park</a> wildlife sanctuary in Hayle, west Cornwall.</p> <p>The project in Cornwall aims to create two grey-free <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iSDDJzNUlQ\" title=\"\">exclusion zones in west Cornwall</a> - one on the Lizard, the other in West Penwith - which are then further protected by buffer zones. All greys will be systematically culled within the zones with poisoned bait and landowners will then work to protect those zones by policing the buffer zones. Only then will the captive-bred reds be released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395469078\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/8/30/1346350684102/Cornwall-Red-Squirrel-Pro-003.jpg\" alt=\"Cornwall Red Squirrel Project at Trewithin Gardens, Project Coordinator Natasha Collings\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natasha Collings, project coordinator for the Cornwall Red Squirrel Project. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: apexnewspix.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Collings says Cornwall was chosen for the \"feasibility study\" because of the county's geography - a long, thin peninsula which enables any grey-free zones in the far west to be more easily defended than in, say, a landlocked county. If successful, the extent of the zones will continue to push east across the rest of the county and into Devon. Other geographically amenable places being considered for similar schemes include the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the Gower peninsula in south Wales.</p> <p>Anglesey, off the coast of north-west Wales, already has a successful colony of 400 wild reds following a cull of greys in 1998. But even the protection of being totally enclosed by water is not sometimes enough, says Collings: \"Greys can swim across the fast-flowing waters of the Menai Strait. If they can see trees over the water they will attempt the journey. It takes just one to spread the pox.\"</p> <p>There is not universal support for a mass cull of greys, though. Animal Aid, the animal rights charity, called for a <a href=\"http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/NEWS/news_wildlife/ALL/2329/\" title=\"\">boycott of Duchy Original products</a> in 2010 when Prince Charles went public with his support for the project in Cornwall. \"Poisoning, shooting or bludgeoning [greys] to death in a sack is irrational, inhumane and doomed to fail,\" said the charity, who thinks the public has been fed the \"emotive anthropomorphism\" of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Squirrel_Nutkin\" title=\"\">Beatrix Potter's Squirrel Nutkin</a> too often by conservationists seeking to bring back reds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chrispackham.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chris Packham</a>, the BBC wildlife presenter, <a href=\"http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/factfiles/Squirrel.pdf\" title=\"\">has described</a> those who seek to eradicate greys as \"a small band of lunatics\" who are \"blinded by sentimental racism\". He says introducing greys was a mistake by the Victorians, but that conservationists need to accept that the \"perfect paradise is lost\" and that non-native species are now an integral part of the UK's flora and fauna: \"If the grey squirrels have to go then so do all the rabbits, hares, four of our six deer species and so on.\"</p> <p>Collings accepts that gaining support for the cull is an on-going challenge: \"Yes, there needs to be a public appetite to remove greys. But until someone develops a pox vaccine for reds, baiting and killing greys is the best method for stopping the few remaining reds from being lost forever.\"</p>",
  "<p>Climate change's impact on future food prices is being underestimated, Oxfam warned in a report on Wednesday.</p> <p>The development charity predicts that massive price spikes will be a devastating blow to the world's poorest people who today spend up to 75% of their income on food, and will also adversely affect UK consumers.</p> <p>Its report, <a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/extreme-weather-extreme-prices-the-costs-of-feeding-a-warming-world-241131\" title=\"\">Extreme Weather, Extreme Price</a>, suggests extreme weather events such as droughts and floods \u2013 made more likely by global warming \u2013 could drive up future food prices.

It warns that by that date the world could be even more vulnerable to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/20/us-drought-inflation-food-prices\" title=\"\">the kind of drought happening today in the US</a> \u2013 the worst in 60 years \u2013 with dependence on US exports of wheat and maize predicted to rise and climate change increasing the likelihood of extreme droughts in North America.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cBFoL3R74Ds?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cBFoL3R74Ds\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The research claimed that:</p> <p>\u2022 Even under a conservative scenario another US drought in 2030 could raise the price of maize by as much as 140% over and above the average price of food in 2030, which is already likely to be double today's prices.</p> <p>\u2022 Drought and flooding in southern Africa could increase the consumer price of maize and other coarse grains by as much as 120%. Price spikes of this magnitude today would mean the cost of a 25kg bag of corn meal \u2013 a staple which feeds poor families across Africa for about two weeks \u2013 would rocket from around $18 to $40.</p> <p>\u2022 A nationwide drought in India and extensive flooding across south-east Asia could see the world market price of rice increase by 22%. This could lead to domestic spikes of up to 43% on top of longer term price rises in rice importing countries of such as Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.</p> <p>\u2022 Climate shocks in sub-Saharan Africa are likely to have an increasingly dramatic impact in 2030 as 95% of grains such as maize, millet and sorghum that are consumed in sub-Saharan Africa are expected to come from the region itself.</p> <p>As well as affecting the world's poorest, such rises will also hit those on the lowest incomes in the UK, who already spend up to half their household budget on food, the report notes.</p> <p>Oxfam's climate change policy adviser, Tim Gore, said: \"Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns hold back crop production and cause steady price rises. But extreme weather events \u2013 like the current US drought \u2013 can wipe out entire harvests and trigger dramatic food price spikes. We will all feel the impact as prices spike but the poorest people will be hit hardest.\"</p> <p>He said the world needed to wake up to the drastic consequences facing our food system of climate inaction: \"As [greenhouse gas] emissions continue to soar, extreme weather in the US and elsewhere provides a glimpse of our future food system in a warming world. Our planet is heading for average global warming of 2.5\u20135C this century. It is time to face up to what this means for hunger and malnutrition for millions of people on our planet.\"</p> <p>The report comes as UN talks aimed at tackling climate change are due to close in Bangkok on Wednesday with little sign of progress, while tomorrow the Food and Agriculture Organisation is due to publish further information on how the worst US drought in 60 years is impacting on global food prices.</p>",
  "<p>At times Paralympic sport can provide some rather jaw-dropping moments of double-take. Nestled in among the technical skill and the engrossing sense of competition on show at these Games there are also, as in all sport, moments of incredulity \u2013 and also of comedy. With the start of the wheelchair fencing competition at the ExCeL Arena morning a boisterous, mid-sized crowd was treated to some extraordinary displays of fast\u2011twitch lunge and block in what remains the only full-on combat sport practised by athletes in wheelchairs.</p> <p>For the novice spectator, though, perhaps one of the more extraordinary sights came in the qualifying round of the men's individual foil as Poland's Stefan Makowski celebrated victory in his Category Amatch by leaping up out of his wheelchair and performing a brief capering dance. His opponent Artur Yusupov of Russia chose to stay seated. But then again he has no right leg. Victory complete, Makowski proceeded to propel himself off stage partly with the help of his own feet protruding, Fred Flintstone-style, between the wheels of his chair. If there seemed some nagging sense of inequity in this, given that the two men are rated as having an equivalent standard of physical function, this is to misunderstand the well-grooved mechanics of what is a grand old Paralympic sport. The more telling details came in the fraternal hug between the two athletes once Makowski had sat down in his chair again, the respectful congratulations offered by Yusupov after defeat to a more aggressive opponent, and in Makowski's own joy at having beaten a well-regarded competitor in what is a truly egalitarian discipline.</p> <p>In many ways the return of wheelchair fencing's elite four\u2011yearly competition to Great Britain this summer is a rather poignant episode in Paralympic history. For a start wheelchair fencing is one of the more broadly pitched and inclusive Paralympic sports, a discipline open to anybody with a malady of the leg that effectively rules out Olympic-standard competition. This is a sport where those who rely on a wheelchair in everyday life compete against those who never sit in one other than to compete, with the chair reduced entirely to the level of a piece of equipment, a static base from which the fencer addresses his opponent.</p> <p>Beyond this wheelchair fencing, which reaches its climax on Saturday with the team finals, is among the most aristocratic of Paralympic events, a founding discipline among the \"parallel\" sports devised at his Buckinghamshire base by the great emigre German neuroscientist Ludwig Guttmann. Guttmann it was who staged the first public demonstration of wheelchair fencing at Stoke Mandeville hospital in the early 1950s, with a match between an injured serviceman and Guttmann himself, who had fenced as a student at Heidelberg University. The sport was conceived as an activity for convalescent members of the armed forces: an aid to recovery but also a means of fostering self-esteem and what Guttmann saw as a sense of galvanising physicality. From a display event at the Stoke Mandeville Games of 1954, wheelchair fencing became a competitive sport at the Rome Games of 1960, at which point fencers still competed in the old-style heavyweight government-issue travaux chairs (as they became lighter over time there was a period when chairs were held in place by crouching stewards).</p> <p>It is now a global sport as evidenced not just by the geographical span of competitors on show at the ExCeL, with Iraq, Argentina, Hong Kong and Malaysia among those nations represented. But also by the rise to competitive domination \u2013 always a sign of sporting gravitas \u2013 of China's fencers, with five out of six individual golds at the Beijing Games going to the Chinese men. At the Excel , as both the men's and women's individual foil kicked off in earnest, the most notable aspect was the unusually vociferous morning crowd, with enormous shrieking support, in particular, for France's Delphine Bernard. As the recurrent Marseillaise and cries of \"<em>Allez Delphine</em>!\" rattled around this low-ceilinged basement amphitheatre it seemed fair to suggest the French passion for fencing \u2013 which is a national sport \u2013 had safely transferred itself to the wheelchair version.</p> <p>Under closer investigation the troupe of face-painted, tricolor-wigged ultras occupying the central stand were a class of French schoolgirls from Bernard's home town, Saint-Blaise in Brittany, a kind of touring Gallic St Trinian's here to support an athlete who has been adopted as a sporting \"godmother\" after developing a close relationship with local schools. \"She's a hero \u2026 She said our support was really important \u2026 My favourite place in London is the Olympic Stadium,\" were the assorted verdicts of Oceane, Justine and Mailiz, in between spontaneous patriotic whoops and yee-haws, as French schoolgirl support continued to dominate the arena a full nine hours ahead of the evening's gold medal matches.</p> <p>Elsewhere the Excel Arena was kept in a state of rapt attention by the quick-fire nature of the qualifying rounds. Bouts are won by the first competitor to five points, scored by touching an opponent's torso with the foil. In theory these matches can go on for three minutes. In practice they tend towards a blink-and-you-miss-it affair of all-out adrenal attack, a chair-bound blur of feint and jab that is instantly translated by a large spectator scoreboard above the competitors. Alim Latr\u00e8che of France was 2-0 up six seconds into his opening bout against China's Hu Daoliang. Latr\u00e8che eventually won 5-0 in something close to 12 seconds all in. His victory was greeted by a frenzy of partisan approval from the French schoolgirl contingent who by now were singing a jaunty chanson version of the baseline from Seven Nation Army.</p> <p>Bernard would later exit the competition in the quarter-finals, beaten by Veronika Juhasz of Hungary. Latr\u00e8che returned to win a bronze medal bout against Marco Chima of Italy while Hu, recovered from his earlier thrashing, faced Anton Datsko of Ukraine in the gold match. To the disappointment of a large Brazilian contingent Datsko had earlier eliminated Jovane Silva Guissone of Brazil, who has one of the more dramatic back-stories. Jovane took up wheelchair fencing as a result of injuries caused by gunshot wounds sustained in a street robbery. If his success here carries with it undertones of a Guttmann\u2011esque validation of the sport's merits, this was always unlikely to detain either Jovane, gracious in defeat, or a thoroughly involved three-quarter full-house at the ExCeL on an opening day that confirmed, above all, the pure competitive appeal of this grand old indigenous Paralympic sport.</p>"
