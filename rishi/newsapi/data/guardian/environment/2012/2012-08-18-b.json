  "<p>By now, Britons may be growing weary of post-Olympic celebration and reflection. But let me add an Australian voice of congratulations to London and Britain. The Games were a stunning triumph. Many Australians watching, myself included, could only concede that they could well have been the best ever. Just maybe.</p> <p>As the autumn conference season approaches, political parties will be tempted to claim the Olympics' triumph as their own, to appropriate the patriotic spirit generated by London 2012. Few could deny that a more confident Britain has emerged this summer. The goodwill and hospitality of Britons provided a picture of what a community of virtuous citizens, at its best, could look like.</p> <p>It helped that Team GB delivered so many medals, including the golden variety. But perhaps it was Danny Boyle's opening ceremony that did the most to define the legacy of the Games. What was especially striking about it, at least to my eyes, was its story of Britain as a project \u2013 that ongoing project of a New Jerusalem. It was a convincing argument that Britishness wasn't about nostalgic yearning for the stuff of an imperial past, but something that existed in the present and future.</p> <p>Both David Cameron and Ed Miliband will surely tap into this forward-looking sensibility. At a time when economic conditions are so grim in much of the world, national optimism can't afford to be squandered.</p> <p>Cameron has certainly been quick to emphasise that Britain was \"not a country whose time has been, but one whose time has come\". Some Tories see the post-Olympic setting as an opportunity for Cameron to revive his ideas about a big society. What better advertisement for Burkean conservatism, they say, than those \"little platoons\" of volunteers staffing the events across London?</p> <p>Whether such a story may be convincing is another matter. Cameron's pursuit of austerity makes any positive Tory story difficult to tell.</p> <p>The response to Boyle's celebration of the NHS highlights, moreover, that public sensibilities remain strongly social democratic.Indeed, Miliband and Labour seem best poised to convert patriotic sentiment into national purpose. Miliband's signalled intent to \"rebuild Britain\" through a responsible capitalism has the early signs of a leftist agenda of nation-building.</p> <p>The circumstances are ripe for such a programme. The economy continues to languish. The young are faced with limited prospects for work. Families are confronted with the pressures of the rising cost of living. Britain is still looking for a durable political economy beyond just the City and the seductive booty of financial services.</p> <p>In such times, it is the social democratic impulse that provides the best guide, the belief in what political historian <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/barnard.edu/sheri-berman/\" title=\"\">Sheri Berman </a>calls \"the primacy of politics\".</p> <p>It is politics and communities that are the forces of history, not economics. To adopt a market economy isn't to capitulate to a market society. A civilised society requires a strong state, which should not only protect the rights of individuals but also enable them to fulfil their potential. Which isn't to say that statism should be back in vogue; any strong state shouldn't dislodge communities and tradition but complement them.</p> <p>Yet it is patriotism that provides the fuel for the engine of a good society. This doesn't mean embracing a tribal belief in the superiority of one's country. There must be room for reason and reflection. But essentially we're talking about a desire to contribute to the common good and to improve one's country.</p> <p>This kind of patriotism sees a national tradition as a living thing \u2013 always growing and evolving. It also demands being prepared to criticise your own country when it falls short of being just and good.</p> <p>Patriotism can sometimes be a vice. National pride doesn't always express itself as civic virtue. Across Europe, populist parties of the far right and extremist street movements have been growing in strength. Racism and xenophobia continue to thrive. In my own Australia, during the past two decades a reactionary nationalism has seeped into the mainstream consciousness. Since the <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/racist-furore-as-mobs-riot/2005/12/11/1134235948497.html\" title=\"\">2005 Cronulla Beach </a>race riot in Sydney (when a 5,000-strong, flag-waving mob attacked Australians of Middle Eastern appearance), members of the Australian public have embraced the national flag with jingoistic enthusiasm.</p> <p>A liberal patriotism, however, is about civic solidarity. This is now something societies have to work hard to cultivate in an age of instant gratification and narcissism. Self-enrichment has become the dominant ethos. All this goes to the central challenge for those on the left side of politics. For too long, social democrats have lost touch with the ethical traditions from which they sprang. Reform was no longer a means to an end, but became an end in itself. This has been true not only in Britain. Just as Labour became captured by the technocratic visions of New Labour, so too did its sister party in Australia.</p> <p>This philosophical vacuum in part explains how it is that Labor governments in Canberra have failed to enjoy sustained popularity. For all that they have achieved \u2013 not least, successfully steering the Australian economy through a global recession and introducing a carbon price \u2013 they have failed to put together a compelling cultural narrative. Their experience is a reminder that stories matter.</p> <p>National stories matter especially in multicultural societies, but not in the conservative sense of cultural assimilation. When earlier this year the home secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/01/uk-migrants-patriotic-citizenship-test\" title=\"\">Theresa May introduced a revised citizenship test for immigrants</a>, the implication was that cohesion could only be secured if immigrants commanded knowledge of trivia concerning Shakespeare, Trafalgar and Churchill.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. Citizenship tests can be an important ritual in the journey of naturalisation, national histories and cultural literacy matter. But it's all about nuance. The common ground of citizenship should be defined more by political than by cultural membership.</p> <p>The most crucial thing is that new citizens understand the rights and responsibilities of belonging to a liberal democracy. And share a public identity.</p> <p>A more progressive view of nationhood doesn't exclude cultural diversity. Where one is committed to improving one's country, one sees in differences a potential source of enriching a national tradition.</p> <p>This isn't about having a cultural identikit or crudely appropriating elements of other cultures. It is about recognising there is no one authoritative way to express one's national identity. For instance, few would suggest there is one musical group that could ever be described to be the definitively British band, even if there may be a body of music that is authentically British. Such pluralism is a source of cultural strength rather than of social weakness.</p> <p>This is the basic proposition of a nation-building multiculturalism.</p> <p>It is very different to the kind of fragmentary identity politics associated with the \"m-word\". But experiences in countries such as Australia and Canada point to forms of multicultural policy worth emulating (or at least learning from).</p> <p>As a policy, multiculturalism in those countries embodies an aspiration to citizenship. Being a member of a country should entail the right to express one's cultural identity and heritage, though this should be accompanied by a responsibility to abide by certain civic values. Multiculturalism hasn't been about the therapeutic validation of identities or about sanctioning relativism. It has been about securing civic equality.</p> <p>Many will know this to be the kind of cultural recognition that most immigrant communities are after. It is a demand for inclusion and mutual respect, not separation and privileged treatment. There has been much of this in how multiculturalism in Britain has been practised. The only problem is that it has been undermined by the emphasis on a \"community of communities\". It has been an unfortunate concept, for it suggests there could be no common ground but only difference.</p> <p>At the moment, though, many countries are looking to Britain as an example of a dynamic multicultural society united by a generous patriotism. The Olympic moment provided a glimpse of a modern Britain that can inspire a world still learning to live with diversity. It is a partial, fragile vision. After all, a country can only be at its best when it has virtuous citizens.</p> <p><em>The Virtuous Citizen: Patriotism in a Multicultural Society by Tim Soutphommasane is published by Cambridge University Press, \u00a318.99</em></p>",
  "<p> A Kenyan man who was paralysed after being shot by carjackers nine years ago has caught the imagination of the nation by embarking on a 2,485-mile journey to South Africa on a manual wheelchair to seek treatment for his spinal injuries. Zachary Kimotho, a 44-year-old veterinarian, began the journey in June with the aim of raising \u00a31.9m to build a spinal injury treatment unit in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</p> <p>On the first phase of his journey, Kimotho raised \u00a3650,000 and covered 78 miles of the route to South Africa, where the nearest spinal cord injury rehabilitation centre is. In a telephone interview on Friday with the <em>Observer</em>, Kimotho, who was near the border of Tanzania and Kenya, said he had continued despite cold and wet weather and he had blisters on his hands from turning the wheels.</p> <p>\"It has been a very cold season in Kenya and I also have to contend with speeding motorists. I have faced so many challenges but I don't want them to deter me from the goal,\" he said.</p> <p>Kimotho was selected in June to be the face of the campaign organised by the <a href=\"http://www.kenyanparaplegic.or.ke/\" title=\"\">Kenyan Paraplegic Organisation</a> to raise awareness of the suffering of spinal injury patients in Kenya. They appealed for the public to help <a href=\"http://www.bringzackbackhome.com/\" title=\"\">\"Bring Zack Back Home\"</a>, urging Kenyans to each contribute a Kenyan shilling (about a penny) in the hope that enough money would be raised to build the unit, saving Kimotho from having to complete his arduous journey. Kenyans took to social media to spread the word and the hashtag #BringZackBackHome became a top trend on Twitter.</p> <p>Kimotho was paralysed in 2004 after he was shot in his car in Nairobi. \"All of a sudden, a vehicle stopped in front of me and through the windscreen, I could see a man raising both hands. Momentarily, I thought I had caused an accident,\" he said. A man with a gun then told him to open the door and to move to the passenger seat. He then felt a sharp pain in his shoulder. \"A bullet pierced through my shoulder, through my spine all the way to the other shoulder,\" he said.</p> <p>Kimotho was in Kenyatta National Hospital for three months. Six months before the incident his wife had died, leaving him to bring up their son, now 10, alone. He had also lost his job as a vet a few months before. When he was discharged he was in a wheelchair, but he believes that his circumstances would have been greatly different had he received better care. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/08/kenyan-dangerous-drivers-twitter-roads\" title=\"\">With 20,000 people injured in road accidents each year</a>, the spinal injury wing of the Kenyatta hospital is overstretched. Kimotho now hopes to help others avoid his fate. \"I would like other spinal injury patients to benefit from proper treatment and rehabilitation \u2013 treatment I never got,\" he said.</p> <p>But Kimotho's journey has now been halted by bureaucracy. \"We had to stop because we had [only] applied for a [fundraising] licence of 60 days,\" he said. The Kenyan Paraplegic Organisation has acquired 12 acres of land in Nairobi to build the new spinal care unit. \"In early September, we'll lay a foundation with the amount raised so far for all to see how their money has been spent. Then we'll launch phase two of the initiative,\" Kimotho said.</p>",

  "<p>Three years ago, I came across the victims of a drone strike about an hour after it occurred. It was in Gaza \u2013 although the location for the purposes of this piece does not matter; only the fact of the weapons system. The drone had fired a missile at a militant commander. Standing close by at that moment was a group of children waiting for a lift to school, three of whom were wounded.</p> <p>All injury and death is horrible, that suffered by innocents doubly so. Having seen so much of the human consequences of war, I tend not to distinguish which weapon has been responsible but try to see the intent behind the attack that caused the injury and death. In conflict, within the existing framework of international humanitarian law, whether an attack is justifiable and legal is defined both by the nature of the target and proper consideration of whether there will be civilian casualties and whether they are avoidable.</p> <p>For this reason, I find the notion of drone warfare no more horrible than a Tomahawk cruise missile fired from a distant ship or a bomb dropped indiscriminately on a village by a high-flying F-22 or MiG. What did bother me about that drone strike three years ago \u2013 about all drone strikes that cause civilian injuries and death \u2013 was the knowledge that, unlike a jet pilot or artilleryman firing a shell on to co-ordinates where he cannot see who is nearby, this aircraft's remote pilot must have been able to see the children who would be injured.</p> <p>The use of drones to conduct lethal strikes, particularly by the US and often causing civilian casualties, has come to be one of the most deeply controversial moral issues in the development of modern conflict, driven by the fourfold escalation in the use of drones by President Barack Obama in the global \"war on terror\" from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Yemen and Somalia. The most recent incident occurred yesterday in northern Pakistan \u2013 the first in over a month \u2013 when five alleged militants were killed in a drone strike on the compound of a local warlord. So controversial indeed is the subject that last month Congress indicated it was seeking the internal White House memos used to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/02/drone-wars-secrecy-barack-obama\" title=\"\">authorise drone strikes</a> where US citizens fighting with militants had been killed. The UK, too, has been drawn in through a court case brought by a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9289127/Court-case-over-drone-strike-could-force-Britain-to-reveal-intelligence-exchanges-with-US.html\" title=\"\">Pakistani student</a> demanding to know whether this country has provided intelligence for a suspected US drone strike that killed his father.</p> <p>Despite genuine concerns over drone warfare, much of what has been written on both sides of the debate on the surrounding moral and legal issues has been ill-informed and confused. In part, this is because for some the issue has become conflated with broader geopolitical concerns, not least a critique of US military power. While how we understand the use of military power by a state should serve as an important context, it does not assist in understanding whether the use of drones is legitimate.</p> <p>For many, the nature of drone warfare itself has become central. The operators' very remoteness, it is claimed, leads to desensitisation. But throughout the history of weapons, designers have always sought to maximise lethality while reducing the vulnerability of those using the weapons. And while it has long been accepted that there is a relationship between increased distance from a target and the ability to kill with reduced feelings of guilt, recent anecdotal evidence suggests that some drone operators, because they spend so long intimately observing their targets, experience the same emotional damage as those who kill at close quarters.</p> <p>What then of the issue of international legality? As Joshua Foust and Ashley Boyle argue in a new paper, <a href=\"http://americansecurityproject.org/featured-items/2012/the-strategic-context-of-lethal-drones-a-framework-for-discussion/\" title=\"\">The Strategic Context of Lethal Drones</a> for the American Security Project, this, too, is more complex than some have assumed. The use of force against countries in peacetime, as they point out, is governed by Article 51 of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/\" title=\"\">UN Charter</a>. This permits \"the right of individual or collective defence\" across borders in peacetime if either one of two requirements is satisfied: that the group or individuals being targeted poses a threat or if the country, where the strike takes place, \"consents\". While Pakistan has complained that drone strikes \"infringe its sovereignty\", strong evidence exists that suggests it is heavily involved in providing the intelligence and other participation for strikes.</p> <p>A case can be made too that drones might be \"more ethical\" than other older systems because they can be more discriminate, lingering over their target for hours or returning for days to the location, giving those authorising the operations the opportunity to minimise noncombatant casualties.</p> <p>Paradoxically, it is precisely because of this potential for discrimination, in the context of the execution of the US drone war, that their use has become more morally problematic because it brings us back to the subject of intent, not least in the way in which the US has drawn up its \"kill lists\" and in its definition of when civilian casualties are acceptable and how those casualties are counted. When Thomas Aquinas condoned killing in self-defence, he defined the moral \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/euthanasia/overview/doubleeffect.shtml\" title=\"\">doctrine of double effect</a>\", a key concept in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/just/what.shtml\" title=\"\">Just War </a>theory from Francisco de Vitoria in the 16th century to Michael Walzer in the modern era.</p> <p>In this context, it sets the killing of civilians, or the risk of killing them, as \"a bad effect\" against what might be viewed as moral within the bounds of self-defence. For while there are very few who would try to deny that a militant threat exists in areas where strikes take place, the central issue comes down to how those combatants are identified and what efforts are being made to protect civilians. One of the most shocking disclosures about the details of Obama's decision-making process is the use of the definition \"militant\" for all males of military age within a drone strike zone, regardless of whether they are combatants or not.</p> <p>This definition is a deliberate evasion of the moral responsibility supposed to be built into the targeting process. Add to that the often wild vagaries of the US intelligence that nominates the list of those who pose an alleged threat, failures of which I witnessed on many occasions in Iraq, and it seems certain that there have been strikes, perhaps many, which have been unjustifiable in their civilian death toll.</p> <p>If there is a final compelling question to be asked over the future of drone warfare, it is the one posed by Foust and Boyle who demanded whether, as a military tool, drone warfare is actually effective; whether its use is justified when set against the political fallout that the drone campaign has produced and whether drones have actually reduced the threat posed by militants.</p> <p>Without clarity on these issues \u2013 that the drone campaign is operated within a real, clear and publicly defensible moral framework and serves a quantifiable defence purpose \u2013 the questions about drones will only get louder and more insistent.</p> <p>Comments will be swtiched on at 11am</p>",
  "<p>The day before Gordon Brown muscled his way into the debate about Scotland and the future of the union, I happened to be in Edinburgh to give a keynote lecture at the opening of the 2012 festival on \"What does it mean to be British?\" One answer might have been provided by the spectacle of a former UK prime minister, and Scot, telling a domestic audience that Britain was \"the best platform\" for \"Scottish success\".</p> <p>A year ago, when the festival organisers first broached this subject, it was a long way south of front-page news. Picking over the debris of the riots, the commentariat was more inclined then to reflect on a disunited kingdom.</p> <p>Timing is everything. In 2007, the last time Brown tackled the question of Britishness, he was widely mocked for the rhetorical equivalent of trying to pin the tail on the donkey. The <em>Times </em>sponsored a campaign for a \"British\" motto, something to match \"Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9\" and less embarrassing than \"Cool Britannia\". Readers' suggestions included, for example: \"Dipso. Fatso. Bingo. Asbo. Tesco\". Closely followed by \"No motto please, we're British\".</p> <p>Not any more. The summer of 2012 looks like a new chapter in the \"British\" story. Alex Salmond's campaign for Scottish independence had focused minds on the strengths of the union. Now the patriotic bounce from the Olympics has had this unexpected outcome: suddenly we're all Britons again.</p> <p>Perhaps we should savour a fleeting moment. In general, the national identity of this dysfunctional archipelago remains a vexatious and contradictory topic, in which what's not said is the important bit. For many Britons, an ironical raised eyebrow can be as meaningful as a national mission statement \u2013 except, of course, in a crisis.</p> <p>Possibly the last time \"British\" made sense was in 1940. Winston Churchill wrapped himself in the union flag, to mobilise the country. \"We shall fight on the beaches\" was a unifying assertion of insular defiance. Without the threat of invasion \"we shall never surrender\" might have been empty bluster.</p> <p>Even in 1940, \"what does it mean to be British?\" was complicated. As the Luftwaffe massed over London, George Orwell explored the question in <em>The Lion and the Unicorn</em>. \"We call our islands by no less than six different names,\" he wrote, \"England, Britain, Great Britain, the British Isles, the United Kingdom and, in very exalted moments, Albion. How,\" he asked, \"can one make a pattern out of this muddle?\"</p> <p>Attempts to navigate Orwell's muddle usually bump into Englishness, a set of values that lurk behind, and complement, Britishness. In the past, icons of Englishness have included Big Ben, cricket, bacon and eggs \u2013 the \"full English\" \u2013 brass bands, allotments, the royal family and the WI, Marmite and the last night of the Proms. These morph into the Britain of rightwing cliche. Since the turn of the millennium there has been a growing appetite for a richer, more complex answer to the question. This summer of 2012 has seen various conflicting versions of Britain Redux.</p> <p>Danny Boyle's was the most uplifting contemporary response. His brilliant, slightly bonkers mash-up of fact and fiction, seasoned with irony and song, was an inspired celebration of popular history and culture that was \u2013 incredibly \u2013 even hailed by the French.</p> <p>Part of the trouble with \"Britishness\" is that, despite sharing an unconscious contract whose terms are made manifest only at moments of high national emotion, our instinct is to play truant from the identity question.</p> <p>Historically, the meaning of \"British\" has never had much traction. As Britons, we are like the man in the <em>New Yorker</em> cartoon who says to his shrink: \"Call it denial if you like, but I think what goes on in my personal life is none of my own damn business.\"</p> <p>Just five years ago, during a rare bout of navel-gazing, when polled about what it was that made them proud to be British, more than 60% said they couldn't think of a single thing. A recent Channel 4 documentary about multicultural Bradford showed one contemporary white Briton, a man, boasting: \"I know I'm a British citizen because I'm not anything else.\"</p> <p>Those days are gone. The <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/39zq7\" title=\"\">poll reported in today's <em>Observer</em></a> tells us that, since the Games, a staggering 82% are proud to be British, while 70% agree that the combination of the Games and the jubilee have \"improved the mood of the nation\" and brought people together. A further 86% believe that the Games has had a beneficial effect on the public mood, while 78% think that the Olympic achievement has had a positive effect on \"the way Britain is viewed by the rest of the world\". This adds up to a profound change.</p> <p>Today, the jubilee and the Olympics have brought a new generation of Britons to the foreground, liberating a new enthusiasm for the union flag. Orwell's \"muddle\" has become something to celebrate. For many Britons, to be \"British\" is to be part of a phenomenon&#xa0;that&#xa0;is polyvalent, adaptive, global&#xa0;and even subversive. Strangely, for an idea that has been painfully associated with empire and colonialism, Britishness is found on the side of the individual in society, especially against elites.</p> <p>A Sri Lankan or a South African immigrant to these islands might be reluctant to embrace the cross of St&#xa0;George. You can't be Scots and English, but you can be Scots and British. Or Asian, or Muslim, or Chinese \u2013 and British. As I said in my lecture, \"British\" is a loose, hospitable definition. With a place for the flags of Scotland, Wales and England, on equal terms. Beyond these islands, even if you have a funny name or look a little different, you can still be a Briton.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/17/being-british-does-it-matter\" title=\"\">recent discussion in the <em>Observe</em>r </a>gives substance to this proposition. Shazia Awan, 29, born in Wales and co-founder of the Peachy Pink fashion and sports brand, said she was \"very proud to be British. I consider it an absolute honour and privilege,\" she said, \"to be born in a western society where we've got democracy, human rights, the right to vote, rights for women, and parliament.\"</p> <p>Her sentiments were echoed by Rajeeb Dey, 26, born in Basildon, Essex, and recently named the world's youngest global leader by the World Economic Forum. Dey said: \"I see myself as a British Asian. To be British is very much about being in a melting pot of different cultures and backgrounds. That's what I love about Britain.\"</p> <p>One unintended consequence of Team GB's Olympic triumph has been to suck the air out of Salmond's Scottish balloon. When Chris Hoy and Andy Murray speak about the buzz of performing for \"the home crowd\", and when an international kaleidoscope of athletes acknowledge a society expressive of tolerance and humanity, the union flag is less a symbol of an 18th-century political fudge that's past its sell-by date, more the emblem of a globally responsive community.</p> <p>In anticipation of my remarks in the Hub (a converted church at the top of the Royal Mile), I had prepared some lines of defence against crotchety Scot Nat audience members. As it turned out, the mood of the meeting (about 400 people) was discreetly pro-union. Agreed, the average age was close to 55 (younger Scots favour independence), but I found no appetite for a discussion about breaking away.</p> <p>And this is before the terms of the referendum have been settled. After that, some Scottish heavyweights will bring their formidable intellectual cannon to bear on the SNP's arguments. Speaking in Edinburgh, Brown said that a Britain based on shared values could become \"a beacon\" for nations living together in \"a multinational world\". This line will doubtless be backed up by some fierce Caledonian number-crunching. As one local said to me last week: \"The Scots never take their eye off the bottom line.\"</p> <p>Brown will certainly&#xa0;be joined by politicians Malcolm Rifkind, Charles Kennedy and Alistair Darling, writer Allan Massie and broadcaster&#xa0;James Naughtie, together with many other freethinking Scots intellect-uals, sportsmen and entrepreneurs who prefer the muddle of the union to the clinical solitude of independence.</p> <p>After the British summer of 2012, Alex Salmond may have to settle for \"devo max\", which is probably what he wanted all along.</p>",
  "<p>The report by Andrew Tyrie's committee of MPs on the Libor-fixing scandal is a good read, unless you happen to be one of the characters mentioned in the 122 pages. For example, on the vexed topic of the role of Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker, and whether or not he encouraged Barclays to reduce its Libor submissions, the report concludes that the bank \"did not need a nod, a wink or any signal\" to reduce rates. \"The bank was already well practised in doing this.\"</p> <p>Remember that the fines against Barclays covered two periods \u2013 from 2005, when Libor submissions were being distorted to potentially make profits, and the period during the banking crisis, when the submissions were being lowered to avoid the negative publicity that a high rate might attract.</p> <p>In fact, the MPs' report correctly makes the point that the conversation between Tucker and the former Barclays boss Bob Diamond that took up so much of the Treasury select committee's time is probably a bit of a \"smokescreen\", distracting from evidence that individuals had been attempting to manipulate Libor a full three years before the crisis.</p> <p>It is certainly a confused story: Diamond's \"file note\" of the conversation, which he sent to the bank's then chief executive, John Varley, and copied to chief operating officer Jerry del Missier, reads as if Tucker wanted Barclays to get its Libor submissions down. But Tucker and Diamond insist this was not what was intended, while del Missier has since admitted he misunderstood. And a dump of documents alongside the report provides Varley's point of view: he says he did not discuss the matter with Diamond, although he did ring officials to insist Barclays was not in difficulty during the crisis period.</p> <p>And then there are the accusations that Diamond gave \"highly selective\" answers when he appeared before the hearing \u2013 largely a reference to what he said when asked about regulatory concerns. Documents published on Saturday include a letter from the Bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, to the committee that appears to support Diamond. Agius tells the MPs that Diamond \"had not had the benefit of seeing in advance\" some of the documents on which their questions were based. But the verdict on Diamond \u2013 who insists he was candid \u2013 remains damning.</p> <p>It is a sorry state of affairs and one that MPs believe is likely to be replicated in other corners of the City. Royal Bank of Scotland has already prepared the ground by warning that a fine is coming. The FSA has said that seven institutions, in addition to Barclays, are being investigated for attempting to manipulate interest rates.</p> <p>But for now the spotlight is on Barclays, which, the report says, saw a \"prolonged period of extremely weak internal compliance and board governance\". The bank's chief executive has now gone and the chairman, Marcus Agius, will go at the end of October when Sir David Walker takes over. But Walker \u2013 highly respected and widely seen as the right man for the role \u2013 has insisted that a full-scale clearout of the boardroom will not be needed once he has found a replacement for Diamond.</p> <p>Surely he is wrong. As the MPs point out, many of the bank's non-executives were in post for substantial parts of the period in question: David Booth joined in May 2007; Fulvio Conti joined in May 2006 and has been on the audit committee since September 2006; Sir Andrew Likierman joined in May 2004 and has been on the audit committee since September 2004. Sir John Sunderland, who led the search for a new chairman, joined in June 2005.</p> <p>This board needs new blood \u2013 and that includes ensuring that the new chief executive comes from outside the existing management.</p> <h2>A reminder that life is also a precious commodity</h2> <p>The appalling loss of life at the Marikana mine has shocked South Africa and should remind the rest of the world that platinum and other commodities used in modern life are often produced in volatile circumstances. The particulars of the incident \u2013 in which more than 30&#xa0;demonstrators were killed by police, raising memories of the apartheid-era <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/19/south-africa-sharpeville-massacre-anniversary\" title=\"\">Sharpeville</a>correct massacre \u2013 are exceptional, but injuries and loss of life from mining accidents are not.</p> <p>Statistics from the South African Chamber of Mines show that until 2007 more than 200 South African miners were dying a year in accidents. In 2010 the figure was 120 \u2013 32 of those in platinum mines. Lonmin's <a href=\"https://www.lonmin.com/Interim_Report_2012/business_review/chief_executive_officers_review_02.html#Mining_Division\" title=\"\">financial report</a> on the first half of this year highlighted problems at Marikana, saying its operations there \"have been able to maintain production despite the headwinds of industrial relations, safety stoppages and community unrest\".</p> <p>What happened last week remains unclear. Lonmin said it \"deeply regretted\" the incident but insisted it was a public-order rather than an industrial-relations issue.</p> <p>Clashes between police and demonstrators in which lives are lost may be unusual these days, but disputes over wages for dangerous mining jobs are not. The strikers at Marikana were asking for a pay rise to 12,500 rand a month \u2013 less than \u00a31,000 \u2013 at a time when mining companies are grappling with falling commodity prices and looking to cut costs.</p> <p>In recent days mining firms such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton have talked about the need to save money and slow developments to reflect a slowdown in demand from customers such as China.</p> <p>In the wake of the shootings Lonmin's share price fell, but the concern was over the loss of production rather than life.</p> <p>We rely on mines such as Marikana to make our lives easier: the metal plays a vital role in the catalytic converters used to purify car exhaust fumes. The problems have forced Lonmin to halt production at all its South African operations, which account for 12% of global platinum output, and that could have repercussions for the car industry.</p> <p>In a boom time, commodities, often mined in struggling developing nations such as South Africa, can produce lots of jobs, plus enormous wealth for mining companies \u2013 and host governments. But they can also highlight disparities in wealth and trigger corruption, which is why people talk about the \"commodity curse\". That curse looks to have struck again.</p> <h2>Complex rail system means missed connections</h2> <p>Before the banking crisis, the railways functioned as a lightning rod for the economic, political and social concerns of the day. Whether it was privatisation, the closure of rural lines under Beeching, or high fares, the rail network represented more than just a means of getting from A to B.</p> <p>Last week saw rail take centre stage again, thanks to confirmation of another year of inflation-busting fare increases and the award of the \u00a35.5bn west coast rail franchise to FirstGroup, signalling the exit of Virgin Trains from the rail business. Amid the blame and counter blame from unions, Tories, Labour and passengers, one thing became clear: we have lost a collective sense of what the railway is for.</p> <p>Given the current structure of the industry, that is no surprise. The Department for Transport leases the right to run privately operated trains on routes that are presided over by Network Rail, a quasi-private and state-funded company. Who oversees this? The Office of Rail Regulation monitors safety and Network Rail's finances, which include debts of \u00a327bn underwritten by the fare payer. Oh, and fares are set by the government. Not the train operators. It's a mess.</p> <p>No wonder passengers feel a total lack of empowerment. As the late, great historian Tony Judt wrote: \"The railways ... are a collective project for individual benefit. They cannot exist without common accord and \u2026 common expenditure.\" This muddle, and lack of institutional clarity, endangers their future.</p>",
  "<p>Dear Mark, You're a tough, shrewd and principled operator, so why on Earth shouldn't you move from BBC director general to chief executive of the <em>New York Times</em>? Top talent flows both ways across the Atlantic every day of the year. From Auntie to Gray Lady in a single bound! Don't pay too much attention to what the doubters say.</p> <p>Don't worry that Arthur Sulzberger Jr, your very executive chairman, is really running the show. Of course he is (except that his own show must surely be closing soon). Or that a job like yours can lie eerily vacant for eight long months without anyone worrying. Or that the mix of family-manipulated shares and Wall Street may prove troublesome, going on toxic. This is the story of upmarket US newspaper life in the 21st century.</p> <p>You've been hired to make a difference, to give a struggling enterprise the sheen of future hope and glory. When Arthur talks iPlayers, video, mobiles and your Olympic glory, he believes you could be the man who walks the walk for him. Think Chairman Patten and breathe deeply. You may be a footnote to history, but at least you'll have died with your Gucci boots on.</p> <p>There is one question floating here, trickier than any gizmo or boardroom manoeuvre, though. Answer it \u2013 for the paper that everyone watches and obsesses over \u2013 and you could be a global hero, a saviour. But first, put the easy assumptions to one side. Look at the evidence month by month.</p> <p>The evidence most observers now take as a given says print newspapers are doomed, victims of a ravening internet. See the <em>New York Times's</em> print circulation plummet from far over a million to 778,000 in two harsh decades, humiliatingly far behind Murdoch's 1,566,000 for his newsprint <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Watch print advertising revenues flake away by as much as two-thirds over the same span. Once advertising and a modest cover price could support the quality the <em>Times</em> believes in. But no longer, unless a paywall and proliferating outlets can make up for the money draining away.</p> <p>Perhaps they can, in part. If you add digital and print subscriptions together, as American circulation auditors have taken to doing, then it's possible to claim a 73% expansion on the <em>Times</em> year-on-year. One analyst (for Barclays Research) sees digital subscription money overtaking print subscription cash by the spring of 2014. The paywall the <em>Times</em> eventually devised \u2013 limited access to stories free, then a charge for more regular customers \u2013 hasn't harmed the number of unique visitors coming to its site and theoretically bringing advertising with them: indeed, it seems the example that most big-city US papers embrace. And yet, for all this splurge of goodish news, this still isn't enough.</p> <p>What's a putative $100m in digital subscriptions when the enterprise needs perhaps 15 times as much revenue to carry on as before? How do you staunch the flow of constant print advertising losses \u2013 and, for the moment, a nasty stalling of digital advertising growth? It's a transatlantic dilemma. Turn, as you will be doing constantly, I guess, to the latest British ABC circulation figures to see the same problems posed here. Print circulations overall down 8.91% on July 2011. No real source for cheer as even the <em>Sun</em> \u2013 down 9.6% in a year \u2013 fails to shine. Storm clouds over the <em>Daily Star Sunday</em> as its subsides to 456,000. (Perhaps Richard Desmond will sell it, if he can.) Apprehension as the <em>Independent</em> records just 84,000 (down 54%) whilst the <em>i</em> puts on 53% to 273,000. These are confected, bulk-bulwarked statistics to be sure: but how long can the mothership survive?</p> <p>But then, Mark, scratch your head as you stroll to the other end of the newsstand and examine the way that magazines, both in the US and Britain, have been performing.</p> <p>The new six-month circulation figures for American magazines offer a confusing choice of messages. Do you concentrate on the 9.6% overall drop in newsstand sales (with <em>Cosmopolitan</em> down 15%, <em>Vogue</em> down 16% and <em>Weight Watchers</em> a whopping 30% off)? Or is it more significant that subscription sales, by far the weightiest category, are up \u2013 yes, up! \u2013 1.1%? Should we reel before the wondrous growth of digital replica editions (doubled in a year) or note that they're still only 1.7% of the market (ie so tiny as to make damn-all difference)?</p> <p>The wisdom of the analysts seems rather more earthbound here. American consumers are short of cash. They're going into supermarkets with lists of things to buy. That list may include a food or home magazine, both categories doing well. But it doesn't include celebrity mags, with stories already aired on the net, nor big-cover-price numbers like <em>Vanity Fair</em> (down 19%). Forget some of the more florid digital lectures, <em>pro tem</em>. Think dollars, cents, pounds, shillings \u2013 and simple common sense.</p> <p>Which is surely the lesson here in Britain, too, as our own ABCs echo many of the US magazine themes. Of course there are some mighty fallers: Mr Desmond's celebrity contenders, from <em>Star</em> to <em>OK!</em>, seem to be catching the flu. But the overall drop, compared with the same six months of 2011, is only 2.1% (under a quarter of newspaper decline). And all manner of magazines \u2013 from <em>Slimming World</em> to <em>Private Eye</em> \u2013 are performing spectacularly well. More relevant, too, in your new area of responsibility in New York, is the way that domestic news and current affairs magazines, as a sector, are up 5.4% \u2013 while international news magazines have lifted by 9.5%.</p> <p>There is, in short, nothing to suggest an overarching malaise that also dooms print magazines to rapid extinction. Rather the reverse. Of course some formulas run out of gas. And of course constantly raising the cover price whilst cutting back on pagination, promotion and staff is a recipe for deteriorating fortunes. But, at root, there's no pat symmetry between the supposed fate of newspapers and the prospective death of magazines.</p> <p>And it isn't just the 20p <em>i</em> here in the UK that shows signs of renewed life, Mark. It's a question of focus, innovation and ambition as well. The print <em>New York Times</em> is a natural cousin of some greater BBC family. Editorially, it moves cautiously, if at all. Its design is legacy, going on funereal. Its habit of turning stories from page to page is guaranteed to make would-be young readers reach for their iPhones. It is much in awe of its own legend. It has manifestly not rethought its role or style for decades of sometimes grandiloquent self-satisfaction.</p> <p>The Sulzberger notion now seems simply to be: carry on as before. Invent digital bells and whistles that will bring in dollars and maybe enhance our worldwide reach. But don't touch the mothership \u2013 except by gently thinning staffing, thinning pages, thinning value. Editors should be left alone to edit. Hired CEOs should be asked to invent escape hatches. Nobody should go back to basics. Yet, since you've been given at least some high-profile responsibility, and since you're a journalist not a manager at heart, you'll certainly want to think all the fundamentals through.</p> <p>Is there any true sign that full transition to the net will be complete in our lifetimes, if at all? Why is the <em>Economist</em> growing and prospering on paper as well as via cyberspace? Coming fresh to America, and all these imponderables, you're intrinsically being asked to find a balance where things you depend on, such as print advertising, aren't blithely written off but made part of a managed transition \u2013 with the wilder shores of vision or despair stripped out.</p> <p>Start with the paper itself, as you did at the BBC with the programmes you made. And always believe that somehow, amid so much foreboding, there is a better way. Remember how the doubters said that the last BBC charter renewal, the one you helped mastermind, would be the last? What garbage that seems now, as subscription models become the media flavour of the decade. Travel hopefully, Mark: and don't forget your big shtick.</p> <p>Last week the BBC wouldn't tell us how much it spent on Olympic coverage. A matter of \"commercial\" secrecy, it said: for some but not all, apparently, as NBC of America promptly lifted the curtain a little and revealed that it spent $1.1bn on US rights plus $200m on production. And now (<a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/writers/richard_deitsch/08/10/NBCs-Mark-Lazarus-responds-to-criticism/index.html\" title=\"\">in a <em>Sports Illustrated</em> interview</a>) the same NBC executive, Mark Lazarus, tells us that the BBC paid $100m for rights to the London Games. Secrecy, schmecrecy \u2026 it was still worth it.</p>",

  "<p>Today is <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/humanitarianday/\" title=\"\">World Humanitarian Day</a>. It marks the anniversary of the day on which S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, the special representative of the secretary-general to Iraq, and 21 colleagues were killed by a massive car-bomb attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad. It is a day to pay tribute to all humanitarian personnel who have lost their lives in the line of duty and to all those who continue to take risks to relieve the suffering of the less fortunate.</p> <p>The Canal Hotel bombing, as it became known, irreversibly changed the security situation in which humanitarian aid workers operate. In the past, aid workers were respected, not targeted. The flags and emblems of humanitarian organisations that traditionally provided a shield for aid workers are now turning them into potential targets.</p> <p>Humanitarian work is one of the world's most dangerous professions. Kidnappings, shootings and death threats are all part of the job description in places such as Sudan, Syria, Somalia and others blighted by conflict. Those who work in this rocky terrain are increasingly exposed to risk while maintaining a lifeline to the victims of wars and disasters.</p> <p>It is self-evidently unacceptable that they are subject to harassment, abduction or even plain murder while serving humanity.</p> <p>Attacks on humanitarian posts have tripled in the last decade. Since 2011, 109 humanitarian workers have been killed, 143 others were wounded and 132 have been kidnapped, according to the United Nations. Crimes against unarmed civilians are never justified. When these crimes are committed against people who dedicate their lives to saving others, the injustice is ever more apparent.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it's important to remember that the overwhelming majority of these victims are not international aid workers from western countries, but those serving in their own country, working closest to the local population. Humanitarian aid is not the preserve of the west but a global imperative. The many national aid workers who have made the ultimate sacrifice bear witness to this.</p> <p>Over the last 12 months, Syria has become a killing ground. Six humanitarian aid workers have been killed since the beginning of this year, all of them Syrian staff. In two cases, it is alleged that the victims, both from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, were deliberately targeted. As with the shooting at ambulances, the misuse of hospitals and the shelling of civilians, these are direct violations of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The safety and security of aid workers are directly linked to safe access to vulnerable populations and the sustainable delivery of assistance. The violence committed against aid workers also affects those they are helping. Thousands of vulnerable people can be left without essential support if aid is suspended or closed due to insecurity.</p> <p>Humanitarian principles and international legal frameworks offer a degree of formal protection but only if and when they are observed and respected. Sadly, the conditions in which humanitarian workers operate are growing more dangerous every year.</p> <p>Humanitarians draw the world closer together by reminding us that we are one family, sharing the same dreams for a peaceful planet, where all people can live in safety and with dignity.</p> <p>This is also a day to examine our lives and consider what more we can do to help \u2013 to reach out to people enduring conflict, disaster and hardship.&#xa0; Let those we honour today inspire us to start our own journey to make the world a better place and bring our human family more closely together.</p>",

The wise thing to do, of course, would be to ignore them. Move on. Return to real life. Cherish the memories and not waste time looking for answers.</p> <p>And in this spirit there are indeed some queries that I'm happy to leave well alone. The meaning and purpose of Fatboy Slim's inflatable octopus, for example, and the disturbing shape and colour of Ray Davies's hair.</p> <p>But there are certain itches that cannot remain unscratched. And so, almost a week on from the celebration of great British popular music, there's still the bemused urge to know what preening boy band One Direction were doing there, and how George Michael was allowed to perform a song that no one had ever heard, and why Annie Lennox chose the dirgeful Little Bird and looked like she was appearing in a zombie version of <em>Les Miserables</em>, and what conceivable bearing on anything did the lifeless fashion interlude have?</p> <p>Such is the imponderable nature of these decisions that no doubt even the artistic director, Kim Gavin, would struggle to provide a rational explanation. Certainly the BBC commentating team of Huw Edwards, Hazel Irvine and Trevor Nelson were of little help. Only Nelson could boast any expertise in the field, but for all his professions of awe he sounded morosely detached or underwhelmed.</p> <p>As Irvine is so straight that she makes Sue Barker seem like a rock chick, she unwittingly gave the impression that, all things considered, she'd rather be interviewing Lee Westwood about his short game.</p> <p>Thus it fell to Edwards, the Martyn Lewis of his generation, to enlighten us. \"It's a jam-packed hour full of big names and brilliant music,\" he said in the officious tone of a budget airline steward running through a list of available sandwich fillings.</p> <p>In the event, the names were not as big as they might have been and the music mostly fell short of brilliant, but there were several highly enjoyable sequences. Curmudgeons have complained that there was too much pop music, as though the evening might have benefited from a performance of John Tavener's <em>The Protecting Veil</em>.</p> <p>But Gavin's idea \u2013 and it was a sound one \u2013 was to throw a party, and to that end the much-maligned (at least by the shoe-gazing fraternity of music critics) Jessie J turned in a PB performance, bringing a voice and vibrancy to the proceedings that the lacklustre Spice Girls couldn't hope to match.</p> <p>If Gavin's vision \u2013 full of mod London aesthetics \u2013 was narrower and less bold than Danny Boyle's, that was only right. The job of the opening was to raise a curtain on a nation, whereas that of the closing was to raise a glass to the Games. Both, like Team GB itself, reached Olympian heights.</p> <p>Those musical selection quibbles aside, the one slight disappointment was that the BBC, which put in a near-faultless performance over 17 days, sent the wrong team to the final event. Edwards and Irvine made it seem like being stuck at the school leaving disco with the headmaster and PE teacher, which, if nothing else, lent renewed resonance to the Who's spirited rendition of My Generation: \"Why don't you all f-fade away/ And don't try to dig what we all say.\"</p> <p>There were two films last week that relied on surprising castings for much of their dramatic punch. The weightiest of them was <strong>Tracie's Story</strong>, the first in the second series of Jimmy McGovern's <em>Accused</em>. It featured Sean Bean as Tracie, a love-starred transvestite who would have given Les Dawson's Ada a run for her money in a world's least-convincing woman competition.</p> <p>Better known for playing gruff, macho men, Bean was excellent as both Tracie and her male self, Simon, a frustrated English teacher, forever doomed to recite The Lady of Shalott.</p> <p>Dressed in spangly minidress and fright wig, the burly Tracie asked a bartender for a \"multiple orgasm\".</p> <p>\"On the rocks?\" he asked mechanically.</p> <p>\"Wherever, darling,\" she quipped back, \"I'm easy.\"</p> <p>That could have sounded just like a Les Dawson sketch, but Bean brought a touching melancholy to Tracie that suggested a scarred vulnerability beneath the brash Yorkshire wit. Equally well handled was the dalliance with Stephen Graham's conflicted married man.</p> <p>It worked as a parody of the heterosexual extramarital affair, intimating that affairs are themselves a parody of marriage and, in turn, that marriage can be a parody of love. They may not be original points, but they were addressed with originality, which at this late stage of human evolution is all that you can ask.</p> <p>What undermined the story was the inbuilt series conceit of a neat courtroom ending. In this case it hinged on Graham's character's failure to recognise Tracie in her non-drag Simon persona. Love may be blind, but not <em>that</em> blind. You simply can't hide Bean's distinctively masculine face with a bit of makeup and false hair. It would be like trying to conceal the identity of Abraham Lincoln's Mount Rushmore sculpture by spraying rouge on its cheeks.</p> <p>The other piece of conspicuous casting of the week was Rob Brydon as a first bed- then wheelchair-bound soldier in <strong>The Best of Men</strong>. Here was a drama that was utterly fearless in the face of social stereotypes and sentimental tropes, embracing both in the heartiest of warming hugs.</p> <p>A fictionalised account of the postwar origins of the Paralympics at Stoke Mandeville hospital, it focused on Dr Ludwig Guttmann, the German refugee who revolutionised the treatment of paraplegics. As played by Eddie Marsan, he was a scourge of received wisdom and apathy who was wont to say things such as: \"Ve are vinning ze battle of ze buttock.\"</p> <p>Brydon did well as an alternately brooding and wisecracking Welshman struggling to come to terms with his paralysis, but he was powerless to dislodge the treacly atmosphere of costumed nostalgia that smothered the proceedings like gauze on a camera&#xa0;lens.</p> <p>No one in their right mind looks to ITV two-part crime dramas for a shot of uncompromising verisimilitude, but even so, <strong>Thirteen Steps Down</strong> set new records on the codswallopometer. It was as if it had been filmed as an experiment in which character motivation was replaced by thematic reiteration. That would be a challenging strategy at the best of times, but plain bonkers when dealing with a plot that veered around like a meths drinker on a unicycle.</p> <p>There was a psychotic young man (Luke Treadaway) sharing a house with a grumpy old lady (Geraldine James) and a lot of hocus pocus about John Christie, the creepy serial killer of 10 Rillington Place fame. But that summary implies a narrative cohesion it never began to attain. How I longed for the dramatic discipline of the Olympic 5,000m.</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of his third year at Sussex, Ian McEwan, somewhat reluctantly, visited the university's careers office. He already knew that he wanted to be a writer, but perhaps, he thought, this could be done in combination with a parent-placating job: \"I had read<em> Seven Pillars of Wisdom </em>[by TE Lawrence] and the one thing I could imagine being was an Arabist diplomat, the kind of man who would wear a dinner jacket one evening and a keffiyeh the next.\" The careers office gave him a pamphlet. \"On the back of it was a table. There were two columns. On one side was your age, all the way up to 65. On the other was your expected salary at any given age. I looked at it and it filled me with horror. My whole life was there. I was going to spend the next 35 years working my way through this table.\" The aspiring author's riding-a-camel-over-a-sand-dune fantasies were thus brought to a sudden and rather feeble end.</p> <p>Luckily, this was the early 70s, when it was very bliss to be alive. Honestly! \"I had the time of my life,\" says McEwan, with a fervent smile. \"It was very easy not to have a job, to live the life of a full-time writer. I had a huge apartment in south London and it cost me \u00a33 a week. The occasional review for the <em>TLS</em>, the occasional piece for <em>Radio&#xa0;Times</em>, and I could very easily pay my rent, buy a few books, make a weekly trip to the launderette. There were no machines everyone needed, apart from a hi-fi. I didn't feel poor at all. At the risk of sounding like Virginia Woolf, I could live on \u00a3700 a year.\"</p> <p>But what about the chaos? The piles of rubbish, the power cuts, the bodies left unburied? \"Oh, the crises didn't trouble me at all. I didn't own anything; I had no stake. I was restless, excited and a touch reckless. I remember reading Daniel Defoe's <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>. I loved the idea of a city in chaos. There was this line in it that went something like, 'We walked north out of London in order not to have the sun on our faces.' I thought: that's real freedom. I had this 'let it come down' feeling.\"</p> <p>There follows a brief pause while he considers what brought an end to this low-level insurrection, and I attempt to match up the 70s McEwan, hair trailing his cheesecloth collar, with the 21st-century version, who is today wearing tastefully crushed pale linen. His task is probably the easier. As he will tell me: \"The moment you have children and a mortgage you want things to work; you're locked into the human project and you want it to flourish.\" For my part, a leap of imagination is required. When I was told my meeting with McEwan would take place in the boardroom of his publisher, Random House, I was terribly disappointed; I wanted to nose round one of his famously lovely homes (preferably the exquisite Fitzrovia terraced house that was the model for the surgeon Henry Perowne's house in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/30/fiction.bookerprize2005\" title=\"\"><em> Saturday</em></a>). But now it strikes me as rather appropriate. McEwan is the nearest thing to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/22/publishers-ebook-popularity\" title=\"\"> EL James</a> that literary fiction has right now; in this sense, the boardroom chair on which he is uncomfortably perched \u2013 it keeps flipping back, forcing his knees up in the direction of his ears \u2013 might as well be a throne. No wonder I can no more see him in a launderette than I can picture him watching <em>The Only Way is Essex</em>.</p> <p>Anyway, the 70s. That is the decade in which McEwan's new book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224097376\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>, is set. I can't say too much about its plot, for the simple reason that it's a novel with a <em>Roger Ackroyd</em>-ish twist and it would be awful to ruin the surprise. But here are the bare bones: Serena Frome is a young Cambridge graduate who finds herself recruited to MI5. An avid reader, she's deployed to work on a cold war propaganda scheme, codenamed Sweet Tooth, in which government cash will secretly be deployed to fund artists likely to portray the west in a favourable light. One of these artists is a promising young writer, Tom Haley. First, Serena falls in love with his stories. Then she falls in love with their writer. No, she is not a particularly good spy. Her real-life contemporary, Stella Rimington, would have had her for breakfast. (<em>Sweet Tooth</em>, incidentally, makes reference to an ambitious colleague of Serena's called Millie Trimingham.)</p> <p>How did this curious, beguiling book \u2013 a spy novel without even so much as a hint of a poison-tipped umbrella \u2013 begin? Which came first, MI5 or the 70s? \"It's hard to say,\" says McEwan. \"I rather drift into my novels. For a long time I've been interested in the <em>Encounter </em>affair [Stephen Spender resigned as the editor of the literary magazine <em>Encounter</em> in 1967, after it was revealed that the CIA had been covertly funding it], and I wondered if there was something in there for me; after I finished <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099512790\" title=\"\"><em>On Chesil Beach</em>,</a> which is set in the early 60s, I thought: sooner or later I'm going to write about England in the 70s. So I think it was both. In the end, though, I just took up my green notebook and got Serena to start talking \u2013 albeit somewhat against my will.\" Why? \"Because I've got a prejudice against first-person narratives. There are too many of them. They're too easy; it's just ventriloquism and authors can hide their terrible style behind characterisation. Any number of cliches are permitted.\"</p> <p>McEwan's MI5 is a hidebound place, staffed mostly by Pooterish, middle-aged men; filing cabinets are the order of the day, not invisible ink. He was, he says, interested in the idea of institutions and how they grow to have their own weird logic. \"What was extraordinary about the cultural cold war was that the CIA in particular poured millions of dollars into very worthy things \u2013 like a festival of atonal music in Paris in 1950. The idea was to persuade left-of-centre European intellectuals that the west was best and that America wasn't just mindless and materialist. And when you think about the horrors the Soviet regime produced, you think: why not? But you also think: why did they do this in secret? Why didn't the government just use the National Endowment for the Arts or something? It never occurred to them that secrecy wasn't necessary.\"</p> <p>In the novel, though, his interest in MI5 wavers a little once Tom Haley appears on the scene, perhaps because he and Tom Haley have so much in common. Haley teaches at Sussex University; he's published by Tom Maschler, who first edited McEwan; he does a reading for his first novel with McEwan's friend, Martin Amis; and two of his stories have been purloined on his behalf from his creator's backlist. \"Yes,\" says McEwan. \"Well spotted. The novel is a muted and distorted autobiography, though unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend.\"</p> <p>So what is he saying, exactly? This merging of fact and fiction, and the several duplicities that run through the book, when combined with its passionate accounts of reading and writing, suggest, at least to me, that<em> Sweet Tooth</em> is a meditation on the fact that novelists are cunning and cold-hearted thieves; in fact, doesn't Tom Haley say as much? \"Yes. Tom mentions the ruthlessness that is necessary to the process \u2013 and it's Serena's fear, too, that he'll write about her.\" Graham Greene said that all writers have a \"chip of ice\" in their hearts. Does he?</p> <p>\"No, I don't think I do. Philip Roth once said to me years ago, when he took an interest in me as a young writer: you've got to write as if your parents are dead. It was very good advice, and I stuck to it, and now I look back with some horror. My father, especially, was torn between exultant pride that I'd published a book and sheer horror at what was in it. So I must have had a steely bit of detachment then. But I've never done what Bellow did in <em>Herzog,</em> or Roth, or Hanif [Kureishi]\u2026 put their ex-wives in books. I couldn't do that.\" He thinks for a moment. \"My chip of ice is a bit\u2026 slushy.\"</p> <p>Ian McEwan is the child of a soldier: his father, David, was a working-class Scot who worked his way up to the rank of major. He was born in Aldershot and lived first in Germany and then in Libya until, at the age of 11, he was sent to a state-run boarding school in Suffolk. McEwan has said in the past that this was quite a bleak time: \"I just went numb for four or five years.\" On the other hand, his dorm experiences came in handy when, in 2005, he travelled with the environmental group Cape Farewell to Svalbard in the Arctic \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/14/solar-ian-mcewan\" title=\"\">trip that inspired his last novel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099549024\" title=\"\"><em>Solar</em></a>. Not for him the chaos of the bootroom. He kept his stuff safely under his bed.</p> <p>After an English degree at Sussex he went to the University of East Anglia, where he studied for an MA, tutored by Angus Wilson and Malcolm Bradbury. He moved to London in 1974 and became part of the literary set that centred on Ian Hamilton's <a href=\"http://www.ianhamilton.org/newreview/index.html\" title=\"\"><em>New Review</em></a> (Hamilton, like Wilson, has a walk on part in <em>Sweet Tooth</em>) and the Pillars of Hercules pub in Greek Street, Soho. It was during this time that he formed some of his most important friendships: with Martin Amis, Julian Barnes and Christopher Hitchens.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-appreciation-by-ian-mcewan\" title=\"\">Hitchens died of cancer last year.</a> What is the post-Hitch world like? Oh no. He looks so terrible, as pale as ash, I wish I had not asked. \"It's very\u2026 desolate. It really does feel empty. He was the one of us who seemed to embrace all of literature; as time goes by, I don't think people will associate him with his taking an unusual line on Iraq. They will connect him with his brilliant essays on writers: Chesterton, Kipling, Wodehouse. The appetite. The conversations. I really do miss them. Martin and I regularly check in with each other in the post-Hitch desert.\"</p> <p>How, though, did he manage to stay friends with them all? The literary world can be bitchy and envious. Fall-outs are standard. \"Well, we knew each other before we were known; it's not as if we are movie stars all hanging out together.\" Besides, he says, novel-writing isn't like sprinting. No one needs to come second; there is infinite space for good writing. \"And perhaps we're too old, now, to be jealous. The status anxiety wears off. I like their company. Supper at Julian's is one of the great pleasures.\"</p> <p>But what if one of them had had to slope off and join a less celebrated profession? \"It probably would have changed things, yes. Maybe it was a self-selecting group, though. Who would want to hang out around the Pillars of Hercules? Only those bent by this passion for writing books. We were absolutely determined to become writers. We didn't use words like 'passion', but we acted them out. Writing was the only important thing.\"</p> <p>His success came a little later than that of Amis. The early macabre books \u2013 think incest, think murder, think sex with shop mannequins \u2013 were acclaimed and they had their devoted fans, but I don't imagine they were big sellers (the first came out in 1975). Then, in 1998, his novel <em>Amsterdam</em> won the Booker prize. Nine years later, his 2001 novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/23/fiction.bookerprize2001\" title=\"\"><em>Atonement</em></a> was made into an Oscar-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119568/atonement\" title=\"\">film</a>, at which point its already considerable sales doubled, even tripled. Does he think success has an effect on creativity?</p> <p>\"Of course it makes a difference,\" he says. \"But I've always done what I want to do, with the result that when I close the door and unhook the phone I feel all the old anxieties associated with trying to get something right.\" And there are certain new anxieties. \"You worry that sooner or later \u2013 it has to happen \u2013 you can't write; that you will become less thought-rich; there is the danger of repeating yourself. All writers in their 60s have to confront these things. When should you stop? Do you tail away with a series of feeble novellas? But in the silence of trying to do it, it doesn't feel different.\" He is keen to remind me that <em>Atonement</em> is an anomaly. \"It [having a huge hit] happened once. A couple of books recently haven't earned back their advances, and the advances weren't that big. <em>Solar</em>, since I'm being frank with you, was loathed by the Americans. It absolutely bombed.\"</p> <p>This is no good. If he's trying, metaphorically speaking, to give me a reality-checking cold shower, it isn't working. His life, from the outside, seems so replete, so purposeful, so \u2013 not a word one usually associates with writers \u2013 happy. It's enough to make you sick! He laughs. \"Yeah, well, stay with that thought.\" And then: \"Like lots of people, I made a very good second marriage [to Annalena McAfee, a journalist whom he met when she came to interview him]. We have to learn how to get that right\u2026 and I take a lot of delight in my sons [from his first marriage, to Penny Allen, whom he divorced in 1995]. I thought it would be bleak when they stopped thinking I was God, but I love the unfolding plot of their early adulthood.\" One is a molecular biologist, the other is working in PR.</p> <p>You can't necessarily organise how life works out, he tells me. But still, I can't help but read his own contentment \u2013 such peace always involves, I think, a certain amount of effort \u2013 as a rebuke to his (now dead) parents. Their marriage was troubled, largely because they were keeping a painful secret: in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/17/books.booksnews\" title=\"\">2007, McEwan discovered that he had an older brother</a>, Dave Sharp \u2013 the result of an affair between his parents when his mother, Rose, was still married to her first husband (Ernest Wort, with whom she had two children, was off fighting in Italy; her baby with David McEwan was born in 1942; Wort died from combat injuries in 1944). The baby was given away via a newspaper ad in the <em>Reading Mercury </em>which said: \"Wanted, Home for Baby Boy, age one month; complete surrender.\"</p> <p>\"That would have been my father,\" says McEwan. \"He would have written that ad. 'Complete surrender' \u2013 it's semi-military.\" Did he feel cross when he discovered what his parents had done? \"Yes. I wanted to shake them. I wanted to say, 'Confront this; deal with it, make yourselves happy.' My regret is that they didn't meet David, because he would have reassured them he wasn't bitter. One of the first things he [David] said to me was, 'I was loved as a child.' He went to visit my mother but she'd already lost her mind. If he'd gone even a year earlier\u2026\"</p> <p>It's such a sad story, given that Rose and David eventually married and could have brought up their child together. \"Yes. They closed something down for themselves. Probably that was my father too. I can hear him say it, 'What's done is done.' But my parents' generation\u2026 it took the 60s for people to give themselves permission to talk about things.\"</p> <p>Is the presence of his brother in his life (Sharp is a bricklayer) another element of his contentment? I think it must be. Even if they're not best friends, a flashlight has been shone in the direction of yet another shadow. McEwan doesn't disagree. \"It makes life richer,\" he says, quietly. \"It absolutely does.\"</p> <p>It's a measure of McEwan's writerly reputation that, even before publication, <em>Sweet Tooth</em> is causing a fuss; the Booker judges have naughtily neglected to put it on their longlist. \"Oh, I've become immune to the Booker,\" he says, though this is an easy line to take when you've already won it. \"I think we need something a little more like the Pulitzer prize, where there isn't this great race. The sense that it's a 110 yard dash has a streak of vulgarity about it.\" As for the reviews, he won't read them. Does he think, as so many people claim, that we are witnessing the end of publishing and, with it, perhaps, the slow death of the novel itself? \"We have a hunger for talking and thinking about others and I don't think any other form can deliver that insider-ish feeling.\"</p> <p>Screen or paper, it doesn't matter. On the other hand, he's just moved house \u2013 yes, Henry's place has been sold, replaced with a flat in Bloomsbury and a house in Gloucestershire \u2013 and he has spent several days pulling books from boxes. \"You put them on the shelf and it's the complete narrative of your existence,\" he says. \"All these crappy, yellowing paperbacks I bought when I was 17. I'll never read them again, but I could never throw them away, either.\" He hugs himself, trying his best \u2013 mostly for my benefit \u2013 to look neurotic. \"I want them around me and that's not something you can do electronically.\"<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>In a huge house in a mysterious part of London, a tall, energetic man called Rupert Maas is showing me a drawing: <a href=\"http://lizziesiddal.com/portal/elizabeth-siddal-and-tennyson/\" title=\"\"><em>The Lady of Shalott</em></a> by <a href=\"http://lizziesiddal.com/portal/\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Siddal</a>. \"It's absolutely lovely, isn't it?\" he asks, though I have the strong impression that he doesn't give two figs whether or&#xa0;not I agree with him. \"There are no more ethereal drawings produced by any of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/the-pre-raphaelites\" title=\"\">pre-Raphaelites</a> than those by Lizzie, and this is a very, very good one.\" His voice runs on: not dreamily, exactly, but clotted with a certain kind of passion. \"It has this febrile intensity. It's deeply sexy, for some reason. Look at the tightness of her dress, the yearning quality of it.\" Somewhat trepidatiously, I tell him that, to me, this particular <a href=\"http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/shalott.htm\" title=\"\">Lady of Shalott</a> \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alfred-tennyson\" title=\"\">Lord Tennyson</a>'s Arthurian maiden, condemned forever to see Camelot only in the reflection of a mirror, was a favourite subject of the pre-Raphaelites \u2013 looks a little like a doll. \"Yes, well... I think that might be part of it,\" he says, with a smile.</p> <p>Elizabeth Siddal, the redhead who is perhaps best known as the model for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/12/10-best-pre-raphaelite-paintings\" title=\"\">John Everett Millais</a>'s <a href=\"http://www2.tate.org.uk/ophelia/\" title=\"\"><em>Ophelia</em></a>, was married to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/apr/11/archive-the-death-of-mr-d-g-rossetti-1882\" title=\"\">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>, one of the seven founders of the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, from 1860 until her death from an overdose of laudanum in 1862 \u2013 though their relationship began in about 1851, when she first started sitting for him. \"The relationship between Rossetti and Lizzie is absolutely central to the pre-Raphaelite spirit,\" says Maas, still peering over my right shoulder. \"She is Beatrice to his Dante.\" But Siddal, who had humble roots and had previously worked as a milliner, also longed to be an artist in her own right; in 1855, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/14/john-ruskin-wedding-effie-gray\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a> agreed to subsidise her career, paying her \u00a3150 a year in exchange for every drawing she produced. \"It's well-documented,\" says Maas. \"He [Rossetti] taught her. He stood over her while she drew, and he did bits that she couldn't manage. It was a thing they did together: a journey of love into another world; a medieval paradise for them both.\" Did Rossetti work on <em>The Lady of Shalott</em>, which is dated 1853? \"I think he might have had something to do with the sprite carved on the chair. I think they did that together.\"</p> <p>In the next few days, <em>The Lady of Shalott</em> will depart this house for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tatebritain\" title=\"\">Tate Britain</a>, where she is to appear in the gallery's autumn blockbuster, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde\" title=\"\">Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde</a>. There, it will join works owned by, among others, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin\" title=\"\">Jimmy Page</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/andrew-lloyd-webber\" title=\"\">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>. Is it thrilling to lend to such an august institution? Not for Maas. This is the second time Siddal's drawing has holidayed at the Tate (the first was during the gallery's last pre-Raphaelite show in 1984), and there are other, equally wonderful works in his collection. \"I do it all the time, quite honestly,\" he says. \"I think it's a public duty. When it's there, I won't even look at it; I'll go and look at something I'm not familiar with instead.\" He grins. \"But, of course, when it comes home, I'll have a jolly good gloat.\"</p> <p>Maas inherited some of his collection from his father, Jeremy, an art dealer who in 1969 wrote a celebrated book about 19th-century British art, <em>Victorian Painters</em>, and who began buying 19th-century British paintings when they were still amazingly affordable. (Rupert now runs his father's Mayfair gallery.) The rest, he bought: \"I'm not one of those dealers who feels he shouldn't collect.\" So what is it about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/aug/12/victorian-art-ford-madox-brown\" title=\"\">Victorian art</a> in general, and the pre-Raphaelites in particular, that speaks to him? They haven't always, it's fair to say, been terribly fashionable.</p> <p>\"Yes. But when people say they hate Victorian art, you have to ask: what is it they're hating? They're hating themselves, because they're hating the stuff of which we're made. Most middle-class people in Britain still live in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/11/victorian-edwardian-british-architecture\" title=\"\">Victorian houses</a>. They gave us all sorts of things we take for granted. And Victorian genre paintings deal with such serious social issues. Look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/16/ford-madox-brown-pre-raphaelite-exhibition\" title=\"\">Ford Madox Brown</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1891P24\" title=\"\"><em>The</em> <em>Last of England</em></a> [a painting about emigration and poverty that will also be in the Tate's exhibition]. He's asking big questions in pictures.\"</p> <p>As for the pre-Raphaelites proper, with their penchant for swooning damozels and complicated allegories, he hopes that the Tate's vast new show will persuade visitors to reconsider them. The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, formed in 1848, was determined to rebel against dreary <a href=\"http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Academy</a> conventions; for this reason its members have sometimes been compared, in spirit, to the <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10220\" title=\"\">Young British Artists</a> of the 1990s. Maas, though, likens them to punks; every young artist wanted to be one. \"Millais was the greatest draughtsman. Rossetti was the romantic, the natural heir to Blake. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/16/holman.hunt.damien.hirst\" title=\"\">Holman Hunt</a> is more difficult: the priggishness, the religiosity, the density: these are some seriously wacky paintings. But they're all so big, so brightly-coloured, so powerful. You can just imagine how they must have seemed once, when everyone was used to seeing Sir Sloshua Reynolds and his school.\" His eyes widen. \"They must have seemed seriously psychedelic.\"</p> <p>It has taken Alison Smith, a Tate curator, more than five years to put Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde<em> </em>together. The idea for it came to her after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/gallery/2007/sep/24/art.artnews\" title=\"\">Tate's Millais exhibition</a> in 2007. It encouraged visitors who thought of the artist as a painter of fancy chocolate-box pictures to see him in a different, more audacious light, and Smith found herself wondering if she couldn't do the same for his colleagues in the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. \"I wanted to show them as modern artists rather than as soft romantics,\" she says. \"That was my agenda.\"</p> <p>Her case successfully argued (the Tate's programme is driven not by potential visitor numbers but by intellectual inquiry, with the result that every show must have a thesis), and the exhibition safely in the schedule, she began work. The Tate has a peerless collection of pre-Raphaelite paintings, among them <em>Ophelia</em> by Millais, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burne-jones-the-golden-stairs-n04005\" title=\"\"><em>The Golden Stairs</em></a> by Burne-Jones, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displayPicture.asp?id=75&amp;venue=2\" title=\"\"><em>The Beloved</em></a> by Rossetti, and <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/pre-raphaelites/triumph/\" title=\"\"><em>The Triumph of the Innocents</em></a> by Holman Hunt. But she also had a list of must-haves to be borrowed from elsewhere: Millais's <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/19c/millais.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Isabella</em></a>, which hangs in the <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/\" title=\"\">Walker Art Gallery</a> in Liverpool; Holman Hunt's <a href=\"http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/op34.rap.html\" title=\"\"><em>Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother</em></a>, which is in a private collection and had not been seen in public since 1984; Ford Madox Brown's <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/fmb/paintings/2.html\" title=\"\"><em>Work</em></a> from <a href=\"http://www.manchestergalleries.org/\" title=\"\">Manchester City Galleries</a>; Holman Hunt's <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/whh/replete/P16.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Light of the World</em></a>, from <a href=\"http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Keble College, Oxford</a>; and, most fabulous of all, Holman Hunt's <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/whh/replete/P30.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Lady of Shalott</em></a>, from the collection of the <a href=\"http://www.thewadsworth.org/\" title=\"\">Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art</a> in Hartford, Connecticut. This massive painting, overpowering and, some would say, overwrought, has not been seen in Britain since 1951.</p> <p>So how did she do? Lizzie Siddal's drawing, just across the river, must have been relatively easy to clinch. But what about the others? \"Oh, we secured them all,\" she says, almost nonchalantly. \"Everything we wanted, we got. <em>The Lady of Shalott</em> was in doubt for a while; there were conservation issues, and we had concerns about travel and costs. But, in the end, all the problems were resolved, and this astonishing late painting [it was completed in 1905 after the artist's death by an assistant, by which time its subject was already long out of fashion] will be the final work in the exhibition.\" And once the names on her list were ticked off, did she dance a little jig? \"No. But you feel good for the show. You feel it's finally coming together.\"</p> <p>Its major paintings bagged, the exhibition began to spread its tentacles outwards. All hands on deck. Backstage in London, Kiko Noda, the show's registrar, embarked on the complex logistical task of arranging the transportation of every loan. \"Most lenders insist on a representative being present when a painting is hung,\" says Smith. \"And once a work has been hung it cannot be moved. You can't go back and say, 'Oh, that would look nicer there.' A big lender might have five or six works in different rooms, so drawing up an installation schedule is perhaps the&#xa0;trickiest thing of all. That's where Kiko comes in.\"</p> <p>In America, Smith's co-curators, Tim Barringer and Jason Rosenfeld (the exhibition will travel to Washington), started working on their scholarly essays for the catalogue. At Tate Enterprises, the team began thinking about merchandise: scarves inspired by the gown Rossetti's model wears in <em>The Beloved</em>; bags and cushions made from fabric designed by the pre-Raphaelites' friend and supporter, <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/morris/wmbio.html\" title=\"\">William Morris</a>; and, of course, fridge magnets and postcards, which sell in their thousands. (Tate Enterprises earns between \u00a32m and \u00a33m a year for the galleries, so ordering the right merchandise is a serious business.) And the marketing department considered how best to attract younger visitors. Among their ideas: pre-Raphaelite-inspired fashion shoots; a pre-Raphaelite <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/siddal/pre-raphaelite/\" title=\"\">Pinterest</a> page; a roll call of \"modern&#xa0;day muses\" with pre-Raphaelite sensibilities (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/13/paloma-faith-interview-fall-grace\" title=\"\">Paloma Faith;</a> Florence Welch, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/florence-and-the-machine\" title=\"\">Florence and the Machine</a>).</p> <p>The months, and the years, ticked by. It's now August and the paintings are finally arriving; Kiko Noda receives every one personally. They will be hung by a team led by Geoff Hoskins, a senior art handling technician of 20 years' experience, in the fortnight before the show opens on 12&#xa0;September (the wall texts were completed only in the past few days \u2013 Smith's American colleagues slaved through the night to finish them on time). What will it be like to see the work in the galleries at last? Smith smiles. \"For me, the most wonderful moment is installation. It's the culmination of everything. That's when you feel you are deep in the heart of a project.\" And when it opens to the public? \"The personal attachment loosens a bit, but you're still concerned. It's a like a child going out into the world: you want it to do well.\"</p> <p>The Tate's pre-Raphaelite paintings are among its most popular (<em>Ophelia</em> by Millais, so lush and yet so plangent, has long been the gallery's bestselling postcard). \"They're always on display,\" says Natasha Walker, a paintings conservator. \"And when they're not, they're often on loan to another gallery. So it's quite rare that we get the opportunity to look at them. That's why we like these big shows. It gives us the chance to get our hands on things.\"</p> <p>Some time ago, Walker and the other conservators examined all of the Tate paintings that will appear in the exhibition. \"We have priorities,\" she says. \"Obviously, if something is stucturally unsound, that's the first priority. This one [she reaches for some images] was displayable, but we wanted it to look its best. So I spent five months cleaning it.\"</p> <p>The painting in question is Dante Gabriel Rossetti's <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/works/beauties/beatabeatrix.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Beata Beatrix</em></a> (1864-70), a portrait of the poet Dante's wife, Beatrice, that was also a memorial to Rossetti's wife, Elizabeth Siddall (the painter used sketches of his late wife to complete it). It's an exquisite piece, smaller and more intimate in scale than many pre-Raphaelite works, and softer, too, being more dimly lit. Beatrice/Siddal has her eyes closed, though whether she is in a state of religious or sexual ecstasy is unclear. Meanwhile, a bird, a messenger of death whose feathers are the colour of dried blood, drops a poppy into her open palms (this must, surely, be a reference to Siddal's death from an overdose of laudanum shortly after she gave birth to a stillborn child). In the background is Dante, looking towards the haloed figure of Love, in whose hands the burning heart of his wife flickers and wanes.</p> <p>\"The painting had a natural resin varnish over it,\" says Walker. \"It would have been added to improve its colour rendition, the gloss of it. But it had become quite discoloured.\" After doing some tests to find which mixture of solvents would best&#xa0;remove this layer, she set to work with a cotton wool swab. \"It's very painstaking. You have to be careful with the paint layer.\" She shows me some before and after pictures. \"Look at the colour shift. Before, it was warmer and quite yellow in tone. Varnish tends to make things look quite unified. The contrast between highlights and shadows is so much greater now, and her flesh is cooler, not quite so glowing.\"</p> <p>During the conservation, Walker x-rayed the picture; she also photographed it while casting light at an acute angle over it. \"I found out quite a lot. The story goes that Rossetti had made and abandoned an oil sketch of his wife, and that it lay in his studio for many years, until his dealer took it to be adhered to another canvas, and brought it back for Rossetti to finish. The x-ray showed that there were indeed canvas additions at the top, sides and bottom, all of which would have allowed Rossetti more scope for background.\" She shows me the x-ray. \"I could also see these losses in the lead white preparation under the paint. Rossetti left these losses. A more meticulous artist would have filled them before recommencing. When I cast light over the picture, I could also see brush hairs, studio dust and debris in the paint, which tells you something about the state of his tools.\"</p> <p>It took Rossetti six years to complete <em>Beata</em> <em>Beatrix</em>, a long time for a painting of this size. \"When I looked at the green of her cloak I could see that it had aged and cracked over a period of time; his red monogram had been added over the cracks. I could even see some of the red pigment caught up in the varnish, which tells me that he signed it and then quickly sent it away.\"</p> <p>How do these discoveries make her feel? Shivery, is the answer \u2013 though in a good way. \"You've seen it in books, or on walls. But this brings you so much closer.\" It's a visceral thing, a connection with the artist himself. What do her discoveries tell us about Rossetti's state of mind? Walker is reluctant to say: \"I'm not an art historian,\" she laughs (her degree is in zoology, the chemistry she learnt then a great help). But to me it seems obvious. Rossetti took his wife's death hard, burying the bulk of his unpublished poems with her in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/may/04/heritage.london\" title=\"\">Highgate cemetery</a>. Afterwards, he grew increasingly depressed. <em>Beata Beatrix</em> was a painful piece to paint; it took him an age. But when he finally felt able to let it go, he couldn't wait to get it out of his sight.</p> <p>It's not only paintings that must be conserved. When Walker and I have finished talking, she takes me to the studio of Alastair Johnson, a frame conservator. For the past year, Johnson has been working on the frame of Burne-Jones's enormous oil, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burne-jones-king-cophetua-and-the-beggar-maid-n01771\" title=\"\"><em>King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid</em></a> \u2013 a project that will be completed any day now, when picture and frame are once again reunited.</p> <p><em>King</em> <em>Cophetua </em>was completed in 1884. It was inspired by a Tennyson poem, <a href=\"http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/atennyson/bl-aten-beggar.htm\" title=\"\">The Beggar Maid</a>, and tells the legend of an African king who disdained women until he met Penelophon, \"a beggar maid all in grey\", with whom he fell in love at first sight. In the painting, the king gazes at Penelophon devotedly (the theme of male enthralment to female beauty was a favourite of Burne-Jones's), having put aside his crown and shield in deference to her beauty. A deeply sensual work \u2013 with her gently rounded belly and her curled toes, there is something so straightforwardly sexy about Penelophon \u2013 Burne-Jones's friends bought it for the Tate after the artist's death in 1898.</p> <p>The painting's frame was made for it, in the Renaissance style, by the Vacani family. But a few years after it joined the collection it was altered to accommodate a glazing door (in other words, an ugly sub frame was fitted inside the original one). \"The alterations were substantial,\" says Johnson. \"They had to insert four inches of material in the bottom of the frame, removing one putto's head, and replacing it with two. They also built up the columns at the side and removed altogether the frame's lovely moulded [internal] edge.\"</p> <p>How did Johnson know what the original frame looked like? Luckily, there existed a photograph by Emery Walker of the painting in its original frame; Johnson found it at the National Portrait Gallery, where Walker's archive is kept. Using this as a guide, he set to work. First he removed the additions. \"They were quite brutal,\" he says. \"You could see the saw marks where they'd cut the bottom of the frame in two.\" Then he made moulds of a putto's head elsewhere on the frame. \"I used a silicon rubber mould; prop-makers use them; they're incredibly detailed. The heads themselves are made from composition, a doughy mixture of plaster or chalk.\" Then he set about copying the moulded edge. \"Usually we find another frame which has something similar as a guide. But I couldn't find one anywhere. In the end, I just modelled a section up in Plasticine.\"</p> <p>Finally he guilded his repairs. Johnson leads me to the frame itself, in the centre of the room. Wow. What a wonderful thing it is. But will he age his own additions? They're a bit bling at the moment. \"Yes. I'll probably use watercolour: something I can easily remove, or add to. And perhaps a bit of household dirt.\" It will, he says, be an anxious moment when the painting is put into the frame. \"A very expensive piece of Perspex \u2013 it's called Optium \u2013 will replace the glass. It has an innovative coating which makes it look like low-reflective glass. It also has an inherent flexibility, which is important with a painting of this size. Unlike glass, it won't crack.\" How will he feel when he sees it in the gallery? \"Oh, it'll be wonderful,\" he says, with great feeling. \"But I'll also be praying I measured the painting correctly.\"</p> <p>As both Walker and Johnson point out, thanks to their efforts, when visitors to the exhibition come to gaze on <em>Beata Beatrix</em> and <em>King Cophetua</em> in a few weeks' time, they'll be seeing them pretty much as Rossetti, Burne-Jones and their contemporaries saw them. Will this make a difference to their understanding of these artists? Perhaps not. Only experts and passionate fans will notice such subtle changes. On the other hand, as the late, great <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-hughes\" title=\"\">Robert Hughes</a> put it, for the pre-Raphaelites, \"God was in the details: in the petals of a cornflower or the vein of an elecampane leaf, in the grain of stone or the purling of a brook.\"</p> <p>Rossetti and his friends would, I think, have adored the care the Tate has put into this show. Such attention, loving and precise, reflects the extreme trouble they went to in their own pursuit of accuracy. Though what they would have made of fridge magnets is anyone's guess.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde\" title=\"\"><em>Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde</em></a><em> is at Tate Britain, London SW1 from 12 Sept to 13 Jan 2013; tate.org.uk</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>A race is a race. </strong>It doesn't matter if it's the Olympics or the Paralympics.</p> <p><strong>When your diet </strong>largely consists of nuts, seeds and blended chicken an Olympic village full of fast food is not what you need. It amazed me to see athletes who have trained their bodies for four years for this moment eating it. That said, the two burgers I allowed myself after the final relay race were some of the best I've tasted.</p> <p><strong>I'd describe the Olympic beds as comfortable, light and airy.</strong> The environment was noisy. Not because people were having sex, as reported, but because you could always hear people coming and going. There was no particularly amazing night's sleep.</p> <p><strong>I will never forget the wall of noise from the crowd</strong> at this Olympics; 70,000 people seemed like 170,000. It felt like final night even in the heats. I'll remember the sound of my name being chanted when I'm 40.</p> <p><strong>Deciding to try and keep up with Jonathan Borl\u00e9e</strong> in the semi-final was stupid of me. He got away so quickly it seemed like a good idea, but then it became about a chase \u2013 not running my own race.</p> <p><strong>Of course, there are athletes who are bitterly disappointed</strong> at their performances. I am not \u2013 I was never expected to get a gold medal at these Games \u2013 but I know how it can feel. The best thing you can do is take the time to grieve your performance.</p> <p><strong>I was lucky enough to be in the stadium </strong>the night David Rudisha broke the 800m record. It was the single best performance by an athlete I have ever seen, and he's so down-to-earth, he trains so hard. It was inspiring.</p> <p><strong>The British athletes were in the greatest spirits,</strong> there's no doubt about that. If there was a team who were buoyed by each other's performances it was Team GB.</p> <p><strong>Chad le Clos slept with his gold medal around his neck</strong> the night he won, and wore it to breakfast. I know because I saw him coming out of the lift the next morning and he told me it wasn't going anywhere.</p> <p><strong>There is no better place than London to hold the Paralympics</strong>. Britain has been forward-thinking in its reaction to disabilities ever since I have been involved with the sport and will teach the world a lot at these Games. Finally people are going to embrace Paralympic sport for what it is: hardcore performances, not our stories. To have all the tickets sold out is mindblowing.</p> <p><strong>The Paralympics 100m will have one of the greatest line-ups </strong>we've ever seen: myself, Britain's Jonnie Peacock, America's Blake Leeper and Jerome Singleton and my fellow South African Arnu Fourie. Any one of us has it in us to win.</p> <p><strong>I believe I'll be at my peak in Rio. </strong>It's already beckoning me.</p>",
  "<p>Despite the Olympic euphoria, there is growing pessimism about the short-term prospects of the British economy. The new orthodoxy is that Britain is too sickly to be cured by a short-term fix; policy should concentrate on bringing about sustainable long-term growth.</p> <p>This rules out an immediate boost to public spending and swings the debate to the more familiar territory of the causes of Britain's relative economic decline, with the right pressing for freer markets and a reduction in the size of the state, and the left rediscovering the virtues of industrial policy.</p> <p>But there is no need to place the short run and the long run in such dramatic opposition. Britain faces both a short-run problem of deficient demand and a long-term problem of unbalanced supply. Government needs to develop policies to deal with both simultaneously.</p> <p>The British economy is still reeling from the economic collapse of 2008. It is 2%, or \u00a327bn, smaller than it was four years ago and 12%, or \u00a3165bn, smaller than it would have been had growth continued at its postwar trend of 2.5% a year (today's prices). These are big numbers. People take comfort from the fact that the percentage of unemployment has risen less than the percentage of output has fallen. But this is because productivity has dropped: <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/15/economy-doldrums-dole-editorial\" title=\"\">as the <em>Guardian</em> put it last week</a>, \"it now requires many more of us to labour away to churn out the reduced volume of stuff\". That still leaves about 2.2 million extra idle and partly idle workers, many of them young, who could produce more \"stuff\" if the market for it was there.</p> <p>This market for output should be supplied by government initiative in two ways. First, the government should rescind its cuts in capital spending. According to the Treasury, departmental capital budgets are set to fall from \u00a350bn to \u00a340bn a year in cash terms from 2010-11 to 2014-15 \u2013 that is, by \u00a350bn altogether, with the heaviest cuts to school building, universities and social housing. \"Shovel-ready\" schemes, abandoned by the coalition, should be reactivated. The advantage of this is that it combines short-run demand expansion with long-run improvements in infrastructure.</p> <p>Secondly, the government should issue all households with time-limited spending vouchers, in sufficient annual amounts to provide a net stimulus to consumer spending. Ideally, these vouchers should be spent only on UK-produced goods. This could be encouraged by a \"Buy British\" campaign. Their spending would be far more effective in reviving the animal spirits of entrepreneurs than quantitative easing practised by the Bank of England.</p> <p>The two short-run programmes combined could add about \u00a3100bn to GDP over five years \u2013 almost enough to completely offset the contractionary effect of George Osborne's cuts to public spending.</p> <p>So much for the short run. By contrast, long-term policy should be addressed to correct the consequences of the failed Thatcherite gamble on financial services and the housing market. Without a strong manufacturing base there can be no export-led recovery, however low the pound sinks in international currency markets. The old smokestack industries are gone, but new industries can be developed. How?</p> <p>Nothing is more upsetting to the conventional wisdom than the thought of government \"picking winners\". Yet governments have been picking winners all over the world, notably in east Asia. What industrial policy does need, though, is clear focus and sustained commitment \u2013 such as was shown in plotting the success of Team GB. Previous attempts at industrial policy in this country have failed because of endless chops and changes.</p> <p>To spearhead a new-style industrial policy, the government should set up a national investment bank with capital of \u00a310bn, the right to borrow immediately, and a mandate to secure Britain a significant presence in cutting-edge technologies like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics\" title=\"\">mechatronics</a>, optics, new materials and nanotechnology, and to invest in such green energy sources as wind power, solar power, hydropower and biomass. These may be too risky for private investors looking for quick returns, but may well attract institutional investors such as sovereign wealth and pension funds, and insurers looking for long-term income streams.</p> <p>As a further element in the rebalancing of supply we need to reduce the speculative role of finance, restoring it to its proper role as the conduit of savings to investment. Two measures would help: a government-sponsored revival of local banking, on the model of the old Scottish country banks and borrowing from the current example of the German <em>Landesbanken</em>; and a transactions tax on financial operations to cut down on what Adair Turner has called \"social waste\".</p> <p>These are the twin pillars of a policy that could bring about the short-term recovery of the UK economy and set it on the path to a prosperous future.</p> <p><em>Lord Skidelsky is emeritus professor of political economy at Warwick University and the author of an award-winning biography of John Maynard Keynes.

  "<p>Here's a question you don't often hear asked: whatever happened to Microsoft? To many people, it will seem a silly question. Microsoft, they point out, is still around \u2013 with a vengeance. It's a huge company worth $250bn (\u00a3160bn) that <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/inside_ms.aspx#RevenueHeadcount\" title=\"\">employs 94,000 people worldwide and earns vast profits</a>. (OK, it made a loss last quarter for the first time in its history, but that's because it had to write off $6bn it blew in 2007 on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/03/microsoft-write-down-aquantive\" title=\"\">a company called aQuantive</a> which turned out to be a turkey.) Microsoft dominates the market for PC operating systems and Office software, products that are still licences to print money: its Xbox game console sweeps all before it; its server software is a big seller in the corporate world. In 2012, the company's net revenues totalled $74bn.</p> <p>Sure, there are some flies in the ointment. Microsoft's search engine, Bing, has failed to break Google's stranglehold on search. The company's repeated attempts to break into the smartphone market have been failures, and its new partnership with Nokia hasn't changed that. Its effort to get into the music business with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/mar/15/technology-links-newsbucket\" title=\"\">Zune player </a>(remember that?) turned out to be an embarrassing farce.</p> <p>As far as social networking is concerned, Microsoft's modest shareholding in Facebook represents its only successful foray into that territory. It has zero presence in the tablet business (though it's been making brave noises about a forthcoming product called <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Surface</a>). And its share price has been flat for as long as I can remember.</p> <p>But when you set all these failures against the money pumps that are the Windows and Office franchises, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that Microsoft's doing just fine. Besides, its products are so deeply interwoven with the IT systems of governments and corporations round the world (just think of the 750,000 Windows machines in the NHS and UK government departments, for example) that Microsoft is one of those enterprises that is \u2013 to borrow a phrase \u2013 too big to fail.</p> <p>So why does it remind me of General Motors around the time that Toyota arrived in the US automobile market? This thought was triggered by an astonishing statistic I came across in an article by <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer\" title=\"\">Kurt Eichenwald in <em>Vanity Fair</em></a>. It is this: Apple's iPhone now brings in more revenue than <em>all</em> of Microsoft's products. In the quarter ended 31 March 2012, the iPhone had sales of $22.7bn. In the same period, Microsoft earned $17.4bn from everything it sold. So a single Apple product, which didn't exist five years ago, had higher sales than everything Microsoft has to offer.</p> <p>Cue the predictable storm of protests that this is a misleading comparison: apples and bananas and all that. Smartphones are not office systems, you can't run the NHS on iPhones, blah-de-blah. All true. But don't let those soothing rationalisations distract you, because implicit in the statistic highlighted by Eichenwald are two salutary, general lessons.</p> <p>The first is about the speed of change in this industry. It's not just that the iPhone (and the iPad) came from nowhere and created a market that nobody, including Microsoft, took seriously, it's that it happened in under five years. And that it propelled a company (Apple) that was a corporate zombie 15 years ago into the most valuable company in the world, with a current market cap of $590bn.</p> <p>The second lesson is about how hard it is for dominant companies to stay innovative in such a fast-changing environment. Microsoft, remember, was once an incredibly rich, smart, agile, innovative, competitive and aggressive company. Today, only the cash reserves and the aggression, personified by its current CEO, Steve Ballmer, remain.</p> <p>The question Eichenwald set out to answer was this: how did Microsoft change from being the lean, mean machine created by Bill Gates and Paul Allen into the sleepy behemoth it is today? In seeking an answer, he interviewed a lot of ex-Microsoft employees. They told a dismal tale of opportunities missed, innovations squashed and talented people demotivated by the corporate ethos of a maturing organisation.</p> <p>What it basically came down to is this: in the start-up phase of a tech company, people are collaborative and technically innovative because a successful IPO means that they'll all get rich. But once the share price flattens out and the company grows, stock options become less valuable (or even worthless) and then the only way to get on is to play managerial games and organisational politics. Bureaucratisation takes hold and innovation takes second place. Eventually, the point is reached when everything is designed or decided by committee, and... well, you can guess the rest.</p> <p>And \u2013 to return to my original question \u2013 that's what became of Microsoft.</p>",
  "<p>The tale of Lulu, Haile Selassie's lap dog that was allowed to piss on the shoes of dignitaries, and the courtier whose job for 10 years was to wipe those shoes clean with a satin cloth, is among&#xa0;the more compelling images produced by modern journalism. It sums up neatly the arrogance and absurdities of autocracy, along with the&#xa0;humdrum obsequiousness of life in&#xa0;the emperor's court.</p> <p>This glimpse into an ancient monarchy comes at the start of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ryszard-kapuscinski\" title=\"\">Ryszard&#xa0;Kapuscinski</a>'s masterpiece <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780141188034/the-emperor-downfall-of-an-autocrat\" title=\"\"><em>The&#xa0;Emperor</em></a>, a taut parable of power that deservedly elevated its author to global fame. The book is filled with similar vivid descriptions garnered from interviews with melancholic courtiers after the downfall of the emperor, painting an elegiac picture of&#xa0;a lost world of ritual and intrigue.</p> <p>Kapuscinski told an interviewer you could only write one book like that in a lifetime. But he went on to write another about the Shah of Iran, a treatise on tyranny and revolt that remains as pertinent today as when it was written. And then there are the astonishing accounts of chaos and revolution in Africa and Latin America, packed with evocative observations that inspired generations of writers and reporters.</p> <p>But as Artur Domoslawski points out in this masterful biography, many of the anecdotes \u2013 including, probably, the incontinent dog \u2013 are phoney. With the Mengistu regime on the rampage, no official from the deposed ruler's circle would have dared be seen with a white man, says one person. Another suggests Kapuscinski interviewed alcoholics. A third that he regurgitated stories from expat dinner parties.</p> <p>It is the same with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780141188041/shah-of-shahs\" title=\"\"><em>Shah of Shahs</em></a>. An academic challenges Domoslawski to open the book at any page and he will point out the falsehoods \u2013 and then does just that. There are tall tales of fish feasting on the bodies of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Idi Amin</a>'s&#xa0;victims, of gangs of dogs on the run in Luanda, of Belgian soldiers threatening to shoot the globetrotting reporter. Even stories of the author's own father escaping death at Katyn, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/26/russian-parliament-guilt-katyn-massacre\" title=\"\">Stalin killed more than 20,000 Polish officers</a>, were made up.</p> <p>Kapuscinski would not have lasted in today's digital world; he would have been just another journalist felled as a fantasist by snapping packs of online critics. As a reporter, his actions were indefensible. The biographer talks to a Bolivian whose father is portrayed as a hard-drinking conman, an editor who charges priests for disclaimers about stories that they are rapists. The son's reaction is shock. \"It's pure fantasy,\" he&#xa0;says. \"What a bastard.\" His father was a serious publisher, politician and patriot forced to flee repression.</p> <p>Yet Kapuscinski's reputation remains high for the brilliance with which he turned frontline journalism into a form of literature. When a friend pointed out that a report of a riot in Tanzania took place on a different street in different circumstances, he retorted: \"You don't understand a thing. I'm not writing so the details add up \u2013 the point is the essence of the matter.\" Near the end of this inquisitive biography, Domoslawski finally understands his friend and mentor: \"Ryszard Kapuscinski \u2013 the hero of Ryszard Kapuscinski books \u2013 is&#xa0;also a fictional character.\"</p> <p>This book caused a furore when published in Poland two years ago; Kapuscinski's wife tried to stop release because of revelations of extramarital affairs, while the rest of the country was&#xa0;gripped by confirmation of collusion with the communist authorities. But what makes it so interesting is that the author does not shred Kapuscinki's reputation, not does he ignore the mounds of uncomfortable evidence. Instead, he peels away and probes with understanding, producing not just a fascinating biography of an important writer but also a subtle study&#xa0;of life under authoritarianism, with all the compromises and complexities that entails.</p> <p>This was a life formed in the dark dislocation of war, growing up amid horrors unleashed by the Nazis and Stalin. He joined the communist party in his youth, had friends in the highest places and only left after Solidarity shook the system. To go abroad, he had to be loyal. But unlike western journalists, the impecunious Kapuscinski travelled and lived like the people he was writing about to gain real understanding, so he accepted deprivations such as maggots nesting under his skin and poor food.</p> <p>These experiences gave him his profound understanding of power, poverty and revolution, together with passionate sympathy for the underdog. While he wrote private reports for his party bosses, his books about Ethiopia and Iran were allusive works, reflecting his own rulers and their decaying systems as much as the courts in Addis Ababa and Tehran.</p> <p>He sought ideals \u2013 and perhaps his&#xa0;own youth \u2013 in the uprisings of the&#xa0;developing world, but he knew that&#xa0;power defeats hope, distorting idealists into soulless bureaucrats and&#xa0;cruel monsters. These are lessons&#xa0;that remain pertinent today \u2013 as does his understanding that wounded dignity, not the fight for bread, drives most uprisings, something we saw demonstrated again&#xa0;last year in north Africa.</p> <p>At times Domoslawski's style, possibly due to its translation from Polish, seems almost self\u2013consciously to echo its subject's writing. The author is weakest in unlocking the character of this detached man: a dreadful father, disloyal husband and disarming user of friends. He was imbued with anti-Americanism, yet made cuts to his work to appease the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cia\" title=\"\">CIA</a>. And for all his passionate anti-colonialism, he viewed Africa as a place of extremes \u2013 what one critic calls \"gonzo orientalism\".</p> <p>On one level this is a devastating indictment of a fraudulent journalist and flawed human being, one who made possibly too many compromises with a tawdry system. But it is also a portrait of a courageous and sympathetic writer, whose hard-grafted prose was unusually poetic and who possessed rare insight into the swirling forces that shape society. Ultimately, Kapuscinski created a new language for telling the stories of oppressed peoples on the cusp of change \u2013 even if we now know they should be filed under fiction.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Why do Bedouins wear black in the&#xa0;desert?</strong></h2> <p>The question so intrigued four scientists \u2013 all non-Bedouins \u2013 that they ran an experiment. Their study, called <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v283/n5745/abs/283373a0.html\" title=\"\">Why Do Bedouins Wear Black Robes in Hot Deserts?, was published in the journal <em>Nature</em></a> in 1980.</p> <p>\"It seems likely,\" the scientists wrote, \"that the present inhabitants of the Sinai, the Bedouins, would have optimised their solutions for desert survival during their long tenure in this desert. Yet one may have doubts on first encountering Bedouins wearing black robes and herding black goats. We have therefore investigated whether black robes help the Bedouins to minimise solar heat loads in a hot&#xa0;desert.\"</p> <p>The research team \u2013 C Richard Taylor and Virginia Finch of Harvard University and Amiram Shkolnik and Arieh Borut of Tel Aviv University \u2013 quickly discovered that, as you might suspect, a black robe does convey more heat inward than a white robe does. But they doubted that this was the whole story.</p> <p>Taylor, Finch, Shkolnik, and Borut measured the overall heat gain and loss suffered by a brave volunteer. They described the volunteer as \"a man standing facing the sun in the desert at midday while he wore: 1) a black Bedouin robe; 2) a similar robe that was white; 3) a tan army uniform; and 4) shorts (that is, he was semi\u2011nude)\".</p> <p>Each of the test sessions (black-robed, white-robed, uniformed and half-naked) lasted 30 minutes. They took place in the Negev desert at the bottom of the rift valley between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Eilat. The volunteer stood in temperatures that ranged from a just-semi-sultry 35C (95F) to a character-building 46C (115F). Though he is now nameless, this was his day in the sun.</p> <p>The results were clear. As the report puts it: \"The amount of heat gained by a Bedouin exposed to the hot desert is the same whether he wears a black or a white robe. The additional heat absorbed by the black robe was lost before it reached the skin.\"</p> <p>Bedouins' robes, the scientists noted, are worn loose. Inside, the cooling happens by convection \u2013 either through a bellows action, as the robes flow in the wind, or by a chimney sort of effect, as air rises between robe and skin. Thus it was conclusively demonstrated that, at least for Bedouin robes, black is as cool as any other colour.</p> <h2><strong>How do our stomachs digest&#xa0;animal bones?</strong></h2> <p>If you like shrews, especially if you like them parboiled, you'll want to devour a 1994 study published in the <em>Journal of Archaeological Science</em>. Called <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030544039590008X\" title=\"\">Human Digestive Effects on a Micromammalian Skeleton</a>, it explains how and why one of its authors \u2013 either Brian D Crandall or Peter W Stahl; we are not told which \u2013 ate and excreted a 90mm-long (excluding the tail, which added another 24mm) northern short-tailed shrew (<em>Blarina brevicauda</em>).</p> <p>This was, in technical terms, \"a preliminary study of human digestive effects on a small insectivore skeleton\", with \"a brief discussion of the results and their archaeological implications\". Crandall and Stahl were anthropologists at the <a href=\"http://www.binghamton.edu/\" title=\"\">State University of New York in Binghamton</a>. The shrew was a local specimen, procured via trapping at an unspecified location not far from the school. For the experiment's input, preparation was exacting. After being skinned and eviscerated, the report says, \"the carcass was lightly boiled for approximately 2 minutes and swallowed without mastication in hind and fore limb, head, and body and tail&#xa0;portions\".</p> <p>Here's how Crandall and Stahl handled the output: \"Faecal matter was collected for the following 3&#xa0;days. Each faeces was stirred in a pan of warm water until completely disintegrated. This solution was then decanted through a quadruple-layered cheesecloth mesh. Sieved contents were rinsed with a dilute detergent solution and examined with a hand lens for bone remains.\" They then examined the most interesting bits with a scanning electron microscope, at magnifications ranging from 10 to 1,000 times.</p> <p>A shrew has lots of bony parts. All of them entered Crandall's gullet, or maybe Stahl's. But despite extraordinary efforts to find and account for each bone at journey's end, many went missing. One of the major jawbones disappeared. So did four of the 12 molar teeth, several of the major leg and foot bones, nearly all of the toe bones, and all but one of the 31 vertebrae. And the skull, reputedly a very hard chunk of bone, emerged with what the report calls \"significant&#xa0;damage\".</p> <p>The vanishing startled the scientists. Remember, they emphasise in their paper, that this meal was simply gulped down: \"The shrew was ingested without chewing; any damage occurred as the remains were processed internally. Mastication undoubtedly damages bone, but the effects of this process are perhaps repeated in the acidic, churning environment of the stomach.\"</p> <p>Chewing, they almost scream at their colleagues, is only part of the story. In each little heap of remains from ancient meals, there be mystery aplenty. Prior to this experiment, archaeologists had to, and did, make all kinds of assumptions about the animal bones they dug up, especially what those partial skeletons might indicate about the people who presumably consumed them. Crandall and Stahl, through their disciplined lack of mastication, have given their colleagues something toothsome to think about.</p> <h2><strong>Is a pound of lead heavier than a pound of feathers? </strong></h2> <p>A pound of lead feels heavier than a pound of feathers, a thing long suspected, but not carefully tested until 2007, when Jeffrey B Wagman, Corinne Zimmerman and Christopher Sorric ran an experiment involving lead, feathers, plastic bags, cardboard boxes, a chair, blackened goggles and 23 volunteers from the town of Normal, Illinois.</p> <p>The scientists were based at <a href=\"http://illinoisstate.edu/\" title=\"\">Illinois State University</a>, which is located in that unassumingly named place. <a href=\"http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p5854\" title=\"\">In a study published in the journal <em>Perception</em>, they explained why they took the trouble. '\"Which weighs more \u2013 a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?'</a> The seemingly naive answer to this familiar riddle is the pound of lead, whereas the correct answer is that they weigh the same amount.\" But, they wrote, this \"naive answer may not be so naive after all. For over 100 years, psychologists have known that two objects of equal mass can feel unequally heavy depending on the mass distribution of those objects.\"</p> <p>Wagman, Zimmerman, and Sorric poured some lead shot into a plastic bag, then sealed and taped the bag inside the bottom of a cardboard box. For clarity, let's call this the box with lead in its bottom. Then they stuffed a pound of goose feathers into a large plastic bag. Feathers and bags being what they are, this fluffed, baggy entity entirely filled a box that looked just like the box with lead in its bottom. Let's call this snugly packed second box the box with feathers spread throughout its innards.</p> <p>Then came the test. One by one, the volunteers sat in the chair, donned the blackened goggles, then \"placed the palm of their preferred hand up with their fingers relaxed. On a given trial, each box was placed on the participant's palm in succession. The participant hefted each box and reported which box felt heavier.\"</p> <p>Slightly more often than not, the volunteers said that the box with lead in its bottom was heavier than the box with feathers spread thoughout its innards.</p> <p>After weighing and judging all the data, the scientists educatedly hazarded a guess as to why one box seemed heavier. Probably, they said, it's because \"the mass of the feathers was distributed more or less symmetrically in the box (ie the feathers filled the box), but the mass of the lead was distributed asymmetrically along the vertical axis (the box was \"bottom-heavy\"). Therefore the box containing lead was more difficult to control and it felt heavier.\"</p> <p>The scientists did not test how volunteers would respond if the lead were fixed precisely in the middle, rather stuck to the bottom, of the box. This they left for future scientists to contemplate.</p> <h2><strong>How should bosses choose who to promote?</strong></h2> <p>Three Italian researchers were awarded the 2010 Ig Nobel prize in management for demonstrating mathematically that organisations would become more efficient if they promoted people at random. But their research was neither the beginning nor the end of the story of how bureaucracies try \u2013 and fail \u2013 to find a good promotion method.</p> <p>Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda and Cesare Garofalo of the University of Catania, Sicily, calculated how a pick-at-random promotion scheme compares with other more enshrined methods. They gave details in <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0455/\" title=\"\">a report published in the journal <em>Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications</em></a>.</p> <p>Pluchino, Rapisarda and Garofalo based their work on the Peter Principle \u2013 the notion that many people are promoted, sooner or later, to positions that overmatch their competence. The three cited the works of other researchers who had taken tentative, exploratory steps in the same direction. They failed, however, to mention an unintentionally daring 2001 <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/xr67g49g6l51558v/\" title=\"\">study by Steven E Phelan and Zhiang Lin, at the University of Texas at Dallas, which was published in the journal <em>Computational and Mathematical Organisation Theory</em></a>.</p> <p>Phelan and Lin wanted to see whether, over the long haul, it pays best to promote people on supposed merit (we try, one way or another, to measure how good you are), or on an \"up or out\" basis (either you get promoted quickly or you get the boot), or by seniority (live long and, by that measure alone, you will prosper). As a benchmark, a this-is-as-bad-as-it-could-possibly-get alternative, they also looked at what happened when you promoted people at random. They got a surprise: random promotion, they admitted, \"actually performed better\" than almost every other method. Phelan and Lin seemed (at least in my reading of their paper) almost shocked, even intimidated, by what they found.</p> <p>But where Pluchino, Rapisarda, and Garofalo would later, independently, hone and raise this discovery for the world to admire, Phelan and Lin merely muttered, ever so quietly in the middle of a long paragraph, that \"this needs to be further investigated in our future studies\". Then, by and large, they moved on to other things.</p> <p>More recently, Phedon Nicolaides, of the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht, the Netherlands, suggested what he saw as an improvement on random promotion: randomly choose the people who will make the promotion decisions. <a href=\"http://www.cyprus-mail.com/opinions/policy-making-hoof/20120715\" title=\"\">Professor Nicolaides published his scheme in the <em>Cyprus Mail</em> newspaper</a>.</p> <p>Another, very different, non-random method was devised for use by the US Air Force. <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG678.html\" title=\"\">Details appeared in a 170-page paper prepared in 2008 by Michael Schiefer, Albert Robbert, John Crown, Thomas Manacapilli, and Carolyn Wong of the Rand Corporation.</a> But regardless of its merits, this scheme may have been doomed purely because it had a curious name. The report was called The Weighted Airman Promotion System.</p> <h2><strong>Do ethicists steal more&#xa0;books?</strong></h2> <p>\"One might suppose that ethicists would behave with particular moral scruple,\" begins a little 2009 monograph by two philosophy professors who specialise in ethics, embarking on what they call a \"preliminary investigation\" of their fellow experts.</p> <p>Eric Schwitzgebel, of the University of California, Riverside, and Joshua Rust, of Stetson University in Deland, Florida, surveyed almost 300 attendees of a meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.apaonline.org/\" title=\"\">American Philosophical Association</a>. Tell us, they asked in a variety of ways, about the ethical behaviour of ethicists you have known. Schwitzgebel and Rust offered candy to anyone who agreed to complete the survey form. They reported that \"a number of people stole candy without completing a questionnaire or took more than their share without permission\".</p> <p>The ethics experts in aggregate indicated that in their experience, on the whole, ethicists behave no more ethically than do other people. <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PeerOpinion.htm\" title=\"\">The paper, published in the journal <em>Mind</em>,</a> pauses for just a moment to suggest a broader context. \"Police officers commit crimes,\" it says. \"Doctors smoke. Economists invest badly. Clergy flout the rules of their religion.\"</p> <p>Schwitzgebel also wrote a study, on his own, called <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsBooks.htm\" title=\"\">Do Ethicists Steal More Books?</a>, which elbowed its way into the face of readers of the journal <em>Philosophical Psychology</em>. He drew up lists of philosophy books \u2013 some specifically about ethics, others not. Then, using information available through computer networks, he examined the status of every copy of those books in 19 British and 13 American academic library systems.</p> <p>Schwitzgebel looked separately at what happened to newish books (Buchanan's <em>Ethics, Efficiency and the Market</em>; Baron's <em>Kantian Ethics Almost Without Apology</em>; Hurd's <em>Moral Combat</em>; and suchlike bestsellers) and to older ones (Aristotle's <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>; Kant's <em>Critique of Judgment</em>; Nietzsche's <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> and other beloved masterworks).</p> <p>It was roughly the same story. The ethics books, whether youthful or aged, went missing more often than did the not-quite-so-relentlessly-about-ethics books. The youthful, \"relatively obscure, contemporary ethics books of the sort likely to be borrowed mainly by professors and advanced students of philosophy were actually about 50% more likely to be missing\". The aged, \"classic (pre-1900) ethics books were about twice as likely to be missing\". (For those older books, Schwitzgebel looked only at the American libraries, muttering that \"the British library catalogue system proved impractically unwieldy\".)</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Brief preamble:</strong> I've been on cricket duty so sorry for the late filing. Opening day always used to evoke for me the inspirational sentiments expressed so vividly by the great baseball writer Thomas Boswell in his essay Why Time Begins on Opening Day. \"Born to an age where horror has become commonplace, where tragedy has, by its monotonous repetition, become a parody of sorrow,\" Boswell wrote in 1984, \"we need to fence off a few parks where humans try to be fair, where skill has some hope of reward, where absurdity has a harder time than usual getting a ticket.\" Already, after a series of extraordinary Premier League results, hope is dashed for QPR and Norwich and Liverpool have hardly ushered in the Brendan Rodgers era with confidence, grumbles from my colleagues about refereeing notwithstanding.</p> <p>For this match between the fourth and fifth-placed teams last season, the joy of their pristine fixture lists is the hope writ large throughout them. Will Newcastle be able to build on last season. How will Papiss Ciss\u00e9 fare in a full season? Tottenham have a new manager, a new system and a fine new midfielder in Gylfi Sigurdsson. What will we learn? Let's find out here and also have a look on Monday when the \"five things we learned\" feature we've run for the past few seasons reappears as \"10 things we learned\". </p> <p><strong>Here are your teams:</strong><br><strong>Newcastle:</strong> Krul; Simpson, Steven Taylor, Perch, Santon; Ben Arfa, Tiot\u00e9, Cabaye, Guti\u00e9 rrez; Ciss\u00e9, Ba. <br>Subs: Harper, Williamson, Anita, Gosling, Ryan Taylor, Shola Ameobi, Obertan. <br><strong>Tottenham:</strong> Friedel; Walker, Kaboul, Gallas, Assou-Ekotto; Livermore, Sandro; Lennon, Sigurdsson, Bale; Defoe. <br>Subs: Cudicini, Vertonghen, Van der Vaart, Naughton, Jenas, Townsend, <br>Kane. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Omens:</strong> ESPN has just said that these two have met three times for the first match of the season with Spurs winning all three. Yet Newcastle have won four and drawn two of the past six at St James' Park. Andr\u00e9 Villas Boas says he didn't pick Vertonghen because Kaboul and Gallas have more experience. Coloccini is out with a thigh strain for the Toon, meaning James Perch comes in. I liked his work as a central midfield holding player last season, not so sure of him at centre-half.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Substitute change:</strong> Shola Ameobi has hurt his hamstring in the warm-up and though Newcastle wanted to name Marveaux as his replacement but they're still trying to locate him \u2026 now they've named Amalfitano instead.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> New season, new season bookies' ads to gladden the heart. We're away Newcastle begin as ESPN announces that Alex Song has joined Barcelona from Arsenal for \u00a316m. Spurs attack up the right through Lennon and Walker, a pair of speedsters, but Santon reads their intentions and blocks out Walker's pass for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Taken by corner specialist Sigurdsson, Kaboul tries to turn and shoot and Perch blocks. Another corner which Newcastle clear up the field where when Spurs build again Tiot\u00e9 slides into Sigurdsson with huge force, but fairly, and looks to have come off worst.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Tiot\u00e9 jogs back on after a minute getting treatment to his knee. Assou-Ekotto chips a 70-yard pass forward for Bale, Taylor holds him off and ushers the ball out for a goalkick. Bale wears Taylor's arm on the nose, accidental I think. He's wearing the No11 shirt this season, Bale.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Gutierrez wins a free-kick as he dribbles through midfield to the left of centre, just in side the Spurs' half. Sandro clears the cross. Ben Arfa's cross when it breaks down flies out to Lennon who storms forward, slips a pass through to Sandro who has made great ground. he miskicks it and his shot finds Sigurdsson, who is given offside in the area when clattered into by Krul but he shouldn't have been.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Tottenham look very quick and dangerous on the break. Newcastle have another free-kick just inside the Spurs half. Cabaye drills it to the far post from the left of the field and Friedel plucks it out of the air.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Loose interplay between Perch and Santon gives the ball away 30 yards from goal and Sigurdsson curls a peach of a cross to the far post but bale had already cut inside.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Good strong tackle from Gutierrez blocks Walker's cross. Sigurdsson looks a real livewire in this formation, just behind Defoe but drifting wide, particularly to the right to overload with Walker and Lennon. That's what made Gutierrez's intervention so vital and a reward for his reading of the danger.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Danny Simpson gives away a free kick on the left and is booked. Sigurdsson loops the cross-shot over the bar. Anita is about to come on for Tiot\u00e9 even if Tiot\u00e9 keeps telling Pardew he wants to carry on.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Livermore brings down Ben Arfa in the centre-circle and he gets a booking for that tame-looking trip. Anita goes back to warming up with his high-vis vest on rather than standing on the touchline with the manager whispering into his ear.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Newcastle have been on the back foot too much to get Ciss\u00e9 and Ba on the ball. They just tried to get a quick break again from the middle of the field when Sandro grabs Ben Arfa's arm to hold back his run. He joins Livermore in the book.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Ba drops back to link up the play when Tiot\u00e9 retreats as a shield in front of his centre-halfs. He laid it off to Simpson then sprinted forward to take the long diagonal pass but Gallas squeezed him out. A moment later Ciss\u00e9 almost scores with a 25-yard shot that takes a deflection, flat foots Friedel and trickles past his right post. This is a far better spell for Newcastle now.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Spurs free-kick for Ben Arfa's shirt tug, 40 yards from goal on the left. Bale swings in a cross but Newcastle see out the danger, holding off Walker's attempt to recover possession by the right touchline.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Simpson brings down Bale, well thrusts out his leg and Bale falls over it. Gallas asks the ref why there was no second yellow card for Simpson but Atkinson shoos him off. Thirty yards from goal, Sigurdsson gets it up and over the wall, and it dips viciously towards Krul's right post. The keeper plays safe and palms it into touch for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> An email from Andrew Mullinder: \"I'm still unconvinced about whether Cisse and Ba can be an effective pair. They should be an excellent pair, but it seems to me that in this half they've both made the same run, looking to get behind the Tottenham defence, or against the last defender, when it needed one to drop off. How many times have we been forced to lump it long from midfield?\" Quite a few Andrew, though in the past five minutes Ba has started to track back and look for shorter passes from Cabaye.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Sigurdsson, who must have had more touches than anyone else, tries a pot shot from 25 yards, left of centre, that skips past the goal. He didn't exactly connect with the full force of his right foot. But speaking of him, here's poor Matt Dony: \"Right, I've already had to put up with Liverpool being edged out by the mighty West Brom, now I've got to read about how well Gylfi's playing as well? It's a day for what-might-have-beens. I suspect there may be more to come over the next nine months or so \u2026\" Hope abandoned. See Nadezhda Mandelstam but for less flippant reasons.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Excellent move from Spurs, Sandro storming through the centre circle on a direct dribbling run. He lays it off to Sigurdsson who slips in Defoe cutting in from the left and his shot hits the post and rebounds into the middle of the area by the penalty spot but away from Lennon who was driving in from the right. Perch hooks it clear.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Newcastle have upped their pressing in midfield with Ba and Ciss\u00e9 hustling the Spurs back four for the first time. Their defence takes a higher line, too. They need to knock Tottenham off their stride and cut out Sigurdsson's space.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Spurs hit the woodwork again when Lennon sells Santon a dummy which the defender buys. Lennon feints left and goes right, standing up a cross to the far post where Bale leaps to meet it and heads it on to the bar.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> A cry goes up. But it's Rob Smyth greeting the fall of Jacques Kallis's wicket. Newcastle throw in and Ben Arfa and Simpson combine on the right to hit a back-post cross which Friedel punches to start a counterattack. Sigurdsson again feed Defoe who cuts inside on to his left foot and shoots over. All in 10 seconds from Newcastle having the ball by the corner flag at the other end.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Chris Waddle may have divided loyalties over these two sides but at the moment is full of praise for Tottenham and saying that Newcastle look flat. They look reticent more than flat to me.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> \u2026 which shows how well Tottenham are playing, forcing Newcastle back into their own half. Ben Arfa has the ball on the right of the penalty area when Assou-Ekotto robs him. The crowd shouts for handball but the ref waves play on.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Santon goes on a rare run beyond halfway and links up with Ciss\u00e9, wrongfooting Walker when he comes in from the touchline on to his right foot but his cross is blocked by Kaboul.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 min +2:</strong> Newcastle corner after Ba's header is blocked. Ba and Taylor hold each other face to face in the penalty area to wait for the corner so they can't be marked. Odd \u2026 and the cross from Cabaye can't find either.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45 min +3:</strong> Cabaye is the fourth player to be booked for hauling Bale down and the whistle goes. The SJP DJ pust on the Kinks' Sunny Afternoon as the players troop off.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half time</strong>: Back in 10 minutes. \"This Barcodes v Sperz game is the second one I've watched today and I've yet to see a goal after undergoing <strike> extensive paint-drying analysis </strike> watching Arse v Mackems,\" writes Nick Saberton. \"So am I a goal Jonah?\" Yes, Nick. It's all your fault</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Newcastle attack the Gallowgate, Taylor knocking a 60-yard ball up to Ba who nods it back to Ben Arfa but he's not given the time to control it and Tottenham recycle the ball over to their right.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Lennon goes on a delightful crossfield run, knocking the ball ahead of him, seemingly too far each time, but then using his speed to nick it again with his toe but his cross, as it so often does, doesn't match the buildup play. \"OK, I'm switching it off now,\" writes Jonah Saberton. \"Presumably when the players trooped off at HT to the Kinks' Sunny Afternoon, Friedel was the only one who said: 'Ah, I remember this one.'\" Naked ageism, Nick. I'll get a letter.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Ben Arfa knocks the ball past the retreating Assou-Ekotto but can't get past him on his blindside. Newcastle have not begun this half with fresh purpose.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Bale and Lennon have switched wings and the Welshman storms up the right, skinning Santon, drives diagonally into the box to the byline but his right-foot drag-back is weak and Perch clears.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> If Spurs tire in this heat, Newcastle's patience may pay off.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Newcastle 1-0 Tottenham (Ba)</strong> And it does. They hold on to the ball for a minute, spraying it across the back, then to ben Arfa who crosses to the back post from the right. Kyle Walker heads it awau but gets under it, spoons it up in the air and it ends up with Ba who swivels and hits a wonderful shot back across the box and past Friedel.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong>We're still on the old MBM technology today. I've no idea why, but you might have to refresh, F5, to get the goal description. Sigurdsson curls a shot from the left of the Newcastle area and wide of the post. Newcastle players thought the ball was out of play before Sigurdsson's shot and Alan Pardew protested by shoving the linesman and he is sent to the stands.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> \"I've turned it back on again,\" writes my only <strike> friend </strike> correspondent, Nick Saberton. \"The jinx is broken \u2026 peach of a finish.\" It was a glorious shot.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Alan Pardew is struggling to put his headset on up in the directors' box and needs a helping hand from Derek Llambias to screw the earpiece in. Assou-Ekotto shoots from distance but it doesn't trouble Krul.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Van der Vaart warms up for Spurs who have shown enough when Newcastle sat back in the first half to pose a threat if the home side does it again. \"Did Pardew really just shove the linesman?\" asks Chris Humphrey. \"Was is that poor a decision or is this game just much more intense for all involved than it appears to be for all watching?\" Well, it was more of a tap, the sort of thing your mother might do in exasperation. But, yes, the ball was out. ESPN focuses on the communication problems Pardew is enduring, no radio, no phone so he's having Wilie Donachie run down to the bench to relay his thoughts.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> John Carver rallies the Toon on the touchline with that pair of breasts mime while AVB talks to Van der Vaart. Ben Arfa has covered Simpson well this half and steps up to nick the ball off the advancing Assou-Ekotto's toe.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> AVB brings on VDV for Sigurdsson. I couldn't find the initials for the son of Sigurd, damn. Jack Reagan writes: \"If a player does same thing, he would likely get red carded and would be out three games.<br>Does Pardew get same punishment? He should.\" He probably will, Jack. The FA will tell him to put his trousers on, son, you're nicked. Tottenham corner, taken by Van der Vaart, loops out of the area to Lennon who wastes his chance.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Newcastle sub. Anita on for Cabaye. Good pass from Walker splits Santon and Perch, Defoe darts in and shoots low from 15 yards. Krul dives to save and Taylor goes on all fours to head it back off the ground into Krul's hands to prevent Spurs winning a corner.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> \"Spurs should be concentrating on getting Bale running at Simpson all the time,\" writes Nick Saberton. \"And they're crying out for a bit more presence up front.\" They should and do look light up front but have no options other than Will Kane. Defoe again creates a chance for himslef with a clever run and his shot as he cuts across the box from left to right is deflected for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Newcastle 1-1 Tottenham (Defoe)</strong> Cross from Lennon from the left, Defoe heads from the edge of the six yard box. Krul dives low to beat it away but Defoe nicks in front of Santon to bury the equaliser.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Sandro dives in to block Tiot\u00e9's shot from 25 yards and jars his arm on the pitch. He's receiving length medical treatment.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Penalty to Newcastle</strong> Lennon and Van der Vaart bring him down when he spins between them and cuts into the box.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Newcastle 2-1 Tottenham (Ben Arfa, pen)</strong> Slotted to Friedel's left with the keeper diving the other way.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>80 min: </strong>Refresh for goal, pen descriptions one last time. The new blog cavalry is on the horizon.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Ben Arfa trips Bale in the centre circle. If you haven't seen the goals, there was some big manager air-punching and leaping going on for the equaliser and the penalty.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Excellent cross from the right by Ba to Ciss\u00e9 who chests it down, Gallas nips in to blast it away to Gutierrez who shoots from 25 yards inches over the bar. Obertan comes on for Ba.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Harry Kane comes on for Tottenham and gets away with what looked like a trip on Tiot\u00e9.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Sorry about the Will/Harry Kane mix-up. Wrong prince. Van der Vaart spins in a long, deep, diagonal cross towards the centre of the goal and Krul rushes off his line to take it off Bale's head.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> An appeal from Niall Sheerin: \"On the train back to Strasbourg after a lovely day swimming in the Rhine in Basle/Barrrl/Basel and your MBM is spoiling it for me. My wife doesn't want me in a bad mood &amp; divorce is on the horizon unless you can fashion a wining (equalising) goal for Spurs.\" Hmm. You've played pretty well, Niall. Sigurdsson is excellent. Defoe is in fine form. You need another two strikers.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min+1:</strong> Spurs free-kick, 25 yards out to the right of the box. Van der Vaart curls in a cross to the far post and Krul fists it clear to Obertan who blasts it upfield.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 min+3:</strong> Spurs free-kick by their own penalty box, launched forward but Krul comes out to collect and the whistle goes.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Final score: Newcastle 2-1 Tottenham</strong> Tottenham had the best of the first half, much the best and continued in the same vein at the start of the second. Gradually Newcastle began to push up and enjoy more possession and control. Ba scored a quality goal, Tottenham fought back then a disastrous defensive intervention from Lennon and Van der Vaart threw a point they deserved away. Newcastle look compact and strong, Ben Arfa, Ciss\u00e9 and Ba class. For Spurs Sigurdsson took up where he left off last season, Defoe was sharp, Lennon a danger. When they spend the Modric money they'll be fine. Thanks for your emails. Bye.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Preamble? You want a <em>preamble</em>? It's the Saturday of the Lord's Test, the sun is burning, everything is at stake and a kid is 28 runs away from a moment that would melt the hardest heart. There's your preamble!</p> <p>(Yes, yes I am running a bit late.)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Take the most exacting day's work</strong> of your life, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near what Jonny Bairstow went through yesterday. It will be such a challenge for him to get past this first hour, not least because, if he gets through the first eight overs, he will then have to contend with the second new ball. That new-ball period may well decide this match.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>73rd over: England 210-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 22)</strong> It's a glorious day at Lord's, absolutely perfect. There will be some sore, pink shoulders in north west London at 7pm. Jacques Kallis is going to bowl the first over of the day, which shows that South Africa have an eye on that new ball. Bairstow tucks him through midwicket for two, the first runs of the day.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>74th over: England 211-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 23)</strong> It'll be Morne Morkel at the other end. That might seem unusual, in that Dale Steyn doesn't take the new ball at the start of the innings, but that's because of the two left-handers at the top of the order and Morkel's hold over Strauss. Steyn will take the second new ball because there will probably be two right-handers. Even if Stuart Broad is in, Steyn won't mind. Morkel starts with an excellent, tight line to Prior, giving him no room to free his arms. Prior pushes a single to cover to end an excellent over.</p> <p>\"Crucial session this,\" says Peter Haines. \"What a perfect set-up for the Saturday of the Lord's Test \u2013 this is definitely the sporting highlight of the year. Oh, and it seems that South Africa did end the career of a third England captain; it's just that it's Pietersen, not Strauss.\" With every passing day, the chances of him playing for England again seem to recede.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>75th over: England 211-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 23)</strong> This is a fine, disciplined start from South Africa. Their line to Prior has been extremely good, and that's a maiden from Kallis. The camera cuts to a couple drinking champagne in the crowd, at 11.09am. \"You can't afford to be dehydrated in this weather...\" says Sir Ian Botham on Sky. What a day to be at Lord's. It's absolutely perfect. There's a lovely, respectful hush around the ground.</p> <p>\"They've got to say to themselves, runs don't matter this morning,\" says Chris Evans. \"Be 260 for five at lunch and be 150 ahead at the close.\" Tell that to Matt Prior. I know what you mean, although I'm not sure it would be wise for Prior, or indeed Bairstow, to play such an unnatural game.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>76th over: England 215-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 78, Prior 23)</strong> Morkel is a touch too full and straight, the first bad ball of the day, and Bairstow drags him through midwicket for four. He's 22 away from one of the great feelgood centuries of the last decade. Please please please let him get what he wants.</p> <p>\"Eff being 260/5 at lunch,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Being 360/8 would be fine. More than fine, obviously, given the other ways in which batting in that style might turn out.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>77th over: England 216-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 78, Prior 24)</strong> South Africa are giving Prior absolutely nothing to work with here. Their plan is to control the scoreboard until the second new ball, and they've done it very well; there have been eight runs from five overs this morning.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>78th over: England 219-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 25)</strong> Bairstow works Morkel through midwicket for a couple to move into the eighties. \"STOP talking about a possible c*****y!!\" says David Ward.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>79th over: England 220-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 26)</strong> Tahir bowls a token over before the new ball in the hope he can snare Prior for the third time in the series. He doesn't. The camera cuts to more people drinking pink champagne. The gits. That's right: <em>gits</em>.</p> <p>\"Is it arguable that Onions and Monty in the side for Broad and Swann would make the team stronger?\" says Jatinder Sahota. \"This is especially the case with Swann who I think has been below par for a while now. Finn may not be as good a bat as Bresnan but by keeping him out of the team until now surely England weakened themselves overall \u2013 and doesn't the same principle apply?\" You could certainly make that case, although it's moot because there is no chance of England ever going in with a tail of Finn, Anderson, Onions and Panesar. Good for last-day rearguards, I suppose, but I'm not sure about them actually scoring any runs. Onions is a fascinating bowler. I know Selve thought he would have been a good option in this game, and he took a couple for Durham the other day. In a different era he would already have 100 Test wickets.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>80th over: England 221-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 27)</strong> Dale Steyn is coming on. He'll have one over to get loose with the old ball \u2013&#xa0;and he makes it talk, snapping a beauty past Prior's outside edge. The next goes past the edge too, although that one didn't really deviate. Prior has made five from 26 balls this morning, a reflection of South Africa's disciplined line.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 221-6 (Prior c Kallis b Philander 27)</strong> Pour yourself some pink champagne, get behind the sofa, do whatever you need to do because it's time for the second new ball \u2013 possibly the decisive period of the entire series. And Prior has gone first ball! Oh for heaven's sake. He had a big drive at a seductive outswinger from Philander that flew off the edge to Kallis at second slip. It was really travelling but Kallis held on, as he always does. Matt Prior will not, it's fair to say, tell his grandchildren about that stroke. It was a minor shocker.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>81st over: England 221-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Broad 0)</strong> England could get cleaned up here. Stuart Broad, the new batsman, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/10617.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=reverse_cumulative\">really needs a few runs</a>. Philander is getting the new ball to swing appreciably, although his line to the left-hander isn't right at the moment. He moves around the wicket as a result and has a huge shout for LBW turned down when Broad misses a yorker. They have to review this surely? No, Graeme Smith has decided against it. It swung a long way so it might have slipped down the leg side, but that was really close. Hawkeye shows that it was missing leg. That's an excellent bit of judgement from Smith and the keeper AB de Villiers. A wicket maiden from Philander, and an ominous one for England.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>82nd over: England 225-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 84, Broad 0)</strong> Bairstow times Steyn nicely through the covers for four. Steyn is getting the ball to swing as well, so this is going to be a serious challenge for the England batsmen. If you offered Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss a total of 300 now in exchange for their deepest, darkest secrets, I reckon they'd sing like canaries.</p> <p>\"There's no need for pink champage envy Rib,\" begins Duncan Smith, promisingly. \"I am quite sure, from your rarified position you could easily start a JustGiving page. I think all of us here on the obo value you enough to contribute funds for a bottle of Lambrusco and some cochineal.\" If you make it Lambrini it's a deal.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>83rd over: England 228-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 86, Broad 1)</strong> Philander goes back over the wicket to Broad, who flick-pulls pleasantly for a single to get off the mark. Then Bairstow steals a second to long leg. He has been excellent between the wickets in this innings. Here's an interesting stat (which may well be meaningless in a few minutes, but still). In the last 30 years, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?agemax1=22;ageval1=age;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;runsmin1=100;runsval1=runs;team=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">only two men have scored Test centuries for England before their 23rd birthday</a>: Mike Atherton and Alastair Cook. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?agemax1=22;ageval1=age;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;runsmin1=100;runsval1=runs;team=1;template=results;type=batting\">And only 13 players have done it overall</a>.</p> <p>\"Every ball, every ball is so, so tense,\" says Gary Naylor. \"And they say a T20 innings is 120 events.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>84th over: England 232-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 86, Broad 5)</strong> Broad normally likes to counter-attack, although the context makes that extremely difficult. He is beaten by Steyn, chasing a wide one off the back foot when he should have been forward, and then pings a crisp cover drive for four. England trail by 77.</p> <p>\"Also, you can tell Broad knows he's batting terribly at the moment. He hasn't even been hogging the reviews like he normally does,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"A year or so ago he'd be waving his arms like a semaphore operative even if his middle stump was hurtling towards the slips.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>85th over: England 236-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 90, Broad 5)</strong> That's a lovely stroke from Bairstow, a stiff-wristed crunch through midwicket for four off Philander. He's into the nineties. <em>He's into the bloody nineties</em>. There isn't a dry nail in the house.</p> <p>\"Oh balls,\" says Guy Hornsby, suddenly recalling The Bad Thing from last night. \"That's got to be galling for Prior. Right up there with finishing fourth in the marathon, running out of paint when you get to the last part of the wall, treading on an upturned plug, and writing your best OBO mail ever only to send it in after the close of play. Are the pavilion windows intact? The balance is back with South Africa again surely. This is such a <strong>PROPER</strong> Test match. Bairstow looking for a ton, Broad in need of sensible runs, England looking for a lead and South Africa looking for a lead. It doesn't get much better than this really. This is the Flamin' Hot Monster Munch of Test matches.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>86th over: England 243-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 94, Broad 8)</strong> Broad drives Steyn on the up through extra cover for three. I wonder what Jonny Bairstow's pulse rate is right now. Whatever it was, it's just gone up a bit more: he is beaten by a jaffa from Steyn and edges the next ball wide of the slips for four. I don't think it would have carried anyway, but it was a genuine edge. Does anyone have any beta blockers I can borrow for the next 20 minutes?</p> <p>\"I must confess to being more nervous watching this than I was on my wedding day, at the birth of my children or being swabbed at immigration at Auckland airport,\" says Phil Withall, to the delight of his wife, his children and the crack swab team at Auckland airport. \"Please let young Bairstow do it, please.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>87th over: England 251-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 94, Broad 16)</strong> Broad shovels the new bowler Morkel off the hip for a couple, with Steyn doing very well to save the boundary. Sometimes, when you see those boundary saves, you think, <em>All that for one or two runs</em>. Not in this game. Every run is a precious thing \u2013 and Broad gets four more with a superbly timed squirt through point. A drag through midwicket for two takes England past 250. The unspoken intensity of this Test match is just wonderful.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 252-7 (Broad c Amla b Steyn 16)</strong> That's the end of Broad's cameo. Steyn dug in an excellent, straight short ball that Broad could only push gently to Amla at short leg. It was all strangely straightforward, and Steyn barely bothered to celebrate. Those are decent runs from Broad, though, 16 from 22 balls. South Africa lead by 57.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>88th over: England 253-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 1)</strong> Swann is greeted with a zesty short ball that trampolines past his not inconsiderable chin. \"Can Bairstow please get his century so I can start concentrating on the research I am trying to do in the British Library?\" says Eva Broer. \"This is too tense to be able to focus on some 16th century popes and their taste in art...\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>89th over: England 254-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 2)</strong> On the England balcony, Andrew Strauss is munching on his right fingernail. He's really tucking in too. Everyone is so desperate for Bairstow to do this. South Africa are prolonging the moment, with Morkel bowling temptingly wide of off stump. Bairstow is not tempted.</p> <p>\"Perhaps Duncan Smith would like to <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/stephfincham2/eurl.axd/596549cb73f2de4aab62940f5aa2cb41\">contribute to my JustGiving page as you don't have one</a>?\" says my colleague Steph Fincham. \"I'll be cycling across Rajasthan in February to raise money for the children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent...\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>90th over: England 262-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 10)</strong> Swann slashes Steyn up and over the cordon for four. The response is an angry short ball that Swann pulls contemptuously for four more! At the risk of asserting the bleedin' obvious, this is great stuff. In other news, some other news from India: VVS Laxman, one of the more beautiful batsmen we've ever seen, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-new-zealand-2012/content/current/story/578096.html\">has retired from international cricket</a>.</p> <p>\"On TMS they just mentioned how good a throwing arm Steyn has from the deep,\" says John Starbuck. \"I suspect it's because he's an expert at the wrist action \u2013 have you noticed how he whips the wrist down at the moment of delivery? It's a lot more pronounced than anyone else's in this game, almost on a par with a mainstream spinner.\" That's a good point. Flintoff had a notable snap of the wrist as well.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>91st over: England 262-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 10)</strong> Bairstow fresh-airs a woolly cut stroke at a very wide delivery from Morkel. He does exactly the same next ball. \"Settle boy, settle,\" pleads David Gower on Sky. When Bairstow leaves the next ball, there is extravagant applause from the crowd. I can't remember the last time when everyone was so desperate for an England batsman to make a century. Graham Thorpe in 2003 maybe? South Africa are expertly prolonging his stay in the nineties, bowling wide of off stump for the most part. It's a maiden from Morkel, who has been outstanding this morning. Bairstow has already faced 21 deliveries in the nineties.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! England 264-7 (Swann not out 12)</strong> The marvellous Dale Steyn strikes again! Swann is going to review it \u2013 there are two left, so he may as well \u2013 but he's in trouble here. He pushed down the wrong line of a good delivery that jagged back into him. But Hawkeye says it was bouncing over the stumps! Swann survives! What a bonus for England. I think Swann thought he was out and only reviewed it because there were two left.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>92nd over: England 264-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 12)</strong> \"Prior's dismissal means he is currently second in both the England batting aggregates and averages to he who shall not be named, who is also top of England's bowling averages,\" says Graem Peters. \"At the end of the series, the head coaches are each allowed to choose the opposition player of the series. It would be interesting to see what would happen if Kirsten chose Kevin Pietersen.\" Crikey, that's a good point. It wouldn't quite be up there with Mohammad Amir two years ago but it would still be uncomfortable. They might give it to Anderson, whose series average of 41.85 is a travesty.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 264-8 (Bairstow b Morkel 95)</strong> English cricket has just had its heart broken. Jonny Bairstow has gone for 95, cleaned up by an excellent full-length delivery from Morne Morkel. Bairstow tried to whip it to leg but it ducked back in and burst through his defences. He walks off to a standing ovation for an immense innings, and if you're not moved by this, you don't have an anima. We must be two-eyed and say that it was majestic bowling from Morkel, who kept Bairstow in the nineties and then bowled him with a beauty. Bairstow made only one run in his last 40 minutes at the crease.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>93rd over: England 266-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 12, Anderson 2)</strong> Crikey. This email, which must have been stuck in a jam on the information superhighway, is accompanied by big dollops of sadness. \"Irrespective of whether he gets his hundred, this has been a terrific innings by Bairstow,\" says SB Tang. \"He's shown guts, determination and no small amount of skill under the most difficult of circumstances. It's safe to say that he's booked his ticket to India this winter.\" That will be a big tour for him, because he had problems there in the ODIs last year. I suppose the seven batsmen in the squad could be the six from this game plus Bopara.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>94th over: England 268-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 12, Anderson 2)</strong> Graeme Swann did make 85 against South Africa back in 2009-10. England would take half that here, even a third of it. He may as well tee off and try to get as close to 300 as possible. Give it some humpty, it's the weekend.</p> <p>Here's Tom Bowtell. \"On TMS, Blowers, apropos of something, just said: 'Geoffrey Boycott has a corridor of uncertainty in his bed'.\" Oh that is magnificent.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>95th over: England 274-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 13, Anderson 7)</strong> Anderson gloves a grisly short ball from Morkel short of slip \u2013 his hand was off the bat, Mr Tucker \u2013 and then drives three through mid on. There is plenty of chat between Morkel and Anderson, two gentle souls who get in character as soon as they enter the field. South Africa lead by 35.</p> <p>\"I must say,\" says Josh Robinson, \"there was something wonderfully reassuring about the way Bairstow got out: it showed me that I can at least play around a<br>straight one just like a Test batsman, even if it usually happens much earlier in my innings.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>96th over: England 276-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 14, Anderson 8)</strong> Philander replaces Steyn, who bowled a fine spell of 8-1-28-1. Anderson steals a run to mid off. Every little helps. \"What an innings Bairstow played and it would be a huge surprise if he isn't a fixture in the team for the next ten years,\" says Mark Lloyd, who has quite the memory on him. \"Back in the dark days of 1989 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63508.html\">I was lucky enough to be at Lord's</a> to see a David Gower Ashes hundred but the innings I remember more is Robin Smith's 96. Terry Alderman denied him a maiden hundred with a beauty that nipped back and bowled him. I remember at the time wondering if that would be the closest Smith ever got to a Test century. I only hope Bairstow ends up a) becoming as important to England as Smith became, and b) being treated better than Smith was by the selectors. Hats off to the young man!\"</p> <p>I can't find a clip of that dismissal, but here's a bit of Alderman action from 1989, when he was close to unplayable. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBG1pSMgTnw\">I suppose it helps if you actually try to play him</a>.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>97th over: England 277-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 14, Anderson 8)</strong> Anderson is rapped painfully on the left elbow by Morkel. You could see all the muscles pulsating at the point of contact. He's getting some treatment, although he doesn't seem especially perturbed. This delay will ensure that this is the last over before lunch. Anderson plays out those two deliveries to end another brilliant session of Test cricket. South Africa were outstanding, making England fight for every run, and they lead by 32. Jonny Bairstow was dismissed five runs short of a maiden Test century. Like the man said, it's been emotional. Rob Bagchi will be here for the afternoon session; email him on <a href=\"mailto:rob.bagchi@theguardian.com\">rob.bagchi@theguardian.com</a>.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong> Afternoon all. Here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/18/vvs-laxman-retires-india-international-cricket\">our story on the retirement of VVS Laxman</a> which, I think, is an inevitable consequence of his recent form but nonetheless saddens me that I won't see him bat again. At his best he had a dreamlike quality of composure when well-set, the ability to transform a commonplace shot such as a leg-glance into a thing of charm and a handsome ease at piercing the infield that kept the scoreboard moving at a pace that perplexed the assumptions of bowler and spectator alike. </p> <p>Rob Wright has invaded Selve's inner sanctum, which is more than I have done as he notes: \"Just had a tour of the Lord's media centre, including the bit where all the papers do their OBOs. I excitedly enquired whether Rob Smyth and Rob Bagchi might be there, and was met with a blank stare. Met Boycott and Gower though.\" We're in Kings Cross, Rob, which allows us the scope to moonlight on football later this afternoon though we'd much prefer to be there.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Anderson c Rudolph b Steyn 12</strong> Fending off the fourth short ball he's faced, the last of this over, he takes his eyes off it and dollies it up for third slip to run six feet in and catch it.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>98th over: England 283-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 17, Finn 0)</strong> An enthralling morning session with honours just about even, England scoring 67 for the loss of three wickets and some supreme bowling from Morne Morkel. Steyn begins from the Pavilion End, dishing up another elbow polka for Anderson who is now wearing a bandage covered by a sweatband on his bruised left funny bone. The first three balls are all short of a length, Anderson stepping to leg and cut-pushing the last of them to third man where the fielder's slip gives England three. Steyn finally pitches one up to Swann who tucks in with an on-drive to within a foot of the rope and they run three more. Anderson is out from the last ball of the over, <strong>England 26 behind</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>99th over: England 291-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 23, Finn 2)</strong> Tahir comes on to toy with Finn's mind. Swann takes a single off the first ball and Finn accomplishes himself well to get off the mark with a toppling sweep. The batsmen swap singles again, leaving Swann on strike for the last ball and he belts it over midwicket for four.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>100th over: England 293-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 23, Finn 4)</strong> Steyn peppers Finn but he gets in line to play it off his chest well short of short leg. The next one is another bouncer, not played so well, Finn fending it to where silly point might have been placed. Next Steyn pitches it up, drifts to leg and Finn tucks him away for two. This short stuff eventually worked for Anderson and Broad but it's a relentless, bullying strategy and the umpires let it pass. Finn withdraws the bat from the last ball of the over, another half-tracker, and it glances him on the shoulder on its way through to De Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>101st over: England 294-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 24, Finn 4)</strong> Philander, buttock knack and all, replaces Tahir after the leggie's solitary over. Swann pushes a single and puts Finn back on strike. Big Vern is bowling Broad pace and surprises himself and Finn with low bounce to which the batsman shows the maker's name. He gets in line, Finn. If he's a rabbit he's not the kind that runs down a hole by the square leg umpire.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>102nd over: England 297-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 25, Finn 4)</strong> Swann has Steve Waugh-like confidence in his partner, taking another single off the first ball of an over. A \"red-inker\", chides Nasser Hussain. At times like this Steyn looks like a shark, all nose and teeth and cold, cold eyes. What a magnificent and vicious bowler he is, though, smacking Finn on the helmet behind his ear and they take a leg-bye. A few inches lower and that ball would have put Finn in hospital. At last Swann farms the bowling, swatting a cut off the top half of the bat down to backward point and running one to end the over.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>103rd over: England 298-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 26, Finn 4)</strong> Philander looks as stiff as a scarecrow but gamely soldiers on. No swing. \"Without wishing to underplay the quality of Bairstow's innings, and its importance in the context, aren't people being a bit premature in taking it to show that he's sure to be a success in Test cricket now?\" writes David Wall. \"That's one success in four matches when in the previous ones he looked pretty unconvincing. Moreover, as it turned out, his innings sadly fell short of being decisive in the match. England do have to win, after all. That's not to say it's not a good sign, and I hope he does continue to show the resilience and quality he showed here, but he wouldn't be the first who failed to build on early promise.\" He wouldn't David but what was encouraging was the signs that he'd taken on board the weaknesses West Indies exposed and done something about it. \"What is a sure sign of quality (in a different field, of course) is the way Blowers just used 'tautological' in his commentary on TMS in a throwaway fashion\" he continues. \"It's a sad reminder that we're going to have to endure Jonathan Pearce and Alan Green for the next nine months.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>104th over: England 303-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 26, Finn 8)</strong> Finn sways out of the way of one that goes past his chin so Steyn comes round the wicket, bounces him, and Finn hooks him for four. \"Oh right,\" writes Dale Slater. \"When Steyn goes short he's bullying and you're looking for intervention from the umpires. When Anderson and Finn are relentlessly short to Steyn in bad light and floodlight failure, it's a strategy of some merit. The only bullying that's going on here is those who control the means of communication taking advantage of it to reinforce their own little prejudices and pop a few more bricks in their wall of stereotypes.\" Wow. When did I say bullying in a cricket context was a bad thing? I said it was relentless and understandable given it did for Anderson and Broad and that umpires these days don't do anything about it, not that they \"should\".</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>105th over: England 308-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 32, Finn 8)</strong> Swann leans into an off-drive, eyes wide, and smashes a four over mid-off from Philander's slightly overpitched third delivery. \"Crucial session this,\" writes Peter Hanes. \"Swann's hitting and Finn's bravery are raising England's spirits, but they could be up against it if South Africa make the most of the good batting conditions now. This is great cricket.\" It is.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>106th over: England 312-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 35, Finn 9)</strong> England draw level when Swann leg-glances Steyn for a single and ahead when Finn prods one into the off-side.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>107th over: England 314-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 36, Finn 10)</strong> Smith drops Finn at first slip, a straightforward chance that bursts through his hands and into his chest. Finn runs a single as the ball cannons of towards leg gully. \"Knowing words like 'tautological' doesn't mean you can't have a howler or two,\" writes John Starbuck. \"Blowers this afternoon has already failed to identify 'turbine' as the modern kind of windmill and also said he'd never seen a bat in the form of a cake. Me too.\" He was on tip top pork pie eulogising form on Thursday. Ian Copestake says: \"The key to bringing the literacy level of footer commentary up to and beyond that of cricket is by unleashing the glories of Stuart Hall at every possible match. He would eat tautologies for lunch and make a feast of his own alliterative biscuits.\" A gem:<br>\"On his firm Stuart Hall International Travel: 'I've never been brilliant in business.

Finn c Duminy b Morkel 10</strong> <strong>England are all out for 315, six runs ahead</strong>. Morkel copped him with a slower ball, his bat through the uppercut too soon and slicing it up to Duminy at point. Swann's vital innings ended on 37 not out.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Innings break</strong></p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 0-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 0, Smith 0)</strong> Anderson begins to Petersen with his tail up and mithering about the indent/foothold on the crease where his left foot lands. Smyth has sent me a stat that none of the last 24 Lord's Test have been won by the team trailing on first innings. Interesting but as he points out, probably means nothing in this context. Every ball bar the last is on an outside-off line but the sixth hurries Petersen into a drive that squirts off the edge towards cover. On come the ground staff with their saw dust to fix the hole.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 2-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 1, Smith 1)</strong> Dale Slater's been back on. \"Point was, that whenever an English journalist hears the words 'South Africa' he finds in his Book of Cliches that the true meaning of the phrase is 'Nasty Bully' - just as surely as he finds the word 'Englishman' actually denotes 'Plucky lad grinding on against incredible odds'! Honestly, you reach for these phrases with Pavlovian predictability; you don't even know you're doing it!\" And he who seeks prejudice where there is none, what is he? Have you read the respect and admiration we've shown for South Africa throughout this series? Or taken the word \"bullying\" and inflated it for all its worth to pander to your sense of victimhood? Smith plays a loose hook of Broad from a ball that was wider and bounced higher than he initially thought. He gets enough on it to clear midwicket and it drops like a stone 30ft in from the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 6-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 5, Smith 1)</strong> Glorious whipped shot from Petersen through midwicket for four. Anderson was looking for outswing and the edge but it didn't deviate. The fifth ball of his over did, though, jagging away from Petersen's forward defensive and into Prior's hands. The England players' squeals are louder than the crowd's.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 7-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 5, Smith 2)</strong> Huge appeal from Broad when he thinks he's got Petersen leg-before with the batsman prodding around the ball but he got an inside edge, as the replay confirmed. \"It may be worth mentioning that Blowers only used 'tautological' to try and dig himself out of the hole he'd dug by saying Finn had got himself tucked up in 'angular angles',\" writes Hugh Barker. Those pesky angular angles.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 12-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 9, Smith 3)</strong> Forgot to mention that South Africa had knocked off the deficit in the third over and had now moved into the black. Anderson comes round the wicket to Smith and he plays that trusty shovel shot around the corner and takes the single. David Gower thinks England are playing to his strengths because he's also vulnerable with that shot early in his innings. Anderson's got the face on, more so when Petersen plays a majestic cut for four.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 17-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 13, Smith 4)</strong> Broad resumes after a length chat with Anderson and then much gesturing from third slip with Fingerbobs hands to show him how the ball should be moving. He bounces Smith first up but then strays too straight, allowing Smith to turn it to square leg. He tosses the next ball up to Petersen, who smacks him through the covers for four. Time for Finn. Smith changes his bowlers much quicker than Strauss does.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 17-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 13, Smith 4)</strong> Anderson bowls one of Boycott's \"lollipop bouncers\" to Smith who has an age to duck out of the way. \"Just to clarify, it wasn't the word 'tautological' that was nice about that bit of commentary but the completely natural, throwaway way in which he used it (and why not, it's a perfectly cromulent word),\" writes David Wall. \"If Clive Tyldsley had used a similar word or phrase then he'd keep trying to work it into the rest of the commentary just to remind everyone how clever he'd been.\" Sorry. I'm anispeptic, frasmotic, even compunctuous to have caused you such pericombobulation. Smith chases another wide bouncer, hooking and top edging squarish but short of Ian Bell who stops the single.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 20-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 14, Smith 6)</strong> It's still Broad, still barely breaking 80mph. Petersen taps a single through the legside and Strauss runs from slip to chat to him which, if it was meant to inspire him, doesn't as he bowls a wide long-hop outside leg stump. He drops short again and Smith hooks him off his visor, a neat controlled pull that the hare Bairstow prevents from going for four with a sprint and a slide. Richard Potter can stand for many of you on the subject of Dale Slater. \"He says: 'Honestly, you reach for these phrases with Pavlovian predictability.' That, Sir, is drivel, and you know it.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 22-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 16, Smith 6)</strong> Big shout when Anderson traps Petersen on the pad, pushing forward. It hit him outside the line. More from proud Cantabrigian, Richard Potter: \"'angular angles' from Blowers was more oxymoronic than 'tautological'. Blowers from Cambridge would agree - Oxymorons are people from the other place \u2026\"</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 22-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 16, Smith 6)</strong> Swann comes into the attack and places a short-leg, short midwicket and slip for Smith. The bowler turns it from the start, enticing Smith, as is his wont, to hit against the spin towards square leg and midwicket, which he does a couple of times competently even if it excites Matt Prior enormously. Maiden.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 24-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 17, Smith 7)</strong> White handle grips still look odd to me, you can't see the join with the gloves when Petersen hits powerfully. Anderson continues, looking rather mournful about the lack of consistent or even regular swing. \"Julian Barton de Courcy Thompson, who played for Kent in the 90s was a right arm quick bowler,\" writes Nick Mannion. He was actually South African and also a medical doctor \u2026 of gynaecology as it happens\u2026 Apparently he was/is the go to expert on the corridor of uncertainty.\" Fnarr.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 24-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 17, Smith 7)</strong> Swann continues with his line of attack to Smith who again works the ball against the spin into the legside. He catches Petersen on the front leg prodding forward and appeals though it hit him outside the line, so Swann bowls a bit straighter.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 31-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 18, Smith 13)</strong> \"Afternoon Bagchi, afternoon everybody,\" writes Josh/Johs Robinson. \"I think I've found a <strike> good </strike> use for Twitter. If an email is bad enough that even you won't publish it, one can tweet it to the good folks over at the Sofa, and they'll read it out to <strike> all </strike> their listeners. OK, so maybe there's a case to be made that emails that aren't good enough even to appear on the OBO are best left in Robinson's sent mail folder. Yes, I think I've convinced myself that that's actually yet another example of why Twitter is evil. It is the place where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westendproducer/status/233463522045079552\">this</a> appeared, though.\" Unimprovably put by Wiggins. Finn takes over from Anderson. His first three balls are shortish and outside off, Smith playing and missing the first then clumping him for four with a bludgeoning cut.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 32-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 19, Smith 13)</strong> Swann is devilishly interested in testing whether Smith can play against the spin with as much efficacy as he did at the Oval, trying to tempt him into an outside edge when playing across the line. So far Smith has had the upper hand. One more over before tea.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 33-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 13)</strong> Finn comes in to Petersen with Nasser Hussain suggesting the tickle down the legside to the keeper is the dismissal they're aiming for and he does have a drive at one drifting across him that he misses and then gets off strike the next ball with a push to mid on. <strong>South Africa end the session 27 ahead</strong>. Thanks for all your emails, particularly Clare Davies and her detective work. Rob Smyth will be here for the evening session.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Hello again</strong>. This doesn't look too pretty, does it. The new ball deviated about as much as a prissy nun, and unless England get some reverse swing they are going to find it very difficult to force a winning position. We'll have a pretty good idea of where the match is heading by the close; there are still 37 overs remaining in the day.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile, at the Oval</strong> <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542535.html\">Just look at this</a>!</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 33-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 13)</strong> England have around 100-120 overs from now to bowl South Africa out if they are to have a chance of winning the game. It really won't be easy as the pitch is a belter. Swann starts after tea to Petersen, with a slip and a short leg. It's a maiden.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 34-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 14)</strong> Despite his failure in the first innings, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;ground=10;orderby=batting_average;qualmin1=2;qualval1=matches;template=results;type=batting\">Graeme Smith still has a three-figure average at Lord's</a>. He leaves a delivery from Steven Finn that isn't too far of off stump, although ultimately Smith knew what he was doing. He wasn't so sure next ball, when an attempted pull met only with still air. A good over from Finn.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 34-0 (Smith not out 14)</strong> England have wasted a review. Smith was beaten by a beauty from Swann that ripped past the edge and the fielders behind the stumps (though not Swann) went up for caught behind. Kumar Dharmasena said not out \u2013 which I suppose is reason enough to review given his performance in this game \u2013 and replays showed there was daylight between bat and ball. There was more than a hint of desperation in that review.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 34-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 14)</strong> So what's England's minimum requirement in the remaining 35 overs? I suppose they would want at least two wickets, ideally three. \"On the subject of the photo at the top,\" says Mac Millings, \"I didn't know Naylor had taken up smoking.\" <a href=\"http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/kxNRKUFirF-l.jpg\">Here, for those who were wondering, is a picture of Mac Millings</a>.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 35-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 21, Smith 14)</strong> Petersen pulls Finn for a single. England do at least have control of the scoreboard, which is a quarter of the battle.

His figures are 6-4-2-0. With many teams you'd say that this almost strokeless batting approach would be risky, but South Africa's top six have the discipline to bat forever, regardless of what the scoreboard is doing.</p> <p>\"Aaargh!\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Smyth, I hold you entirely responsible for the fall of that last Middlesex wicket. Lancashire desperately needed a Surrey defeat to at least keep within touching distance of avoiding relegation going into the fag end of the season, and the impossible was just starting to look possible until you went and flagged it up to the world. No hotpot for you.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 42-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 23, Smith 19)</strong> Smith back cuts Finn for the first boundary in eight overs. \"Getting twitchy at all the commentators jinxing the South African batsman with talk of their imperturbability,\" says Helen Musselman. It's not an attempt to jink them, just a sincere judgement as to how the game is developing. I'd be surprised if South Africa lost another wicket all match, never mind 10 by tea tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 46-1 (Smith LBW b Swann 23)</strong> Graeme Swann has got him! I was just typing 'The certainty of Smith's batting is awe-inspiring and terrifying' when he went for an ugly sweep, missing it completely as the ball zipped on to hit the pad. Kumar Dharmasena raised the finger, and after a long discussion with Alviro Petersen, Smith decided to walk off without reviewing the decision. He was right to do so: Hawkeye showed the point of contact was 'umpire's call' and it was hitting the just below the off-and-middle stump bail. There was no need for Smith to play that shot. Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 46-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 23, Amla 0)</strong> The new batsman is Hashim Amla. He has struggled a little since that triple hundred at the Oval \u2013 his series average is an embarrassing 120.33. He defends his first ball from Swann, who has a lovely rhythm and figures of 7-4-6-1.</p> <p>\"I have a bottle of Joseph Perrier in the fridge for emergency celebrations,\" says Josh Robinson. \"I was planning on opening it when Bairstow got his ton, and after he fell for 95 I decided to open it when Middlesex hit the runs that consigned Surrey to defeat. Now I think I should decide to open it at the moment when South Africa's series victory is confirmed. I think that's what they call hedging.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 48-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 24, Amla 1)</strong> Stuart Broad replaces Finn, and his first ball reverse swings in towards Petersen. Two more later in the over shape back into Amla. This is really encouraging for England because the ball is only 23 overs old. Hence the '23rd over' bit at the top of this entry, yeah?</p> <p>\"Is there a league table of Test bowlers and their record of successful DRS decisions?\" says John Starbuck. \"Swann must be on it somewhere. Perhaps more pertinently, does it include umpires too?\" I have no idea, but I do know that Aleem Dar has a 110 per cent success rate.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 49-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 24, Amla 2)</strong> \"I want to see Max Millings when he was a young man, when his wife's heart stopped at her first sight of him, when she fell helpless into his arms and whispered 'take me',\" writes <strike> Mac Millings </strike> Alex Xu.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-2 (Petersen LBW b Broad 24)</strong> Another one gone! England are flying! Broad had Amla dropped two balls earlier and then trapped Petersen plumb in front with a beautiful reverse inswinger. Petersen played across the line and knew immediately he was gone. He didn't even consider a review. What a stunning Test match this has been. Twenty minutes ago England were moving towards the brink; now they have two wickets, the ball is reversing and all bets are off.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 50-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 3, Kallis 0)</strong> England could have had another wicket, but Prior dropped Amla earlier in the over. It was a difficult chance diving to his left when Amla gloved a short from Broad down the leg side, but Prior almost always takes those. Prior was really angry, almost gritting his teeth as he shook his head. The wicket of Petersen soon changed his mood.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 52-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 4, Kallis 1)</strong> Strauss must be tempted to give Kallis a couple of others of rough stuff from Finn. Against that Swann is bowling really well, and Kalls gets an inside edge onto the pad and not far wide of Taylor at short leg. South Africa by 46. Can anyone lend me some beta-blockers please?</p> <p>\"My good chum Dominic Sayers did <a href=\"http://blog.dominicsayers.com/2011/04/12/umpire-ranking/\">an Umpires' DRS-o-meter in April of last year</a>,\" says Ant Pease. \"It's now out of date, but shows pretty much what you just said; that Aleem Dar is very good indeed. Daryl Harper, not so much.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 57-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 2)</strong> Kallis has a filthy record on this ground: 23 runs in four Test innings before this, one run in two ODI innings and 20-odd in his only T20 knock here. He hooks Broad for a single and then Amla plays a gorgeous back-foot square drive for four.</p> <p>\"Please don't get carried away,\" says Clare Davies. \"England are not 'flying'. It's just good Test cricket and the most excited we should get is to exclaim 'Game on' in discreet and refined tones. All right?\"</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 61-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 6)</strong> The camera cuts to an admirable obese gentleman in the pavilion as Swann comes in to bowl again. After blocking a few, Kallis drives Swann imperiously over mid on for four. That was a seriously good shot.</p> <p>\"The photo,\" says Iain Chambers. \"I'm pretty sure that old geezer puffing on a stogie forgot his bow tie and has cunningly fashioned one out if a Tunnocks caramel wafer wrapper.\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 66-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 6)</strong> Amla wears a short ball from Broad on the body \u2013 and then Kallis takes one on the helmet, completely missing an attempted hook. The ball bounced off the helmet and overs the slips for four leg byes. I would definitely give Finn a short spell at Swann's end before Kallis gets his eye in.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 70-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 11, Kallis 7)</strong> \"I think it's time to retire the term '110%',\" says John Starbuck. \"Ever since Chancellor Ozzy started using it, in what he (probably) fondly imagines to be a knowing, ironic way, it's become the numerate's equivalent of 'inter web', still employed by crass lifestyle journalists. Squares, the lot of 'em.\" Oh it's a hideous term. I used it knowingly. Obviously. In fact it's a decent rule of thumb: if you read a cringeworthy term or phrase on the OBO, just assume it's being used knowingly. Yeah?</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 81-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 12, Kallis 16)</strong> Kallis makes room to uppercut Broad high over the cordon for four, and concludes the over with another boundary, driven beautifully off the back foot. This pair have regrouped calmly after that manic 10 minutes when England took two wickets and had Amla dropped.</p> <p>\"If I stay in this pub with my gin, not talking to anyone and only reading the OBO, will I forget about football?\" says Liz Rippin. \"Or will Amla ruin my weekend anyway by batting his way to a million runs? Please advise.\" Are you a Liverpool fan? Did they not win today? Oh well, there's always 2013-14. Besides, if you drink enough gin, by 11pm you'll be convinced they won 7-1, with all eight goals from Andy Carroll.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 85-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 16, Kallis 16)</strong> What a beautiful shot from Amla. He was given a hint of width by Swann, and skipped back to cut it emphatically for four.</p> <p>\"Amla, when he's facing Swann, is shuffling from leg to off to a ridiculous degree. By the time he hits the ball, his leg stump is completely exposed,\" says SB Tang. \"Swann just needs to spear in a well-disguised yorker onto his leg stump. I seem to recall Amir dismissing Simon Katich \u2014 another obdurate leg-to-off shuffler \u2014 at Headingley in July 2010 with a ball that pitched outside leg and swung back to clatter into the leg stump.\"</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 92-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 20, Kallis 19)</strong> Anderson replaces Broad, who bowled a good ageing-ball spell of 5-0-19-1. He strives for a reverse swinging yorker to Kallis, who waves it superbly wide of mid on for three. Amla then pings a beautiful square drive for four. South Africa have scored 22 from the last three overs; the mood of the match has changed yet again.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 94-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 21, Kallis 20)</strong> Swann is milked for a couple. This partnership is starting to look a little ominous for England.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 101-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 28, Kallis 20)</strong> Amla brings up a fine fifty partnership with a thick edge for four off Anderson. South Africa lead by 94, there are 17 overs left in the day, and England are in the same postcode as the place called 'need a wicket'.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 102-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 29, Kallis 20)</strong> Amla sweeps Swann for another single. These two look a bit too comfortable for comfort. It might well be time for a bit of Finn music with a couple of men back.</p> <p>\"I'm following the cricket to forget about that other sport, and the repeated mental beatings that Liverpool visit upon me,\" says Matt Dony. \"Three months of excitement wiped out in 90 painful minutes. Please don't add to that. Just allow me to read about the jeffing cricket. I've been nothing but supportive, and I always defend your crass cliches as 'knowing'. All I ask is a little reciprocation. Viva cricket!\" There's no need to be sad. I don't care what anyone says, the race for a Champions League place in 2018-19 is wide open.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 111-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 30, Kallis 24)</strong> The ball hasn't reversed much for Anderson. A couple of induckers but nothing more. Kallis opens the face to steer another boundary to the vacant third-man area, and the following delivery swings down the leg side for four byes. South Africa are scoring far too quickly at the moment, with 41 from the last seven overs.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 112-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 31, Kallis 24)</strong> Swann breathes new life into the game with a fine over that include three huge appeals. He <em>begs </em>for LBW when Amla is hit on the back leg, but Kumar Dharmasena says not out. Swann wants to review it, Strauss is not convinced. England have only one review left and I suppose they can't risk it. It's the right decision as it hit the pad outside the line of off stump. There's an even bigger appeal next ball when Amla gets in a tangle as he attempts a slap to leg. Again Dharmasena says not out, again England decide not to review and again it's the right decision: this one was turning past the leg stump. Then there's a third LBW appeal, this time against Kallis. It wasn't a bad shout but he was outside the line. Excellent work from Kumar Dharmasena, who after an iffy start to this match has had a very good day.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 116-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 35, Kallis 24)</strong> Finn comes on for Anderson. England are starting to make things happen again at the end of a long day. Amla inside edges consecutive deliveries, the first wide of off stump for two and the second onto the pad, from where it lands safely on the off side. There are 13 overs remaining today. Please please please please please let England take another wicket or seven.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 121-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 39, Kallis 25)</strong> Swann now has no slip but two men on the leg side, short leg and backward short leg. Amla clips a full delivery through midwicket for four with beautiful timing.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 125-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 39, Kallis 29)</strong> Another boundary to the vacant third man area, with Kallis forcing Finn wide of the slip cordon. This has been a fantastic partnership at a crunch time in the entire series. Amla and Kallis have not so much coped with the pressure as ignored it. If they are still here at the close, South Africa will sleep very soundly tonight.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 126-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 40, Kallis 29)</strong> Amla just about gets his bat down on a horrible grubber from Swann, although I think he'd have been outside the line anyway.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 128-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 42, Kallis 29)</strong> Ten overs remaining. One last push, from Queen, country and mace, and to keep Piers Morgan's mouth shut. Finn is getting a bit of reverse inswing and has a big shout for LBW against Amla turned down by Simon Taufel. Height is the issue, as ever with Finn, and Strauss is not interested. Replays show it was bouncing over the top.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 130-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 42, Kallis 31)</strong> Swann's figures are 18-4-33-1. Pr-etty good indeed, although Enlgand could really do with one becoming two before the close and to hell with that Spice Girls song.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 131-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Kallis 31)</strong> Finn's certainly reversing it now. He also gets one delivery to seam back grotesquely towards Kallis, who takes it on the arm without complaint. \"That would have been three months off for you Nass...\" says Beefy on Sky. Seven overs remaining; a wicket now would be pure gold for England.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 131-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Kallis 31)</strong> Swann switches around the wicket to Amla, who will have to change his approach. He had been exposing all three stumps when moving towards the off side to repel Swann. A maiden.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 131-3 (Kallis LBW b Finn 31)</strong> Kallis has been given out LBW by Simon Taufel \u2013 but he must think he's hit it because he reviewed the decision instantly. Hang on, the first replay suggests he he didn't hit it: the two noises were the ball hitting both pads. Height is the other big issue. It only needs to shave the bails for it to be out. Here comes Hawkeye ... <strong>he's gone</strong>! It was smacking the middle-and-leg bail. This is a <em>huge</em> moment in the game. Kallis is really unhappy \u2013 he thinks he's been stiffed in both innings \u2013 but that looked a perfectly fair decision. There was nothing at all on Hotspot. He pushed around his front pad at a good delivery that came in just enough to beat the inside edge as Kallis pushed around his pad. His bat made contact with his pad as well, and I think that's why he thought he hit the ball.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 131-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Steyn 0)</strong> Dale Steyn is in as nightwatchman. There are still five overs remaining after this, but we won't get them all because play has to end at 6.30pm. Steyn survives the remainder of a fine over from Finn, a wicket maiden.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 136-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 48, Steyn 0)</strong> Look, I know greed is one of the seven deadly sins \u2013 and look what happened to that bloke in Se7en who got greedy \u2013 but I don't care. The wicket of Kallis was lovely and brilliant and spiffing and life-affirming, but could we have Amla before the close as well please? Nice one.</p> <p>It doesn't happen in that over. Swann, still around the wicket, bowls a strange long hop that is smashed for four by Amla. At first I thought it was a Warne-style bouncer but in fact it just slipped out. It was the filthiest delivery of the series. \"One twenty for four here lads,\" shouts one of the England fielders, which is the definition of optimism given South Africa are 136 for three.</p> <p>In other news, Snickometer suggests that Kallis <em>might</em> have got an inside edge, but it's not conclusive \u2013 so much was happening at the same time \u2013 and there's no way the decision could have been overturned, even if Snicko was available to the third umpire.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 137-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 49, Steyn 0)</strong> Amla, driven back in his crease, pushes Finn off the face of the bat and just wide of Taylor, diving to his left at short leg. Steyn then takes a hit on the glove from Finn and calls for treatment. He's in a bit of pain here. The break (in play, not on Steyn's left hand) will ensure this should be the last over of the day. Steyn gets into line for the last two balls of the over. We will have time for one more.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>50th over: South Africa 145-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 57, Steyn 0)</strong> Stuart Broad will bowl the last over of the day, a smart move from Andrew Strauss. Amla drives him sweetly through mid off for four to reach a tough and vital half century, and then fizzes another boundary through extra cover. That's the end of another storming day's Test cricket: 85.3 overs, 252 runs, eight wickets and the match still in the balance. South Africa lead by 139 and are slight favourites, but England are still right in this. Thanks for your emails; see you tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Over the last few days, Israeli newspapers have been consumed by reports that the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/08/13/why-do-israeli-media-keep-predicting-war-with-iran/\" title=\"\">decided to launch an attack</a> on Iranian nuclear facilities some time this autumn. Although Netanyahu has an obvious interest in increasing pressure on Iran, it would be <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/05/21/if-the-baghdad-nuclear-talks-fail-netanyahu-is-likely-to-attack-iran/\" title=\"\">an error</a> to regard these reports as simple rhetorical sensationalism. In my opinion, whether this year or next, Israel is likely to use its airforce to attack Iran.</p> <p>While it is impossible to know for sure whether Netanyahu will act, it is possible to consider the likely repercussions that would follow an Israeli attack. While it is likely that Iran would retaliate against Israel and possibly the US in response to any attack, it is unlikely that Iran will instigate a major war. Albeit for different reasons, Iran, Israel and the US all understand that a war would not serve their interests.</p> <p>First, the Israeli policy angle. If Netanyahu decides to order an attack on Iran, his focus will be on maximising the success of that action and minimising any negative consequences that might follow. In terms of Iranian retaliation, Israel would expect Iran's core non-state allies Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2012_Gaza-Israel_clashes\" title=\"\">launch rocket attacks</a> into Israeli territory.</p> <p>However, present success with advanced defence systems has helped increase Israeli confidence in their ability to absorb this method of retaliation. Beyond rocket attacks, the Israeli leadership also understands that a likely mechanism for Iranian retaliation is via attacks against Israeli interests internationally. Whether carried out by the Iranian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force\" title=\"\">Quds Force</a> or Hezbollah, or a combination of both, various incidents this year have shown Israel that Iran continues to regard <a href=\"http://www.tomroganthinks.com/2012/07/bulgaria-bus-explosion.html\" title=\"\">covert action</a> as a powerful weapon.</p> <p>The key for Israel is that, while these Iranian capabilities are seen as credible, they are not seen to pose intolerable threats to Israel. Faced with rocket strikes or limited attacks abroad \u2013 to which the likely response would be air strikes or short-duration ground operations (not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War\" title=\"\">a repeat of 2006</a>) in Lebanon and Gaza \u2013 Israel would be unlikely to pursue major secondary retaliation against Iran. Certainly, Israel would not want to encourage intervention by Syria's Assad alongside Iran (an outcome that might follow major retaliatory Israeli action).</p> <p>If Netanyahu does decide to take action, Israeli objectives would be clearly limited. The intent would be to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear capability while minimising escalation towards war. Israel has no interest in a major conflict that would risk serious damage to the Israeli state.</p> <p>Though holding opposite objectives, Iran's attitude concerning a major war is similar to Israel's.</p> <p>While Iran regards nuclear capability as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/24/iran-sanctions-nuclear\" title=\"\">prospectively guaranteeing</a> the survival of its Islamic revolution, clerical leaders also understand that initiating a major war would make American intervention likely. Such intervention would pose an existential threat to the theocratic project that underpins the Islamic Republic.</p> <p>Thus, in the event of an Israeli attack, Iran's response would be finely calibrated towards achieving three objectives:</p> <p>\u2022 First, punishing Israel for its attack.</p> <p>\u2022 Second, deterring further Israeli strikes and so creating space for a reconstituted Iranian nuclear programme.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, weakening US/international support for Israel so as to increase Israeli isolation and vulnerability.</p> <p>Hezbollah, Hamas and other non-state allies would play a major role in effecting Iranian retaliation. Iran may also attempt to launch a number of its new <a href=\"http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/irans-ballistic-missile-program\" title=\"\">Sajjil-2 medium-range missiles</a> against Israel. Again, however, using these missiles would risk major retaliation if many Israeli citizens were killed.</p> <p>As a preference, Iran would probably perceive that utilising Hamas and Hezbollah would allow retaliation without forcing Netanyahu into a massive counter-response. Crucially, I believe Iran regards that balancing its response would enable it to buy time for a reconstituted, hardened nuclear programme. In contrast to the <a href=\"http://www.isisnucleariran.org/sites/\" title=\"\">relatively open current structure</a>, sites would be deeper underground and far less vulnerable to a future attack. The nuclear ambition would not be lost, simply delayed.&#xa0;</p> <p>As a final objective for retaliation, Iran would wish to weaken Israel's relationship with the US and the international community. This desire might encourage Iran to take action against US navy assets in the Gulf and/or attempt to mine the Strait of Hormuz, so as to cause a price spike in global oil markets and increased international discomfort.</p> <p>However, beyond their rhetoric, the Iranian leadership understand that they cannot win a military contest against the US, nor hold the strait for longer than a few days. For Iran then, as with Israel, regional war is far from desirable.</p> <p>Finally, consider the US. It is now clear that Obama and Netanyahu <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdR0-sxm1w\" title=\"\">disagree on Iran</a>. In my opinion, Netanyahu does not believe Obama will ever be willing to take pre-emptive military action against Iran's nuclear programme. Conversely, Obama believes Netanyahu's diplomatic expectations are too hasty and excessively restrictive.</p> <p>The policy distance between these two leaders appears increasingly irreconcilable. If Netanyahu decides to go it alone and attack Iran, the US president will face the unpleasant scenario of having to protect American interests while avoiding an escalation dynamic that might spin out of control towards war. This difficulty is accentuated by Obama's re-election race and his fear of the domestic economic fallout that may come from the decisions that he might have to make. Again, the simple point is that the US government has no interest in a war with Iran.&#xa0;</p> <p>If Netanyahu decides to take military action, he will do so in a strategic environment in which Israel, Iran and the US have no preference for a major war. Each state views the prospect of a war as counter to their particular long-term ambitions.</p> <p>Because of this, while serious, Iranian retaliation would be unlikely to produce an escalatory dynamic leading to war. The leadership of each of these states will restrain their respective actions in the pursuit of differing long-term objectives but common short-term ones.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article are currently set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed earlier</p>",
  "<p>They are currently a small emergent group of volunteer activists committed to direct action on the seas. But by the end of the year, if meticulous planning pays off, <a href=\"http://theblackfish.org/\" title=\"\">the Black Fish</a> could be making headlines with the launch of a guerrilla-style campaign against illegal fishing in European waters.</p> <p>Taking their name from the term given to illegally caught fish, the Amsterdam-based group has a budget of only a few thousand pounds a year and pays no salaries, but boasts contacts and activists from across Europe, including Britain. Within weeks it expects to have raised around \u00a3500,000 from wealthy European backers to buy its first boat, a former coastguard vessel.</p> <p>The aim will be high-profile confrontation on the high seas. Greenpeace's first action was to sail to the Aleutian islands to stop the dropping of an atomic bomb. The Black Fish crew of 12 will sail to the Mediterranean, where they plan to stay for three years to confront illegal fishermen, and, they hope, embarrass commercial companies and persuade Europe to ban completely the catching of endangered fish, such as the bluefin tuna that they have released off Croatia.</p> <p>Each year 30-40,000 tonnes of Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught in the Mediterranean and towed to farms in Croatia and elsewhere in giant nets. The fish are then fattened for several months until they reach the target size of around 250kg, when they are sold, largely to Japan, where a single 269kg fish was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/05/japanese-half-million-pound-tuna\" title=\"\">sold this year for a record price of nearly half a million pounds</a>.</p> <p>Most Mediterranean tuna farms act responsibly, but spiralling prices encourage trawlers to far exceed quota limits and catch many juveniles. The result, says conservation group WWF, is that up to 20,000 tonnes of tuna are illegally caught each year. Breeding numbers have plummeted in the last five years, suggesting that the whole fishery could collapse within a few years, perhaps never to recover.</p> <p>The tuna trade will be the Black Fish's primary target. \"We have identified the boat \u2013 we are on the point of buying it \u2013 the crew has put their lives on hold and we are ready to go,\" says Wietse van der Werf, a Dutch environmental activist who spent six years in Nottingham working with Earth First! and was co-founder of the community media group Notts Indymedia.</p> <p>The group sees itself as a young, fleet-footed organisation with most of its founders and members in their 20s and none of the disadvantages and burdens of bureaucratic, membership-based organisations.</p> <p>Last month the group released thousands of endangered bluefin tuna, worth millions of pounds on the Japanese market, after activists located a series of Croatian fish farms where tuna were being fattened up. As guard boats circled and under the eyes of men in a watchtower, members of the group cut a large hole in one of the nets and watched a silver tide of the most expensive fish in the world escape into the Adriatic. According to the group, thousands of tuna of all ages and sizes escaped.</p> <p>In another successful action, a small group of Black Fish divers went to Japan and cut the nets of six pens in Taiji that were holding dolphins destined for international theme parks. The group has also won a battle to close down a German dolphinarium.</p> <p>Van der Werf, a vegan who says he encountered police spy Mark Kennedy when he infiltrated their group in Nottingham, has travelled twice to the Antarctic with Paul Watson's Sea Shepherd conservation group to stop Japanese whaling. In 2010 he helped Watson release 800 bluefin tuna off the Libyan coast, an action that led to a court case that was dismissed earlier this year.</p> <p>\"I came off the Sea Shepherd boat with nothing. I borrowed \u20ac500 to set up the group and I had \u20ac50 left. We have raised money from benefit concerts, and supporters. No one has been paid but we can call on web designers, legal firms and fishery experts,\" said Van der Werf, who originally trained as a violin-maker.</p> <p>\"We realised that you don't need to be a huge Greenpeace or Sea Shepherd with millions of pounds and big staff behind you to act; you can start small, be flexible. We want to move away from the 'hero' complex and encourage ordinary people to act for the oceans,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd inspired us, but what is not needed now is an organisation similar to them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/jul/13/activists-tuna\" title=\"\">We need more of a social movement of people who work on marine protection</a>. Conservation groups talk the language of politicians and MPs. There is an increasing gap between them and the public. I have trouble understanding their reports. We want to inspire other local initiatives.\"</p> <p>The Black Fish has positioned itself firmly at the \"no compromise\" end of the green spectrum. \"We don't see ourselves as witnesses, more as enforcers of law. We want evidence of illegality and we are prepared to take direct action. We don't want to just build awareness, but achieve change. We want to be judged by our actions and be effective,\" said Van der Werf.</p> <p>\"We have growing support from the public. We have customs officers, tube drivers, all kinds of people.\"</p> <p>He claims the tacit support of most European conservation groups, but the group is certain to cross swords with those who advocate reform of fishing practices rather than an absolute reduction in the catch. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/14/ofm-awards-2011-fearnley-whittingstall\" title=\"\">The high-profile campaign by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall </a>and Jamie Oliver to ban \"discards\" \u2013 young fish that are not allowed to be sold in EU markets and are thrown away \u2013 is not good enough, he says. \"In effect they are saying it's a waste of fish; let's eat the by-catch,\" said Van der Werf.</p> <p>\"Sustainable fishing\", promoted by supermarkets and some conservation groups, is totally unsustainable, he says. \"It's a feelgood option. Sustainable fishing has not worked in terms of over-fishing. It just legitimises destructive fishing.\"</p> <p>The group has challenged the establishment to change. \"Governments and some mainstream conservation groups argue that 'aquaculture', where fish are bred and reared in captivity, is the way forward, with the industry just needing to 'clean up'. But can such an industry clean up? Governments have failed by letting this lucrative industry spiral out of control,\" says the group on its website.</p> <p>Van de Werf adds: \"The fact is 85% of all stocks are overfished. Oceans are rife with corruption. Unless something is done, there will be no fish left.\"</p>"
