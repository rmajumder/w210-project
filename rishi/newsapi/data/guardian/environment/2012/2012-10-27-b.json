  "<p>It is hard to believe that Sir David Attenborough has ever mistreated a single animal in his life. This is a man for whom the natural world is sacred, after all. Yet midway through our interview, organised to promote his new television series <em>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild</em>, a crestfallen look crosses the great naturalist's features when I ask if he has any regrets about his career.</p> <p>\"Jumping on animals. I regret that,\" he states. I blink in disbelief. It is as if Judi Dench had admitted to glue-sniffing. Attenborough explains. \"Fifty years ago, I used to go along, chase a giant anteater and pull it by the tail so we could film it. I am sorry about that sort of thing. But those were different days.\"</p> <p>Then there was the time he and his crew were stuck in Borneo and strapped for something to film. \"I found a little crocodile and we did a cod sequence with it. We filmed it close up so that it looked like a really big crocodile. I then took off my shirt and jumped on it. Everyone thought I had a fight with a full-sized crocodile. 'God you were brave,' they told me. I wish I hadn't done that.\"</p> <p>And as for eating turtle eggs, he pulls a face. \"They were horrible, salty. I wished I hadn't done that either.\"</p> <p>As crimes against nature, these are minor transactions, it must be admitted. Yet they are informative \u2013 for it is easy to forget how attitudes to wildlife have changed since Attenborough began his career in 1952 on programmes such as <em>The</em> <em>Pattern of Animals</em> and, later, <em>Zoo Quest</em>. Wild creatures were still viewed from a Victorian perspective in those days. They were there to be tracked, captured, tied up and brought back to Britain to be goggled at. Attenborough was no different from other naturalists at the time, he admits.</p> <p><em>Zoo Quest</em> was certainly made in that mould, he believes. For the nine years it aired, Attenborough would travel with staff from London Zoo to a tropical country to capture an animal for the zoo's collection, a practice that was considered to be perfectly acceptable at the time. Attenborough's first assignment was to track down a white-necked Picathartes in Sierra Leone on the grounds that no other zoo in Europe had one or even knew what it looked like. \"I thought: 'Oooh, a bird that no one has ever even seen. I must become the first European to get one.' It was very childish really.\"</p> <p>Today Attenborough, like the rest of us, has a far more respectful attitude to animals, as the new series makes clear. Indeed, if <em>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild</em> has a theme it is that of transition. How attitudes to the natural world have changed and how knowledge of living things has been transformed by modern science. Not to mention the leap that has taken place in the film technology bringing the wonders of the world into our front rooms, from clockwork, wind-up cameras to stop-frame photography and thermal imaging.</p> <p>An example of these technological changes is provided in the living room of Attenborough's own elegant west London home. It is dominated, not by images of wildlife or native art, as you might expect, but by a giant 50in 3D television. Now Attenborough is certainly no geek \u2013 he can't drive and has trouble answering his mobile phone, he says \u2013 but he has pioneered a recent series of 3D programmes for Sky. He is clearly in thrall to the technology and keen to demonstrate its wonders.</p> <p>Attenborough bustles round the set, pulling out discs from a Blu-ray player, and flicking through scenes. The tasks involve a great deal of kneeling and bending over, which Attenborough accomplishes with no hint of stiffness or back pain that would leave many younger men groaning. Dressed in an open-neck light-blue shirt, chino slacks and loafers \u2013 an Attenborough uniform to judge from other interviews \u2013 he could easily pass for a man 20 years younger and is clearly determined to keep up with the latest developments in his profession.</p> <p>\"I began my career in broadcasting on the old 405 line, black-and-white TV that was broadcast from Crystal Palace,\" he adds. \"I wasn't going to say no to doing a programme in 3D that would be displayed on huge colour screens when I was offered the chance.</p> <p>\"On the other hand, as a medium, 3D TV is certainly not perfect. You are limited to what you photograph. You cannot use long focal lenses because of problems with background. And the cameras require two or three men to carry them. But oh, when you see time-lapse photography of plants flowering in 3D, the results are absolutely mesmeric.\"</p> <p>However, the real change in our perspective of the natural world is not due to improvements in TV technology but has been achieved through scientific revolutions, particularly in the fields of biology and geology. These have been the real game changers, Attenborough believes. \"We forget what we have learned in the last 60 years. At university I once asked one of my lecturers why he was not talking to us about continental drift and I was told, sneeringly, that if I could I prove there was a force that could move continents, then he might think about it. The idea was moonshine, I was informed.\"</p> <p>Yet we now know that continental drift explains a vast amount about the variation in the planet's plants and animals \u2013 for example the presence of similar families of earthworms in central Africa and in central South America \u2013 continents which were once attached to each other. Continental drift featured strongly in <em>Life on Earth</em>, Attenborough's first great series on the natural world, in 1979. What his old lecturer made of the programme is not recorded.</p> <p>Since then a host of great scientific visionaries have been interviewed by Attenborough, with Konrad Lorenz providing an unforgettable early start. Lorenz won a Nobel prize for physiology for his work on animal behaviour and had an astonishing affinity with many species, in particular greylag geese. Would he like to appear on TV and demonstrate that empathy on the air, Attenborough asked.</p> <p>Lorenz agreed and was filmed clutching a goose provided by London Zoo. \"Komm, komm, mein Liebchen,\" he murmured to the unhappy animal which, as Attenborough relates, eventually squirted a&#xa0;jet of green dung straight at the great scientist, covering his trousers. Lorenz released the goose, wiped his clothes with his handkerchief before absent-mindedly blowing his nose with it. He completed his interview, on camera, with a green smear down his face.</p> <p>Other stars to receive homage in <em>60 Years in the Wild </em>include Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey for their ape-observation work, Francis Crick and Jim Watson for their discovery of the structure of DNA, and Richard Dawkins for his ideas about the selfish gene. \"These people have completely transformed our understanding of the animal world. We see the world very differently today thanks to them.\"</p> <p>Finding ways to film these scientific visions has taken Attenborough to every conceivable place on the planet. He donned a diving suit for underwater sequences filmed for <em>The Trials of Life</em> in 1990; has been lifted to the top of rainforests by cranes; spat at by cobras; flattened by a belligerent Scottish capercaillie; and, of course, been groomed by gorillas in that glorious sequence in <em>Life on Earth</em>.</p> <p>So which spot on the planet would he recommend to give people a chance to enjoy living creatures at their best? The Gal\u00e1pagos with their iguanas? The Amazon rainforest? His answer comes as a surprise. \"People say you cannot beat the rainforest. But that is simply not true. You go there and the first thing you think is: where the hell are the birds? Where are the animals? They are hiding in the trees, of course. No, if you want beauty and wildlife, you want a coral reef. Put on a mask and stick your head under the water. The sight is mind-blowing.</p> <p>\"And that, actually, is still a mystery: why are coral reefs so beautiful and colourful? It is not immediately obvious, though the wildlife is wonderful: shell-less molluscs, crustaceans and shoals of fish that do not give a damn whether you are there or not. Your first trip to a coral reef will be one of the most transforming moments of your life.\"</p> <p>There is, of course, a downside. Coral reefs are now being destroyed at a staggering rate. Some estimates suggest around 600 square miles are lost every year, a rate double that of rainforest destruction. Reefs are dying because ocean waters are being acidified as carbon dioxide levels rise in the atmosphere as a result of human industrial activity. At the same time, rainforests are being ploughed up for farmland.</p> <p>And this takes us to the darker side of the changes that Attenborough has seen in 60 years. Just as we are learning more and more about the glories of the living world, and as new breath-taking visions are being brought into our homes, we are destroying these wonders at an accelerating rate. It is a simple question of numbers, says Attenborough. \"There is no problem on Earth that could not be solved quite easily if you could reduce world population. The reason that oil palms are being planted all over the place is because there are so many mouths, so many people in the west offering to pay for these forests to be cut down and palms planted for margarine, for plastics.\"</p> <p>Plastic refuse turns out to be a particular concern for Attenborough, who is working on a film that will highlight the crises facing our oceans. \"It is just tragic,\" says Attenborough. \"You have got an albatross that comes back to feed its young. In close-up, it regurgitates the stuff it has been collecting round the world's oceans for 10 days to feed its chicks and what comes out? Bits of plastic. And then you see the chicks swallowing this plastic. If you warm the plastic, it gives off dioxins. And the litter of this stuff. You can only get rid of it if you can burn it \u2013 and then it gets worse.\"</p> <p>It is a grim picture, though Attenborough is not without some shred of optimism. \"If I have to grasp for little threads of hope, one is that humans are going to be better informed about the state of the world than they have ever been in the planet's history. Kids in Tibet are going to be talking to people in Patagonia about what is happening to the Earth and there is a chance that a worldwide, slow protest movement will grow with younger people wanting something to be done.\"</p> <p>Much of their awareness of the living world and the perils facing its wildlife will have come from Attenborough, of course. In the past, he was criticised for not making clear his position on global warming, and for not taking on those who deny that climate change is occurring. However, in the past few years, he has been far more explicit in his warnings about the dangers our planet faces as it warms up and the polar regions melt.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, these attempts at enlightenment have brought him into conflict with those who reject the idea that the Earth is in peril. For example, in the final episode of his last major series, <em>Frozen Planet</em>, Attenborough highlighted the impact of global warming on the polar regions. He pointed out that summer sea ice cover has declined by more than 30% over the past few decades and is causing major disruptions to the wildlife.</p> <p>Nigel Lawson, former chancellor and leading climate-change denier, was unamused. \"Sir David's alarmism is sheer speculation,\" he claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/03/david-attenborough-frozen-planet-climate-change\" title=\"\">after the programme was transmitted last year</a>. \"When it comes to global warming, [Attenborough] seems to prefer sensation to objectivity.\" Attenborough, said Lawson, should have acknowledged that although the extent of Arctic sea ice has been declining over the past 30 years, satellite observations have also shown that, at the other pole, Antarctic sea ice has been expanding over the same period.</p> <p>Sensationalism is not an accusation that many have made about Attenborough in the past. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and was awarded the Order of Merit in 2005. He does not, generally, shoot his mouth off and many scientists were quick to jump to his defence. These included oceanographers who pointed out that yes, summer sea ice in Antarctica has increased over the past 30 years, but only slightly \u2013 by about 0.4 million square kilometres, an upward trend that may actually be no more than a reflection of year-to-year variability. By contrast summer sea ice in the Arctic has declined in extent by about 3 million square kilometres in the past 30 years: a vast decrease. Lawson was guilty of being economical with the truth, to put it mildly.</p> <p>So what does Attenborough think about climate change deniers like Lawson? What should be done to counter their highly selective views about global warming?</p> <p>\"Well, it is difficult to know what to say except that people like him have to be allowed to make these claims so that others can assess them. Any idea of suppressing their views would be disastrous. We need to be able to see just how wrong-headed they are and how selective they are in picking data to support their ideas. They pinpoint examples to say global warming cannot be happening because it got colder in some area of the planet. That is the sort of thing they say. But, of course, that completely misunderstands the global nature of the crisis we are facing. We have to keep pointing that out. Certainly I think that most people would recognise that Lawson is up a gum tree.</p> <p>\"The truth is: the natural world is changing. And we are totally dependent on that world. It provides our food, water and air. It is the most precious thing we have and we need to defend it.\"</p> <p>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild<em> begins on BBC2 on 16 November at 9pm</em></p>",
  "<p>It's always a pleasure to see a familiar face again and when that face is Tony Blair's and it has reappeared beneath a banner headline that includes the words \"multimillionaire\", then you know it can be only one thing: time to sit back with a cup of tea and a digestive biscuit for what will surely be another rich comedic treat.</p> <p>What this time, Tony? More news about your hilarious comeback tour? (\"I have got things to say. And if people want to listen, that's great,\" as he said in July.) Further details on your impenetrable tax affairs? To recap, last year Windrush Ventures (the trading name of the Office of T Blair) made \u00a312m, of which they decided that almost \u00a311m constituted \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2083827/The-12m-tax-mystery-Tony-Blairs-earnings-soar-42--pays-315-000-HMRC.html\" title=\"\">administrative expenses</a>\". I know I shouldn't have to point this out, but Tony, you're the ex prime minister. You were, until recently, in charge of the Treasury. If you can't be arsed to give it any money, then really\u2026 oh you know, I can't even be bothered to finish this sentence. Work it out for yourself.</p> <p>In fact, it was neither of the above. Blair made the papers last week because of his ongoing, deeply felt personal commitment to social justice. Having made it his mission when he was in power to bring in a minimum wage to end the vicious capitalist exploitation of the low-waged and particularly the young, he has continued this now that he's out of office by employing young people and not paying them anything at all.</p> <p>Last week, a graduate told how he'd been offered an unpaid internship in Tony Blair's office, but had asked to work only four out of five days so that he could continue to earn money in his part-time job to support himself. He was distraught when he was told that this wouldn't be acceptable and the offer was retracted.</p> <p>A spokesman for the office of Tony Blair said: \"We do run an internship programme and value our interns very highly. Each internship lasts for around three months and is designed to give young people valuable experience in a high-profile and fast-moving work environment. We support all our interns by paying travel and lunch expenses.\"</p> <p>He's right. It is \"valuable experience\". Euan Blair, for example, managed to parlay the work experience that his daddy secured him on Capitol Hill with a congressman into a career as an investment banker with Morgan Stanley. It's hard to know whether it was nepotism, connections or that helpful glamour internship that really gave Euan the edge. But it certainly did no harm.</p> <p>Because don't underestimate how much difference these early opportunities make. Twenty years ago, when I graduated, I walked straight into my first job \u2013 as a waitress. And one of the people I waited tables on was a university contemporary of mine. Her first job, it turned out, was with a well-known national newspaper group. This one. A position she'd secured through the connections of her semi-famous family member. She's now a powerful newspaper executive. I don't think it harmed her either.</p> <p>It's become a cliche to rail at intern culture and how toxic it is, how socially exclusive it is, how it consolidates opportunities for the offspring of the moneyed and connected, but it's also true. And it's growing, burgeoning, an unstoppable tumour, smothering the few last remaining healthy cells of social mobility that we have left.</p> <p>The <em>Guardian</em> and the <em>Observer</em>, I should point out, have reformed their work experience rules, but it's the exception, not the rule. Intern culture has become so mainstream that an ex-Labour politician who championed the minimum wage feels no shame at all in defending its use.</p> <p>Oh, I know, I jest. Tony Blair and shame? In the same sentence? I find that if I'm in any sort of moral quandary, I stop and think: \"What would Tony do?\" Would it be a good idea to go on a jolly beach holiday with Silvio Berlusconi? Advise Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh dictator who's alleged to have siphoned $1bn out of his country and whose family has asset-stripped its main industries? Invade Iraq? Probably not. The rule is if you can imagine Tony Blair doing it, don't.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Blair appeared in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17827773\" title=\"\">video</a> that waxed lyrical about the wonders of Kazakhstan, a country that Transparency International found came 122 out of 146 for corruption, where the president won an impressive and not entirely credible 91.15% of the vote in the last election and where torture and abuse are claimed to be widespread.</p> <p>Blair had been recruited by Portland Communications, run by his former media adviser, Tim Allan. And this connection has been a wonderful work creation scheme for washed-up New Labour has-beens \u2013 Alastair Campbell has also done his bit for Kazakhstan. The fact is that Britain is now more like what Blair calls that \"bastion of stability and progress\", aka Kazakhstan.</p> <p>Or at least the Britain that Tony Blair lives in and has tried to create in his image. Nursultan Nazarbayev bequeathed state industries to his children to see them on his way. Blair broke no laws to buy three \u00a31m houses for his older offspring, but it's not a dissimilar impulse. He just wanted, like most parents, to do his best by them. To enable them to take the kind of unpaid internships that he's now providing for the children of other well-off parents. From wealth and connections come wealth and connections.</p> <p>His friends are enriched, his children set up for life and his financial affairs demonstrate the great pellucid transparency of mud. It's not quite an oligarchy, is it? But it's not a million miles off either. Britain: that other great bastion of stability and progress.</p> <p><em>Comments will be turned on later</em></p>",
  "<p>President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande will meet the heads of global economic organisations for crisis talks on Monday after suffering a series of damaging economic blows in what was his worst week since taking power five months ago.</p> <p>The French leader has been hit by soaring unemployment figures, further factory closures and job losses, and plummeting popularity on top of growing fears that he and his Socialist government are failing to address the country's problems. Members of the opposition right-of-centre UMP have accused them of being \"amateurs\".</p> <p>The meeting with chiefs of international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and World Trade Organisation, has been billed by the Elsy\u00e9e as a \"sharing of views\".</p> <p>However, sources told the <em>Observer</em> the economists will urge Hollande to press on with key structural reforms to improve France's competitiveness on the world market and restore confidence at home and abroad. World financial institutions are said to be encouraged by Hollande's efforts to reduce France's large public spending deficit, but are seeking more from the French leader.</p> <p>Herv\u00e9 Boulhol, a senior OECD economist, said France needed \"deep structural reforms\" to improve public and global confidence in the country. \"Then people will believe there is a clear political direction towards tackling unemployment, public spending and competitiveness. It is these three things that need to be addressed,\" he said.</p> <p>\"At the moment, France is just above average in Europe, but if we are to avoid the extreme situations other countries have found themselves in, one has to find a way out of this crisis. There's no room for complacency.\"</p> <p>As the French head off for an autumn break after weeks of increasingly gloomy news, commentators have warned of growing anguish and despair among voters and deep disillusionment with the country's Socialist government.</p> <p>\"People knew there would have to be, as Churchill said, blood, sweat and tears and this was never going to be popular,\" J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet from the opinion pollster Ifop, which carries out regular surveys of the public mood in France, said: \"They knew there would be tax rises and reforms, whoever was elected, and they were prepared to make the effort, even if painful, if it was worth it. But with the situation seemingly getting worse, people don't see a light at the end of the tunnel and Hollande is not providing one. This has made people pessimistic, anxious and fearful.\"</p> <p>The French, pollsters admit, have a tendency to be \"morose\", but the metaphor of an economically battered France as a ship in a storm taking on water, while passengers look desperately to the captain to save them, is often heard these days, along with concern that Hollande and his Socialist crew are not sufficiently experienced to handle the crisis.</p> <p>In such a climate, the slightest <em>faux pas</em> has created a full-blown tempest. Last week prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault suffered what was dubbed Black Wednesday after announcing the French Constitutional Court was to scupper a housing bill before the council had even sat down to decide. The government was bashed again for appearing to lobby against a report it had itself commissioned, on how to improve France's economic competitiveness and plug a trade deficit that reached a record \u20ac70bn (\u00a356bn) in 2011, after its author suggested a \"massive\" cut in business taxes.</p> <p>News that unemployment, having broken the 3 million barrier in August, had leaped by 46,900 in September, the highest monthly increase since 2009, plus more factory closures and layoffs, made the general gloom even murkier.</p> <p>Carine Marc\u00e9 of pollster TNS-Sofres, whose recent survey discovered that 70% of French people thought things could only get worse, said the daily bad news had created a vicious cycle.</p> <p>\"Every day there is the announcement of more job losses and people worry even when it doesn't affect them, because they think they're next. And when people are worried, they consume less and it becomes the snake biting its own tail.\" She added: \"The French have been morose for 30 years; Fran\u00e7ois Hollande fed them hope of things improving but the French had no great expectations. They knew their country had been hit by crisis and there was no magic solution.</p> <p>\"People are not convinced by the government, not convinced they are good enough. They used to say, 'France is not Greece or Spain', but now they are beginning to worry it is heading that way.\"</p> <p>Fourquet agreed that the popularity of the president and PM had suffered a \"brutal and spectacular fall\", but said the causes were mostly out of their control. \"The factors behind this are unemployment, redundancies, factory closures, the drop in spending power, the rising price of energy and petrol. All this weighs heavily on the morale of the French, but it's not just a problem in France.\"</p> <p>Laurence Sauvage, national secretary of the leftwing Parti de Gauche, describes the atmosphere in France as \"toxic\" and warned it was conducive to driving voters into the arms of the extreme-right Front National.</p> <p>\"The Left has incredible, historic power in France... but the government is not rising to the occasion,\" she said. \"It is sad to see how afraid and unhappy people are.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande promised the time for change was now. But there's no change, just disillusion. If this continues, people will be beating a path to Marine Le Pen.\"</p>",

  "<p>Politicians on both sides of the divide reached for the Bumper Book of Cliches last week as they reacted to the news that the double-dip recession was over.</p> <p>For George Osborne, it was evidence that his policies had put us \"on the right track\"; while Ed Balls \u2013 whose analysis of the economy has repeatedly been proved correct over the past two years \u2013 insisted this was \"no time for complacency\" (is there ever a time?).</p> <p>While Labour was desperate not to be seen as dismissive of the strongest quarter's GDP growth in five years, Osborne was scrupulously careful to avoid triumphalism, attributing the long-delayed recovery to \"the hard work of millions of people and businesses\". Behind the scenes, meanwhile, Treasury officials were reminding everyone that strong early GDP estimates can be revised down, and that growth was boosted by one-off factors \u2013 not least the Olympics \u2013 that won't be repeated in coming quarters.</p> <p>These carefully choreographed pronouncements reflect the fact that today's politicians are being forced to rewrite the script as they go along, to adjust to a new economic reality.</p> <p>Just how much has changed emerged in two other pieces of news last week, away from the short-term noise of one quarter's numbers.</p> <p>The first was the Office for National Statistics' latest report on the country's wellbeing. David Cameron has asked the ONS to look into how best to lift the lid off the traditional measures of economic output and gauge families' life satisfaction \u2013 what used to be known as the elusive \"feelgood factor\".</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/the-economy/art-economic-well-being.html\" title=\"\">last week's study</a>, the latest in a series, the ONS found that net national income per head, which <a href=\"http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm\" title=\"\">experts including Joseph Stiglitz have found to be a better indicator of families' living standards than raw GDP</a>, had declined by more than 13% from its pre-crisis peak by the summer of this year \u2013 far sharper than the 4% drop in GDP.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons for this, not least the clobbering many people's incomes have taken from rising inflation, caused by rocketing commodity prices and the VAT increase. And with inflation drifting down (though it may blip up again this autumn as fuel prices rise), the squeeze should start to ease slightly in the coming months.</p> <p>But the overall message was that even though unemployment has risen less dramatically than in previous recessions, living standards have taken a drastic hit. Many households up and down the country are having to permanently adjust their hopes for the future \u2013 downwards.</p> <p>Sir Mervyn King made much the same point in his wide-ranging speech in Wales last week. Aside from a dash of teary-eyed Olympics nostalgia, from which it seems no one is immune (\"recall that balmy night in late July \u2026 the sound of Welsh children singing Cwm Rhondda on that beautiful beach in Rhossili filled the Olympic stadium\"), the Bank of England governor used his appearance to warn that the UK, along with much of the industrialised world, may be working through the after-effects of the crisis for years.</p> <p>\"After a period of lopsided expansion, with growing trade deficits and debt levels, and a collapse of their banking systems, advanced economies across the world are facing a huge adjustment. Such is the scale of the global adjustment required that the generation we hope to inspire may live under its shadow for a long time to come,\" he said. He talked about a \"downward correction of expectations about future incomes and wealth\" that will inevitably change consumer behaviour and slowly start to shift the shape of the economy.</p> <p>It's hard to know how much the productive capacity of the economy has been damaged by those years of \"lopsided\" growth; but an army of export champions won't spring up overnight to replace jobs lost on boarded-up high streets, and Ford's announcement that it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/ford-1300-job-cuts-plants-dagenham-southampton\" title=\"\">laying off up to 1,400 workers</a> as demand from the continent shrinks demonstrates the scale of the challenge.</p> <p>But the governor clearly believes we may be facing a long-drawn-out reckoning. In practical terms, that may mean thousands more loans go sour, and businesses go under, as it becomes increasingly clear we are not destined for a textbook recovery and instead face a period of sluggish growth \u2013 what Danny Gabay of consultancy Fathom calls \"bumping along the bottom\".</p> <p>For politicians weaned on boom and bust, recession and recovery, such a long period of pain will require a marked change of policies \u2013 and language. \"Pre-distribution\" is Ed Miliband's first stab at a response to an economic world in which growth is weak or non-existent and government is too busy paying down the debts of the past to borrow any more from the future \u2013 though what it means in policy terms is, so far, harder to pin down.</p> <p>Cameron's remark that \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/24/good-news-economy-cameron-recession\" title=\"\">the good news will keep on coming</a>\" at prime minister's questions last week sounded distinctly like the clapped-out old politics of riding recovery to seal an election victory. But Osborne's more measured response to the GDP figures suggests that he's well aware the improvement may be short-lived; that even if it comes, it may not improve families' fortunes as much as they hope; and that in order to win over voters, he will have to stress instead the long-term, more nebulous project of building a better economy.</p> <p>The panicked \"back us or we'll turn into Greece\" rhetoric of the 2010 election can hardly be applied to an economy that's been flatlining for years. Instead, expect to see politicians at both ends of the spectrum reaching for a different vocabulary \u2013 stressing aspiration, wellbeing and fairness over clear-cut, mathematically measurable concepts such as recession and growth.</p>",
  "<p>Those of us who worry about the old media have had a fraught week \u2013 and we're used to stress. The last few days have been up there with those anxious months in the 1480s when the bottom fell out of illuminated manuscripts. They've seen the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/oct/22/bbc-ceefax\" title=\"\">demise of Ceefax</a> \u2013 probably the most recent of all the old media, a brand spanking new old medium, hardly conceived before it was careering towards obsolescence. Useful, if clunky \u2013 like a seatbelt but it didn't save lives \u2013 this valiant example of British innovation will be sadly missed and reminds us that not everything that came out of the BBC in the 1970s is tinged with rape.</p> <p>Worse than that, the most powerful journalist in the world has quit. It emerged last week that Clark Kent, aka Superman, is to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2012/oct/24/supermans-clark-kent-quits-job-video\" title=\"\">leave his reporting job</a> in the forthcoming issue of the comic. Initially I assumed he was protesting against all the nasty commenters on the <em>Daily Planet</em> website: the thousands calling him an arsehole without having paid for the paper, or complaining that he only got to save the world because of his posh upbringing on Krypton. But apparently not: as well as his other powers, Superman is super-thick-skinned and embraces the internet age. He's off to work in new media and, according to Scott Lobdell, the writer of the series, is \"likely to start the next <em>Huffington Post</em>\".</p> <p>Presumably Kent originally chose to work in the print media in order to be at the beating heart of news, so he'd find out about impending world crises and sport before his fellow citizens and would consequently be best placed to save their lives. But, as the under-resourced <em>Daily Planet</em> came increasingly to rely on stories cobbled together from Twitter, the giving out of free DVDs and endless pages of comment, Kent's disillusionment must have grown. The last straw was a disagreement with proprietor Morgan Edge over his preference for celebrity gossip over hard news. Apparently they'd also just given some comedian a column.</p> <p>Superman will be all right, of course. If his internet start-up founders, he could reboot his career on <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>. But, in an era of crumbling institutions, where will the fictional heroes they once sheltered end up? What hovels will they fashion for themselves in the entrepreneurial rubble?</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Olsen becomes a pap</strong><br></h2> <p>The <em>Daily Planet</em>'s keen young photojournalist has long since noticed which way the technological wind is blowing and gone freelance. With his digital camera and close working relationship with Superman, he can sell pictures of world disasters to the highest bidder. \"No sooner has Superman heard that there's a bus about to fall off a suspension bridge than we're there: Superman rescues the bus while I see if I can get up-the-skirt shots of the flustered passengers. People really lose their sense of modesty when they think they're about to die. I can have the shots online before Mr S has repaired the bridge with his laser eyes.\"</p> <h2><strong>Dr Watson sets up a reflexology clinic</strong><br></h2> <p>Disillusioned with the NHS, Watson has been searching out a better way to spend his time during Holmes's frequent cocaine binges. \"Medicine is a mug's game,\" is his diagnosis. \"People resent what you earn and sue if you accidentally kill them. Worse than that, you're constantly having to meet diseased people and deal with the insoluble problem of their mortality. Far better to earn my crust sympathising with affluent malingerers. After all, alternative medicine does a hell of a lot of good for those who don't happen to be ill. Also, in my Harley Street clinic, I get to meet the kind of rich person who's likely to be involved in an interesting murder.\"</p> <h2><strong>Mr Chips says goodbye early</strong><br></h2> <p>In the latest reimagining of the tale of Mr Chipping, the noble and dogged public schoolmaster who inspired generations of schoolboys with his principles and erudition, Chips leaves Brookfield in disgust when the prime minister, an old Brookfieldian, slashes spending on libraries and the arts. \"You can't spend your life worrying about whether or not children know Latin,\" he concludes. \"You've got to follow your dream!\" In this case, a gay dance reimagining of the <em>Satyricon</em> which he's staging above a pub in&#xa0;Wandsworth.</p> <h2><strong>Rumpole of the Bailey makes sideways move into corporate law</strong><br></h2> <p>With legal aid now capped at the bus fare for a trainee solicitor to come and explain how to plead guilty, Rumpole desperately needed a more remunerative outlet for his legal knowledge. Inspired by an old university friend who makes an excellent living concocting legal challenges to anything nasty that gets printed about Jeffrey Archer, Horace decided he'd had enough of criminal law and is now doing a roaring trade defending chemical conglomerates against class actions from the various poor people they've maimed.</p> <h2><strong>Inspector Morse takes the plunge into app design</strong><br></h2> <p>In ITV's latest remake, following the success of <em>Lewis</em>, <em>Endeavour</em>, <em>Morse at School</em>, <em>Morsel</em> (the Inspector's Infant Cases), <em>Space Morse</em> and <em>What If Morse Was In The Sweeney But He Wasn't Regan He Was Still Morse?</em>, comes <em>Morse Code</em>, a brand new quality drama in which Morse didn't die but just went into hiding and had plastic surgery to look like Robson Green. Increasingly disillusioned with the police force post-Hillsborough, Morse does an IT course, moves to the Isle of Skye and tries to make a living designing cryptic-crossword- and real-ale-based smartphone apps.</p> <h2><strong>Mary Poppins works in PR</strong><br></h2> <p>Preferring to leave the tedium of caring for other people's children to those who are trying to obtain residency rights, the former magical nanny is forging a very successful career since founding Practically Perfect PR. \"There are two types of PR company,\" she explains. \"Those who tell people about events, movies, shows and products that are already very popular and don't really need PR, and those who fail to tell them about those that aren't and do.

  "<p>A nuclear fuel pellet the size of your little finger provides more energy than 800 kilograms of coal or 650 litres of oil \u2013 and all without belching any carbon dioxide or other fumes into the atmosphere.</p> <p>But the intense power of uranium, the raw material of nuclear fuel, was demonstrated to the world by the Fukushima disaster last year. Its price on global markets has collapsed, from a record $136 a pound in 2007 to just $44 last week \u2013 a slump so severe that some of the world's biggest miners have decided they're better off leaving the mineral in the ground.</p> <p>The market suffered further blows in the last month or so as several developed-world governments announced or confirmed plans to move away from atomic power for good.</p> <p>But even as the west retreats, the nuclear industry may be about to rise again \u2013 in the developing world. In the last few days, China announced plans to restart its massive \u00a3170bn reactor building programme, intended to create generating capacity so large that it could power the whole of Spain.</p> <p>Last March, Japan went into lockdown and shut all of its nuclear plants, which had provided 30% of the nation's electricity. Fears of a nuclear apocalypse rippled across the globe, turning the lights out at reactors around the world, and many of them still lie idle 18 months later.</p> <p>Japan, which is now running a series of expensive and polluting diesel generators at 100% capacity to replace its nuclear fleet, has announced plans to completely end its reliance on nuclear power by 2040, at an estimated cost of $620bn. Germany and Belgium are also giving up on nuclear power, while Italy has cancelled a long-planned move back to it, and even France \u2013 the most pro-nuclear country in the world \u2013 is scaling things down.</p> <p>The future of the UK's nuclear ambitions also hangs in the balance after Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, the French company charged with building new reactors in the UK, told parliament the company had yet to make up its mind whether it was worth building plants without support from the government. Two German companies \u2013 RWE and E.ON \u2013 have already pulled out of the Horizon joint venture to build new nuclear plants in the UK.</p> <p>\"It is the same as after Chernobyl. There are huge question marks hanging over whether we should have [nuclear power] \u2013 a lot of countries are umm-ing and err-ing,\" says Heenal Patel, a senior industrial analyst at Bloomberg Industries.</p> <p>Patel says President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's decision to close France's oldest nuclear plant last month, and his commitment to lowering the country's dependence on nuclear power from 75% to 50% of total electricity demand, has caused the biggest waves in the industry: \"If the world's most pro-nuclear country is blowing cold it is noticed by other countries.\"</p> <p>Uranium miners have noticed the cool wind too. This summer, BHP Billiton, the giant Anglo-Australian mining group, shelved plans for the world's largest open-pit copper and uran, and announced it has no plans to build or acquire other uranium minesium mine in south Australia. The \u00a312bn Olympic Dam mega-project would have transformed the mine 350&#xa0;miles north of Adelaide into a massive pit capable of producing 19,000 tonnes of uranium a year. Explaining the decision to stall the project, Marius Kloppers, BHP's chief executive, said demand for uranium had \"collapsed\". BHP has also sold off its Yeelirrie uranium field in Western Australia.</p> <p>Canada's Cameco, the world's third-largest uranium miner, has said it is only worth pressing ahead with its Kintyre uranium project in Australia's Great Sandy Desert if the uranium price climbs back above $67 a pound.</p> <p>Patel said that if the uranium price keeps falling, \"manufacturers are going to look to keep it in the ground \u2026 That's the great thing about being a mining company: you can decide whether to produce or not. The uranium isn't going anywhere.\"</p> <p>Paladin Energy, which mines uranium in Malawi and Namibia (the largest sources of uranium oxide, or \"yellowcake\", after Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia), has warned that if the price stays depressed, supply will dip by 25% by 2020. Chief executive John Borshoff says his analysis \"confirms a supply industry in crisis, in which production is unable to meet emerging requirements in the short to medium term\".</p> <p>Another, more unusual, source of uranium could also run dry soon. At present, about 16% of the world's uranium (and half of supplies used in American reactors) come from Soviet nuclear weapons. The \"megatons to megawatts\" programme, which formed part of the 1993 US-Russia non-proliferation treaty, has seen highly enriched uranium from the equivalent of 18,000 Russian warheads converted to lower-grade fuel for use at power plants in the US cities at which they were once aimed. But the programme is due to come to an end next year.</p> <p>Despite the current collapse in demand, analysts say the uranium price will recover in the long term. The rapacious growth of China and India will be dependent on nuclear fuel, and the oil-rich Gulf nations are planning big forays into nuclear so that they can extend the lifetime of their highly profitable oil exports.</p> <p>There are 65 reactors being built around the world, and 69% of them are in the fast-growing Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Beijing's ambitious programme will increase nuclear from 2% to 5% of the country's electricity supply by 2020, and make China the world's biggest market for new nuclear equipment.</p> <p>India \u2013 which lacks fossil fuel resources and has been growing so fast that its electricity supply is falling 12% short at peak hours, causing frequent blackouts \u2013 is also planning a massive expansion programme. The country hopes nuclear will account for 50% of its electricity needs by 2050, up from just 3.7% last year.</p> <p>To raise nuclear output, India has had to convince uranium producers to provide supplies, despite long-held concerns over India's nuclear weapons programme. Four years ago, the 46-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group exempted India from a 30-year ban on exports to countries that have failed to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty after receiving assurances that no nuclear imports would find their way to the military.</p> <p>This month Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, held talks with his Australian counterpart Julia Gillard, with the aim of reversing Australia's decision to maintain its own ban on exports to India. Lifting the ban will boost Australia's miners, which produced 7,529 tonnes of uranium worth A$782m (\u00a3500m) last year, but could cause problems at home: nuclear power is a sensitive topic in a country that has decide not to build any nuclear plants despite having the world's largest uranium reserves.</p> <p>Patel reckons Japan will be forced to follow China and India and re-embrace nuclear despite the memories of Fukushima. \"Like India, they don't have a huge amount of natural resources, and that's why Japan was so into nuclear \u2026 They have had to import a whole lot more oil and gas, which is expensive and not great for energy&#xa0;security.\"</p>",
  "<p>Fifty years ago this month, the first James Bond movie, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/85424/dr-no\" title=\"\"><em>Dr No</em></a>, opened at United Artists's West End showcase, the London Pavilion in Piccadilly Circus, a former Victorian music hall. United Artists no longer exists as a major production company and the cinema became a shopping arcade a quarter of a century ago, but the franchise goes on. For the first time in more than a decade, the final credits confidently tell us there will be a new Bond film soon.</p> <p>Though produced by children of the American who launched <em>Dr No</em>, the Bond series is now a British institution with a global reach greater than our former empire, and the latest addition, <em>Skyfall</em>, was given its world premiere not in a movie house but at the Royal Albert Hall. In certain senses, it is more British than ever, not only in its predominant use of UK locations but in its relationship to national traditions. The patriotic opening ceremony of this summer's Olympics sealed the pact between Buckingham Palace and showbusiness when the current Bond, Daniel Craig, was accompanied on a mission by the Queen, concluding with a parachute jump into the Olympic Stadium. It is now virtually impossible to look at Bond's superior, M, as other than a stand-in for the Queen, especially as the regal Judi Dench came to the Bond series after impersonating Elizabeth I and Victoria. M seems now a code letter for majesty.</p> <p>This 23rd canonical Bond picture is possibly the best, challenged only by the 2006 Craig version of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/01/favourite-james-bond-casino-royale\" title=\"\"><em>Casino Royale</em></a>, which was at last able to draw on the text of Ian Fleming's first and best novel. It has two of the same writers who worked on <em>Casino Royale</em> and the last Bond picture, the disappointingly frenetic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\" title=\"\"><em>Quantum of Solace</em></a>, and although they've invented their scenario, it is true to Fleming and the series while making interesting additions. Returning to Britain to work on it are director Sam Mendes, all of whose pictures have been made in America, and the outstanding British cinematographer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/gallery/2008/mar/27/roger.deakins\" title=\"\">Roger Deakins</a>, who's been working for years in the States, principally for the Coen brothers, but also for Ron Howard and Mendes.</p> <p>The movie begins with a protracted chase by car, motorcycle and train in Turkey which ends with the serious, tight-lipped Bond failing to retrieve a list of MI6's special agents around the world and plunging down a gorge as precipitous as the Reichenbach Falls. A somewhat premature verdict of missing presumed dead is announced, but, like Holmes, he returns, somewhat depleted, only to be dispatched to find the ludic villain who has penetrated MI6's computers and planted a bomb that wrecks a whole floor of the department's Millbank HQ.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-397352619\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/8/1349692141948/2012-SKYFALL-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/8/121008SkyfallTrailer-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121008SkyfallTrailer/121008SkyfallTrailer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/8/121008SkyfallTrailer_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/8/121008SkyfallTrailer-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/8/121008SkyfallTrailer_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>M contemplates a room full of her employees' coffins draped in union flags and we realise that this is a Bond film that, for much of the time at least, takes death seriously. The explosion has driven MI6 underground to occupy the austere bunkers created by Winston Churchill when the country had its back to the wall in the second world war. Here, Bond is restored and reinstated, under the supervision of stiff-necked intelligence co-ordinator Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), an establishment figure redeemed in Bond's eyes by his having been an SAS captive of the IRA who never cracked.</p> <p>Bond is eventually sent to the exotic east \u2013 Shanghai and Macau, glitteringly affluent after staid London \u2013 to track down the villain. Here, he consorts with two alluring Bond girls, one black and dependable (the wisecracking MI6 agent Eve, played by Naomie Harris), the other Eurasian and expendable (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe). After seeing off some minor hoodlums, one of them in a pit patrolled by komodo dragons, he discovers the villain, a laughing lunatic called Silva (Javier Bardem), a suave Hannibal Lecter type whose motive is revenge against MI6 for not appreciating him. Unlike his predecessors, who lived in Renaissance mansions and worked in state-of-the-art subterranean silos, Silva's an austere figure living in supposedly polluted ruins on a remote, deserted island.</p> <p>Most of the rest is set in Britain. In London, Bond contemplates changing times and his own future while scrutinising Turner's <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/joseph-mallord-william-turner-the-fighting-temeraire\" title=\"\"><em>The Fighting Temeraire</em></a> during a rendezvous in the National Gallery with the new, young, computer-savvy Q (Ben Wishaw), who provides for his logistical needs. M, in mortal danger from Silva, recites Tennyson's \"Ulysses\" (\"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\") to give her strength for the fateful showdown with her relentless nemesis. This is staged in the bracing Highlands, ancient home of the Bond family (their 16th century mansion is called Skyfall). It's the sort of place where British sporting heroes such as Buchan's Richard Hannay and the protagonist of Geoffrey Household's <em>Rogue Male</em> would once repair to confront their enemies. To get there, Bond digs out the Aston Martin DB5 (first seen in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79341/goldfinger\" title=\"\"><em>Goldfinger</em></a>) and M jokes about not wanting to be ejected.</p> <p>There's some lazy repetition in <em>Skyfall</em>, the badinage is often perfunctory and Bond is as usual captured too easily and too easily escapes. But overall it's admirably staged, has a suitably sombre look, and the oddly moving final scenes have an elegiac grace and a tragic sense that the end of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77768/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service\" title=\"\"><em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</em></a> only hints at. At the centre, Craig manages to get out of the shadow of Connery. He's the only Bond so far who might also have played Alec Leamas, the downbeat hero of le Carr\u00e9's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141194523\" title=\"\"><em>The Spy Who Came in From the Cold</em></a>. Alongside him, Judi Dench suggests she could have played Smiley, which is more than one could say of Stella Rimington.</p>",
  "<p>At the Google campus in east London last month, an unshaven, scruffily dressed 31-year-old man took to the stage to address a packed room. Introducing the panel beside him \u2013 which included David \"Two Brains\" Willetts, the geekish minister for universities and science, and Mind Candy founder Michael Acton Smith \u2013 he remarked that the last time he'd visited the building, he'd been with George Osborne shortly after \"that budget\" and their ministerial car had been pelted with Cornish pasties (after the chancellor announced a so-called \"pasty tax\"). It's fair to say that Rohan Silva, the senior prime ministerial adviser and the person many credit with putting east London's technology cluster of startups on the map as \"Tech City\", enjoyed a rather less hostile welcome this time, as he unveiled plans to open up London's equity markets to high-growth tech companies.</p> <p>The announcement was the latest in a tsunami of initiatives to turn London's East End (according to the press release at the time) into \"a world-leading technology city to rival Silicon Valley\". The campaign began in the unlikely setting of Brick Lane's sticky-floored Old Truman Brewery, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2010/nov/04/tech-city-london-facebook-google\" title=\"\">where David Cameron sketched out his technology strategy</a>, which was, according to insiders, heavily moulded by Silva. Among the prime minister's pledges that day were that companies such as Vodafone, Google, Facebook and Intel would invest in the long-term future of the area and that the Olympic Park media centre would become an \"accelerator space\" after the games.</p> <p>Reactions from east London tech companies \u2013 which numbered around 200 at the time \u2013 were decidedly mixed. One founder <a href=\"http://designswarm.com/blog/2010/11/politicians-handbook-east-london/\" title=\"\">blogged that Downing Street should leave the East End alone</a>: \"If you fill east London with Google, Facebook and Intel, the value of property will rise and the creative people will move to Bermondsey\", while one leading US investor, John Lilly of Greylock partners, pointed out that \"<a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/02/start/silicon-roundabout?page=all\" title=\"\">tech hubs are rarely created by governments</a>\". For Charles Armstrong, CEO of Trampoline Systems, the initiative had \"got mixed in with a policy fig-leaf, which is really about this embarrassment about legacy and the Olympics\".</p> <p>Yet two years on, with an estimated five-fold increase of tech companies in the area, Silva has much to crow about \u2013 not least last week's considerable coup of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/21/facebook-joanna-shields-silicon-roundabout\" title=\"\">landing Facebook executive Joanna Shields</a> to lead the <a href=\"http://www.techcityuk.com/#!/home\" title=\"\">Tech City Investment Organisation</a> (TCIO), the UK Trade &amp; Investment vehicle for growing east London's tech zone. The <em>Observer</em> understands that Shields was called at Facebook by headhunters asking whether she could recommend anyone for the role. To their surprise, she said: \"Yes. Me.\" The timing, says an insider, was serendipitous: \"After years of working for [large corporations] she wanted to do a public service role.\"</p> <p>With the departure of chief executive Erik van der Kleij, it was felt that the TCIO required a big-hitter with the profile to impress Silicon Valley \u2013 and that Shields fitted the bill. Topping last year's <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/06/the-wired-100\" title=\"\"><em>Wired</em> 100 list</a> of UK tech influencers, Shields was previously president at AOL and chief executive of UK social network Bebo (which was acquired by AOL for \u00a3530m in 2008 and, two years later, sold on for a reported \u00a36.2m). Before joining Facebook, she was Google's MD for Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>As he munches his way through a family pack of nuts and seeds in the Google campus courtyard, Silva says that a government has rarely moved so quickly on a range of policy and legislative fronts. With an annual budget of just \u00a32m to promote the area, TCIO has more or less \"bootstrapped\" the entire venture, he argues. Simultaneously \"the great assets of state\" have been deployed to introduce the east London tech community to corporate and venture capital big-hitters, with regular Tech City breakfasts at 10 Downing Street and events at Buckingham Palace and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. \"We even had a Tech City event on the west coast of the US with Prince William and Kate,\" he says.</p> <p>Silva, who got married this month and has wrongly been reported to be leaving his post, points to three main achievements so far. \"The first is the global profile that east London now has. It's true to say that the majority of serious tech people around the world are now aware of Tech City. The second is a long list of government policies, which have flowed directly out of conversations with Tech City companies: 'entrepreneur visas' [a fast-track visa scheme for entrepreneurs], the <a href=\"http://www.seis.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme</a> [of tax breaks], the work on IPOs and opening up of government procurement contracts. Third is the building we're in now. The Google campus literally wouldn't have been here had it not been for us going to Google and saying, 'come to east&#xa0;London'.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's speech had also named a number of major companies that would invest in the area. Two years later, this, too, can too be chalked up as a success. Among others, Google, Intel, Vodafone, Cisco, Yammer and Airbnb have invested in the capital, while Facebook is opening its first non-US engineering hub. However, everyone interviewed for this article considered Tech City to be very much a work in progress. While entrepreneur visas were widely praised, there was criticism about the hardening of discourse surrounding immigration, which has been capped by the coalition and might put off overseas coding talent, which is in short supply. \"What the PM does constantly say is that the brightest and best will always be welcome in the UK, whatever the media discourse,\" counters Silva. \"Where we could do more is go to university campuses around the world to tell people about the entrepreneur visa. We want the next Sergey Brin to come to London and find a home, investment and build a business here.\"</p> <p>But the next Sergey Brin might not be overly impressed by the quality of broadband to be found in London, and the fact that start-ups have on occasion struggled to persuade providers to connect them. Silva concedes this remains a live issue. \"We've just announced \u00a325m for fibre-optic broadband for London. But we're also leaning on BT to get them to roll out their fibre faster. One of the challenges the entrepreneurs were telling us about was that even where fibre is available, you've got to sign a two-year contract, but as a startup you don't know where you're going to be in two months, let alone two years. So we've worked with Virgin on that and they're piloting switch-on-and-off fibre-broadband.\"</p> <p>As for the Olympic Park, Silva chooses his words carefully. \"Our thinking with the Olympic Park is that as a government, we inherited this thing,\" he says. \"We want to make sure companies around the world are aware that it's there and can make use of it. If the likes of Songkick and Mind Candy do turn out to be massive companies, where do they grow to? All we're saying is that there is this fantastic asset there, and if people want to move there, then great.\"</p> <p>Silva readily accepts there is still more work to do. When pressed for specifics, he says: \"There is still not a world-class computer science university in east London. I think that's something the ecosystem needs. There are also some transport things we can look at: high-speed rail links to Europe, links to City Airport and links to other clusters such as Cambridge.\" What about a third runway at Heathrow? The Downing Street adviser laughs nervously. \"I think I'll leave that for Boris [Johnson] and the PM to sort out.\"</p>",
  "<p>At the end of a dinner created by triple Michelin-starred chef Yannick All\u00e9no, served to a&#xa0;table of 100 against the surreal backdrop of Harrods menswear department, a young man rises to speak to the assembled guests. His audience, which includes supermodels David Gandy and Eva Herzigova, gallerist Jay Jopling as well as artist Dinos Chapman and editors Jefferson Hack and Suzy Menkes, have gathered to celebrate the relaunch of <a href=\"http://berluti.com\" title=\"\">Berluti</a> as a&#xa0;major luxury menswear brand. The French leather goods label is 127 years old, but the CEO who stands before us is 35.</p> <p>His face is rounder, his fringe is floppier and he is, of course, much younger than you'd imagine a CEO to be. But the room falls silent as he recounts an anecdote about his first Berluti shoes, which his father gave to him when he was 17. He was going through a rebellious phase, \"listening to Nirvana\", so he barely wore them. But he kept them, quietly proud to own something so beautiful. Now the father who gave him those shoes has put him in charge of the brand. He says he's determined to honour that idea of an heirloom. He promises that he will never compromise on the quality. The room applauds and the waiters surge forward to fill glasses with Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem Sauternes 2006. I slip away, and finally manage to get a cab when Bryan Ferry relinquishes his so I can get home.</p> <p>I want an early(ish) night because I'm meeting Antoine Arnault, CEO of Berluti, at 9am the next day at Hotel Bulgari in Knightsbridge. The Arnaults, who hail from Roubaix in northern France, are the most influential family in global fashion. Their holdings company, Groupe Arnault, is the majority shareholder in Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA \u2013 better known as LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate which runs Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Fendi, Veuve Clicquot, Tag Heuer and Guerlain to name but a few of the 60-plus brands that fall under its grand umbrella. The father he talked about so fondly last night is Bernard Arnault, according to <em>Forbes</em> magazine the fourth richest person in the world, with a net worth of $41bn. Bernard's empire started with Christian Dior, acquired in 1984, and has grown through aggressive expansion and inspired hiring (he is the man who pulled designers such as Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen on to the international stage) to become the largest luxury-goods group in the world. Sales are expected to hit $33bn this year.</p> <p>Antoine's older sister, Delphine, also works in the business. Having started at the smaller fashion labels Loewe and Pucci, she is now a&#xa0;director at Dior. Antoine started in the advertising department at Louis Vuitton and worked his way up to head of communications before becoming CEO at Berluti. He's also on the board of LVMH. Although the pair have three much younger siblings (from Bernard's second marriage to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist), at the moment it looks likely that one of them will become Bernard's heir apparent. \"We work hard,\" says Antoine. \"We were raised with real values about the importance of work and respect for the people. We're not in the gossip magazines playing strip billiards.\" Unlike Prince Harry, when Antoine goes to Vegas it's for poker \u2013 he's a world-class player. He dates a&#xa0;supermodel, but his relationship with Natalia Vodianova is very stable. The couple have just finished doing up their house in France.</p> <p>Normally it would be hard to imagine what Antoine's level of wealth feels like, but in the last 24 hours I've had a&#xa0;reasonable insight into his world. The Berluti party was catered by All\u00e9no, a chef who works at Cheval Blanc Courchevel, a&#xa0;French five-star hotel owned by LVMH, which Arnault assured me is absolutely lovely. We were served \u00a3300-a-bottle wine from Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem \u2013 the 14th-century vineyard is LVMH's oldest brand \u2013 and this morning we're in a suite at Hotel Bulgari which is, of course, five star, and, of course, owned by LVMH. \"It's very nice, <em>no</em>?\" says Arnault walking around the suite's living room. His enthusiasm when he talks about the hotels, last night's menu and how much he enjoyed the party feels completely genuine. He pauses to inspect a classic Arco floor lamp next to the sofa. \"I think this used to be mine, I'm sure I&#xa0;had it in my office, but I got a little bored of it\u2026\" He wanders off to greet Alessandro Sartori, Berluti's creative director.</p> <p>It is, of course, very easy to dismiss Arnault's appointment as nepotism. Bernard Arnault comes from a culture of family business (before he moved into fashion, he was the third generation of Arnaults to work in a real-estate business founded by his grandfather). But an empire like LVMH isn't built by doing family favours. And, although Berluti \u2013 a well-established brand with devoted customers \u2013 at first glance seems like an easy ride, it's a crucial development for the conglomerate and a&#xa0;huge amount of money has been invested in the project. LVMH's success is too dependant on Louis Vuitton: the fashion house brings in 37% of the group's sales. At some point sales will surely slow \u2013 to continue growth, LVMH has to diversify. The luxury menswear sector is currently one of the hottest growth areas in fashion, so relaunching Berluti as a clothing and lifestyle brand is a&#xa0;big deal, a potentially vital diversification. \"It's a good appointment for Berluti,\" says Honor Westnedge, a retail analyst at Verdict Research. \"It's not a well-known brand in America or the UK, so Antoine's background in marketing and communication gives him the perfect qualifications to refresh the brand and introduce it to new customers.\" Arnault's little anecdote about his first Berlutis may have been a nice soundbite for last night's dinner, but he clearly understand the brand's potential value.</p> <p>\"Berluti was untouched,\" he explains. \"LVMH bought it in the 1990s and it was one of the few brands that felt like an almost divine name, quite untouchable \u2013 and that's where you want a brand to be, in luxury it has to feel almost inaccessible. A pair of Berluti shoes has this flair, these nuances in colour and patina, so I thought: 'What if we took this <em>je ne sais quoi</em> and turn it into a menswear brand?' Also, we are not poets, huh? We're businessmen. We know this is a segment of the market which lacks a real good player, a house that allies to authenticity and tradition, but with style and sophistication. It's usually either or.\"</p> <p>The Berluti menswear collection created by Alessandro Sartori, who Arnault headhunted from Italian menswear label Z Zegna, launched this autumn and is certainly sophisticated. It's the epitome of how to create modern ultra-luxury. The clothes and leather goods have no logo \u2013 the range's only signature is a&#xa0;stitched slash, so only those in the know will recognise the brand. The clothes \u2013 in shades of slate, navy, mahogany \u2013 are heavy on silk, cashmere, double cashmere. The prices are just as remarkable. Shoes come relatively cheap, starting at \u00a3980, but you could spend more than \u00a322,000 on a crocodile-skin bag. Cashmere coats start at \u00a33,300. Obviously it's between you, your god and your bank manager whether you think paying these prices is obscene, an aspiration or something you do most weekends, but there's undeniably an international market for this level of luxury goods.</p> <p>\"It's an expensive pair of shoes,\" concedes Arnault. \"It's \u00a31,000. Why do people spend that on shoes? Well, for them it's not just shoes, it's a lifestyle, it's a message to the people around you. I think the LVMH portfolio has done well during this economic crisis because we make things right, we don't cheat. It's not indecent that these brands grow, it's because our customers think they're buying an asset, not a product.\"</p> <p>The prices may be elitist, but Arnault is adamant that the brand should be egalitarian. \"I&#xa0;think buying shoes is intimidating for a guy. Sitting down taking your shoes off, for men, it's too much. But you should never be intimidated by anything. If I see one of my sales assistants neglecting someone because he doesn't look like a good client, he's fired immediately. I hate it when those guys are pricks and don't say hello. Not least because it's a terrible mistake.</p> <p>\"I remember a while ago at the Venice Biennale, there was a beautiful Brancusi statue in one of the galleries and everyone had to wait to see it. This guy turned up and they told him to get a ticket and come back later. So the guy leaves, goes to the next stand and buys three Picassos \u2013 because it was Bill Gates. If that was the way it was for Gates, imagine how intimidating it would be for a regular guy to see the Brancusi. That's how I <em>don't</em> want things to be in my company. Because even if you can't buy, you're going to see beautiful products here \u2013 and one day when you can buy, well, we'll still be here.\"</p> <p>If you ever do want to spend significant money on luxury goods, if it isn't Arnault's brand you spend it with, well, it will probably be one that his family owns. Antoine says that fashion has always been part of his life and that he thinks his immersion in the market gives him a significant advantage.</p> <p>\"I was taught fashion very early, from the age of 12 when my father bought and created the group. We spent all our weekends in stores, speaking about brands, discussing advertising \u2013 I remember watching the adverts for [top-selling Dior perfumes] Poison, for Dolce Vita\u2026 is the music right? The edit? I had a couple of rebellious years when I didn't want to be bothered with it, but I very naturally came back to it. It's not a burden, you know? You're going to work in fashion, surrounded by creativity and beautiful people, beautiful objects \u2013 or work in banking. Well, you know\u2026 OK, I choose fashion. It was really a road that I was happy to drive down. The fact that we were initiated into it very early gave me and my sister Delphine a&#xa0;headstart. We feel things, brands, streets, we know where it's going to happen maybe a tiny bit before the others, so we use that.\"</p> <p>Arnault thinks the most important thing he has learnt from his father is the ability to communicate with designers properly \u2013 and that this is a&#xa0;key skill in the fashion business. \"I'm sorry, but designers are not artists. They may have the talent of one, but if they want to work in that way they should paint or sculpt. Here they're working in business and they need a&#xa0;brief. That's what my father does so well. I've witnessed him do it countless times and I'm really inspired by that. You know, towards the end, my father just couldn't talk to John Galliano at all, it was impossible \u2013 he wouldn't listen to anything. At that point, it crashes.\"</p> <p>I wonder if it's hard to work for his father \u2013 it must add an extra level of stress to performing well at work. He laughs heartily. \"Of course there's pressure, but I deserve absolutely no pity. It's a great life and a great job. It didn't arrive just like that\" \u2013 he snaps his fingers \u2013 \"I&#xa0;work hard and, yes, my father trusts me more and more and we're more involved in business decisions, but please don't feel sorry for me.\"</p> <p>I promise him, hand on heart, that I won't \u2013 which makes him laugh even more.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Price \u00a324,785</strong><br><strong>MPG 50.4</strong><br><strong>Top speed 120mph</strong></p> <p>The green-walled lanes of south Devon are a beautiful place to visit for a holiday. Bursting with flowers and alive with nature, the winding tracks are the arteries that keep Mother Nature in such rude health. But for your car these lanes offer no easygoing respite from the daily grind. They are a traumatising boot camp hell bent on sending your forecourt-fresh motor home in tatters. Thorns wait to lacerate your paintwork, gaping pot holes linger ready to devour your suspension, while those velvety, moss-covered boulders loiter in the damp verges primed to sabotage your sills. A&#xa0;week in Devon puts years on your car and will send it home distressed, tired and battered.</p> <p>The car I chose to inflict such punishment on was <a href=\"http://seat.co.uk\" title=\"\">Seat</a>'s all-conquering Alhambra \u2013 a tuff mudder if ever there was one. No nonsense, economical and business-like, Seat's large MPV is used to winning. Year in year out it cleans up when it comes to award time. Earlier this year it was named <a href=\"http://whatcar.com\" title=\"\"><em>What Car?</em></a>'s back-to-back MPV champion.</p> <p>It's not that I had a personal vendetta against the Alhambra, but it promised to do everything I needed it to. Room for seven adults: check. Huge boot: check. Five-star safety rating: check. Fifty miles to the gallon: check. Decent stereo: check. Engaging drive: check. Great looks\u2026 well, OK, it's not exactly a stunner. It simply looks like what it is: a mammoth, parsimonious people carrier.</p> <p>As probably the best-value large MPV on the road, most Alhambras have little more to look forward to than a life of servitude: long days and late-night minicabbing with the odd early-morning airport transfer thrown in for variety. But those that escape the rat race \u2013 to Devon, say, or to work uncomplainingly for a multi-child family \u2013 will reward you amply.</p> <p>All cars want to play the Tardis card: small on the outside, big on the inside. But the Alhambra trumps the rest. It's biggish on the outside and absolutely vast on the inside. Its boot is a yawning maw, ready to swallow, in my case, everything from surfboards to a portable barbecue, plus luggage for seven for a week. But like a large man holding in his stomach for that terrible family beach shot, the Alhambra takes up less space than it should. Its wheels are pushed out to the corners, and the rear doors slide rather than winging open \u2013 meaning you can squeeze into the smaller parking spaces and still actually get out of the car. And inside all five of the rear seats can fold flat to create enough space for a kingsize mattress. Combined with the full-length panoramic roof, you could stretch out on your back and look at the autumn rain falling with impunity.</p> <p>The square shape means visibility is superb and Seat has the handling of a much smaller, more agile car. With vehicles built for size, driveability can only really be seen as a bonus. The Alhambra steers well, offers a cushy ride and its eager 2-litre diesel is quiet, responsive and never whines (just like my children). And 50mpg, too \u2013 come on, that's a deal-closer.</p> <p>Should you buy one? Without doubt. The only problem is that you won't want to take a car you like so much on holiday.</p> <h2>Tyres to trees <br></h2> <p>Environmentally conscious motorists are being given the chance to turn their unwanted cars into newly planted trees. <a href=\"http://ScrapCarPlantTree.org.uk\" title=\"\">Scrap Car Plant Tree</a>, which launched this week, allows motorists to donate unwanted vehicles and uses the money raised through their disposal to plant trees in a city of their choice. The innovative and free-to-use recycling scheme enables people to offset their car's carbon footprint and offers the most environmentally friendly means of car disposal currently available in the UK. Money made from each disposal will go to UK charity Trees for Cities, which plants trees and creates green spaces throughout Britain's urban areas. Scrap Car Plant Tree expects to fund the planting of 13 saplings on average per disposal which will offset around a year's carbon emissions \u2013 although some vehicles will be able to provide significantly more. Collection of the vehicle is taken care of through the site and users are notified after the disposal just how much money was raised to fund urban tree planting.</p> <p>Alex Harvey from <a href=\"http://Giveacar.co.uk\" title=\"\">Giveacar.co.uk</a>, who manage the vehicle's disposal, said: \"We are thrilled to be part of an idea that will have such a positive impact on the way that people think about their end of life vehicles and the damage they may have done in their lifetime. Each car that is disposed of will offset at least one year's carbon emissions and vehicles which are auctioned could provide significantly more carbon relief, which can only be a good thing for the environment. Everybody is aware of how bad cars are for the environment so what better way to give something back than by funding the planting of new trees when getting rid of an unwanted vehicle?\"</p> <p>So, if your car has reached the end of the road and you would like to donate it, call 020 0011 1664 or visit <a href=\"http://ScrapCarPlantTree.org.uk\" title=\"\">ScrapCarPlantTree.org.uk</a>.</p> <h2>What's your favourite Bond car?</h2> <p>As <a href=\"http://skyfall-movie.com\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall </em></a>unleashes the next wave of Bond madness (or Bond envy), those of us who are more interested in what 007 is driving than which evil mastermind he is saving the world from, will be weighing up that eternal question: what's your favourite Bond car?

  "<p>\"Humorous Spanish books about cancer\" is probably a small section at your library. \"Humorous Spanish books about cancer that mention Gary Lineker\" is probably an even smaller sub-genre. In fact, it likely&#xa0;includes only this strange self\u2011help memoir.</p> <p>Aged 14, Albert Espinosa was a typical football-obsessed schoolboy from Barcelona. Then doctors found a malignant bone tumour in his left leg. His parents were told he had a 3% chance of survival and maybe a month to live. Just as they reached the airport to jet off for one last holiday together, the Espinosa family decided to turn back and fight. Albert spent the next decade in hospital, losing a leg, a lung and part of his liver. He learned to walk four times and endured gruelling amounts of chemotherapy \u2013 83 sessions, to be precise.</p> <p>By the time he was finally cured, aged 24, he'd written <em>El Mundo Amarillo</em> (<em>The Yellow World</em>), which the author insists is \"not about how to survive cancer but how to live\". It became a bestseller around Europe, shifting 1m copies. Now it's being published for the first time here.</p> <p>The best bits of this initially beguiling book aren't the self-help sections but the vivid portrait Espinosa paints of life on the cancer ward. Having lost their hair because of chemo, the young patients take ownership of their baldness, styling themselves as a cool gang called the Eggheads. They talk into the small hours, sharing pain-coping strategies and street wisdom. They'd visit the \"other Eggheads\" (newborn babies), have wheelchair races, escape outside to sunbathe or watch the 1990 World Cup (hence that Lineker name-check). \"I was happy when I had cancer,\" he writes. \"It was one of the best times of&#xa0;my life.\"</p> <p>The friendships formed in this environment are intense. Espinosa watched 22 fellow patients, mainly teenagers, die from the disease but is never maudlin about it. The Eggheads made a pact that \"if one of us were to die, we would share out their life\" by acting on their dying wishes. Espinosa now carries with him the desires and dreams of 3.7 friends.</p> <p>Warmly evocative and shot through with black humour, these tales reminded me of kids' caper films such as <em>Stand By Me</em>, <em>E.T.</em> or <em>The Goonies</em>. It's no coincidence Espinosa has turned them into a hit Catalan TV series, <em>Polseres Vermelles</em> (<em>Red Bracelets</em>). Steven <a href=\"http://www.catalannewsagency.com/news/culture/spielberg-produce-remake-catalan-public-television-series-%E2%80%98polseres-vermelles%E2%80%99-american\" title=\"\">Spielberg is now remaking it</a> under the title <em>The Red Band Society</em>.</p> <p>Hospital staff make vivid cameos. A 7ft-tall physiotherapist preaches \"the art of positive wanking\". A neurologist shows how to \"change his brain's factory settings\". A nurse strokes his big toe comfortingly. \"It was a bit sexy,\" he admits. A surgeon advises him to throw a farewell party for the leg he's about to lose. The night before the amputation, he does just that, inviting people with a connection to his left leg. They all tell stories about the limb, touch it and give it a send-off. He dances on it one last time. The next day, he'd \"lost a leg but gained a stump\". Having buried the leg, Espinosa says he's \"one of the few people who can literally say they've got one foot in the grave\".</p> <p>Less successful is the book's second half, where Epinosa espouses his \"philosophy for life\" based on his 23 \"discoveries\" during illness. This happy world he found is yellow because that's the colour of the sun. It's around this point that his naive style starts to lose its charm and become as saccharine as a Purple Ronnie postcard.</p> <p>While some ideas are interesting (say, mastering anxiety within 30 minutes), others are clangingly obvious. Does anyone need a book to tell them to be themselves or keep a diary, regardless of its author's good intentions and brave backstory? Espinosa advises changing the way you laugh every two years. At times, I felt like advising him to do something less printable.</p> <p>Apparently, fans get tattoos of their favourite quotations, especially \"Trust your dreams and they will come true\", and send photos to the delighted author. Which is all very sweet, but such lines still don't mean much. You might as well ink your body with the contents of a fortune cookie or bumper sticker.</p> <p>He's passionate about the importance of friendships, such as those formed with his fellow Eggheads. He encourages the reader to seek out their own \"yellows\" \u2013 special people who touch our lives, transform us for the better. We each have 23 \u2013 that number again. Espinosa's fixation with it feels forced and faux-mystical, despite his wide-eyed sincerity.</p> <p>Things get downright irritating when he advises readers actively to seek out these 23 yellows, giving tips on how to spot and approach them. Build a mood-board of faces you're drawn to. Fertile hunting grounds include airports. A key part of bonding is caressing, cuddling and sleeping next to them. Call me an uptight Brit but I'm not going to start loitering in departure lounges, sidling up to strangers and fondling them because they look like a face off my mood-board. I'd get arrested. \"Your honour, I thought she was a yellow\" is unlikely to cut it in court.</p> <p>I found myself wishing Espinosa had written a straightforward memoir, rather than using his experiences as a launch pad for this mystic mumbo-jumbo. His story is fascinating enough, without bolting on all the faux-profound, self-help hokum. Maybe such an approach was too easy for this extraordinary character, but it would've made his book less frustrating and more compelling \u2013 for me, if not for Mr&#xa0;Spielberg.</p>",
  "<p>As the mists begin to clear a little, one word links <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\" title=\"\">BBC</a> travails ancient and modern. It is a most unexpected word for a great media organisation. Simple but deadly: incuriosity.</p> <p>At first sight today, though this worst of crises for our world-class broadcasting corporation is not over (nor will it be until the foul legacy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile </a>is finally fixed), a certain stability seems to be returning. BBC News is able to lead on other stories but its own distress. Meanwhile, <em>Panorama </em>scores a palpable hit in the hell-hole of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20084254\" title=\"\">Winterbourne View </a>care home, which led to arrests and convictions. But there remains major issues for the BBC \u2013 two different areas of concern involving two different inquiries.</p> <p>One (the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/16/jimmy-savile-scandal-bbc-inquiry-heads\" title=\"\">Dame Janet Smith</a> remit) ostensibly concerns deeds and omissions from long ago. The BBC was not alone in letting Jimmy Savile roam its corridors. Other institutions, hospitals and prisons among them, have their own tawdry secrets to unravel. Though Savile is beyond justice, others may not be. The police are on that case. When they're done, Dame Janet can begin to lay out her lessons and to ask, among other things, how on earth a mighty broadcasting organisation full of journalists trained to sniff out foul play found nothing to pursue over decades in the activities of a celebrity performer whose first hit show featured young teenage girls left to party with the stars. It was a disaster waiting to happen. So, later on, was another show devoted entirely to kids and their dreams. Were the BBC warned? It would seem that they were. Yet incuriosity and inertia ruled.</p> <p>Now, because Dame Janet will be turning over old stones, there'll be a temptation to draw a line under her findings. Jimmy Savile is dead and in his grave and, we'll be told, there has been a fundamental shift in society's attitudes towards child sex abuse.</p> <p>What is much more immediately compelling in headline terms these past few weeks is the show that wasn't broadcast, the light that wasn't shone, the official excuses that withered on the lips. Here's inquiry number two under <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19970059\" title=\"\">Nick Pollard</a>, once boss of Sky News. This will be contemporary in its conclusions, affecting people who hold jobs now but may not hold them much longer. Was Peter Rippon at <em>Newsnight </em>pressured by senior bosses? What are we to make of a civil war between journalists on <em>Newsnight </em>and <em>Panorama,</em> or of the disdain with which many BBC producers, editors and reporters regard the men and women in suits who rule their lives? Is BBC Trust governance too close or too far away?&#xa0;</p> <p>There is, to be frank, a real chattering class dimension to much of this. Readers and viewers outside the media village may all too easily switch off. But that, yet again, will be letting incuriosity win the day.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/george-entwistle\" title=\"\">George Entwistle</a>, the very new director general, met MPs for an early grilling last Tuesday, the most desultory part of an understandably nervy performance came as he attempted to explain how the corporation's internal reporting system works. You're a <em>Newsnight</em> reporter and you've got a good story. So you get your editor to commission it. If necessary, he'll mention it to the deputy head of news who may consult the head of news who can consult the director general as necessary. And the DG's office could theoretically alert the Trust, sitting over down the road. George Entwistle was head of vision last December, a portentous delusion of a title that meant he had a sort of responsibility for all TV and thus for the two Savile tribute specials. Was he warned that <em>Newsnight </em>was on the paedophile case? Helen Boaden, the head of news, touched on it during a chat over a drink apparently, but Entwistle asked nothing more because he was vision and she was news and probity dictates the two must be kept apart.</p> <p>Much of the focus has been on the <em>Newsnight </em>programme that never aired but little is known about the background to the two tribute programmes that were broadcast. If there was widespread rumour and/or speculation about Savile inside the BBC, what lengths did the producers of the tribute programmes go to investigate these? Were the senior executives who authorised the tribute programmes not curious about the stories that had surrounded Savile?</p> <p>Let's take that institutional incuriosity as gospel truth in relation to the <em>Newsnight </em>programme. Let's believe that one good journalist and ex-<em>Newsnight</em> editor (Entwistle ) had no interest in what another good journalist and editor (Rippon) was doing, that he lived in a gossip- and speculation-free environment. You have to ask whether that's any way to run Britain's biggest news operation.</p> <p>You also have to ask that question again when the director general still ruling the roost in 2011, Mark Thompson, says he only vaguely knew about the <em>Newsnight </em>investigation because a reporter, Caroline Hawley, mentioned it briefly at another pre-Christmas drinks do.&#xa0; The hallowed chain of command develops missing links so fast that the people paid to be responsible only hear the mildest whisper of impending doom over a mince pie and mulled wine.</p> <p>As Pollard may soon discover, answers come even more difficult than questions here. There's vital independence in the little boxes of journalism where programme editors rule. It means that no politically implanted DG can tell them what to do without an almighty public fuss. It's the space for manoeuvre and decision-making that keeps the BBC free. No wonder, in this structure, nobody quite knows what's going on. But, in an era where every BBC.com posting and every blog is also supposedly the word of the corporation, you have to wonder whether it needs refitting for new purposes.</p> <p>Even the journalists who work for it seem a bit fogged about what their layers of bosses do all day. Hostility and incomprehension grow up that long chain. Even a trust designed to monitor the corporation vacillates bizarrely between defence and glum predictions that heads may roll when the pressure comes on. There is, lurking behind this lousy business, a challenge that everyone at the BBC, and everyone who cares about good journalism, needs to answer.</p> <p>Incuriosity let Jimmy Savile shut the green room doors.

  "<p>David Laws, newly restored to the front rank of British politics as Lib Dem education minister, is a disgrace to his party and political tradition. He was one of the principal architects of the coalition agreement, one of whose consequences was to undermine Britain's threadbare social contract. Now, compounding the felony, he has joined the choir of elite figures who attack teachers as undermining working-class aspirations.</p> <p>Last week, he told the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9634695/Teachers-to-blame-for-lack-of-ambition-among-pupils.html\" title=\"\"><em>Daily Telegraph</em></a>, voicing what he imagined is the emerging consensus, that teachers' \"depressingly low expectations\" fail to encourage too many children \"to reach for the stars\". Too few teachers, career advisers and colleges encouraged pupils to believe they could reach the top. Improved social mobility demanded change.</p> <p>There is no easier constituency to attack than teachers, especially as, at first glance, Laws has a point. In too many schools, teaching is little more than getting through the day without incident, shepherding the barely controllable class to modest qualifications. Of course it should be better and teachers and teaching unions would do their cause a great deal of good if they committed themselves fully to excellence and aspiration. There are enough barriers to disadvantaged children breaking out of their situation without teachers offering another.</p> <p>But to focus merely on the shortcomings of teachers is to dodge huge questions, not just about the nature of contemporary society but about what it means to live a life well. Stagnant social mobility characterises the entire industrialised west. And, uncomfortable as it may be for those who believe that social class is so very yesterday, the brutal truth is that the higher the inequality and the weaker a country's social contract, the lower its mobility and aspiration. Inequality matters. Blaming hapless teachers for deep trends that have an impact on all western societies is little better than scapegoating.</p> <p>Too much discussion of inequality takes as axiomatic why we should be concerned about the extent to which the top 1%'s incomes are outstripping the rest, driven by technology, skills and not a little old-fashioned exploitation. Yet what makes inequality toxic is not so much the differential buying power but that it creates social groups in which the members of society have no idea or stake in how others live and which work as self-fulfilling traps.</p> <p>The more hermetically sealed the world of the rich, the less a sense of obligation or shared destiny they feel they have with the rest of society. Conversely, for the average and disadvantaged, the chance of escaping their position becomes ever more remote as expectations and aspirations, collapse along with their relative incomes.</p> <p>Laws says it is deplorable that even young people in his own constituency of Yeovil, not a social black spot, feel that a career in investment banking is so much another world that they and their teachers would not aim to join it. But such a response is completely rational.</p> <p>Investment banking <em>is</em> another world. Nor are its denizens interested in creating wealth on the ground in Britain. To declare yourself a candidate means doing something of dubious value, where the objective odds of selection are tiny.</p> <p>I doubt Laws would criticise, say, Lord O'Donnell for not being aspirational enough to be candidate for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/07/paul-tucker-favourite-bank-england\" title=\"\">governorship of the Bank of England</a>: why set yourself up for a highly probable failure? Precisely the same logic applies to a bright student from a state school in Yeovil, pondering a career in investment banking. In any case, even if Yeovil's half-a-dozen brightest end up working at Goldman Sachs, in what way would anything substantive be solved for the rest of Yeovil's school-leavers?</p> <p>Of course school-leavers want to make the best of themselves, live a life they have reason to value and find jobs where employers allow them to do just that. Most social mobility is not driven by making spectacular leaps across ever widening social gaps, even though we should never discourage the attempt. Rather, it is done by joining an organisation and working one's way up. The problem is that so few of today's employers provide such ladders and those that do are being driven by economic exigency to remove them.</p> <p>Promotion in the public sector has been close to eliminated by the over-the-top austerity for which Mr Laws is such an enthusiast. By next year, for example, it will be four years since the Metropolitan Police stopped promoting constables to sergeants. Meanwhile, in the private sector, large organisations are removing layers of management and very few offer starter job apprenticeships on any scale. Barclays, creating&#xa0;1,000 apprentices, was oversubscribed more than 10-fold.</p> <p>To promote social mobility, we need to create a more dynamic capitalism so that more firms can grow together with their people. Alongside it, we need a social contract that equips people, especially our young, to make the most of their capabilities. Only then might the gap between the social groups be narrowed to allow more people to move up, and also create a society in which we live more fulfilled lives, surely a broader conception of social wellbeing than just mobility alone.</p> <p>Some of the foundations of a 21st-century social contract were laid by New Labour. The child trust fund was a means by which working-class parents could create a pool of saving for their children, their contributions matched by the state, so that as adults they would have some wherewithal to buy training or, at the very least, the means to buy or rent a home. It was carelessly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/may/24/child-trust-funds-scrapped\" title=\"\">scrapped by the coalition</a>. Same story with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/25/education-maintenance-allowance\" title=\"\">education maintenance allowance</a>. Housing allowance for the young is soon to go as well. Yeovil's young men and women are trapped both geographically and socially, while the firms that might employ them are no less stymied.</p> <p>Doubtless, some teacher in a Yeovil school might have dissuaded a bright student not \"to reach for the stars\", but most are only too anxious to spot and coach young talent. It is what makes the job worthwhile. But Britain's teachers operate in the most socially polarised schools in the world, according to the OECD. The great liberal thinkers \u2013 Green, Hobhouse, Keynes and Beveridge \u2013 who wrestled with how to create a social liberalism that offered opportunity alongside capitalism would never have singled out uninspirational teachers as the cause of falling social mobility. Neither should their successors today.</p>",
  "<p>A provocative new theory of history which has won influential support from Bill Gates poses the latest challenge to the coalition government plans to return to a traditional school curriculum.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bighistoryproject.com/\" title=\"\">Big History</a>, a movement spearheaded by the Oxford-educated maverick historian David Christian, is based on the idea that the academic study of the past can no longer be carried out from a nationalist perspective. Christian and his acolytes argue that the discipline will progress only once it charts human activity with a global scope, looking at chains of cause and effect that do not respect national borders. On a Big History course, the species <em>Homo sapiens </em>is not even mentioned until more than halfway through.</p> <p>\"I believe human beings mark a threshold in the development of the planet, of course,\" Christian has explained, \"but it is only part of the picture. What Big History can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power, with collective learning.\"</p> <p>The 66-year-old American-born academic is now a professor at San Diego State University after a long period teaching in Sydney, Australia. Originally an expert on Russia and the Soviet Union, Christian has been determined since the late 1980s to try to teach history on the largest possible scale and has become a popular speaker on the subject.</p> <p>Fans of Big History want to put geology and the climate at the centre of the subject, alongside other branches of science and technology. They believe it is essential to show that the course of human life has been altered by both natural and manmade factors. So Big History emphasises the significance of the fact that 4.6bn years ago an exploding star created a crust for the planet that contained 5% of iron. As a result, the metal has helped humanity to kill prey and forge weapons.</p> <p>Last year an education project was launched jointly in Australia and America, founded by Gates, the philanthropist and chairman of Microsoft. \"The Big History Project began a few years ago after I took an online version of the college-level Big History course,\" Gates has said. \"I really like how the course challenges students to wrestle with big questions \u2013 questions like how different timescales affect our perspective on history, how language transformed humanity, and what it means to be human.\"</p> <p>After Christian and Gates met, they set up a free online version of the Big History course targeting US and Australian high schools, funded by Gates's charitable organisation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p> <p>Gates also <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/david_christian_big_history.html\" title=\"\">presented Christian at the TED 2011 conference in Long Beach</a>, California. The aim of the new course is not just to alter the focus of history teaching, but to build a shared global discipline so that children can learn about the same connections. The curriculum has been also picked up by schools in Canada and Scotland. Since the summer, three south Ayrshire schools \u2013 Ayr Academy, Kyle Academy and Marr College \u2013 have been working with schools in Australia and America to pilot the free online curriculum, with the aim of making the courses widely available from August next year.</p> <p>Christian's theories, which are almost opposite those of education secretary Michael Gove, will come to prominence in Britain next month when the History Channel screens a 12-hour documentary called <em>Mankind, The Story of All of Us</em>. Filmed over two-and-a-half years, it hopes to draw in new audiences by revealing surprising facts, rather in the manner of BBC2's <em>QI;</em> the UK version of the series, which starts on 14 November, will be presented by Stephen Fry.</p> <p>Ben Goold, the British executive producer of <em>Mankind</em>, believes the series will prove that history is relevant to ordinary lives and rid the subject of its more dusty associations, with long lists of dates and kings and queens: \"Today everybody acknowledges we live in a connected world because of the internet, but when you look back in time you see we have always been connected really.\" who made Sky's seven-part epic <em>The British</em>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2012. The original said that the UK version of <em>Mankind, The Story of All of Us</em> starts on 13 November rather than 14 November. The US version starts on 13 November. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>When the Art Deco doors of Claridge's hotel reopened to the world's well-to-do in 1929 \u2013 oblivious to the looming Great Depression \u2013 they revealed a refurbishment that set the gold standard for Mayfair luxury which endures to this day.</p> <p>Afternoon tea is still served in four sittings from 3pm in the hotel's mirrored foyer, attracting a cast of characters who would not look out of place in a PG Wodehouse tale. Cucumber sandwiches and Earl Grey are consumed, as ever they were, over chatter and clinking china to the strains of light piano melodies.</p> <p>Behind the genteel nostalgia, however, the last two years have placed Claridge's at the centre of one of the most poisonous and unedifying scrambles for control of a London landmark in modern times.</p> <p>In a bygone era, such a disagreement might have been settled over cigars in the hotel's Fumoir bar, but this 21st century clash has played out in the high court, racking up legal bills estimated to be in excess of \u00a325m.</p> <p>At the centre of the spat is Irish property tycoon Paddy McKillen, a usually low-profile investor best known for some hotel co-investments in Dublin with U2 band members Bono and The Edge. In 2004 he and fellow property speculator Derek Quinlan led a consortium of Irish investors who took on colossal loans to acquire the Savoy Group. The business comprised four of London's most prestigious five-star hotels: Claridge's, the Savoy, the Berkeley and the Connaught. After the quick sale of the Savoy, the business was renamed Maybourne; its holding company was Coroin.</p> <p>Today McKillen cuts an isolated figure, despite holding just over a third of Coroin's shares. He is the last man holding out against surrendering control to Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, already owners of the nearby Ritz hotel.</p> <p>The septuagenarian twins, who also own the <em>Telegraph</em> newspaper titles, have long coveted Claridge's, and now Coroin is poised to fall into their grasp. Rearguard court actions by McKillen, alleging that illegal means were used by the Barclays to secure creeping control over the holding company, have failed. An appeal application remains outstanding, but it feels to many concerned that the end of this bitter saga is fast approaching.</p> <p>An increasingly inevitable-looking denouement \u2013 which may start to play out as early as this week \u2013 is likely to seal the brothers' hard-fought victory over rival investors who have been circling the luxury hotel group ever since its leading shareholders turned against one another in 2010 and the business began to hurtle towards a debt crisis.</p> <p>Coroin's towering debts of \u00a3660m fall due for repayment on Wednesday and without a major injection of capital, the company does not appear to have the capacity to meet that deadline. The loans are owned by the Barclay brothers, leaving them in a powerful position.</p> <p>Among those whom the Barclays appear to have outsmarted are Qatar's ruling Al Thani family and Manchester City FC owner Sheikh Mansour, both of whom had looked seriously at seizing control of the five-star hotels \u2013 well established as favoured haunts for super-rich Middle Eastern visitors. To a lesser degree, others who spied an opportunity to prosper from the pandemonium at Coroin included Mayfair financial engineer Robert Tchenguiz and Malaysian tycoon Jho Low.</p> <p>On their behalf and others', attempts were made to navigate the toxic mix of feuding shareholders and distressed debt. Efforts to force a breakthrough came from advisers at Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Lazard as well as Middle Eastern deal broker Amanda Staveley and even former PM Tony Blair. None was able to pull off a decisive deal.</p> <p>On occasion the feuding bordered on farce. In one submission to the court, McKillen recalled how he believed he had deliberately been made to feel awkward during a difficult meeting with Sir Frederick Barclay at the Ritz.</p> <p>\"I specifically remember \u2026 the concierge introduced me to Sir Frederick. However, he initially ignored me and instead asked the concierge why I had been allowed to enter the hotel without wearing a tie. I thought this was a joke: however, Sir Frederick continued to reprimand the concierge ... I felt he intended to cause me embarrassment.\"</p> <p>McKillen's ire stemmed from what appeared to him to be an illegal alliance forged by his old friend Quinlan with the Barclays early last year. Quinlan, a former Dublin tax inspector who had, in better times, transformed himself into one of Europe's most acquisitive property barons, was all but bankrupt. Years ago, he had pledged his one-third stake in Coroin and other assets as collateral for loans from fallen Irish banks. Following the 2008 banking crisis, these loans passed to Nama, Ireland's state-owned toxic loan agency.</p> <p>Cleverly, the Barclay brothers had persuaded Quinlan to enter into a series of agreements that gave them effective control of his stake in Coroin without actually formally buying it from him. For good measure, the brothers went on to buy from Nama the debts against which Quinlan's Coroin shares had been put up as security.</p> <p>This enraged McKillen. Not only did it kill a rescue deal he was trying to advance with the Al Thanis, but was, he claimed, in breach of an agreement between Coroin's original shareholders.</p> <p>The agreement had been designed to bind investors in a common purpose, eliminating suspicion that they might betray one another. Central to it was an undertaking not to sell shares without first offering fellow consortium members the opportunity to buy them. This provision, known as pre-emption rights, was intended to remove the threat of one shareholder, or an outside party, taking a majority interest.</p> <p>At about the same time as striking a deal with Quinlan, the Barclays also snapped up a second holding in Coroin of close to one third, buying out the family interests of wealthy Irishman Peter Green. Pre-emption rights were not triggered as they bought a Cypriot investment vehicle that owned the shares, rather than the shares themselves.</p> <p>McKillen was incandescent with rage and took to the courts. Over several months, evidence spilled out detailing the minutiae of the dealings between the Barclays and Quinlan. Lawyers for the Barclays admitted the twins had effectively started to bankroll the financially distressed Quinlan from late 2010, handing out loans to pay off a tax bill and funding a very comfortable life for the Irishman and his family in Putney, west London.</p> <p>\"My brother and I deeply resent the suggestion that we have been party to an unlawful conspiracy,\" Sir Frederick said in a witness statement, noting that his family had long been friendly with the Quinlans. \"Helping the Quinlan family in their time of need was something that I will never regret and I would not hesitate to do it again if necessary, regardless of anything to do with Coroin, which is irrelevant to how I feel on this issue.\"</p> <p>Hitting back at the behaviour of McKillen, Sir Frederick's statement recalled one telephone row. \"He began with a barrage of what I can only describe as foul-mouthed abuse about Mr Quinlan, calling him a fat so-and-so and using a stream of four-letter words about him&#xa0;\u2026 I do not like or tolerate swearing. I was not going to listen to Mr McKillen's rantings and I cut off the call.\"</p> <p>McKillen's lawyers invited the court to make much of the notoriously private brothers' decision not to attend court and face cross-examination. Living in Monaco and a in castle on their private Channel Island of Brecqhou, the Barclays are rarely photographed and are said to fear kidnapping.</p> <p>McKillen's legal team also sought to draw dark inferences over deleted text messages, emails sent indirectly through the accounts of Barclay relatives, and a partially destroyed laptop belonging to Richard Faber, a senior executive in the family business and Sir Frederick's former son-in-law. But the Barclays' lawyers insist no relevant material was lost or withheld \u2013 and Mr Justice David Richards concurred in a 158-page judgment handed down in August. McKillen might not have liked the Barclays' tactics, but the twins had not broken the law.</p> <p>The courtroom also provided a forum for the brothers' legal team to do a bit of mud-slinging of their own. \"It is a striking feature of this case that Mr McKillen should be alleging impropriety in others&#xa0;\u2026 where he has acted in the same manner or worse,\" suggested the Barclays' counsel, Kenneth MacLean QC.</p> <p>MacLean painted a picture of McKillen, Quinlan and their original consortium as prodigals \"riding a wave of cheap and easy Irish credit\" when in 2004 they stunned the property world by outbidding Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia to win control of Claridge's and the other hotels. In truth, MacLean went on, McKillen's financial position had been almost as dire as that of Quinlan. His business interests had only avoided falling to Nama after a closely fought court battle in Dublin.</p> <p>MacLean told the court that McKillen's determination to secure a lucrative outcome for himself \"would make avarice itself blush\".</p> <p>However hard-fought the Barclays' battle had been for dominance of Coroin's share register, this was only half the war. The destiny of the company, all agreed, was likely to turn on the decision over Coroin's unsustainable debts of \u00a3660m. These borrowings had been in Nama for some time and throughout much of last year the Barclays and rival predators circling Coroin had been in discussions about buying up the debt. Judge Richards later stressed this was \"the single most significant factor\" bearing on Coroin's future.</p> <p>But such a debt purchase presented a major problem. Valuations suggested the business simply could not support this level of indebtedness: \u00a3450m to \u00a3500m, perhaps, but nothing close to \u00a3660m. Yet Nama would not sell for a penny less.</p> <p>The Barclays knew last June that they could get a loan from Barclays bank for \u00a3660m, but only if Sir Frederick and Sir David were able to provide \u00a3260m of personal guarantees. An internal memo from the Barclays camp two months later said: \"The simple truth is the current [share] register when combined with an overindebtedness to the tune of \u00a3160-200m make the refinancing impossible, especially as the banking market moves against us by the day.\"</p> <p>By mid-September, however, such defeatism had abruptly evaporated. Barclays bank had loaned the twins the full \u00a3660m after the required personal guarantees had been given. What triggered this surprise breakthrough remains a private matter and was not explored in court. As a result, however, the brothers took control of Coroin's borrowings \u2013 the last piece of the puzzle required to bid for total control of the group.</p> <p>That debt was due for repayment at the end of last month but the Barclays have extended the deadline until Wednesday of this week. Whether or not they choose to delay once again remains to be seen. Sooner rather than later, however, they are likely to be popping champagne corks in triumph. Barring a successful appeal from McKillen, the only question will be in which hotel Sir Frederick and Sir David choose to celebrate their victory.</p>",

Tech companies' success often depends on the skills of their development team. This is why both tech startups and large technology-dependent enterprises are desperate to find experienced, highly skilled software professionals. Every day, we are asked by tech startups how and where they can find good people. Our jobs board at Skills Matter is absolutely packed with vacancies advertising 'cool' projects and teams, begging people to join them.</p> <p>\"The government can help in a number of ways. Provide tech companies with funding or tax breaks to fund training in advanced technology. And relax immigration rules for the highly skilled. In the meantime, we should provide the next generation with actual programming skills (as opposed to MS Office skills) very early on \u2013 by supporting initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Computing at School</a> and <a href=\"http://appsforgood.org/\" title=\"\">Apps for Good</a>, so that in 10 years' time, we'll be in a better position.\"</p> <h2><strong>Joe Cohen</strong></h2> <p>Founder and chief executive of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.seatwave.com/\" title=\"\">Seatwave</a></p> <p><strong>\"Make all of London Tech City\"</strong></p> <p>\"The government focuses on publicising Old Street and the Olympic Park \u2013 but so far the winners are all over&#xa0;London. Betfair are in Hammersmith, Spotify are in Soho, Wonga are located in Camden and Skype in Fitzrovia. Whether it's promoting London or east London [as a tech hub], from a PR point of view, wouldn't make that much difference. If you look at what's going on around Old Street, while there are certainly some success stories, you have companies at an earlier stage with a higher probability of failure.</p> <p>\"Why wouldn't you just claim the winners, wherever they are in London? History may prove me wrong when Crossrail is finished and maybe the Olympic Park [will] become a really popular place. But until that happens, I can't imagine you'll have many people who'll move into that space of their own free will, without the government twisting their arms.</p> <p>\"Broadband provisioning is also a major issue. It's amazing to me, because you would just think that market forces would solve this \u2013 but it doesn't seem to be happening.

I think lionising entrepreneurs is a good thing \u2013 having educators and officials who recognise the value and importance of entrepreneurs in society. There are parts of the world where entrepreneurs are looked up to much more than here. I read about an entrepreneur here who said when he tells people he's an entrepreneur, they&#xa0;feel sorry for him, as if he can't get&#xa0;a real job. That shouldn't be the case.</p> <p>\"[Tech] is the next industrial revolution and these people are the pioneers. This is what the country needs. You can't continue to rely on natural resources, traditional goods and insurance companies for growth and job creation. Schools and universities need to do more to promote entrepreneurship as a lifestyle, a career and an ethic. They need to make sure that all children are given access to great education in maths and science and engineering so we don't end up with a lopsided employment pool.

The way to think of London is the way you think of financial services markets in offshoot countries. Singapore and Hong Kong are vibrant markets in Asia. However, they are markets that are subservient to the two global markets that really matter in finance \u2013 New York and London. [In tech terms] London has a very good shot at becoming an offshoot market. Really what the government should be focused on is how we work in harmony with Silicon Valley. A lot of that is bridge-building between those two economies and they've not done a good job there so far.</p> <p>\"The best parallel for success, if you take this thesis, is New York. New York was by and large a nonexistent tech centre, and then a few things happened that made a material difference. One was Google set up an engineering centre. One of the best ways to bridge is exactly what New York did \u2013 get a company that is out on the west coast to open up not a sales office but an engineering centre&#xa0;here.&#xa0;The&#xa0;government needs to spend a lot of&#xa0;energy doing this, because without that depth of managerial and engineering talent, you will not get big companies in your&#xa0;backyard.\" </p> <h2><strong>Stephen Ball</strong></h2> <p>General manager of Hitachi Data Systems UK</p> <p><strong>\"Develop the next generation of coders\"</strong></p> <p>\"We all heard the prime minister's speech, but the reality is I don't know what Tech City is.

Traditionally a lot of companies head to&#xa0;Silicon Valley for the large, later-stage investment, because that investment is there. Equally, when you want to float you still head to New York. Two things need to be done. The first is happening slowly anyway, which is educating the market itself. Second, the&#xa0;rules and regulations around floating are considerably more&#xa0;onerous and difficult to go through here.</p> <p>\"I've seen several companies abandon float plans in London and shift them to the Nasdaq [in New York] because of it. The government is working on that, but more needs to be done. Much more also needs to be done with government procurement. When I spoke at the launch [of Tech City], I talked about trying to build a booking system for sport. It took two years and we're finally working very closely with Sport England \u2013 and they&#xa0;wouldn't have worked with us until the government said: 'You have to work with some startups.'

It is located just west of Silicon Roundabout \u2013 an area sprinkled with fashion boutiques, up-and-coming and more established designers, and unique cafes selling vintage clothing and strong espresso to budding tech entrepreneurs.</p> <p>\"That inspiring setting is partly because of the government's effort in encouraging large digital companies such as Google, entrepreneurs and investors to set up shop in Tech City. The government was smart to see that as one of the keys to the success of Silicon Valley, but they should be looking at this as just one initiative among many to make London a global centre of tech. Additional priorities include education programmes that encourage young Brits to pursue careers as entrepreneurs, engineers and designers. Organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.princes-trust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Prince's Trust</a> are getting this kickstarted, but they could use help.

  "<p><strong>Is the UCI calling on Lance Armstrong to hand back his $3m prize money an empty gesture?</strong></p> <p>The International Cycling Union did not go into detail about whether the governing body would take any legal action against Armstrong or what its next steps might be. Given that the president, Pat McQuaid, has already said that Armstrong should be forgotten and cast from the sport, it is hard to see what leverage they have over the Texan should he refuse to hand back his prize money. Armstrong's more immediate concern will be SCA's efforts to recover the \u00a36.9m bonus it paid out in 2005 after Armstrong took the prize money insurance company to a tribunal over its refusal to forward the money. Success for SCA could open the floodgates for other sponsors to make claims on Armstrong.</p> <p><strong>How independent will the UCI tribunal be?</strong></p> <p>The key question. In 2005, when <em>L'Equipe</em> published \"The Armstrong Lie\", a revelatory report on a French Anti-Doping Laboratory research project to re-test six samples from the 1999 Tour that linked the Texan to EPO use, the UCI responded to pressure from the International Olympic Committee and World Anti-Doping Agency and launched an independent investigation. Headed by the Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman, his report concentrated on the extent to which the French lab had followed the correct protocol at the expense of whether it could be used to corroborate other evidence and was criticised by Wada. To some, it appeared to be more an attempt to knock down the evidence than to get to the truth. The new commission must be the opposite \u2013 wide-ranging in its remit and with the power to make recommendations in the knowledge they will be acted upon. The composition of the panel will be crucial. The British Cycling president, Brian Cookson, a member of the UCI committee, insisted they were \"unanimous in our determination that this independent commission will just be the start of the process and nothing will be off the agenda \u2013cycling must and will learn the lessons of the Armstrong era.\"</p> <p>The commission, to be appointed by an independent sports body, must translate those words into action. In addition to looking at how to clean up the sport and rebuild its reputation, it must also examine the claims made by Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton, and fervently denied by the UCI, that $100,000 donated by Armstrong was tied to a cover-up of suspicious tests.</p> <p><strong>Why has the UCI taken this action now?</strong></p> <p>There is a disparity between the tone of some of the defensive material posted on the UCI website on Monday when they agreed to ratify the United States Anti-Doping Agency's damning report and the more strident measures revealed on Friday. Without the need to defend the reputations of McQuaid and the honorary president, Hein Verbruggen it may be that the UCI recognised the need to go further. Partly, it was a response to pressure from within the sport. The International Association of Professional Cycling Teams and Association of Professional Cyclists called for independent reviews.</p> <p>Yet a nagging suspicion remains that the UCI was only bowing to pressure. McQuaid almost said as much. \"We have listened to the world's reaction to the Lance Armstrong affair and have taken these additional decisive steps in response to the grave concerns raised.\" They will have to prove that the measures are more than an attempt to buy some time.</p> <p><strong>Why has no one resigned? </strong></p> <p>There have been loud calls for McQuaid and Verbruggen to step aside if the sport is to move on but they have foundered. As with other global sporting bodies, personal loyalties still appear to count for much and the pair feel they have done nothing wrong. Both will almost certainly remain in post until the commission reports next year, but that will not ease the pressure on them in the meantime.</p> <p>McQuaid feels he has not been granted enough credit for the steps that cycling has taken to combat doping \u2013 from introducing biological passports to developing new testing techniques. He makes a distinction between the pre-2005 era \u2013 before he became president during which Armstrong won his seven Tour de France titles, now made void from the record books \u2013 and the seven years since.</p> <p>Not only does the Usada report contain compelling evidence that Armstrong was doping on his comeback in 2009 but McQuaid has other questions to answer about the extent to which the UCI failed to consider evidence not based on analytical findings, such as riders' testimony.</p> <p><strong>Why have the UCI suspended their legal action against the former Sunday Times writer Paul Kimmage?</strong></p> <p>This, too, seems to chip away at McQuaid's personal authority. On Monday, he said continuing the action was a \"straightforward defamation case\" unrelated to the Armstrong affair, only to \"suspend\" it on Friday. Yet the independent commission will look into the very claims that McQuaid, Verbruggen and the UCI had sued over. The case was due to be heard in Switzerland in December and supporters of Kimmage's position had already contributed $83,000 (\u00a351,000) to a fighting fund. Suspending the action was the only sensible course of action if the UCI wanted their claim that the commission would have free rein to investigate all allegations against it to have any credibility.</p>",

  "<p>The Manchester United vice-chairman responsible for attaching the club's brand to everything from noodles to outboard motors, turbocharging their revenues in the process, has made the United States their new No1 target. Ed Woodward said that a number of factors had come together to make the US the club's priority for expansion as it prepares to open a New York office and hold a number of \"fan parties\" across North America.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Premier League's auction for US live coverage from 2013-14 has gone to a second round of bidding and is expected to be decided early next week. According to US media reports, NBC appears to have gazumped both Fox and ESPN by offering $85m for the rights over three seasons, a four-fold increase on the existing contract.</p> <p>Since the Glazer family bought the club they have faced trenchant criticism for loading United with debts that currently stand at \u00a3360m and spending upwards of \u00a3500m on interest payments and financial charges, leading to complaints of underinvestment on the pitch.</p> <p>Off it Woodward has overseen the growth of a London-based sales unit from imposing wood-panelled offices designed to impress potential clients, which has increased commercial income to \u00a3117.6m a year and necessitated the recent launch of a Hong Kong office. He claimed the popularity of the 2010 World Cup, the David Beckham effect at LA Galaxy, the grassroots popularity of the sport, threats of lockouts in other sports and soccer's improved commercial standing had come together to create a huge opportunity.</p> <p>\"We've seen amazing growth in India, China is still a massive opportunity but the US is becoming the No1 opportunity for us,\" said Woodward. \"The Glazers didn't buy the club because they saw the US as a big soccer market; they saw it as a niche sport there. But something changed in the last two years.\"</p> <p>The New York office will seek to replicate the strategy being followed in Asia and elsewhere, of hiving off some of its global sponsorship categories \u2013 of which the club has identified 90 \u2013 to sell on a regional basis.</p> <p>\"To take mobile operators as an example, instead of doing a deal with Vodafone for a few million, we're in 44 countries with a \u00a321m guarantee and now we're moving to others,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We're now doing credit cards \u2013 we're in 16 countries. We're doing soft drinks. We look at companies that don't exist outside their territories or where decisions are made at a regional level. You get more money, there's no dilution and they market us more in those territories. We're not even at base camp. The rate limiting factor is resource,\" he told the Observer.</p> <p>He said the club's new shirt sponsorship deal with Chevrolet, worth $559m (\u00a3347m) over nine years from July 2014, would also help open doors in America. A new media strategy should boost revenues and fan engagement across the world but particularly in the States.</p> <p>\"We're not going to do it quick and wrong, we're going to do it right. We're developing this digital strategy \u2013 behind the scenes stuff, player access, highlights \u2013 it doesn't matter how you consume it. It will be crossing over with membership \u2013 community, merchandising opportunities. And we will know you. We believe the US will be one of the key markets it will take off in,\" said Woodward.</p> <p>He will sit down with Nike in February to renegotiate its contract with the US sportswear giant, in a deal that could be worth as much as \u00a31bn over 15 years. Last week the club bought out their \u00a340m training kit deal with DHL early because they are convinced they can improve on the terms. Whether all of that will be enough to appease Manchester United fans who feel that the Glazers' leveraged business model has not only sucked hundreds of millions of pounds out of the club but is increasingly predicated on valuing global growth over matchday fans is open to question.</p> <p>Woodward admitted the recent share launch on the New York Stock Exchange \u2013 and return some of the money to the Glazers \u2013 had been a \"distraction\" but defended it despite the fact the shares have fallen below the offer price, itself lower than initially hoped. He said that, given rising commercial income, even after interest payments and tax the club would have \u00a360m of free cashflow per year that could be used to buy players, pay off debt or improve the stadium.</p> <p>He said Sir Alex Ferguson had never been refused transfer funds for any player, while maintaining that a net transfer outlay of around \u00a325m a year would be enough to continue to compete \u2013 particularly once the financial fair play rules start to bite. \"Are you going to force Sir Alex's arm on a player? I don't know how you'd make him spend more on players. If it [United] was still a plc, every single player would still be the same and you'd probably have higher dividends. He wouldn't have bought any other players.\"</p> <p>But for all the complex financial modelling and rapid expansion of its commercial footprint, there is one thing he admits the club can't plan for \u2013 the timing of Ferguson's departure.</p> <p>\"A plan has been thought through as regards the type of person and the process and it's in a drawer. There is no ongoing conversation,\" Woodward said.</p>",
  "<p>The prospect of playing the top three countries in the world rankings in consecutive weeks, even with home advantage, is daunting for any team, never mind one such as England, who have spent less than a year together and whose most experienced players are confined to club duty, but the 2015 World Cup hosts are relishing the opportunity rather than trotting out old cliches such as performances being more important than results.</p> <p>This time, the results are vital. After the major European nations have finished their international campaigns at the beginning of December, the draw for the World Cup groups will be made. Those who are in the top four of the world rankings will avoid each other, and England go into their four-match campaign in fourth place.</p> <p>The last time England defeated New Zealand, Australia and South Africa in an autumn series was in 2002, a period when the men in white were the best team in the world. Even then, they subdued the Wallabies by a point and a penalty goal was the difference against New Zealand. South Africa, a man light from before the end of the first quarter, collapsed ignominiously and the three scorelines showed how potent England then were: 31-28, 32-31 and 53-3.</p> <p>It is attack that England will be focusing on next month, starting with Fiji in the series opener. By fielding their strongest side, England plan to be rust-free when they take on Australia the following weekend. When Stuart Lancaster took over as head coach at the end of last year, aided by Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree, they had to sift through the rubble of the 2011 World Cup campaign and England started the Six Nations cautiously.</p> <p>\"We are playing a brand of rugby that is expansive, energetic and attacking,\" Rowntree, the forwards coach, says. \"We are a young group and we want the guys to go out there and enjoy themselves; I would hate us to be inhibited by the fear of failure. You have to be defeating these big teams coming over at the end of their season: they keep beating us when we go over there at the end of our season.</p> <p>\"We learned in South Africa in the summer the value of playing in the right areas and applying pressure and we will see exactly how much in the coming weeks. I am always positive as a coach but I am a realist and the players will know what is coming. They will be ready.\"</p> <p>England's record against the southern hemisphere big three is considerably better than those of the other home unions, but they have lost their past nine games against the All Blacks and last June's draw in Port Elizabeth ended a run of nine consecutive defeats against South Africa. Between 2000 and the 2003 World Cup final, England played the Sanzar unions 12 times, winning every match. Since then, they have won six out of 32.</p> <p>\"We aim to win all four of the Tests,\" says Farrell, who is coaching the backs along with Mike Catt. \"It would be accepting defeat to say our goal was to get three victories. I would say that New Zealand are the top team in world sport at the moment and to beat them would send out a tremendous message. They will challenge us in all departments and the teams we play all pose different threats; we have to be smart enough to tackle all four, changing and adapting. We feel we can handle them all and it does not get much better when you are fourth in the rankings to have the top three coming over.\"</p> <p>Catt, a 2003 World Cup winner, has been charged with firing England's back division and the emergence of players such as Jonathan Joseph and Alex Goode has enhanced the permutations behind the scrum. Catt the player was someone who trusted his instincts and reacted to the changing flow of a game, qualities he wants the players to show next month when they will be tested to the full.</p> <p>\"This group of players has the ability to emulate what England achieved in 2003,\" Catt says. \"We have got them at a young age and they proved in South Africa that they have the mental ability to handle a hostile environment. When you look at the guys coming through, the future is very bright. What we as coaches have to ensure is that the players understand the game and that we play to their strengths.</p> <p>\"It is about seeing the game and what is happening in it, living in the moment and being able to adapt to what is in front of them. The keywords are pace, tempo and variety; we have to get on the front foot and have accuracy in everything from rucking to distribution. The reason New Zealand are so good is that they are accurate. We need to make sure that guys like Manu Tuilagi have freedom on the ball and support runners for off-loading. We have the players to move on our attacking game.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the pouring rain in the middle of a Suffolk wood, Mike Ryder pats the trunk of a dripping ash, bending and snapping its branches to show how a slow death is creeping through the tree.</p> <p>\"They might want us to fell it, or burn it where it stands. We don't know what will happen, we're just waiting to be told,\" he said. \"It's frustrating and you feel quite helpless. It's just about watching it happening: there's nothing you can do. This is all ancient woodland around here and ash is the most dominant species \u2013 around 40% is ash. So it's going to change the landscape beyond recognition, that's for sure.\"</p> <p>Ryder, the Woodland Trust's forestry manager for Norfolk and Suffolk, said the discovery of \"ash dieback\" in Britain was a wake-up call for tighter restrictions on the importing of plants. \"There's been a wave of new pests and pathogens and they are slipping through our borders only too easily.\"</p> <p>This weekend Forestry Commission officials have found more than 20 sites in East Anglia where ash trees are now infected with the <em>Chalara fraxinea </em>fungus, which causes ash dieback. The UK is now braced to lose the vast majority of its 80 million ash trees, a native species which accounts for up to 30% of tree cover and hedgerows.</p> <p>The disaster facing the ash tree is a warning that Britain needs to tighten its biosecurity, say campaigners who criticise what they claim is a \"far too little too late\" response from the government.</p> <p>But Joan Webber, principal pathologist at the Forestry Commission's forest research centre, said there had been a great deal of ambiguity around ash dieback. \"How it works \u2013 how its spores travel \u2013 are all still things just emerging from research. I'm pretty sceptical about the distance it can travel airborne, for example. Hindsight is a great thing, but the fact is this is a very new and complicated situation.\"</p> <p>The president of the Country Land and Business Association, Harry Cotterell, said Britain faced a tragedy. The ash was \"one of our iconic native species\", second only to the oak as the best-known tree in the British countryside, he said, adding: \"If the ash stock in the countryside is devastated, it will be a national tragedy.</p> <p>\"I think this is a call to arms for the [whole] country \u2013 because they demonstrated, when the forest selloff was proposed, that they really love their woodland, and this is a really huge threat.\"</p> <p>Cotterell criticised the government for not issuing earlier warnings about the disease. \"It's a great pity that we weren't told about it until two or three weeks ago, whereas it clearly had been discovered in nursery stock and young trees in the spring. I think we could have started looking for it \u2013 the real concern is to find out the true extent of it.\"</p> <p>Ash dieback was first identified in the UK in February, in young plantings and nursery stock. Ryder at the Woodland Trust said he found the disease in mature native woodland in August. But it was only last Wednesday that official confirmation came from the government that the disease had spread beyond plantations and nurseries into Norfolk and Suffolk's mature trees. On Thursday the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, told the Commons that a ban on imports would start tomorrow.</p> <p>He defended the government by suggesting the outbreak in East Anglia could have resulted from spores being carried naturally into the UK. \"I think the real concern is that, geographically, it looks like the disease may have arrived into the wild on the wind,\" he said.</p> <p>Previously the fungus had only been thought to have been able to travel around 20km, but its appearance on the east coast may suggest otherwise.</p> <p>Paterson denied that the government had acted slowly since the disease was first detected in the UK in February, pointing out that more than 1,000 sites had already been checked and 50,000 young trees burned.</p> <p>But Jim Pratt, a retired Forestry Commission expert, said the authorities had been ignoring years of warnings before that, and that a ban on imports should have been made earlier. As a result, the government may be left open to compensation claims, he added.</p> <p>Pratt believes that a scaling-up of the response to ash dieback is urgent. He has called for plans to be made for the felling and storage of diseased ash.</p> <p>\"The unpalatable truth is that some large sums of money are needed, to be made available to individuals who, for reasons not of their making, find themselves obliged to destroy large and potentially dangerous trees which would not have become infected had the UK authorities accepted their responsibilities for evading this disease when it became such an obvious threat at least eight years ago,\" he said.</p> <p>The Woodland Trust is pushing for a tree passport scheme to be introduced to help monitor imports. Its chief executive, Sue Holden, called on Saturday for a summit to be held on how further diseases could be kept out of the UK.</p> <p>\"We are clearly pleased to see Owen Paterson finally taking action to introduce a ban on the import and movement of ash trees into the UK,\" Holden said. \"We also ask government scientists to give urgent and clear advice to all woodland owners on how to manage the disease. The trust will do all it can to mitigate spread in line with this government instruction and advice.\"</p> <p>But she added: \"Ash dieback is only one of numerous tree pests and diseases in the UK. With more than 15 separate pests and diseases listed on the Forestry Commission website as already present [in the UK], it is crucial that the wider issue is tackled. The government must set up an emergency summit bringing together representatives from all areas of forestry, plant health and conservation \u2013 because today it's ash, but tomorrow yet another of our precious native trees could be at risk.\"</p> <p>In Pound Farm Wood in Suffolk, Ryder is striding off through the rain to check the rest of his trees. He hopes that alongside the growing list of infected ash trees he might find one or two \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/disease-killing-denmarks-ash-trees\" title=\"\">as has happened in Denmark</a> \u2013 that show signs of resistance to the fungus and remain untouched even while the deadly plague wipes out the majority of the species.</p> <p>\"Other species will come in and fill the gaps \u2013 of course they will, that's how nature works \u2013 but some things won't come back: the flowers and insects that rely on ash and the light it lets through on to the forest floor,\" he said. \"It isn't the first disease, historically, to come into our forests from abroad \u2013 even if it will have a more significant impact on our wider environment than most. But we need significantly tighter controls on our borders if we want it to be the last.\"</p>",
  "<p>The number of woodland sites in the east of England found to be infected with deadly ash dieback has leapt to more than 20.</p> <p>The main concentration of cases of ash dieback \u2013 which has wiped out swaths of trees in the rest of Europe \u2013 are in mature ancient forests in East Anglia, along the coast where easterly winds arrive from Scandinavia. By Friday there were just two confirmed sites, but surveys have now turned up many more, the Forestry Commission said.</p> <p>\"The new cases will have to be confirmed by scientists, but it certainly looks as if there are more than 20 suspicious sites and we will continue to survey, although we really only have a one- or two-week window now to detect new cases before the autumn leaf drop makes it very difficult to see,\" said Stuart Burgess of the Forestry Commission.</p> <p>Ash, which makes up around 30% of all of the UK's tree cover, is a hugely valuable part of the country's natural ecosystem. The Forestry Commission and other forestry workers have been looking for the telltale signs of ash dieback since the disease was spotted in trees at two sites, one in Norfolk and one in Suffolk, this month.</p> <p>Environment minister, Owen Paterson, was accused of being \"asleep on the job\". He announced on Thursday that a ban on importing ash tree saplings into the UK will begin on Monday, but this may be too late to help save Britain's ancient woodlands from the fungus, which has been creeping across Europe from east to west for more than a decade.</p> <p>More than 90% of Denmark's ash trees have been affected, and Norway, the Netherlands and Germany have been very badly hit. In addition to warnings from scientists in those countries, ash dieback was found in British nursery tree stocks as far back as February. However, the government only opened a consultation into a possible import ban on ash trees from the rest of Europe this month.</p> <p>Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, responding to reports that a ban on ash tree imports will be introduced on Monday, said: \"Like the forest selloff fiasco, the government have been asleep on the job with ash dieback. They discovered the disease in a tree nursery in February but waited until it was found in the wild in August to consult on banning ash imports.</p> <p>\"The government also ignored the Forestry Commission's warning that there was no money to tackle tree disease and cut its cash by 25%, forcing seven offices to close and cutting 250 staff. You simply can't trust this incompetent Tory-led government with the nation's forests.\"</p> <p>Harry Cotterell, president of the Country Land and Business Association, warned that while the import ban was a step in the right direction, it might already be too late to stop the disease spreading.</p> <p>He said: \"We are very pleased to hear that the ban is going to be announced. I think the real concern is that geographically, it looks like the disease may have arrived on the wind.\"</p> <p>Asked if the ban could halt the pathogen, he replied: \"It may not. It depends on the extent to which we find the disease in the wild throughout the rest of the country.\"</p> <p>A new website, ashtag.org, and a smartphone app, will be launched on Monday to encourage the public to report trees showing symptoms.</p> <p>Paterson said: \"The plan is to bring in a ban on imports on Monday. It will now be illegal to bring in ash trees and move them around.\"</p> <p>Ash dieback, caused by a fungus called <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, was relatively unknown in the UK until this year. The threat increased this week when the first outbreaks recorded in natural environments on domestic soil were confirmed in East Anglia, where no recent plantings had taken place, and in woodland in Suffolk. The disease, which causes leaf loss and crown dieback, works particularly quickly on young plants, killing them within one growing season of symptoms becoming visible. Older trees can withstand the initial infection but tend to die after several seasons of attacks.</p> <p>Trees were found dying across Europe, including in forests, nurseries and urban areas, such as parks and gardens, after an outbreak in Poland in 1992, the first time the pathogen was recorded. The Commission is treating <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> as a quarantine pest under national emergency measures and is encouraging the public to report any suspected cases.</p> <p>Most experts now believe the UK is likely to lose a huge percentage of its 80 million ash trees, in a mirroring of the disastrous outbreak of Dutch elm disease in the 1970s and 1980s, which killed off 25 million mature trees.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 8 November. The main text said that 90% of trees in Denmark had been killed. This is incorrect and has been changed to \"affected\". </p>",

Happily, most voices agree that we have to follow a similar path, as was shown in the <a href=\"http://www.uncsd2012.org/\" title=\"\">Rio+20</a> conference held in Brazil. There, the international community suggested that new global goals should be set for the future, after 2015, combining poverty reduction targets with sustainable development concerns. This means that the architecture of the new global goals should be built in two pillars: reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development.</p> <p>My government supports this approach and we expect that the UN will embrace such a framework with enthusiasm and commitment.</p> <p>None the less, I also believe that the new global goals will fall short of what is expected of them if the international community cannot also agree on specific targets aimed at ensuring universal access to justice and reduction of extreme violence for vulnerable groups.</p> <p>My country, Guatemala, continues to suffer from multiple forms of violence and high levels of impunity. Based on our experience, I can affirm that extreme violence, insecurity and limited access to justice are factors that prevent development in general, and particularly ensure the continuation of poverty and social exclusion. Let me explain this.</p> <p>First, violence suffered by women, children and other vulnerable groups translates into impunity because a large proportion of people have limited or no access to justice. Impunity derived from low coverage and poor quality of justice is one of the major drivers of poverty (and intergenerational reproduction of poverty), because long exposure to a violent environment prevents otherwise perfectly healthy women and children gaining access to economic and social opportunities that may help them escape from the poverty trap.</p> <p>Second, violence reproduces violence itself. The vicious circle of violence and impunity transforms many vulnerable groups into agents that reproduce abuse and mistreatment from one generation to another.</p> <p>But a life without extreme violence is not just desirable, it is also possible. Actually, in my home country, we have demonstrated in the last three years \u2013 and particularly in the last 10 months of my administration \u2013 that fighting impunity and reducing murder is possible. Our homicide rate has reduced in a sustained manner and I can proudly say that we are not far from the day when there will not be a single homicide in one week.</p> <p>Allow me to be bold on this. Extreme violence and impunity are still too high in Guatemala by international standards. But if we can claim some progress even in these difficult circumstances, why can't the world set a goal that will allow thousands to live a life free of violence?</p> <p>The progress made in Guatemala would not have been possible without the support of the international community. The UN and bilateral co-operation have played the right role of strengthening the justice system and they have helped us particularly in enhancing the state's capacity for crime prosecution and crime prevention. This support, combined with the right national policies and national leadership, shows that a world free of extreme violence and with universal access to justice is desirable and possible.</p> <p>Women, children and other vulnerable groups deserve to live in a world without poverty, but they also deserve a world without extreme violence. Humanity can make a big jump towards living on a better planet if we set global development goals aimed at poverty reduction, protecting the environment, and reducing extreme violence.</p> <p>We should pass our children and grandchildren a planet that is free from want, free from extreme abuse and environmentally friendly. A planet where all people are treated in a dignified manner, no matter their country of birth, the colour of their skin, their sex or sexual preference, their age or their private wealth. A world that is, finally, free from fear.</p>",
  "<p>News that a fatal disease has landed on British soil understandably causes alarm. Today, the disease in question \u2013 <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> \u2013 threatens trees, not humans, but it's a sign of the esteem in which we hold our ash trees that the alarm bells have been so loud. This could be like Dutch elm disease all over again, an unstoppable plague that transforms the countryside.</p> <p>As someone who manages a 10-acre woodland in Somerset, I've always thought that <em>Fraxinus excelsior</em>, our native ash, is the most magnificent specimen in the woods. It's beautiful, with a smooth, honey-coloured bark and a clean, white wood. Its delicate, pinnate leaves let in the light and the tree is useful for almost anything: it's both strong and elastic, so we use it for making all sorts of furniture, anything from chairs to four-poster beds. Ash can be used to make snooker cues, tennis rackets, hockey sticks and oars. It's also the finest firewood: as the old saying goes, \"ash wet or ash dry, a king shall warm his slippers by\". In both Greek and Norse mythology humans were made from it. Odin was speared to an ash \u2013 the mythical Yggdrasil. Ash was used both for the symbolically important maypole and the Yule log.</p> <p>For the last three years, since we set up our woodland shelter for people in crisis, we've been thinning out the willow, hazel and hawthorn to give more space and light to our ashes. Believing the old planter's proverb \u2013 that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now, we've added 200 ashes in various clearings. We've protected the coppice against deer.</p> <p>So the news that they're now endangered fills me with melancholy and something close to fear: when you heat your house and your water with wood, ash is your oil. And when the ashes are the tallest trees in the woodland, they're your canopy, your roof. It's as if someone had told you that, pretty soon, your fuel will run out and your tiles will disintegrate.</p> <p>The government's reaction to the crisis has been flat-footed. A disease <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/disease-killing-denmarks-ash-trees\" title=\"\">that had affected 90% of the ash trees in Denmark</a> was first noticed here eight months ago: in Buckinghamshire, Leicester, Scotland, Yorkshire and County Durham. There were links to imported saplings. Last week was simply the first time the dreaded disease had been witnessed in mature trees rather than nursery stock.</p> <p>So for eight months nothing has happened. A ban should have been imposed on imported ash saplings immediately. Bear in mind that this pathogen was first discovered in Poland in 1992. It's not as if we haven't had time to act. It's the sylvan equivalent of knowing about HIV/Aids, but forgetting to advise about condoms.</p> <p>This is the umpteenth time the countryside has felt aggrieved by metropolitan policymakers. In recent years, the squires of the countryside have been dismayed by the ban on foxhunting, a piece of legislation which put wind in the Countryside Alliance's sails. They've been infuriated by politicians lacking the <em>cojones</em> to cull badgers and have also been appalled that their incomes are dwindling as costs rise. Milk prices are just the most recent example of hard-working farmers being screwed. Our bees are dying out, either because of the weather or the varroa mite. The cost of feeding our pigs has increased 25% in two years. Even urban visitors to the shires recognise that the government's idea of selling off a third of the Forestry Commission's 1.85m acres was barmy; and that cutting the commission's budget by 25% would drastically reduce its ability to combat this catastrophe.</p> <p>Rising fuel prices also affect rural areas unduly; mobile reception and broadband coverage is patchy; access to public transport and other services is often woeful. This year has also seen the worst harvest for a generation. It's understandable that rural residents feel hard done by.</p> <p>Our instinct is to blame politicians. Many feel our metropolitan MPs inevitably have a blind spot when it comes to the countryside. In a democracy in which 90% of the electorate live in urban areas, they're bound to. \"The countryside,\" says Jonathan Dimbleby, a former president of the <a href=\"http://www.cpre.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a>, \"is a second-level problem for politicians. Over the last 20 or 30 years they've concentrated so much on the urban environment that they only wake up to the countryside when it becomes a problem.\"</p> <p>Of course us agriculturalists will always moan. As the English humorist AP Herbert wrote:</p> <p><em>The Farmer will never be happy again;</em><br><em>He carries his heart in his boots;</em><br><em> For either the rain is destroying his grain</em><br><em>Or the drought is destroying his roots. </em></p> <p>If we're honest, we should be grateful for the huge subsidies and grants that have come our way in recent times. Our woodland is a tiny operation, but we have received a few thousand quid to create a 5,000-gallon pond, plant 450 trees and control Japanese knotweed.</p> <p>And yet anyone who lives in a rural area still feels there's something wrong in the representation of the countryside as somewhere to \"escape\" to. Television offers a deeply sentimentalised view of it, an idyll where stress is replaced by serenity. For most people it's not, then, a place of toil and blisters, but the backdrop for weekend recreation: it's where daytrippers go for walks, see birds, or shoot birds, enjoy stately homes and roaring fires. For most Brits, the countryside is a pleasurable museum, not a tough place to live.</p> <p>In other countries it's different. France has its mythical \"France <em>profonde</em>\", the deep soul of the nation that resists urban fashions. In Italy, Sicily was known as the \"granary of Rome\" and, even now, the country's beloved pasta is provided by native wheat fields. America has its corn belt and even elected a peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter, as president.</p> <p>In other nations it just seems as if rural labourers are a vital niche of the electorate. That, perhaps, is why no British politician that I can remember has ever spoken so clearly to the farming community as Eisenhower did when he said, parodying bureaucrats: \"Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil, and you're a thousand miles from the cornfield.\"</p> <p>The problem is perhaps historical: we were the first industrialised nation and our ancestors left the land in such large numbers that, even now, the terms \"agricultural\" or \"a bit village\" are easy insults. The idiot in any Shakespearean production always has a Somerset accent.</p> <p>Britain was the first global superpower, meaning that long before we became obsessive foodies, we already had exotic tastes for foreign foods and timbers. Sugar, tobacco, tea and mahogany became commonplace. The reason the UK imports 42% of its food isn't just because we're a crowded island, it's because we insist on eating what our climate can't accommodate.</p> <p>The result is a complete lack of connection between what's on our plates and what's in our fields. And I'll bet my fine breeding sow, Harriet, the chair you're sitting on to read this isn't made from native timber. If it's wooden at all, chances are it's from the forests of Russia or Poland that supply Ikea.</p> <p>We want everything to be cheap, whether it's furniture or milk. That's understandable, but there's a hidden cost. I remember when I was buying those 200 ash saplings, a woodsman warned me not to save a few quid by buying from a nursery that imported them from Hungary. \"Never know what might come in,\" he said, looking suspicious. At the time, I thought his comment was the woodland equivalent of racism, but I did as he advised. At a marginally increased cost, I bought all our saplings from a nursery that guaranteed British provenance.</p> <p>I assumed the woodsman was mildly ignorant. In fact, he was very wise \u2013 because it's absurd that we've been importing ash saplings when they regenerate so prolifically from our 18m UK specimens. From tomorrow, Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, will introduce a ban on imports, but it's far too late. The disease is here and spreading. Fifty thousand ashes have already been burnt. Shakespeare's \"blessed plot\" will soon, sadly, be a lot more bare.</p> <p><em>Tobias Jones is the warden of Windsor Hill Wood (</em><a href=\"http://windsorhillwood.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>windsorhillwood.co.uk</em></a><em>) </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 8 November. The main text said that 90% of trees in Denmark had been killed. This is incorrect and has been changed to \"affected\". </p>",
  "<p>A ban on imports of ash trees from Europe may not be enough to stop an epidemic of a deadly disease wiping out most of the species' 80m trees in the UK, the government has been warned.</p> <p>The president of the Country Land and Business Association, Harry Cotterell, said one of the best-loved features of the British landscape faces devastation due to the spread of the fungus <em>chalara fraxinea</em> into the wild, eight months after it was first discovered in the UK.</p> <p>Cotterell said the UK faced a \"national tragedy\" as ash trees make up 15%-30% of the wooded landscape, across woodlands, hedgerows and parks.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, told the Commons on Thursday that a ban would start on Monday in a bid to halt the disease, which has already killed 90% of ash trees in Denmark.</p> <p>On Wednesday, it was confirmed the disease had spread beyond plantations and nurseries into Norfolk and Suffolk. The find has raised fears of a repeat of the Dutch elm disease epidemic in the 1970s, which wiped out virtually the entire 25m-strong mature elm population by the 1990s.</p> <p>The impact of the ban would depend on how widely the disease had already spread in the wild, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I think the real concern is that geographically, it looks like the disease may have arrived into the wild on the wind.</p> <p>\"It has already have been discovered in at least 11 woods in Norfolk and Suffolk.\"</p> <p>The ash is \"one of our iconic native species\", second only to the oak as the best-known tree in the British countryside, said Cotterell.</p> <p>\"If the ash stock in the countryside is devastated, it will be a national tragedy.</p> <p>\"I think this is a call to arms for the country, because they demonstrated when the forest sell-off was proposed that they really love their woodland, and this is a really huge threat.\"</p> <p>While he welcomed the import ban, Cotterell criticised the government for not warning of the disease in the UK earlier.</p> <p>\"It's a great pity that we weren't told about it until two or three weeks ago, whereas it clearly had been discovered in nursery stock and young trees in the spring. I think we could have started looking for it \u2013 the real concern is to find out the true extent of it.\"</p> <p>The Woodland Trust has called for an emergency summit or taskforce to tackle tree diseases, before another species is lost for good.</p> <p>Its chief executive added: \"We would also urge the secretary of state to ban the movement of ash around the UK until the extent of ash dieback, and how it is spread, has been determined.</p> <p>\"We also ask government scientists to give urgent and clear advice to all woodland owners on how to manage the disease.</p> <p>\"The government must set up an emergency summit bringing together representatives from all areas of forestry, plant health and conservation because today it's ash but tomorrow yet another of our precious native trees could be at risk.\"</p> <p>The Forestry Commission is urging forest managers and tree professionals to use the information on its website about the disease, inspect trees again and report any suspected to be infected.</p> <p>As a precaution, the Commission is suspending the planting of ash trees in public forests it manages.</p> <p>The Horticultural Trades Association has already urged members to abide by a voluntary moratorium on importing ash trees for planting in this country.</p> <p>Paterson said that the import ban would be accompanied by strict movement restrictions on ash trees already in the country, to prevent the spread of the disease to unaffected areas of the country.</p> <p>He denied the government had acted slowly since the disease was first detected in the UK in February, pointing out that more than 1,000 sites had already been checked and 50,000 trees burnt.</p> <p>Commercial imports of ash trees do not begin until November each year, so the only possibility of infected plants reaching the country over the summer would be if individuals brought them back from nurseries on the continent in their cars, he said.</p> <p>He appealed for anyone who knows of small-scale imports of this kind to contact the authorities.</p>"
