  "<p>More children are surviving to their fifth birthday than ever before, but the world is not on course to get the death toll down to the level envisaged in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">millennium development goals</a> by 2015, according to a new report from Unicef.</p> <p>There has been considerable progress, said the children's emergency fund in its progress report, <a href=\"http://www.apromiserenewed.org/files/APR_Progress_Report_2012_final_web.pdf\" title=\"\">Committing to Child Survival: a promise renewed</a> (pdf). In 1990, there were 12 million deaths of young children, but the latest figures (from the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation) show that deaths had fallen by nearly half, to 6.9 million, by 2011.</p> <p>Geeta Rao Gupta, deputy executive director of Unicef, said: \"The story of child mortality is one of significant progress and unfinished business as well.\" Satisfaction in the gains had to be tempered by the reality that 19,000 children still die every day from largely preventable causes. \"We must give new energy to the global momentum to reduce under-five deaths.\"</p> <p>Executive director Anthony Lake said there were proven, affordable interventions. \"These lives could be saved with vaccines, adequate nutrition, and basic medical and maternal care,\" he said. \"The world has the technology and knowhow to do so. The challenge is to make these available to every child.\"</p> <p>Poor countries have been able to bring down their death rates as well as the richer ones, Unicef pointed out. Between 1990 and 2011, nine low-income countries \u2013 Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda \u2013 reduced their under-five mortality rate by 60% or more.</p> <p>Middle-income countries such as Brazil, Mongolia and Turkey, and high-income countries such as Oman and Portugal, have also made great progress, cutting deaths by more than two-thirds over the same period.</p> <p>The highest concentration of deaths is in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where 82% of all under-five deaths occurred in 2011. The proportion has grown steadily from 68% in 1990, as other countries have made faster progress. One in nine children in sub-Saharan Africa does not reach his or her fifth birthday.</p> <p>\"The growing breach between the rest of the world and sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia underscores the inequities that remain in child survival,\" says the report. It goes on to point out that those inequities can exist within countries. \"In 2011, about half of global under-five deaths occurred in just five countries: India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of [the] Congo, Pakistan and China. Four of these [all but DRC] are populous middle-income countries.\"</p> <p>The leading causes of child deaths are infections such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, which are worsened by malnutrition. Around four in 10 deaths are in babies less than a month old. The death of the mother also reduces a child's chances of survival.</p> <p>Commenting on the new figures, the UK government's international development minister Lynne Featherstone said, \"It is heartening to see a real reduction in these figures but it is shocking that children worldwide are still dying of preventable causes.</p> <p>\"This is why are we are committed to help immunise up to 250 million children in developing countries by 2015.</p> <p>\"We will strive to save the lives of at least 250,000 newborn babies by the same date and we are tackling big killers such as inadequate nutrition and poor water and sanitation. We will also save children's lives by improving the welfare of their mothers: by keeping more girls in school, by empowering women to decide when and if to have children, and by ensuring access to skilled care when they do.\"</p> <p>Unicef is calling for a new push on child survival. Since a meeting in June calling for action, more than 115 governments have signed a pledge to redouble their efforts, said Gupta. The strategy includes concentrating resources on countries and regions with the most child deaths, focusing on high-impact solutions such as investing in maternal healthcare and nutrition, and strengthening accountability.</p>",
  "<p>Chris Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya killed in an attack on the consulate in Benghazi, was the sort of diplomat that America can ill afford to lose. Deeply knowledgable after more than 20 years in the Arab world, and personable too, if anyone could start to reverse the deep suspicion in which America is held in the Arab world, it would be someone like him.</p> <p>That he met his end along with three others in Benghazi, the city that considered itself saved by Nato's bombardment, demonstrates how volatile allegiances in post revolutionary Libya are. If anyone doubts this, look what then happened to the vote parliament was due to take on a new prime minister. The pro-western candidate Mahmoud Jibril lost and Mustafa Abushagur, a candidate considered acceptable to both liberals and Islamists, won.</p> <p>If the circumstances of the firefight that led to the ambassador's death are unclear (there were conflicting reports last night about whether the attack was planned) the provenance of a grotesquely offensive film that depicts the prophet Muhammad as a feckless philanderer, which provoked the anti-US protests, was today equally murky.</p> <p>The film was attributed by US media reports to a man whom no one can now find any trace of. Indeed the original film may not have existed at all. A clip, dubbed in Arabic, was promoted by a virulent Islamophobe, Morris Sadik, an Egyptian Copt based in California, who campaigns for Egypt to be divided into five states and whose views are disowned by Christian Copts at home. The final poison of this toxic brew was added by the Florida pastor Terry Jones, who has a track record in inciting violence by burning the Qur'an.</p> <p>The whole episode may have been a grotesque provocation, of which all sides taking positions in this culture war should be wary.</p> <p>The revolutions in Libya and Egypt have represented \u2013 until now \u2013 a defeat for Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian-born doctor and ideologue behind Osama bin Laden's global terror campaign. His deadliest enemies are fellow Islamists \u2013 the proponents of non-violent political Islam who are now in power in Egypt and Tunisia and who are trying to lay the foundations of law-based democratic states.</p> <p>After a long period of hesitation, the US, Britain and France are about to invest heavily in the Egyptian presidency of Mohamed Morsi. The consulate attack came on the final day of a big US business delegation. Egypt is broke and in desperate need of foreign investment and both it and Libya remain highly volatile. They are critically vulnerable to grenades lobbed from afar, in this case from diaspora communities in California. It is clear where Egyptian and US interests of the type that Stevens was trying to forge lie. They lie in working together for a better future for the Arab world.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2012 because the original misnamed Libya's new prime minister as Mustafa al-Shakoura. He is Mustafa Abushagur.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Evening all: </strong>This is the last match of the international summer and England's last for nine days before kicking off their defence of the World Twenty20 title in Colombo next Friday. It's also England's first ever T20 at Edgbaston which, given it's the players' favourite ground and when you're sat in the Eric Hollies Stand the most raucous, surprises me. I thought England bowled well in the truncated and frantic N9 at Old Trafford on Monday, holding South Africa about 20 short, and if it hadn't been for Stuart Broad's last over would have made the target more gettable. I also thought they did OK off the 25 balls faced overall even though they needed 13 off five balls to get ahead of D/L and probably wouldn't have made it and Craig Kieswetter's timing was worrying, slogging and missing four times before ending his misery. There's a lot of talk of building momentum for Sri Lanka though I doubt anything apart from injuries on a chilly night in B5 will have much impact on next week's tournament.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Oh, <em>cack</em></strong> \u2013 It's been raining at Edgbaston but it seems to have stopped for the night. The problem is that the outfield is sopping and there will be an inspection at 6.30pm. The cut-off to play a full game is 7pm. Nick Knight reckons we'll get a shortened game at 7.30pm at the earliest.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Evening Robinson: </strong> \"Evening Bagchi, evening everybody,\" writes Josh Robinson. \"I could have sworn that a moment ago it said that Smyth would be doing this evening's OBO. What's happened, has he gone into mourning for Kent's chances of promotion to the first division of the county championship? Is he cursing at the batting performance that has left them 7-2 following on, needing a win to have any chance of being promoted? Are there signs of the smoke from a burning effigy of Fat Bob Key, who got a golden duck in the first over? Or are you going to feed us a story of 'rail delays' or a 'sports desk error'?\" It's the proliferation of Robs, Robinson. I'm going to have to revert to Robin if Smyth won't go the full Bob. And he's too busy writing his 10,000 word reappraisal of Alan Igglesden.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>\"What's your view on Broad?\"</strong> asks Indranath Neogy. \"The last game I saw (as opposed to followed on the OBO) was the last Test and he looked very out of sorts. Is he looking back in the groove?\" I thought he was bowling within himself during the Test series against South Africa when hovering between 78 and 82mph and didn't look to have the zip and rip of his best form. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?class=1;id=2012;type=year\">But we shouldn't forget he has more Test wickets in 2012 than anyone else</a> and only Graeme Swann has more T20 wickets for England than him. He was much quicker at times at Old Trafford \u2013 his first over looked pretty menacing and he might have got a wicket if Jade Dernbach had seen the ball flying towards him at third man off that second over. We'll get a better indication if the weather affords him more than two overs tonight. I have always thought that Swann should have succeeded Paul Collingwood as the captain of this side but Broad has impressed me so far, even if he still gives fielders that Paddington Bear stare when they c0ck up.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Game's gone to the bally dogs</strong> \"Look,\" writes Richard Noble who, given his opening, may have the sun-cowering squint of Stephen Rodger Waugh with that opening. \"I grew up when cricketers were the somewhat languid gentlemen of a reasonably mature age, physique and a distinguished pate. Seems to me that the game's gone to pot. It's not the proliferation of limited overs, the scandals of fixing and demise of whites or off-whites.</p> <p>\"Nope, its that the average English cricketer these days seems to appeal to mine and others' wives, is pictured leaping around rather a lot in undignified states of joy and to cap it all off, has a full head of spiky unkempt hair. It's all wrong \u2026 do something about it, will you!\" I shall write at once to the Daily Telegraph. </p> <p>\"Evening again Bagchi, evening again everybody,\" writes salutation man. \"Do you think you could get Smyth to tweak that reappraisal of Igglesden into a piece for the 'forgotten story' series on McCague's Test? The fact that no one who reads Smyth's writing has been allowed to forget it should surely only<br>be a minor and easily superable hurdle.\" Josh, you josh. Forgotten story? You'll be lucky.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>6.41pm: The 6.30pm inspection decides \u2026 there'll be another inspection at 7.15pm.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>The black clouds have gone and sun is shining as it sets in Birmingham</strong> \"Surely if Kevin Pietersen was prepared to go out and do the mopping up at Edgbaston that would prove his commitment enough to be named for India \u2026\" writes Keith Flett. An apology would suffice for me, Keith. I don't think he's bad, just a bit, well, silly.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>7.25pm: We know that Danny Briggs wins his first cap for England. We don't know when play will start.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>7.26pm: A further inspection at 7.40pm is the latest news.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>7.26pm: An if it's an 8pm start as predicted, it will be 13 overs a side.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>It is getting bloody farcical</strong> as Bumble points out, as does our correspondent Lanky: \"Once again the authorities show NO RESPECT to the paying public at a cricket match. To wait another ten minutes before decideing whether to play - when conditions are hardly going to change - is taking the pi$$. I don't know what goes through these umpires minds but it certainly does not include the fact that the paying public are once again having to put up with this nonsense. Will the fans get a refund???? This is rubbish with a capital F.\" It's so daft because the particular areas \u2013 specifically the one at point \u2013 that are of concern will not improve much.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>7.43pm: <strong>We're going to have an E11 starting at 8.12pm</strong></p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>7.51pm: Here's <a href=\" http://reversesweeper.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/pietersen-team-spirit-and-lessons-of.html  http://\">Scott Oliver's take on KP</a>. \"In the light of the ongoing KP saga,\" he writes, \"I wrote a long and rather rambling meditation on Steve Archibald's assertion that \"team spirit was an illusion glimpsed in the aftermath of victory\" going by way of (a very amateur take on) nonlinear thermodynamics.\" Here it is. I felt like <a href=\"http://www.friendsreunited.com/british-entertainment-television-comedy-hancock-london-1961/Memory/fef75949-6a14-415d-af98-a00a0038af46\">Tony Hancock reading Bertrand Russell's Human Knowledge</a>. I'm more a Lady Don't Fall Backwards type.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss and put England in to bat</strong></p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>England: </strong>Kieswetter (wk), Lumb, Wright, Morgan, Bairstow, Buttler, Bresnan, Broad (c), Swann, Dernbach, Briggs.</p> <p><strong>South Africa:</strong> Levi, Amla, Kallis, de Villiers (c/wk), Ontong, Du Plessis, A Morkel, Botha, Peterson, Parnell, M Morkel.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Two Luke Wrights?</strong> No, my fat fingers. Bairstow has been restored below. Lumb's back and Bresnan, too, two winners from 2010 and Briggs makes his debut. Duminy and Steyn have been rested by South Africa. One bowler can have three overs, the rest a maximum of two.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>8.03pm: \"Evening Rob, evening Robinson, evening everybody,\" writes Phil Sawyer. \"That was a rather emotive email from Lanky. Didn't realise the Red Rose's giraffe mascot felt so vehement about the needs of the paying public, but it's nice to see him channelling his frustration at Lancashire's relegation last week into concern for the fans. Unlike me, who has taken the mighty Rose's relegation extremely badly and have sunk into a slew of vodka-fuelled depression. The news that Yorkshire have pretty much cemented their promotion today has not improved my mood. Cheer me up, Rob!\" Cheer you up? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y82WdMot--U\">Here you go</a>.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 16-0 (Kieswetter 9, Lumb 1)</strong> Morne Morkel does his turnaround dance and storms in, bowling a waist-high full toss first ball that could and probably should have been a no ball but he gets away with it as Kieswetter picks it up and dabs it into the legside for a single. Lumb rotates the strike then Morkel channels the Gabba 2006 and bowls a monstrously wide one that rattles through to the boundary. He then breaks a bar of chocolate in his back pocket (see Chic Murray) when bowling another (single) wide. Kieswetter anticipates the bowler is going to be tentative, just rtrying to pitch it for a while so he smashes the next two legside half-volleys for four apiece through midwicket. \"Two Luke Wrights?\" asks Joanne Beasley. \"Perish the thought. Are you sure it's fat fingers, or have you been at the advocate smoothies? Either way, the Eric Hollies' occupants are a wonderful sight, but only from the Raglan Stand.\" Rumbled \u2013 I've been on the legal aid.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Lumb b Parnell 5</strong> Second ball of the over was driven confidently for four. The next one pitches in the same place outside off stump but jags back in and knocks down middle stump.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 21-1 (Kieswetter 9, Wright 1)</strong> Parnell is in for Steyn and bowling quicker than the man he replaced did in the last match, two at 86mph, one at 90mph. After Lumb goes Wright takes a single to get off the mark and Kieswetter pushes one to wide long on and walks one. More accurate and much quicker than Morne Morkel who spent about half an hour warming up and almost sconed Nick Knight while he was doing his pitch report.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 27-1 (Kieswetter 11, Wright 4)</strong> Albie Morkel replaces his brother and Wright gets his bat around his front pad to take two, then one, almost colliding with the bowler when he ran the single. Tip and run off this over, the last of the powerplay, to the fielders on the edge of the circle. Wright attempts to make it at least a run off every ball but is almost run out when he tries to steal one off the last ball when he hit it too firmly to point but he dived back into his crease a fraction of a second before De Villiers knocked the stumps down.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 37-1 (Kieswetter 14, Wright 6)</strong> Peterson comes round the wicket and spears a wide down the legside. The batsmen try to use the crease to put him off but he sticks to his leg-stump line and even gets some spin. When it doesn't turn, Kieswetter sweeps him away. One spins so late, after Wright misses it that the stumper does too and they run a bye as Levi's dive and grab saves four. Ten off the over.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Wright c Amla b Botha 6</strong> He thought it would turn so Wright tried to clip it over the top of midwicket but the ball stayed true, caught the outside edge and sailed high to point, Amla diving to catch at the edge of the circle.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 44-2 (Kieswetter 20, Morgan 0)</strong> De Villiers is going for one-over spells tonight. Botha's turn now and he gets huge turn from off to leg, the batsman misses it, as does De Villiers and they runm one. Kieswetter then connects with one of his golf shot drives that looked at first if he was going to gets some draw on it but it flew past the bowler's left side for four. Wright tries to whack the ball into the crowd, Botha sees him coming, bowls the arm ball, drops it shorter and Wright is snared.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 50-2 (Kieswetter 22, Morgan 4)</strong> Peterson is going to bowl a second over and though England play tip and run, South Africa are happy top let them do it. There's no bounce and Morgan goes down on one knee to try and reach the ball to mow-sweep it and is struck in the ribs. De Villiers appeals for leg-before but it looked as though it pitched outside off and didn't turn enough. When he chips one in the air over cover Parnell doesn't make enough ground to try to catch it, much to the consternation of his captain.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 52-2 (Kieswetter 23, Morgan 5)</strong> That rib-tickler would have hit the stumps, incidentally. Botha is using the slow pitch and variable turn to confound the batsmen's attacking ambition. This is about steady accumulation. De Villiers misses a stumping down the legside when Kieswetter's momentum knocks him over when he goes for a big hit and doesn't connect. The keeper fumbles the take and Kieswetter is back in his ground when he does knock the bails off. Good over from Botha.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 63-2 (Kieswetter 34, Morgan 5)</strong> Eighth over and the Saffers are on their sixth bowler with Kallis. Hard running from Morgan turns one into two from Kieswetter's offdrive to wide long off. Kallis drops short next ball and Kieswetter takes a step forward and larrups it over long on, flat for six. He moves again next ball so Kallis pushes it wider and Kieswetter has to really stretch to reach for it to square drive for two. He prefers the pace and South Africa were wrong to feed him with it.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Morgan c Ontong b Botha 5</strong> He went for the DLF MAXIMUM! didn't get hold of it properly and spooned it to long on where Ontong took it when it finally dropped out of the sky.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 74-2 (Kieswetter 44, Buttler 1)</strong> Botha's the chosen one to bowl three overs and he duly bags Morgan with one of his, erm, darts. \"I'll get you\" Buttler gets off the mark to give Kieswetter the strike and the opener completes a sharp two to face the last ball which he advances to, and spanks low and flat for six over the bowler.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 106-2 (Kieswetter 44, Buttler 31)</strong> Tremendous shot from Buttler off Parnell's first ball. It was a good length so Buttler waited for it and leant backwards to smash it for six over long-on. He gets six more next ball, this time over the offside with a less graceful shot with his bat at eight o-clock and his eyes closed. Parnell then gets his yorker almost right but its wide and Buttler steers it for two through point. Parnell no balls and Buttler scoops him for four off the free hit which is another no ball. Another free hit, another scoop for four from outside off - so 24 off the first three balls of the over. Brilliant innovation from Buttler. Six more off the fourth legitimate ball. It's short so Buttler pulls him over midwicket and takes two off the last ball. Thirty-two off the over. Welcome Mr Buttler. You've arrived.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Kieswetter b M Morkel 50</strong> Tried to play the Buttler scoop and missed the ball by two inches.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Bairstow b Morkel 4</strong> Yorked middle stump.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 118-5 (Bresnan 1, Buttler 32)</strong> Morne Morkel, who went for 16 off his first over, goes for six more off his seventh ball as Kieswetter brings up fifty with a pull off a shocking slow half-tracker. Morkel gets him out going for the long leg flick from outside off. In comes Bairstow who cut/edges his first ball for four to third-man. Then he's out: 6-W-4-W so far from Morkel. Bresnan gives Buttler the strike for the last ball of the innings by taking a single to wide mid on and the Somerset batsman gets out his scoop again but doesn't time it right and takes only a single off the last ball. That was fantastic from Buttler, surely the best ever over for England in T20 and Kieswetter's judgment was spot-on today and his execution almost perfect. <strong>The Saffers will bat in 10 minutes. </strong></p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Bully and Victor</strong> will be purring as their cheeks been gettin' redder from Charterhouse to Cheddar tonight.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 9-0 (Levi 1, Amla 8) Target 119 </strong> Danny Briggs opens the bowling for England on debut. And he turns his first ball from off stump away from Levi who adjusts and clips him for a single. Amla waits for the next one to get to the apex of its bounce and cuts it for four but he misses the third ball going for the heave-ho and Kieswetter knocks the bails off but the batsman's foot was on the ground and in the crease. He bowls another peach to Amla who misses it then tries to reverse sweep and can't connect either. The last ball, though, Amla belts over mid off and it flies for four past Morgan's dive on the rope.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Levi b Bresnan 1</strong> Misjudges a slower ball, and gets through his shot too quickly. Clever bowling.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 13-1 (Du Plessis 3, Amla 9) Target 119 </strong> Big shout from Bresnan for leg-before as Levi tries to pummel him over midwicket and misses but the ball was sliding past leg stump. Bresnan takes him third ball and Du Plessis comes in ahead of Kallis, getting only three for his square drive thanks to Lumb's excellent diving drag back. Good over from Bresnan, finishing with a yorker that's dug out.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 25-1 (Du Plessis 8, Amla 16) Target 119 </strong> Broad follows De Villiers and this one-over policy, taking the ball himself while Du Plessis and Amla each take four off him. He's called wide on bounce when he reacts to Du Plessis trying to charge him by digging it in and is not happy but the replay shows it was too high. So Broad bowls a Sidebottom slow bouncer for the last ball and Du Plessis was facing square leg by the time the ball was going over the stumps.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Du Plessis c Morgan b Briggs 8</strong> Hitting against the spin he thick edges his ondrive to cover where Morgan takes it above his head.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 34-2 (De Villiers 0, Amla 21) Target 119 </strong> Someone's actually hoovering around my feet as I type this over. Hello, mum. Slightly disconcerting. Amla takes four, his fast hands countering the turn but Du Plessis goes the other way and succumbs.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 44-2 (De Villiers 2, Amla 29) Target 119 </strong> Amla's batting beautifully, apart from two failed sallies in Briggs's first over. Here he reverse sweeps Swann for four with those pinball wizard wrists. \"Just home and had no idea this match was still on. Got TMS going as well and just heard Bairstow described as a gazelle in the field,\" Writes Clare A Davies. \"All seems a bit surreal to me. Been out at Book Group \u2013 we've just read a lovely book about France, and I come home to this cricket. Sweet.\" It sounds as though you're having an enviably happy evening, Clare. Wait till you see/hear about Buttler's knock.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 51-2 (De Villiers 2, Amla 35) Target 119 </strong> Poor Stuart Broad is having one of those days, being called for a second wide from a short ball, another his face, if not his voice, disputes and again he follows it up with a slow bouncer that Amla misreads and misses. Good variety from Broad, though, as he cranks up the speed to bowl the next one outside off, pitched up that again evades Amla's bat. You can't tie a class bat in the form of his life down with a T20 field, though, and he stands tall to crash his 100th four of the tour.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! De Villiers c Bairstow b Swann 3</strong> Regulation catch on the run from the Gazelle running in at midwicket when De Villiers tries to go big and top edges his cow-corner swipe.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Amla c Bairstow b Swann 36</strong> Brilliant from Swann, who saw Amla coming towards him so bowled it quicker and flatter and the batsman could not compensate, splicing it to Bairstow at midwicket just like his captain.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 53-4 (A Morkel 0, Ontong 0) Target 119 </strong> Amla takes a single after De Villiers is out and almost takes cover point's hands with him, so hard did he smite the ball. But Swann is bowling beautifully, turning on so far past Amla's off drive that it misses the batsman and leg stump. But he gets his deserts with the last ball of the over.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 55-4 (A Morkel 1, Ontong 1) Target 119 </strong> Jade Dernbach comes into the attack as South Africa seek 66 off 24 balls and he keeps up the pressure with his bag of tricks - one at 88mph, one at 70mph. Yorkers, bouncers, back of the handers. Two off an over which bamboozles both batsmen.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 69-4 (A Morkel 5, Ontong 10) Target 119 </strong> Swann will be the three-over anointed one and Ontong tries the same shot that did for his captain and Amla, doesn't hit it as hard and it drops short of Bairstow sliding in. \"Cleaners don't usually get much of a shout, so how about identifying the hooverer for us?\" asks John Starbuck. \"It would be a Guardianista thing to do.\" I would but he's gone, John. Sorry. I'll be drummed out of the Guardian. Ontong gets it right next time, battering a six to deep midwicket and Swann chunters when he takes two off the last ball which he felt should have been kept down to a single.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Ontong c Morgan b Bresnan 10</strong> Full toss, pocket high that Ontong caught at the top of his bat and sliced to point. Ontong asked about its height but the umpires said it was OK.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 78-5 (A Morkel 13, Kallis 1) Target 119 </strong> After Ontong reluctantly leaves Bresnan tests Albie Morkel with a short one which he shovels over square leg for six. They needed five a ball after the fall of the wicket but Bresnan keeps them down to three singles off the last three balls</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 90-5 (A Morkel 17, Kallis 8) Target 119 </strong> Dernbach to complete England's victory. Er \u2013 he starts with a wide but Morkel can only take one off his first ball. Then another wide to Kallis, snaking well down the legside and Jacques keeps his strike rate looking impressive with a pair of twos as Mariachi man blows his horn. Dernbach should have had his wicket but Lumb puts his hands above his head Australian-style when Kallis thick edges to cover and the ball breaks through his thumbs and falls onto the ground.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>England win by 28 runs and tie the series 1-1</strong> Impressive stuff from the Somerset pair and some incisive bowling from all five bowlers gave England a deserved victory and in enjoyably unexpected fashion. Here's Simon McMahon as I wrap up: \"This has been an exciting end to an enjoyable summer of international cricket between two excellent sides. And we still have the sub-continent to look forward to starting with the World T20, then back to back Ashes series in 2013-14.

  "<p>The debate over a third runway at Heathrow is not helped by Zac Goldsmith's failure (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/07/third-runway-heathrow-betrayal\" title=\"\">Cameron would pay a high price for a Heathrow U-turn</a>, 8 September) to understand the importance of Heathrow as a hub airport for the whole of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Telling those in the north how easy it is to take the train to Heathrow reveals he doesn't know how long it takes and how complex the journey actually is. Nor does he seem to grasp that the proposed high speed rail tracks will stop at Manchester and Leeds.</p> <p>His advocacy of a two-hub approach (Heathrow and Stansted), while worthy of further investigation, needs to bear in mind that the rest of the UK has to be connected to them.</p> <p>It is vital for rebalancing our economy and driving growth across the UK that our transport connectivity improves. Without it, the whole of the UK will pay the penalty, and our national carrier will increasingly lose business to hubs outside the UK such as Schiphol and Dubai.</p> <p>All the options now need full examination and we should welcome the review that is taking place. <br><strong>John Shipley</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008I am almost too ashamed to admit it, but I have to agree with Zac Goldsmith on something: a third runway at Heathrow would be a very expensive mistake. More sensible routing of planes and use of other airports would free up money for more essential infrastructure expenditure.</p> <p>If more money must be spent, yet again, on London, why not improve public transport access for the disabled, as the brilliant Sophie Christiansen suggests (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/07/paralympic-gold-medallist-disabled-access\" title=\"\">London is horrendous, says triple gold medallist</a>, 8 September)? Video conferencing and emails have surely diminished the need for business travel, and technological developments will undoubtedly reduce it further. Fancy a Tory MP suggesting the government has \"been seduced by vested interests\". Whatever next?<br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008It is interesting that Zac Goldsmith, my MP, promotes himself as a \"green\" politician, yet belongs to a party increasingly committed to a third runway at Heathrow. Locally, the first thing his party did on taking power from the Liberal Democrats was to rescind one of the few local council green initiatives that made headlines nationally (a \"parking tax\" on less fuel-efficient cars), a move Mr Goldsmith subsequently defended.</p> <p>Without further action from him and others in positions of power, I fear a repeat of this episode with regard to Heathrow, and we will be left with a situation where we have identified another source of hot air, but done nothing about it, in an already warming world.<br><strong>Jane Dodds</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008In response to a question from me, the prime minister confirmed in parliament that he would abide by his party's manifesto committing to no third runway at Heathrow. There was no mention in this manifesto that the commitment was limited to the life of a parliament. However, later the same day, he announced that Howard Davies would be leading an inquiry into airport capacity that would investigate the case for a third runway at Heathrow, reporting after the next election.</p> <p>It's hardly surprising that most have interpreted this as a disingenuous manoeuvre to appease the powerful aviation lobby, get him past the next election and become the excuse to allow this environmental disaster to go ahead.</p> <p>Many are sceptical at the independence of the Davies inquiry, given that it is headed by a former director of the CBI, which has been a strong lobbyist for expanding Heathrow. Others question the judgment of a person who resigned his office because he allowed the university he led <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/mar/03/lse-director-resigns-gaddafi-scandal\" title=\"\">to have such close links to the Gaddafi regime</a>.</p> <p>Whatever the prime minister's motives, let me warn him and others that if there is an attempt to ride roughshod over us and force this expansion through, they will be faced with the greatest environmental movement of resistance that this country has seen, using both the electoral process and if necessary an unprecedented wave of direct action to save our communities and our planet.<br><strong>John McDonnell MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Hayes and Harlington</em></p>",

  "<p>The global climate is universally accepted to be a non-linear, dynamic (chaotic) system. It is, for example, impossible to make reliable weather forecasts more than a few days ahead. Despite this, geoengineering interventions are being proposed as a means of modifying the climate to arrest current global warming and initiate global cooling (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/09/climate-change-expert-calls-for-nuclear-power-boost\" title=\"\">Climate 'emergency' warning</a>, 10 September).</p> <p>Since a geoengineering intervention can only be tested meaningfully at large scale, any such experiment would have to be agreed between all neighbouring states. The test would then either be ineffective, or achieve some uncontrollable measure of success within an imprecisely defined region for an unpredictable time, or initiate an irreversible change in climate over a region of unknown extent, also for an indeterminate period of time.</p> <p>Geoengineering is, unfortunately, a totally impractical concept that could be used politically as an excuse for delaying further the drastic measures needed to reduce our consumption of irreplaceable natural resources.<br><strong>Roy Butterfield </strong><br><em>Emeritus professor of civil engineering, University of Southampton</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The only chance of avoiding catastrophic global warming lies in geoengineering.

It would be a challenge to remove it faster than the human race is currently releasing it but, with sufficient investment, it should be possible.</p> <p>Carbon capture from power station chimneys and storage beneath the North Sea seems overly complicated; why not just capture it from the air above the North Sea using wind-powered equipment and pump it straight down there?

  "<p>Governments in the US, Europe and Britain must ditch austerity and tackle the yawning gap between rich and poor or risk being trapped in a deep economic slump, according to the UN's trade arm, Unctad, <a href=\"http://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=255&amp;Sitemap_x0020_Taxonomy=Globalization%20and%20Development;#20;#UNCTAD%20Home\" title=\"\">in a new report</a>.</p> <p>In its 200-page annual trade and development report, Geneva-based Unctad sets out a damning case against what it calls the \"dogma\" of flexible labour markets, and urges governments to focus instead on boosting wages to shore up demand.</p> <p>\"Any policy approach that dismisses the important contribution of income distribution to demand growth and employment is destined to fail,\" it says.</p> <p>Heiner Flassbeck, Unctad's chief economist, said: \"What we have now is an age of diminished expectations for working people. They have no positive income expectations any more, and this is the first time since the second world war that this has been the situation.\"</p> <p>Without the hope of higher wages, workers will continue paring back their spending, he argues. With central banks' ammunition exhausted \"if you don't have consumption, you can't get out of the slump\".</p> <p>Unctad predicts global growth of 2.3% for 2012: weaker than the 2.7% of last year, and well below the 4% that was the norm before the credit crisis. It expects expansion in emerging economies such as China and India to slow, as they suffer the knock-on effects from recession in the eurozone, and slowing demand from the US. \"The developing and transition economies cannot avoid the impacts of economic troubles in the developed countries,\" it says.</p> <p>Economists and politicians have become increasingly concerned about the impact of widening income inequality on an economy's growth prospects. The share of GDP taken home by workers in wages has declined across developed economies: in Britain, from 70% in 1970 to less than 63% in 2010; and in the US, from 65.3% in 1970 to 59% in 2010.</p> <p>Labour leader Ed Miliband floated the idea of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/06/ed-miliband-coalition-vince-cable\" title=\"Guardian: Miliband overtures to Cable\">pre-distribution</a>\" in a speech last week, arguing that left-of-centre politicians should concentrate on building a fairer economy, rather than rely on redistribution of tax revenues to narrow the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>Unctad suggests stronger collective bargaining, and a centralised \"incomes policy\" \u2013 conjuring up the age of beer and sandwiches in Downing Street \u2013 could boost growth. \"The obvious failure to return the global economy to a sustainable growth path after 2008, and in particular the failure to revive domestic demand in the developed world, should be taken as a warning sign,\" it says.</p> <p>\"If a large majority of people lose faith in the willingness of companies and governments to provide them with a fair share of the collectively produced income, income growth itself will drastically suffer.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, has called for the three jailed members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot to be freed.</p> <p>But Pussy Riot's supporters quickly dismissed the prime minister's statements, noting his long history of appealing to Russia's more liberal demographic while failing to follow through on delivering results.</p> <p>In televised remarks about the band on Wednesday, Medvedev said he was \"sickened by what they did, by their looks, by the hysteria that followed what had happened\". Three members of the radical anti-Kremlin punk collective were sentenced to two years in prison last month on charges of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred after performing a song criticising Vladimir Putin in Russia's official cathedral. The case sparked a global outcry and highlighted the crackdown on the opposition inside Russia.</p> <p>But Medvedev said he believed the women should be freed early. \"The prolongation of their incarceration in the conditions of jail seems to me to be unproductive,\" he said. \"A suspended sentence, taking into account time they have already spent [in jail], would be entirely sufficient.\"</p> <p>The three women \u2013 Maria Alyokhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova \u2013 have been jailed since their arrest in early March. They remain in a pre-trial detention centre in Moscow as they wait for their appeal to be heard. The appeal is due to start on 1 October.</p> <p>\"This well-known group of girls has been in jail long enough,\" Medvedev said, calling the time they had already spent in detention a \"very serious punishment regardless of the sentence\".</p> <p>Medvedev \u2013 who forwent seeking a second term as president to allow his mentor, Putin, a free run \u2013 has long sought to portray himself as a liberal reformer. As president, he had vowed to reform Russia's culture of \"legal nihilism\", building on his career as a lawyer. Yet critics of the government note that his numerous statements on various legal cases \u2013 including the need to fully investigate the death in custody of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky \u2013 have yielded no results. He ceded the presidency in May to Putin amid unprecedented anti-government protests.</p> <p>\"Medvedev has already spoken about several criminal cases and we know what the results have been,\" said Nikolai Polozov, a lawyer for Pussy Riot. \"I agree with what he said \u2013 that they should be let out. But considering all the other awful propaganda against our clients, it seems his voice will not be heard. This is an attempt to save face.\"</p> <p>A popular programme on state-run television said in a broadcast late on Tuesday that the Pussy Riot women were doing the devil's work, and were the brainchild of the London-based oligarch and Kremlin foe Boris Berezovsky. Berezovsky denied the accusation.</p> <p>Pussy Riot's supporters accuse Putin of personally orchestrating the campaign against the band. The women sang a song that begged the Virgin Mary to rid the country of the powerful leader.</p> <p>During the trial, Putin called for the women not to be judged \"too harshly\". The court handed them a two-year sentence instead of the maximum seven years or the three years requested by the prosecution.</p> <p>Both Putin and Medvedev said they had no intention of interfering in Russia's notoriously politicised court system.</p>",

  "<p>Peter Cummings, the HBOS banker whose division lent billions of pounds to property developers, has been given a lifetime ban by the Financial Services Authority for his role in the banking crisis.</p> <p>Cummings, who has also been fined \u00a3500,000, is the only former HBOS banker to be penalised by the City regulator as a result of the near-collapse of the bank which was rescued by Lloyds in September 2008 - and the highest profile banker to be punished since the financial crisis.</p> <p>The 57-year old Scottish banker launched a stinging attack on the regulator for not taking action against any of his former colleagues at the bank which eventually needed a \u00a320bn taxpayer bail out.</p> <p>Calling for an independent report into the HBOS collapse, Cummings, who retired with a \u00a3352,000 a year pension, said: \"This is tokenism at its most sinister, and has made it feel throughout like institutional oppression\".</p> <p>The action against the retired banker, well known as a lender to Top Shop founder Sir Philip Green and other high profile business executives, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/bank-of-scotland-fsa-serious-misconduct\" title=\"\">follows the announcement by the FSA in March</a> that the Bank of Scotland corporate division of HBOS which had run and which was found guilty of \"very serious misconduct\".</p> <p>The FSA said it would begin work on finding out what went wrong at the bank - created in 2001 through the merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland - and publish a report before it is disbanded in March next year.</p> <p>Cummings, who retired in January 2009 following the Lloyds rescue after a career <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/11/peter-cummings-hbos\" title=\"\">that began at Bank of Scotland when he was just 18,</a> was found to have failed to \"exercise due skill, care and diligence\" in running the corporate banking division and failed to manage \"high value transactions\" as they showed signed of stress as the banking crisis took hold.</p> <p>A softly spoken Glaswegian, Cummings' first job was said to be making tea in his local Dumbarton branch. It was not until January 2006 that he was promoted to main board level when Sir James Crosby was still chief executive of HBOS. Crosby handed the helm to Andy Hornby, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/18/andy-hornby-new-boss-coral\" title=\"\">now boss of Coral</a>, in July 2006 while Lord Stevenson was chairman of the bank during the period.</p> <p>Bank of Scotland corporate division became well known as a lender to property companies but also taking equity stakes in companies such as retirement-home builder McCarthy &amp; Stone, and housebuilder Crest Nicholson. It helped fund Green's ill-fated tilt at Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004.</p> <p>The division kept expanding in the months running up to the financial crisis, even as rivals were pulling back - and the FSA, <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/final/peter-cummings.pdf\" title=\"\">in a 92-page final notice</a>, argued that Cummings should have restrained the business which operated \"with a culture of optimism\" with bonuses linked to sales. The investigation covered the three years starting in early 2006 and ended in December 2008, just as Lloyds was taking control of HBOS. Shortly afterwards, in February 2009, the enlarged bank, known as Lloyds Banking Group and 40% owned by the taxpayer, was forced to increase the level of bad debt provision to \u00a37bn from \u00a33.3bn in December because HBOS had taken an \"optimistic\" approach to provisioning.</p> <p>In March, the regulator said it did not fine HBOS because the bill would have been picked up the taxpayer.</p> <p>Explaining he was not taking the FSA to a tribunal because of the cost and impact on his family, Cummings said: \"Many people must bear collective responsibility for what happened, including governments and regulators as well as the boards of the banks themselves. But the fact that I am the only individual from HBOS to face investigation defies comprehension\". The FSA said it had taken into account the fact had waived a \u00a31.3m bonus when he left.</p> <p>There has been speculation that Cummings had originally faced a \u00a31m fine from the FSA which has been under fire for its handling of the financial crisis.</p> <p>It closed its investigation in to what went wrong at Royal Bank of Scotland <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/dec/12/royal-bank-of-scotland-fsa-report\" title=\"\">without taking action against Fred Goodwin</a>, the former chief executive who has since been stripped of his knighthood. Johnny Cameron, the former head of investment banking at RBS, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/18/rbs-boss-cameron-never-take-bank-job\" title=\"\">agreed not to work in the City again</a> although no regulatory action was taken against him.</p> <h2>Rise in bad debts</h2> <p>Peter Cummings, the former boss of the Bank of Scotland corporate division inside HBOS, was found by the FSA to have a led a \"culture of optimism\" which led to the bank being slow to notice a rise in bad debts.</p> <p>While the FSA admitted that some of the problems existed before Cummings took over and other directors shared responsibility, it said the bank allowed too many big loans to a small number of borrowers and that the full extent of the bad debts inside the corporate division were not immediately clear to the board, its auditors or regulators.</p> <p>The FSA noted that the corporate division took on risk by taking on 100% exposure to loans which it then sold down rather than trying to join in a club with other banks to reduce the risk.</p>",
  "<p>Should you find yourself in the new Burberry store in central London and ready to buy this season's gilt duck-head umbrella (\u00a3495) or trenchcoat (starts at \u00a3395), you would probably look around for a till at which to pay.</p> <p>But you are more likely to be directed to a sofa by one of the sales staff, then presented with a swipe machine and with your purchase, already wrapped.</p> <p>The store on Regent Street has been designed as a physical manifestation of the Burberry website, known as Burberry World Live.</p> <p>The 1820s building, occupied by Habitat until last year, is now home to the biggest Burberry store in the world.</p> <p>Remodelling the grand structure into a bricks-and-mortar version of a website is a clear statement to the world that, for Burberry, digital now comes first.</p> <p>Christopher Bailey, the firm's chief creative officer, said: \"We designed it like that because when you're shopping at home online, you are on the sofa with your credit card. You don't stand up and queue.\"</p> <p>Despite a profit warning that wiped \u00a31bn off Burberry's market value, the company is a huge success story for British fashion. Having bounced back from job cuts in 2009 to profits of \u00a3166m in 2010, thanks in no small part to a focus on digital growth, Burberry remains the anchor brand of London fashion week, which starts on Friday.</p> <p>For Bailey, the primacy of the digital experience is self-evident. \"I find it weird that anyone would find it weird [digital-first thinking].</p> <p>\"Most of us are very digital in our daily lives now. Burberry is a young team and this is instinctive to us. To the younger generation who are coming into adulthood now, this is all they know.\"</p> <p>Within the fashion industry, there are still many who look down on the internet. Patrizio Bertelli, the chief executive of Prada, told Harvard Business Review last month that he would not sell high-end Prada collections online because he is \"concerned about compromising our image by using a channel where secondhand cars and books are sold\".</p> <p>Many analysts feel that while social media is undoubtedly effective in building brand awareness and creating a community of fans, it is unproven in terms of driving actual sales.</p> <p>Burberry, however, would point to the success of the marketing campaign for last year's launch of the Body fragrance, in which 250,000 samples were sent to Facebook friends of the brand in return for customer details.</p> <p>Body was Burberry's most successful perfume launch, and moved the brand from 19th to ninth in the US fragrance sales charts.</p> <p>\"The world is moving so fast. There is absolutely no room for laziness or for resting on your laurels,\" said Bailey.</p> <p>Clothing in the store is embedded with chips which can be read by screens and mirrors using radio-frequency identification technology. When a customer walks into a changing room holding a jacket, one of the mirrors might respond by turning into a screen showing images of how it was worn on the catwalk, or details of how it was made.</p> <p>In the childrenswear room, low-level tables are equipped with iPads loaded with drawing apps to keep young customers happy.</p> <p>A network of small high-speed lifts concealed behind restored panelling has been added because the online shopper, accustomed to knowing in the space of a click whether an item is available in their size, will not put up with waiting the 10 minutes it could take a sales assistant to travel to and from the stockroom in a building which has 25 staircases and 1,500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) of backroom space.</p> <p>Miles of additional cables have been laid under the floors to allow for future innovations.</p> <p>\"People arrive at Burberry.com from many different entry points,\" said Bailey, \"because that's how the internet works. They might find us through music, for example.\"</p> <p>Music is a passion of Bailey's and has been meshed into the modern Burberry brand. Bailey tweets his music recommendations, and the songs are streamed on the website; the prettiest boys in the hottest British bands are handpicked for the front row of the catwalk show, and sometimes appear in advertising campaigns.</p> <p>The new store has 420 speakers concealed around the main room and a hydraulic stage for live music.</p> <p>On Monday, the Burberry catwalk show will be livestreamed on a 38 sq m screen that dominates the main floor.</p> <p>But Bailey says the speakers, lifts and wires are not about technology, but about customers not feeling bored. Emotion is important to him and he loves to orchestrate \"moments\": the finale of the last show was accompanied by rain pattering on the plastic roof of the Hyde Park marquee, the ultimate foil to those duck-head umbrellas.</p> <p>\"Burberry was born out of the trenchcoat, which is all about the weather. It's a national obsession, and I love to celebrate that,\" he said.</p> <p>Bailey is intriguing. Building an individual creative vision into a global brand suggests a force of will, an iron fist in the velvet glove, and yet he displays neither bombastic ego nor mannered eccentricity.</p> <p>Only when I congratulate him on his forthcoming marriage to his longterm boyfriend, the actor Simon Woods, does the faintest shadow of ill-humour pass over his face: \"Ah, yes, thank you. Actually, it's a bit strange, because we hadn't had a chance to tell many of our friends, and suddenly it was in the papers, which wasn't the idea.\"</p> <p>But this is Burberry, where the world moves fast. The shadow passes, the smile returns. He claps his hands, which he does frequently to denote a new beat, or a change of key, in the conversation.</p> <p>\"But there you go! We're very excited. It's great. Anyway, tell me, how are you?\"</p>",
  "<p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.publico.es/espana/442153/una-marea-independentista-colapsa-barcelona\">some politicians</a> trying to claim the contrary, Tuesday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/catalan-independence-rally-barcelona\" title=\"\">million-and-a-half-strong demonstration in Barcelona</a> was a mass call for the independence of Catalonia. The obvious explanation for the high turnout is the devastating impact of Spain's economic crisis, which in the last year saw a further 800,000 added to the jobless. This has been accompanied by a political crisis exemplified by the \"indignados\" protests, in which one in four Spaniards participated.</p> <p>If you look at the history of modern Catalan nationalism, crises like the current one have actually played a significant role. After Spain lost its last colonies in Cuba and the Philippines in the \"great disaster\" of <a href=\"http://www.ara.cat/premium/opinio/retorn-lEspanya-del-Desastre_0_763723647.html\">1898</a>, the political backwardness and uneven economic development of an erstwhile global empire was laid bare. During the subsequent period of soul-searching, industrialists in the most developed region, Catalonia, fought for political autonomy to help modernise Spain (an idea given cultural expression in the modernist architecture of Gaud\u00ed, funded by those same industrialists).</p> <p>After the experience of Spanish centralist dictatorship, and with the world crisis advancing, Catalan political leadership transferred to more radical and republican forces. The leader of the leftwing Catalan ERC party, Francesc Maci\u00e0,, announced an independent \"Catalan Republic\" in 1931, but eventually settled for the creation of an autonomous Catalan government (the <em>Generalitat</em>). When Franco declared civil war in the midst of widespread social agitation in 1936, his crusade was against \"separatists\" as well as \"reds\".</p> <p>For the 40 years after his victory, expressions of Catalan-national identity were repressed. Yet by the 1960s a new Catalan movement emerged under the leadership of Jordi Pujol, who would become Catalan president when regional autonomy was restored after Franco's death. Pujol managed to align Catalan nationalism with the workers' movement and the Communist party \u2013 giving <em>catalanisme</em> a progressive identity.</p> <p>The success of this progressive version of Catalonia was underlined by Pujol's inclusive model of regional identity: a Catalan was a person \"who lives and works in Catalonia and feels [Catalan]\". Pujol understood that under a centralist Spanish state, with 37% of the Catalan population being Spanish immigrant, he would need to help the new population identify as Catalan. Through his approach, applied energetically through the Generalitat's pro-Catalan-language policies, the Catalan national project survived and grew in support.</p> <p>Yet if anything, Tuesday's march seems to indicate that Pujol's Convergence and Union (CiU) \u2013 an elitist and conservative coalition \u2013 is now lagging behind the popular mood in the region. The party has taken no serious steps towards independence \u2013 but now the majority of Catalans say they would support independence if a referendum were called.</p> <p>There are several reasons behind this shift. First, both rightwing and centre-left governments in Madrid have opposed any further substantial devolution of powers. Sections of the People's party (PP) government have suggested abandoning Spain's relative decentralisation. The Zapatero government (and constitutional court) closed the door on a reformed Catalan Statute of Autonomy, approved by the Socialist-led Generalitat in Catalonia in 2006 \u2013 provoking <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Catalan_autonomy_protest\" title=\"\">mass demonstrations</a> and local referendums on independence.</p> <p>Second, there has been growing agitation around Catalonia's fiscal relationship with Madrid. Most of the net transfers from Catalonia to the central state result from its relative prosperity (compared, for example, with the unemployment-striken south of Spain) \u2013 meaning that CiU and <a href=\"http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20120902/54344291514/catalunya-cumplir-sin-morir-intento.html\">many pro-independence economists</a> are exaggerating discrimination.</p> <p>Yet Madrid has underinvested in Catalonia. Despite Barcelona being an economic pole comparable to Madrid, a new high-speed railway network connected several other regional centres to the Spanish capital before reaching Barcelona. Unlike in the rest of Spain, Catalonia's motorway system has received almost no investment. It is not outlandish to ask whether different central governments have deliberately promoted development elsewhere. Therefore Catalans would seem to have at least some genuine grievance.</p> <p>A final factor likely to aggravate tensions is that the heavily-indebted Generalitat has become shut out of the bond markets \u2013 an inevitable collateral effect of the Spanish crisis. Catalonia has already <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19564640\">borrowed \u20ac5bn</a> from Madrid and may well need more in the coming months. CiU has sometimes been more aggressive in its austerity measures than the Rajoy government, but if further social cuts to reduce Catalonia's growing debt are seen to be centrally imposed this could inflame national tensions. It could, on the other hand, be used as a political lever by Madrid to further tame CiU's pretensions.</p> <p>Clearly there is a case to support the Catalan mobilisations, including the smaller parallel protest yesterday by more leftwing <em>independentistes</em> that defend a \"people's\" as opposed to neoliberal Catalonia. But serious questions must be asked about the kind of Catalonia its nationalist leaders will provide, whether in or out of Spain, and even whether they want independence at all.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 September 2012. It originally stated that Llu\u00eds Companys was the ERC leader who announced an independent Catalan Republic in 1931. It also misspelled \"independentistes\" as \"independistes\". These errors have now been corrected</p>",
  "<p>Angela Merkel said Germany's highest court had sent a powerful message to the rest of Europe and beyond, after it paved the way for the creation of a \u20ac500bn rescue fund to tackle the eurozone's debt crisis.</p> <p>Markets rallied following the decision by the eight justices of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe to let Germany ratify a treaty to establish the European stability mechanism (ESM). The euro reached a four-month high and European stock markets rose after the court imposed conditions that were less burdensome than German parliamentarians and other ESM supporters had feared.</p> <p>The ESM can now start up next month and become fully operational by the new year, despite the warnings of analysts who say it will not work. The ruling was considered one of the most important in the court's 61-year history.</p> <p>A key condition attached to the ruling means that Germany's liabilities will be capped at \u20ac190bn. But the fact that the Bundestag and Germany's ESM representative can override the limitation led some observers to say it was a bluff, introduced to assuage the concerns of German taxpayers whose frustration at the prospect of having to bail out indebted southern European countries indefinitely has been on the rise.</p> <p>A poll before the ruling showed that 54% of Germans wanted the court to block the ESM, amid growing fears that Germany is ceding too many powers to European institutions. The court was petitioned by 37,000 Germans arguing that the ESM was anti-constitutional.</p> <p>The ruling is a breakthrough for Merkel and allows the go-ahead of the two-pronged approach she favours of both bailouts and budgetary discipline in the form of the ESM and the fiscal pact. She said the decision sent a strong signal of Germany's commitment to Europe, and was positive news for German taxpayers, who she said had been provided with certainty.</p> <p>\"This is a good day for Germany, a good day for Europe,\" she told the Bundestag. \"We haven't yet overcome the crisis, but we have achieved our first steps.\"</p> <p>Frank-Walter Steinmeier, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, expressed his relief that the ESM \u2013 whose creation had been substantially delayed by the constitutional court's deliberations \u2013 could now start to work. \"The significance of this decision for the future of Europe cannot be underestimated,\" he told the Bundestag.</p> <p>Neil Prothero, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the decision would come as a relief to policymakers across the eurozone. \"A decision against the ESM would have thrown the region's crisis response strategy into disarray,\" he said.</p> <p>But Gunnar Beck, an EU analyst at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, called the decision \"a completely absurd judgment from a legal point of view\", because it meant Germany's liability was fixed \"unless it is decided otherwise, which means there's no limit to it\".</p> <p>He was gloomy about the long-term effects of the decision, predicting that the markets' enthusiasm would not last. \"In the short term the market will be booming, but in the long term this means unending horror. Germany is locked in now and it means that if the ECB buys unlimited bonds, Germany's liability is unlimited as well,\" he said. \"Germany is like a bank that has lent too much to its biggest client so that it has to continue lending until the client goes bust\".</p> <p>The court had been under huge pressure not to torpedo the ESM, amid fears that it would cause the destruction of the euro and have a chaotic effect on the global economy. Andreas Vosskuhle, the court's president, said the economic and political consequences of delaying the law's introduction were \"almost impossible to calculate reliably\".</p> <p>Despite repeated claims of the court's independence, there have been strong suggestions of at least one high-level meeting between the government and the court, reports about which led to speculation that the two bodies might have worked closely on a face-saving solution.</p> <p>A little light relief amid the gravitas was offered by a slip of the tongue by Vosskuhle, who called the petitions to block the ESM \"justified\" before changing it to \"unjustified\" after being corrected by a colleague, as peals of laughter filled the courtroom.</p> <h2>Bank power balance<br></h2> <p>The EU executive has unveiled new laws empowering the European Central Bank to police 6,000 banks in the eurozone, a step towards a more centralised federation in response to almost three years of the bloc's currency crisis.</p> <p>The aim, accompanied by decisions on direct eurozone recapitalisation of struggling banks, is to establish a far more robust supervisory and regulatory regime over the banks and to break the pernicious links between weak sovereigns and vulnerable banks feeding Europe's debt crisis.</p> <p>While broadly welcomed by all of the EU including Britain, which will take no part in the new regime, the detail of the draft legislation will be hugely contested by EU governments between now and the end of the year, with London and Berlin squaring off as opposite poles in the argument.</p> <p>Signalling the new draft represented just the start of months of wrestling over the outcome, a British diplomat said: \"A banking union for the euro area must also respect the integrity of the single market for the whole of the European Union, and we'll ensure the agreement on it does that.\"</p> <p>Germany strongly resists planned supervision of all 6,000 banks, seeking to minimise the ECB's remit to just 20-odd \"systemic\" banks, the biggest in the eurozone, which would include only two German institutions. Berlin is also reluctant to rush into using eurozone bailout funds for direct bank recapitalisation.</p> <p>Berlin, the first to call for the \"banking union\" and to insist that the supervisory powers be vested in the ECB in Frankfurt, appear to be keen on the policing of eurozone banks as long as few as possible German banks are controlled.</p> <p>The British, remaining outside the new regime, are worried about the impact of the new system on non-euro members, on the European single market, and on the City of London, disputing complicated new proposed voting arrangements they fear could leave them defenceless against moves to penalise London-based banks while making it harder to force action against eurozone banks.</p> <p>For the ECB to gain the sweeping new powers,including that to grant and withdraw banking licenses in the eurozone, all 27 EU governments must agree, giving the UK a veto if they fail to force concessions.</p> <p>The ECB's supervisory role is to be phased in, according to the plan, kicking off next January with extensive intrusive powers of scrutiny over weak banks already being bailed out, notably in Spain, extending to the 20-30 systemic banks by the middle of next year, and then putting all 6,000 banks under ECB policing by the beginning of 2014.</p> <p>The draft law concerns solely supervisory powers. The plan is to then expand the regime over a few years to include a common eurozone resolution authority and funds for winding up or restructuring failing banks as well as common deposit guarantee schemes for eurozone savers.</p> <p>Both elements are also contested by Berlin which is wary of being made co-liable for the costs of other countries' banking failures and savings guarantees. While the new ECB regime will apply to all of the eurozone, non-euro countries can also come under the system without gaining voting rights in the new ECB supervisory board. Of the non-euro countries, Poland is the keenest to join but is also arguing for better terms.</p> <p>While Michel Barnier, the single market commissioner in charge, sounded optimistic on Wednesday that several non-euro countries would join the new supervisory system, senior officials expect it to start with only the 17 single currency countries.</p> <p>The trickiest part of the new system concerns relations between the ECB authority representing the 17 and the London-based European Banking Authority which groups national supervisors and coordinates between them.</p> <p>The Germans are scathing about the performance of the EBA, the ECB in Frankfurt sees it as a rival, while the British are worried that the role of the EBA is actually being strengthened and could damage UK interests.</p> <p><strong> Ian Traynor in Brussels</strong></p>",
  "<p>\"In 2007 and 2008 the banking industry was almost destroyed in a global liquidity crisis that exposed deep structural flaws in the industry and rocked and in some cases brought down so many institutions, including HBOS, where I had worked for almost 36 years.</p> <p>\"Many people must bear collective responsibility for what happened, including governments and regulators as well as the boards of the banks themselves. But the fact that I am the only individual from HBOS to face investigation defies comprehension.</p> <p>\"For the past three and a half years I have been singled out and subjected to an extraordinary Orwellian process by an organisation that acts as lawmaker, judge, jury, appeal court and executioner. The FSA has never had to prove its case to anyone other than itself, and sits safe in the knowledge that few individuals can afford to take it on.</p> <p>\"The decision to single me out for investigation is even more grotesque given that even the FSA has to admit in its notice that other senior people were involved in the critical decisions for which I am taken to task. This is tokenism at its most sinister, and has made it feel throughout like institutional oppression.</p> <p>\"The FSA failed even to interview a significant number of HBOS's senior executives and non-executives, including its former group finance directors and the divisional finance director, in its investigation. This alone highlights the fundamental shortcomings in its investigation, which failed for example to address the question of who set the financial targets that the Corporate Division had to meet.</p> <p>\"When I was appointed to run the Corporate Division in 2006 I took strenuous efforts to improve risk controls and to embed risk as a core competence with the full co-operation and knowledge of the FSA. I appointed a Chief Risk Officer and carried out a series of structural changes to ensure the Division complied with the Basel II capital adequacy rules. I cannot reconcile the close engagement I had with the FSA then with the criticisms they level against me today, other than with their application of lavish portions of hindsight.</p> <p>\"I believe there should be a wholly independent inquiry into the failure of HBOS to identify the full reasons for the failure of the bank. This should not be conducted by the FSA, which has such a clear conflict of interest in the matter given it was responsible for the bank's regulation throughout this period. I reject the notion that work on the substantive Report into the failure of HBOS could only commence at the conclusion of this investigation and find it difficult to understand why a Report of such public significance was delayed in preference to proceedings against one individual said to be involved in it. It is, of course, unrealistic to suggest that action leading to a financial penalty can now be taken against any other individual.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mexico's small and medium sized enterprises account for more than 99% of the four million businesses in the country, generate 52% of GDP and provide 72% of employment. The government's business accelerator programme supports these SMEs by funding institutions that can help the sector grow by improving competitiveness, business opportunities and market scalability.</p> <p>One such business accelerator is the IDEARSE Center at Anahuac University in Mexico City. The centre's business model for SME acceleration is built around CSR, incorporating environmental impacts, human rights, self-regulation, social impacts and community involvement and stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>More remarkable still is that, by working with the supply chains of big brands such as Sony, Coca-Cola and Cemex and having trained more than 150 SMEs since 2007, the SMEs achieved sales growth of between 5% and 37% and jobs growth of between 5% and 19%. At the same time SME performance across all six CSR areas has improved between 23% and 46%. These numbers debunk several popular myths, most notably that CSR is not relevant, too expensive or not incentivised for SMEs. Let's look more closely at these myths.</p> <h2><strong>Is CSR relevant for SMEs?</strong></h2> <p>The issue of relevance largely hinges on whether you adopt a very literal and narrow interpretation of CSR. Laura Spence, director of the Royal Holloway, University of London's <a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/management/cris/\" title=\"\">Centre for Research into Sustainability</a>, says that the terminology of CSR is both inaccurate (as small firms are unlikely to be corporations) and off-putting jargon for SMEs.</p> <p>\"Also since CSR practice is often associated with reporting, SMEs don't stand a chance. They are unlikely to have external financial reports, let alone the time resources or need to produce a glossy CSR report,\" says Spence.</p> <p>So first, we need to get the labels and definitions right. The IDEARSE centre, for example, describes CSR as \"a permanent and continuous commitment, voluntarily adopted by the business, to respond to the economic, social and environmental impacts of its activities, and to guarantee the sustainable and human development to all its stakeholders.\" No doubt, it helps that CSR in Spanish (responsabilidad social empresarial or RSE) translates more accurately as socially responsible 'enterprise'.</p> <h2>Explicit or implicit CSR?</h2> <p>The second issue \u2013 whether CSR is too costly \u2013 is a real concern, but once again, it depends what we mean by CSR. Work by CSR academics Dirk Matten and Jeremy Moon distinguish between explicit and implicit CSR. Explicit CSR refers to many of the formalised practices we associate with large corporates, such as CSR codes, standards, managers, systems, reports and audits. These are resource intensive and mostly not feasible for SMEs.</p> <p>Implicit CSR, on the other hand, includes informal ethical practices that are not dependent on size or financial muscle. \"If you talk about the content of a socially responsible business \u2013 integrity, reputation, caring for employees, building relationships, community engagement \u2013 that is often simply an everyday part of SME life,\" Spence says. Many SMEs, thus, are practicing social responsibility without even knowing it or needing to give it a CSR label.</p> <p>Besides these implicit CSR practices, Itzel Lopez of the IDEARSE centre says that CSR is often crucial for SMEs because it can be \"a requirement imposed, not by the law, but by the market itself.\"</p> <p>She is referring to the growing practice of large companies in demanding ethical standards of their suppliers. Nike's supplier code of conduct and Walmart's supplier sustainability assessment are two cases that increasingly illustrate the rule rather than the exception.</p> <p>There is also a middle ground between too costly (explicit CSR) and business critical (supply chain compliance). As with CSR practiced by multinationals, SMEs can often find a business case in cost savings from eco-efficiency, especially from reductions in waste, water and energy. Furthermore, Lopez believes that \"CSR strategies can lend prestige and boost consumer confidence. They can also increase productivity by motivating employees and encourage loyalty.\"</p> <h2>Collaboration, values and frameworks</h2> <p>We should also not totally discount formalised CSR practices among SMEs. One of the things I observed when visiting the sugar plantations of Guatemala was that they had formed a cooperative of farms in order to tackle CSR. Individually, they were too small to justify a sustainable business programme, but collectively, it made sense. This is one of the ways that SMEs can address CSR, through pooling their resources and collaborating.</p> <p>On the issue of incentives, as most SMEs are owner-managed, the values of the director play a crucial role. My experience has been that most SME owners live in their communities and that responsibility often comes naturally to them. After all, they usually have to personally interact with their customers every day. The exceptions tend to be when SMEs are entirely set up for export and their employees are not also their customers. This not only creates worker dependency, but also low accountability for impacts on the community and environment.</p> <p>Besides the moral orientation of SME owners, governments can also help to create incentives for CSR adoption. It is no surprise that the IDEARSE centre was selected as one of the business accelerators in Mexico, since the government developed a national CSR standard in 2004 and has subsequently adopted ISO 26000 on social responsibility as a best practice guideline. Local support is also important. For instance, some years back I observed a local government agency in Scotland that had established a dedicated unit to offer free sustainable business advisory services to SMEs.</p> <p>But there is no denying that SMEs face many barriers \u2013 from alienating definitions and weak incentives to prohibitive costs and heavy-handed supply chain audits. But at least perceptions are changing, the evidence of benefits is mounting and helpful tools are increasingly available, such as the recently launched <a href=\"http://nbs.net/knowledge/primer-business-sustainability-for-smes/\" title=\"\">Primer on Business Sustainability for SMEs</a> and ACCA's report on <a href=\"http://www.accaglobal.com/content/dam/acca/global/PDF-technical/small-business/rr-128-001.pdf\" title=\"\">Environmental Aspects of Sustainability: SMEs and the Role of the Accountant</a>.</p> <p>I look forward to the day when pioneering British economist EF Schumacher's small is beautiful idiom applies as much to sustainable business as to economic activity. If Mexico's example is anything to go by, that day may come sooner than we expect.</p> <p><em>Wayne Visser is director of Kaleidoscope Futures and senior associate at the </em><a href=\"http://www.cpsl.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership</em></a><em>.

  "<p>On 15 April, 1989, the Hillsborough disaster took place - it led to 96 deaths and the publication today of a <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk\">major independent inquiry</a> into the events, the police actions and the subsequent cover-up.</p> <p>As part of the inquiry, <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/catalogue/index/organisation/all/outofscope/all/perpage/20/page/1.html\">thousands of documents have been released</a>, in one of the most organised official crowdsourcing exercises ever. And all as open data. </p> <p>It's a fascinating data dump and a great source for anyone interested in data journalism. This is my first take. </p> <p>There are 25,911 documents released today by the panel - over 450,000 pages published on its site, which also allows you to download the full catalogue, which we've done here. Unlike many official reports, the team have <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/open-data/\">signed up to open data in a big way</a> and have made the metadata publicly available, complete with links so the scraping of all the documents is made easier. There's also a guide to <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/open-data/taxonomy/\">what the headings mean</a>.</p> <p>What kinds of documents were they?</p> <p>The vast majority - 25,246 - were on paper; memos, letters and reports. These have now been digitised by the team at the Inquiry. There were also 297 photographs and 22 audio/visual reports, with a handful more on disk, and even ancient formats such as floppy disks and computer tapes.</p> <p></p> <p>12,905, half of all the documents, came from the South Yorkshire police, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-david-cameron-apologises\">which was heavily criticised</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The panel concluded that the main cause of the Hillsborough disaster was a \"failure in police control\" but also revealed \"multiple failures\" within other organisations that compromised crowd safety. It underlined the \"clear operational failure\" that led to the disaster and the attempts by South Yorkshire police (SYP) and the ambulance service to cover up their shortcomings. The fact that the ambulance service also altered statements from staff is revealed for the first time.</p> </blockquote> <p>The top ten also reveals who else provided information to the panel - the Home Office is second with nearly 5,000, followed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). </p> <p>Further down the list are News International (publishers of the Sun) who provided 9 documents, and the Thatcher archive, who sent in 12. Sir Bernard Ingham, Mrs Thatcher's press secretary who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/apr/12/tanked-up-mob-hillsborough-police-thatcher\">wrote that he learned of \"a tanked-up mob\" of Liverpool supporters outside the Hillsborough ground</a> provided 14.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdDBUV1IyWHZwSld5YllmWjVDRUhObFE&transpose=0&headers=1&range=A1%3AB11&gid=1&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"titleTextStyle\":{\"bold\":true,\"color\":\"#000\",\"fontSize\":\"20\"},\"series\":{\"0\":{\"color\":\"#cc0000\"}},\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"title\":\"Where the documents came from\",\"height\":276,\"animation\":{\"duration\":0},\"legend\":\"none\",\"width\":460,\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"textStyle\":{\"color\":\"#222\",\"fontSize\":\"7\"},\"viewWindow\":{}},\"isStacked\":false},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart3\"} </script> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Although the vast majority of the documents were written around the event itself in 1989, or immediately afterward, there are a smattering of documents form as far back as the 1970s, including details of the <a href=\"http://www.firesafe.org.uk/fire-safety-and-safety-of-places-of-sports/\">Wheatley report into safety at sports grounds in 1972</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdDBUV1IyWHZwSld5YllmWjVDRUhObFE&transpose=0&headers=1&range=O4%3AP501&gid=1&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"titleTextStyle\":{\"bold\":true,\"color\":\"#000\",\"fontSize\":\"20\"},\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"series\":{\"0\":{\"color\":\"#a61c00\"}},\"title\":\"When the documents were written\",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"curveType\":\"\",\"animation\":{\"duration\":0},\"legend\":\"none\",\"lineWidth\":2,\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},\"width\":460,\"height\":276},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"LineChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart1\"} </script> </figure>  <p></p> <p>This was written after the Ibrox Park disaster in Scotland where the steel barriers on a stairway gave way and sixty-six people were suffocated to death and many more injured in the resulting crush.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdDBUV1IyWHZwSld5YllmWjVDRUhObFE&transpose=0&headers=1&range=S2%3AT12&gid=1&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"titleTextStyle\":{\"bold\":true,\"color\":\"#000\",\"fontSize\":\"20\"},\"series\":{\"0\":{\"color\":\"#cc0000\"}},\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"title\":\"Top ten most mentioned people\",\"height\":276,\"animation\":{\"duration\":0},\"legend\":\"none\",\"width\":460,\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"textStyle\":{\"color\":\"#222\",\"fontSize\":\"7\"},\"viewWindow\":{}},\"isStacked\":false},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart2\"} </script> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The data also records who the documents are about, ie who is mentioned most. <a href=\"http://www.southyorks.police.uk/sites/default/files/foi/significantpublicinterest/interim%20report%20hillsborough.zip\">Lord Taylor, who conducted an inquiry into</a> the disaster, comes out top but after him are the much-criticised coroner Stefan Popper, the South Yorkshire Police chief constable Peter Wright and even then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Using Google Fusion Tables new network tool, we've tried to visualise the networks of documents and the people they referred to.

  "<p>Ubisoft has always been the most creative and experimental of the major publishers, willing to bet millions of euros and hundreds of staff on mega-concept brands like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs.</p> <p>Over the past few years it has also been taking increasing notice of the digital sector, bringing back classics such as Rayman as downloadable console titles, while introducing free-to-play versions of console blockbusters such as Ghost Recon. </p> <p>On the verge of a new console generation, and with a range of interesting digital projects on its books (including the promising Mighty Quest For Epic Loot), Ubisoft is gearing up for an unpredictable and challenging future. So what are its plans, and how important will digital distribution be? We spoke to the company's chief executive, Yves Guillemot, to find out.<br><br><strong>Last week, Ubisoft held a big digital gaming event in Paris, and you had plenty of big online, smartphone and free-to-play titles on show. Is digital already a major part of your business, or is this really only the beginning?</strong><br>It's the beginning for us, it's going to grow very quickly over the next couple of years. </p> <p><strong>My favourite title at the event was Mighty Quest For Epic loot, which is your first new free-to-play IP. Some people are saying that all games will be free to play in the future. What do you think?</strong><br>Free-to-play is one model; it's just a different way to monetise games. I believe that all the models will co-exist with different types of experiences. Free-to-play is working very well, and we're going for it because in some countries, especially in Asia, it's the only model. But we will continue to make console and high-end PC games. </p> <p><strong>You're bringing the Ghost Recon brand to every platform, from console to tablets to social networks. Is that the inevitable future for your titles \u2013 huge multi-platform roll-outs?</strong><br>Yes, the goal is to reach more consumers. We went from 300 million to 1 billion to more than a billion customers and the newcomers were from tablets and other platforms. The goal is to make sure our brands are platform agnostic. We're trying to make sure all gamers know about our games, and that they get an experience that's adapted to the format they play on.</p> <p><strong>Do you think this will lead to a future of seamless cross-platform play \u2013 of persistent experience across console, phones and tablets?</strong><br>You should be able use whatever device you have, wherever you are, to continue a game. What I see for the future is that you'll be able to take console and PC titles wherever you are, whether that's the full experience or [a modified experience for smartphones] where you can prepare for the main game or react to things happening in the world.</p> <p>If a game is always on, friends may have done something in the game world, and you need to react. We want to provide the possibility of being connected to game worlds and to act on a regular basis, either with friends or alone. Not every game will do it, but it's a feature that's needed \u2013 we all have smartphones and tablets and we want to be able to use those devices to interact with the experience. We need to be able to compete with friends either synchronously or asynchronously. It makes things much more fun and interesting.</p> <p><strong>Are the new models and new platforms changing the way you design and green light games at Ubisoft?</strong><br>We need to adapt to these new phenomena \u2013 it's different from console where you create the content and deliver it whole. With digital games, we will have to make sure we can react quickly and change the experience and we have to create all the systems so that we can understand what is going on; we need to know why people are stopping playing at certain points. That's something we've been working on for the last three years \u2013 not just listen to what players say, but see what they do.</p> <p><strong>With the next console generation approaching, and a new era of very wide cross-platform release schedules, do you think you'll be making fewer titles?</strong><br>With next gen consoles, it's going toward bigger games, and yes, we will make less of them. But with free-to-play games, the teams aren't as big so we can try different things and find subjects that are of interest to consumers. We announced Mighty Quest for Epic Loot last week, and we are announcing new types of games. This new environment is actually giving us the chance \u2013 because we're reaching new consumers \u2013 to develop new types of game brand and experience. What I like about the FTP model is that you are with your consumers all the time \u2013 you can spend six months refining the gameplay and then put it in another environment, another title, because you automatically know it works well.</p> <p><strong>So you'll be able to take proven game systems and ideas out of free-to-play titles and put them in other projects because the notions have been tested?</strong><br>You've already had feedback from gamers. You can use those features in other types of games. </p> <p><strong>Ubisoft has also used digital platforms to explore its legacy brands such as Rayman and Prince of Persia. Do you see this continuing? I mean, there are a lot of people who would love to see another Beyond Good and Evil game. Could Beyond Good and Evil 2 come out as a digital release?</strong><br>You never know. It could happen! It's a fact that you don't have to create a game that's very long, you can take different risks with games.</p> <p><strong>What are you expecting from the next generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles?</strong><br>I think what happens this time will be like what happened in the past. Generally, next generation consoles pick up what's interesting in the world around them \u2013 they look at what the PC experiences are, what the mobile experiences are, they look at the social elements \u2026 and then manufacturers come up with a unit that you can put in front put the TV but that takes advantage of all the innovations that have happened since the last generation, and at a price that is accessible. So for sure, the machines will be more powerful, but we can expect this generation \u2013 because they took quite a long time! \u2013 to actually come with something really new, really interesting that will boost the market enormously.</p> <p><strong>How will they be different?</strong><br>You have a glimpse at what could happen with SmartGlass from Microsoft. Microsoft is also moving in to mobile \u2013 we can look at what they and Google are doing \u2013 those guys are trying to consider the universe we inhabit. Being connected, playing with your friends on any device \u2013 consoles can continue to improve that experience and make sure it's more believable, that you're immersed in those worlds. The potential is there, with everything that's been created in the last seven years, to give us new sensations. </p> <p><strong>With Wii U, Nintendo is betting on this new idea of dual-screen entertainment, the theory that we're all interacting with both a large screen display and a smaller personal device simultaneously now. Is that going to be a big part of the future?</strong><br>Yes, there are two factors there. You can play on the small screen when the large one is taken. but also there's the possibility of having different gameplay for different people, depending on what screen they're watching. It's not only playing together, it's having a different experiences in the same world. We see lots of new very interesting possibilities with the Wii U: you can adapt the game to the different levels of know-how among your players. So a father who is not as agile as his kid could be doing a part of the game that is complimentary, that doesn't require speed. This will develop \u2013 it's the whole idea of complimentary activities. And that's just one facet. There are a lot of changes coming, starting with the Wii U.</p> <p><strong>How about Ubisoft's approach to smartphone and portable console development going forward?</strong><br>Starting with putting Assassin's Creed on Vita, what we see is that those machines will be able to play big, epic adventure games \u2013 you will see more of those games from Ubisoft coming on mobile platforms. Rayman is on iPhone and iPad and Android \u2013 this is something created on console but all the graphics and animations have been moved onto the other machines. </p> <p><strong>You're very optimistic about it all, but the digital era brings with it a lot of problems. For example, gamers are still somewhat suspicious about the free-to-play model \u2026</strong><br>It's a new type of game \u2013 you have to change the way you think. There can be misunderstandings about the type of monestisations in place \u2013 some mobile games push you very quickly to buy something. But we see that, the longer people can play without having to play, the more we actually monetise. It shows that if you provide a good experience it will bring in more people and a greater number of these players will eventually want to show they have, say, a better costume than others, or will want different items than the others.</p> <p>We don't look at the first steps toward free-to-play, we're looking at what it will be in the long term. The goal will be to make sure you want to stay in that environment, to be with your friends, to be able to help your friends progress. The first goal is always to make sure the experience is interesting. And, as I've said, everything we learn there we can use in console games. After a year you can be so confident, you can optimise it so well, the experience becomes perfect.</p> <p><strong>And you've just closed your first big digital controversy \u2013 your very unpopular always-on DRM. Is that a sign that you're developing a new approach to the industry as it evolves?</strong><br>In fact, when you look at it, we changed our system in June last year and we thought everyone would see it \u2013 but that wasn't the case. People now understand that one-time activation is what's been happening for more than a year. The goal is to make sure we can create content that will be paid for; everything we've been trying to do, which hasn't always been popular, is to make sure we give our creative staff more to put into their games \u2013 the higher the revenue, the better the games can be.</p> <p>But we saw that it caused problems and we've made it lighter. Our systems are no different than what we see with other companies. We have to make sure our customers are happy. We weren't happy about the trouble. From the beginning, the goal of this company has been to make sure gamers are pleased.</p>",
  "<h2>Email from Colin Church to Miriam Maes, DECC Official, 15 September 2010 17:06, RE: Engaging with stakeholders and departments </h2> <p>\u2026 There is one other issue I wanted to mention. I know the team are keen to share the full range of our work with you to maximise their use of your experience.</p> <p>However, we are of course speaking to a range of outside contacts, where the parties concerned may have concerns on the level of disclosure of commercially sensitive material. While likely in only a very few cases, we will need to take a case by case judgement on whether (and if so under what constraints) we can share such material with you to balance the concerns of others with our desire to maximise your input, all in order to meet our need to see a wide range of quality evidence. I am sure you will understand this and am of course very happy to discuss.</p> <p><em>Question: as early as September 2010, Decc officials were politely warning Maes about the sensitivities of her role as a DECC adviser. Was Barker also warned?</em></p> <h2>Email from Miriam Maes to DECC Official (cc: Colin Church), 6 November 2010 17:52, RE: DECC Delivery Advisor \u2014 Invoices for Sept/October</h2> <p>Thank you for your email and please find my response in red below. <strong>[Note \u2013 these are indicated in bold in the following email]</strong></p> <p>I wish to inform you that I have not been counting any travel time or weekend/evening work I have undertaken for DECC, something I would do under any other Foresee Consultancy contract. I have also not counted any of my PA's time or administrative and other expenses to limit the amounts charged to DECC.</p> <p>Equally, I have not counted a number of meetings with Private Sector companies, NGO's and other institutions which have approached me on the 10% initiative. In summary, I have charged less hours and costs than actually spent.</p> <p>I trust that we can come to a satisfactorily conclusion quickly.</p> <h2>Email from DECC Official to Miriam Maes 05 November 2010 13:16: RE DECC Delivery Advisor \u2014 Invoices for Sept/October </h2> <p>Thank you for the invoice. I need to raise a few issues.</p> <p>[]</p> <p>I must ask you to resubmit the invoice having deleted two items more related to your direct relationship with Ministers. These are 3 hours on 6 October accompanying the Minister to a renewables conference, and an hour on 11 October meeting the Minister and Lord Marland.</p> <p><strong>Both meetings took place upon request of the minister. The first one was close to Birmingham and was organised by DECC. Greg asked me to accompany him , so that no DECC official needed to travel to join the minister. The second meeting was a general introduction meeting on request of Greg for which I came to DECC.</strong></p> <p><strong>Can you please advise me on how I can get paid for meetings for which the minister is asking me to be present?</strong></p> <p><em>Question: why was Maes accompanying Barker on a ministerial visit without a Decc official present? Who was at the \"general introduction meeting\"? Was it one of Maes's clients?</em></p> <h2>Email from DECC Official to Miriam Maes, 02 March 2011 10:40, Working Together</h2> <p>\u2026 it would be very useful to be copied your advice to Greg in same we share our advice with you. I trust you would agree that it is not efficient, effective or indeed fair, for me or my team to be in meetings where we are basing our support to GB or SoS on one briefing, if they are working to another briefing we have not seen before.</p> <p>Of course you will and should advise GB as you see fit, including where you disagree with our advice or on how you think we are approaching issues, but we need to see to either amend our briefing or be clear on where we differ and why.</p> <p>Besides providing clarity we do need to watch the 'audit trail' for decisions as it will be me and my management answering challenging select committee questions!</p> <p><em>Question: by March, 2011, Decc officials were also asking Maes to copy them in on any advice being given to Barker. Maes was contracted as an advisor to Decc, not to Barker personally, so why didn't the official put her straight on this?</em></p> <h2>Email from Miriam Maes to DECC Officials, 25 November 2010 12:19, RE: Update Actions Funding work stream 21112010</h2> <p>Great update! Thank you! My only addition is that I would also or try to organise a meeting with [ ]. I have also met with [ ], who have agreed to share contract info and would appreciate a short meeting with Greg in return. The more I think of it, the more I think that these meetings are useful as the energy services companies have a lot of interesting experiences top share and they have helpful ideas on how to deliver an energy savings programme in the wider public sector.</p> <p><em>Question: who was Maes lining up meetings with? Were any of them her consultancy clients? Why was she suggesting that these people would \"share contract info\" in exchange for a meeting with Barker? How did the Decc official respond?</em></p> <h2>Email from Miriam Maes to Gregory Barker, 06 February 2011 14:50, Meeting with Air Products</h2> <p>This week we discussed briefly the request by one of my clients Air Products to meet with you. Air Products Vice President Energy is coming to Europe on the week after the February recess (commencing 28th February).</p> <p>I am excited about their new High Temperature Gasification Energy from Waste Plant, which will provide 50 MW of base load, mostly renewable power, classifying for double ROC's. I have been working with Air Products on this project since over a year and am impressed by their technology and the progress they are making to build their first plant in the UK.</p> <p>Air Products is advancing with their planning permission at T side and have secured their waste contract.

  "<p>Apple's September announcement is a familiar annual ritual \u2013 an electronic delicacy emerges after months of hints and anticipation. Rumblings from the supply chain reflect the birth of a new device. Sneak peeks leak from parts manufacturers, foretelling form and components. A shipping partner calls all hands on deck for a \"surge volume\" event that coincides suspiciously with a launch countdown pattern. Behind the scenes, a vast industrial footprint underpins the sleek object soon to reach retail.</p> <p>Apple's booming (and now looming) success represents the sustainability challenge in microcosm. How to prevent product demand from translating into an environmental <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boondoggle_%28project%29\" title=\"\">boondoggle - a project that wastes time and money</a>? The <a href=\"http://www.egg2012.de/\" title=\"\">Electronics Goes Green</a> (EGG) conference, now wrapping up in Berlin, makes visible how eager makers are to crack the challenge. Trimming lifecycle impact is <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/gadgets/6232571/Gadget-sales-to-top-1-2-trillion-in-2012\" title=\"\">no small matter in an industry defined by rapid refreshes of resource-intensive products that generate over $1tn in sales annually</a>.</p> <p>Amid vigorous debates plumbing fascinating depths of wonkdom, a recurring theme emerged in the German capital: the challenge of carrying lifecycle considerations on the long path to market and through end-of-life. Manufacturers already made great engineering strides toward sustainability, most tangibly by reducing energy use and making ever smaller products. But for many of today's most popular products, material use is where the majority of environmental impacts now reside. <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/environment/reports/\" title=\"\">Today's notebooks can contain a bigger material footprint than a similarly configured all-in-one desktop</a>.</p> <p>Rare earth metals, used in everything from smartphones to wind turbines, are a prime challenge in both reality and perception. Their use in relatively small quantities obscures how much energy they require to produce, compounded by finite reserves in relatively few countries, an instability variable that invites comparisons to the oil sector. Factor in concerns over extraction residuals from metals of all kinds, such as the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11492387\" title=\"\">2010 red mud disaster</a> in Hungary, and the importance of promoting a stewards-eye view of product design becomes clearer. Legacy materials like lead-laden CRT TVs are poster children for design choices that will bear on the environment for years to come.</p> <p>There is a growing recognition that material usage decisions have end-to-end consequences, which should brighten the prospects for applying ecological principles and new business models that support them. What would this look like? First, it would favour product longevity \u2013 disposability is an obvious waste of resources and even rapid recycling pales in comparison to a physical product that stands the test of time. Second, resource reusability would ease the intense burden of extraction, the value proposition is especially strong with metals, given their inherent recyclability. Third, taking a holistic approach to accounting for full costs would focus product teams on a sustainable range of design choices.</p> <p>So how do we get there?</p> <p>Disclosure and truth telling are always welcome steps. Though Apple faced ample scrutiny this spring for its contractor workplace practices,<a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/08/21/foxconn_makes_strides_in_workplace_conditions_takes_284_remedial_actions.html\" title=\"\"> its subsequent actions</a> and <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/environment/reports/\" title=\"\">plain-language reports</a> on products dating back to 2008 shine a light in the right direction. Consistent, comparable measures like material efficiency are the result of high-level executive commitment to demonstrate lifecycle focus. Just as important is perseverance, letting time and consistency work their compounding magic.</p> <p>Another promising path proposed by industry leaders at EGG was to distil production knowledge into real-time informatics that report manufacturing, sourcing and usage scenarios to simplify comparison of alternative designs. To my eye, this resembles 'building information modelling', a decision-making tool now shaping the future of construction. A similar approach in electronics would be powerful but fraught with complexity; still, it is a hopeful direction.</p> <p>The common thread is the importance of shifting priorities to act on different information \u2013 as once it was commonplace to use lead in televisions and let them languish in landfills, now we know the sun must set on these practices. The next consciousness shift will require a comprehensive view of our technology, its place in our shared ecology and the vision to commit ourselves to make the change stick.</p> <p><em>Jeremy Jones is a planning analyst based in Minnesota, where he evaluates program and policy for </em><a href=\"http://hennepin.us/portal/site/HennepinUS/menuitem.b1ab75471750e40fa01dfb47ccf06498/?vgnextoid=080c2d651fbb4210VgnVCM10000049114689RCRD\" title=\"\"><em>Hennepin County Environmental Services</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The first \"contract\" between rural England and the government has pledged to drive economic growth in country areas by delivering superfast broadband and supporting business to create new jobs.</p> <p>\"Rural economic growth is vital for this country,\" said environment secretary, Owen Paterson, in his first statement since taking the post after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/04/environment-owen-paterson-spelman-reshuffle\" title=\"\">government's recent reshuffle</a>.</p> <p>\"The government's role is ensure that rural areas have all the infrastructure they need to grow. Businesses should then be free from the unnecessary government red tape that has got in the way of rural economic growth in the past.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/09/12/rural-growth/\" title=\"\">20-page rural statement</a> published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), sets out the government's measures to boost rural business in order, say ministers, to enable communities to hold them to account.</p> <p>Harry Cotterell, president of the Country Land &amp; Business Association, welcomed the statement: \"Long-term sustainability and the competitiveness of rural businesses are crucial in the present economic climate. It is vital Defra understands the needs and interests of rural businesses as well as those who live and work in rural areas.\"</p> <p>Rural campaigners also welcomed the statement but said they were disappointed by the sidelining of environmental issues. \"As with much of current government thinking, the statement is limited by its assumption that economic development is unrelated to the natural environment,\" said Neil Sinden, director of policy and campaigns at the Campaign to Protect Rural England. \"Only by putting the environment at the centre of measures to achieve social and economic progress will the government help to support a sustainable future for rural areas.\"</p> <p>Nearly 10 million people \u2013 20% of England's population \u2013 live in rural areas, which make up 86% of the area of the country and 28% of the nation's businesses. The statement includes measures for farming, forestry, holiday homes, rural post offices and village pubs, as well as the broadband internet programme. On Wednesday, Paterson visited Garsdale and Dentdale in Cumbria, one of the first communities to be given funding for superfast fibreoptic broadband from the government's \u00a320m rural community broadband fund.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Maria Miller, said: \"Superfast broadband is key to the economic prosperity of rural communities. The government is investing \u00a3680 million in delivering the best broadband in Europe - and we are slashing red tape to get the programme moving quickly.\"</p> <p>Prof Mark Shucksmith, director of the Newcastle Institute for Social Renewal, said the statement was a welcome reassertion of the coalition government's commitment to rural communities. \"However, there is an air of unreality about this account in the face of what rural people are currently experiencing. Services are under great pressure as council budgets are subject to major cuts.\"</p> <p>Mary Creagh, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said: \"People in rural areas are feeling the impact of this weak and incompetent government's failed economic plan. We a need plan B for the countryside to tackle the rural cost of living crisis, protect buses and social services, and invest in green jobs and growth.\"</p>",
  "<p>Universities are currently experiencing an unprecedented volume, velocity and variety of change. In commissioning contributions for the 2012 UK edition of Blue Skies, Pearson Think Tank's collection of essays on HE, it became apparent that the drivers for change can be group under the following headings: funding, quality, fairness, and technology.</p> <p>Indicating the degree to which change is needed in HE funding, Ken Starkey, a professor at Nottingham University Business School, argues that <a href=\"http://pearsonblueskies.com/2012/university-narrative-lessons-from-the-financial-crisis/\" title=\"\">universities need a new narrative that places themselves, rather than banks, as the true engines of growth</a>. Such a narrative could not be more timely, as around the world the cost-sharing mix for university funding is changing, with the burden shifting from public sources to private ones (parents, students, businesses and donors). The UK has just experienced one of the biggest such shifts, despite already spending less than the OECD average. Universities minister, <a href=\"http://pearsonblueskies.com/2012/putting-students-first/\" title=\"\">David Willetts, has often defended these developments </a> as the only sustainable funding option in the long-term \u2013 and one that is attracting significant interest from other countries. Yet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/06/browne-report-higher-education-reforms?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">tripling student loans has raised public finance fears</a>, with student number controls the primary method of defence against over-exposure.</p> <p>So do these changes constitute revolution or evolution? With institutions responding in a variety of ways, some slashing staff and courses, there are many in the UK who fear the former. But reaching a firm conclusion is difficult as it seems the much maligned HE White Paper is unlikely to result in a parliamentary bill. What is clear though is that uncertainty around funding is hampering the ability of both families and institutions to plan for the future.</p> <p>When it comes to quality, the perceived risks of private for-profit providers free-riding on the wider academic community, as well as identifying an appropriate role for employers, remain key issues. Such changes are not new, harking back to fundamental questions about what university is for and who it serves. As ever, there are no simple answers, and the sector continues to serve a multitude of masters and purposes.</p> <p>For me, the key indicators of quality to watch over time are the course choices of applicants, the destinations of graduates and softer measures such as wellbeing. I'm confident that the sector will continue to focus on high quality provision and that this will help dictate the pace and degree of change \u2013 rather than the reverse: the pace of change leading to a fall in quality.</p> <p>Social mobility and fairness also remain key drivers of change. To some the sector is a launch-pad that enables disadvantaged young people to improve their situation. To others, it is an elitist ivory tower that cements advantage over time. <a href=\"http://pearsonblueskies.com/2012/fair-access/\" title=\"\">Personally, I agree with Tessa Stone of the Bridge Group</a> when she says that the sector needs to do better than the patchy, and often poor, guidance it currently provides, the variable and confusing admissions policies that rarely makes good use of valuable contextual data.</p> <p>Arguments about excellence and global competition do not seem sufficient if fairness is forgotten. Similarly, placing the blame for poor performance only at the door schools feels like a cop-out. Given high rates of unemployment addressing fairness \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 is only likely to increase in importance, though sadly the revolution that many hope for currently feels unaffordable.</p> <p>The last area of note is the role of technology, which for many might hold the key to solving the other three issues. Though <a href=\"http://pearsonblueskies.com/2012/seven-predictions-for-technology-enabled-higher-education/\" title=\"\">the technological revolution in higher education</a> is only beginning, staff and students are already better connected than ever before, making learning an increasingly social and virtual enterprise.</p> <p>A key outcome of these developments will be a huge increase in the data produced by higher education, in ever more open and accessible formats. This will include linked data about research, learning resources, the curriculum taught, assessment, achievement and performance. Although we are currently data rich and analysis poor this situation will begin to change as new technologies, systems and training help us capitalise on this wealth of data in ways we cannot yet imagine. Learning will become more personalised and could achieve better outcomes than ever before \u2013 as hinted by some early studies into 'flipped classrooms' and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/08/mooc-coursera-higher-education-investment?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">US MOOC initiatives</a>.</p> <p>These changes will not only have an impact on accountability by informing policy and practice with better evidence, but will allow for a real revolution in efficiency and innovation. Despite some fears of a two-tier system (created as a result of increased specialisation and competition), technology also has the potential to dramatically improve access by offering high quality and cost-effective higher education for all. Although hyperbole is rife at the moment \u2013 as some fear that we are entering an edtech bubble \u2013 ultimately it is technology that promises to be the most revolutionary driver of change in higher education.</p> <p>There is much hype of revolution, much of it will not filter through to reality.

  "<p>The greatest danger <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\" title=\"\">up here on the Arctic ice</a> is not getting lost or separated, falling in the water or freezing, but polar bears. At this time of year they hunt across the ice floes and are likely to come close out of curiosity. Already we have seen several on floes.</p> <p>Travelling with us \u2013 with a rifle \u2013 is Roland Hansen, a recently disbanded Danish soldier who has finished 26 months patrolling Denmark's remote 3,000km coastline in northern Greenland with the unique Sirius dog sledge teams.</p> <p>Taking tents, rifles, maps, satellite phones and enough food for days, six teams of two men, each with 13 dogs, travel continuously 5,000-6,000km a year between drop-off points where they have prepositioned supplies.</p> <blockquote> \"Bears travel big distances, they can swim hundreds of miles, from Greenland as far as Iceland. They are a constant presence in northern Greenland. We know mostly where they are. In November and December it's dark so we seldom see them. The sun rises in February and then they are there. <br> \"They like to go round us about 500-1,000m away. They are curious about what we are doing. They hear the dogs and smell us. They can come too close so we scare them off with flare guns. We do everything we can to avoid confrontations. They can move 50-60kph, whereas we can only do 10kph on our sledges.\" </blockquote> <p>When a bear attacks \u2013 which is rarely says Hansen \u2013 it will often be a young one, two or three years old whose mother has left it and who cannot find food to eat. \"He may be ill, not know his limits. We only shoot them at a 15-metre distance,\" he says.</p> <blockquote> \"Each team perhaps has to shoot one only every four or five years, whereas some Inuit communities have licences to kill 30 a year for food. I have never eaten bear. <br> \"We are quite likely to see them. I will patrol the floe. I would expect to see them. They hunt on the edges of the floes.\" </blockquote> <p>What he does not have with him are his dogs. These Greenlandic huskies, he says, are remarkable for their strength, stamina and loyalty. One of his, called Armstrong, is 12 years old and has pulled sledges over 100,000km.</p> <blockquote> <br>\"They are really well looked after. We depend on them for everything. They are our way of living. Without them we could never do the 3,000km journeys we do. They enable you to go places that snowmobiles would never let you. Each team has a top dog, which is like your right arm. You are very connected to all them.\" </blockquote> <p>The relationship with the other man in the team is equally important.</p> <blockquote> \"There's just the two of you, out there in the wilderness. My buddy is my doctor, my dentist, everything. He must be able to operate on me and I on him. We need to connect.\" </blockquote>",
  "<p>The differences in fundraising and charitable giving in different countries and cultures can give fundraisers pause for thought. As many countries are throwing off the old orders, how can fundraisers take advantage of new opportunities?</p> <p>Mark Cook of <a href=\"http://movingthinking.com/\" title=\"\">Moving Thinking </a>tells a story of the experiences of his uncle, an English ex-pat living in a small village in rural Thailand. The local temple regularly requests donations from people living in the village to fund small things like building a new shack for a destitute villager, refurbishing a classroom in the village school or helping a family with medical bills.</p> <p>The interesting part of the system is the attitude to donor privacy \u2013 or lack of it. In the centre of the village is a telegraph pole with a loud speaker attached to it for important public announcements. The temple uses this to announce the names of everyone that supports the current fundraiser, along with how much they've given. And they make these announcements loudly and often. The effect is powerful. Donors feel publicly recognised and feel good about doing it again. As a resident it is very hard to avoid donating (your neighbours will know and chastise you).</p> <p>A specific sum is usually requested and you must give around that sum or people will think you're mean. The wealthy villagers will often give high amounts to get the kudos of giving the most. It's a system that seems to work, but for a reserved Englishman it's excruciating. It tells us a lot about our expectations that our giving remain private and the comfort that affords.</p> <p>Sustainability is an issue in the Arab world. Atallah Kuttab, founder and chairman of <a href=\"http://saaned.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=72\" title=\"\">SAANED for Philanthropy Advisory</a> in the Arab Region, says: \"Fundraising in the Arab world is nascent and complex \u2013 intertwining between regulatory and religious, both in fundraising and service delivery. In some Arab countries, making a charitable donation to help those in another country can be illegal if it is outside the sanction of the government and if you do this you can get into big trouble. But people still give. In the move to strategic giving we are asking governments to relax rules on giving so strategic giving is easier.\"</p> <p>On the religious side, Islam has three ways of giving. Foremost and most ingrained in Islam's attitude to philanthropy is zakat where you are required to give a certain percentage (usually 2.5%) of your wealth above the amount you need to live on to charity. Indeed, there is an argument whether this should be seen as 'charity' or is more a 'right' of poor people.</p> <p>Then there is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf\" title=\"\">waqf</a>, which is similar to an endowment in Judaeo/Christian religion. Indeed, waqf is the forerunner of western giving, having been introduced by returning crusaders. There are guidelines as to how much you can give and where it should go. You must state what you are giving, what the intent is and who is the beneficiary. For example, you might give a sum of money to build a hospital to help the people of a certain city.</p> <p>Thirdly is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadaqah\" title=\"\">sadaqa</a>, \"voluntary charity' which is flexible \u2013 how much you want to give out on top of zakat \u2013 for public benefit. It might be donating money, volunteering or sponsoring an orphan. Atallah says: \"The religious side to giving is self-driving and you cannot do much with it, but you can find ways.\"</p> <p>In Libya now there is legislation being discussed for charities and Islamic ways of giving, but it is early days. One encouraging development is that whereas before the Arab Spring most Arab 'family' giving went to support causes on their doorsteps, it has recently been mobilised to support the opposition movements that toppled the Libyan regime, and the same seems to be happening in Syria. Atallah says: \"It was very moving to hear the story of the young Libyan living in Turkey who sold all the property he had inherited to fund the medical treatment of Libyans arriving in Turkey from Misrata in Libya and mobilised thousands of dollars from the Libyan diaspora and from people across the Arab region.\"</p> <p>It is clear that each region around the world has different cultures, channels, modes of interpersonal relationships (particularly about charity) and different infrastructures. Thus each region has different lessons to teach the rest of the world about fundraising. In tune with this, the <a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/pages/en/ifc.html\">International Fundraising Congress </a>for the first time ever, this year will be introducing specific sessions offering new perspectives, case studies and insights on fundraising from different geographical areas around the globe including Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.</p> <p>These sessions have been design to allow fundraisers to learn from others how best to overcome regional challenges, enabling them to successfully raise funds and friends to solve global problems. Neelam Makhijani, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/\" title=\"\">Resource Alliance </a>highlights \"There are fundraisers from over 60 different countries that come to the IFC which brings together such diversity. At this year's Congress, we are showcasing amazing fundraising stories from small and medium sized NGOs from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle east. These stories will touch you, inspire you and will be a great source for learning. It is vital to the sector that fundraisers come together from across the globe to learn from each other and take advantage of different approaches. By doing this we can help create a strong and sustainable civil society for the future.\"</p> <p><em>Jon Shepherd is head of marketing and communications at the Resource Alliance, which is organising the </em><a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/pages/en/ifc.html\" title=\"\"><em>International Fundraising Congress</em></a><em> in Amsterdam from 16-19 October this year. </em></p> <p><em>This article is sponsored by</em><a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/\" title=\"\"><em> the Resource Alliance</em></a><em>, which organises the </em><a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/pages/en/ifc.html\" title=\"\"><em>International Fundraising Congress</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

Most of my colleagues are neither terribly bright nor terribly hardworking. As this is my first experience of corporate life I'm puzzled and want to know: is it me? Is it them?

Do you have memories of a first job in a professional environment? Were you, as a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed new employee, disappointed by the culture you found?

  "<p>Frogs and other amphibians are being wiped out at such a rapid rate across Asia that many are going extinct before scientists even have a chance to identify them as new species, biologists warned at <a href=\"http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/\" title=\"\">an international conservation meeting in South Korea</a> this week.</p> <p>The scale of the destruction \u2013 caused by habitat loss, disease, pollution and other factors \u2013 is hard to quantify, but scientists fear the result will be disastrous. Amphibians have been suffering a wave of devastation all around the world, in part because of the spread of the fungal disease <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, known as BD or chytrid fungus, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/03/panamanian-golden-frog\" title=\"\">which has wiped out whole populations within the space of a few years</a>.</p> <p>But while conservation and monitoring efforts have so far focused on the Americas and Europe, little work has yet been done in the world's most populous continent, with the result that many amphibian species there are as yet uncatalogued and unstudied. For instance, according to one researcher, there are probably at least three to four times as many amphibian species in India alone as are currently catalogued.</p> <p>\"These creatures are disappearing before we even know they exist. We know this is happening \u2013 this has already been shown in cases such as Sri Lanka,\" said Bruce Waldman, associate professor at Seoul National University in Korea. \"These are living jewels \u2013 but we don't know even how many we have, and we are not saving them.\"</p> <p>He said rapid economic development in Asia was taking a toll on amphibians, with an increase in the level of nitrogen pollution in the water, from fertiliser use, and habitats being rapidly destroyed.</p> <p>He called for an urgent approach to the problem in Asia and across the world: \"We need to very quickly address the global crisis in amphibians.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/16/amphibians-terrifying-extinction-threat\" title=\"\">Frogs and other amphibians are among the most threatened creatures in the world today</a> \u2013 globally, at least a third, probably 40%, of amphibian species are in urgent danger of extinction, making a total of more than 2,000 species of amphibian so far documented to be officially \"threatened\", \"endangered\" or \"vulnerable\", classifications used by scientists to describe the level of threat. \"This is higher than any other terrestrial animal,\" said Jaime Garc\u00eda-Moreno, executive director of the <a href=\"http://amphibiansurvivalalliance.org/\" title=\"\">Amphibian Survival Alliance</a>.</p> <p>The plight of frogs and other amphibians is of particular concern to scientists because many think the devastation afflicting them could be a foretaste of that in waiting for other creatures. Their physiognomy makes amphibians particularly sensitive to small changes in their environment, including temperature changes such as global warming, and to water and air pollution.</p> <p>This sensitivity, some scientists believe, could be behind the sudden and unexpected extinction of certain species even from well-protected areas. Waldman pointed to the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3172/0\" title=\"\">golden toad of Costa Rica</a> which \"disappeared from a pristine habitat\".</p> <p>Garc\u00eda-Moreno said that the loss of frog species could have knock-on effects not just on biodiversity and the food chain, but on human development. He pointed to research that has identified naturally occurring chemicals, such as skin secretions from frogs, that can be turned into medicine to treat human beings.</p> <p>\"Amphibians play a very important role in ecosystems \u2013 they are a conveyor of energy and nutrients from very small animals to larger animals,\" he said. \"They are natural pest controllers too. Some have chemicals in their skins that can be useful to medical treatments, such as cancer and perhaps Aids. We must try to conserve these creatures.\"</p> <p>Scientists could also learn more about the deadly chytrid disease from studying Asia, noted Mi-Sook Min, research professor at Seoul National University. Some indicators suggest the disease could even have come from the continent, as most cases to date have been found in other continents which may indicate a long history in Asia whereby amphibians have evolved to live with the disease. However, there are also indications in other research that the disease could have been existing in Latin America since the 1880s.</p> <p>Waldman emphasised: \"We just don't know \u2013 in fact the Asian crisis [over the disease] may be even worse [than in other, better documented areas] but we just don't have enough information. We are overwhelmed by our ignorance.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396043787\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/30/1346327916124/Map---spread-of-chytrid-d-001.png\" alt=\"Map - spread of chytrid disease in Central America\" width=\"460\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map - spread of chytrid disease in Central America</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Global trade, including the pet trade but also commerce more generally, has helped the fungus to spread widely. In some afflicted areas, frog populations plummeted by 95% in less than a decade. The fungus appears to disrupt fluid and electrolyte balance in frogs, depleting their sodium and potassium levels and causing cardiac arrest and death, <a href=\"http://www.sfsu.edu/~news/prsrelea/fy12/039.html\" title=\"\">according to research</a> from the University of California, Berkeley, and the San Francisco State University.</p> <p>Garc\u00eda-Moreno said some areas of trade were badly monitored. For instance, millions of frogs' legs are sold, imported and exported around the world today for human consumption, with few restrictions or monitoring. He called for tighter controls.</p> <p>The scientists, presenting their work at the World Conservation Congress, the quadrennial meeting of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, in Jeju this week, called for more research into amphibians in Asia as a matter of urgency.</p>",
  "<p>If Muammar Gaddafi were still alive, he might give a bitter laugh at the news that the US ambassador to Libya has been killed in Benghazi. Hosni Mubarak, in his prison hospital, would growl a wry \"I told you so\" after the attack on the fortress-like American embassy in Cairo.</p> <p>Two onslaughts in two of the cities that witnessed the historic drama of the Arab spring last year do not an Islamist winter make. But both underline the glowering and dangerous presence of the sort of radical Muslim fundamentalists whom the old regimes kept at bay and are now free to pursue their agendas. Gaddafi and Mubarak may have been unreconstructed dictators but, by and large, they did Washington's bidding while presenting themselves as the guardians of stability. And US diplomats were usually safe.</p> <p>Libya is the more disturbing case. On a day when Gaddafi's democratically elected heirs were due to announce a new prime minister, it will be infuriating to have global attention diverted to the Salafi extremists who killed an American official who was instrumental in helping overthrow a hated tyrant. It will also highlight the grave problem of security as the authorities in Tripoli struggle to create a national police force and disarm militias.</p> <p>Conspiracy theories are common in the Middle East, but it was surely no coincidence that these incidents took place on 11 September \u2013 a date that will be associated with the notion of an inevitable \"clash of civilizations\" long after the death of Osama bin Laden and demise of George W Bush.</p> <p>In Cairo, much was made of the role of the brother of Ayman al-Zawahiri, Bin Laden's Egyptian successor, and of the black Salafi flags carried by demonstrators. Still, the target was a crude and poisonously anti-Muslim film made in the US and circulated on YouTube, aided by the notorious Pastor Terry Jones \u2013 evidence of American arrogance and prejudice rather than anything directly political.</p> <p>Barack Obama faced criticism for backing Mubarak until the end, but the US supports Cairo's new regime \u2013 now led by Mohamed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood. Libyans know the US backed last year's UN resolution that led to a no-fly zone, Nato intervention and Gaddafi's downfall. Salafi groups in Tunisia, a thorn in the side of its Muslim Brotherhood government, also called for anti-US protests. (Salafis, like Islamists, come in different shapes: all are socially conservative but not all condone violence.)</p> <p>Islam is by definition wider than any national issue and this violence highlights the uncomfortable truth that the US remains deeply unpopular across the Muslim world, where Iraq, Afghanistan and, above all, the enduring Israeli-Palestinian conflict remain open sores.</p> <p>But religion and politics make for a toxic combination. \"The US has killed hundreds of thousands of unnamed Muslims in 9/11 revenge wars,\" commented the Palestinian activist Ali Abunimah. \"Media dehumanisation helps make this possible.\"</p> <p>Coming amid the US presidential campaign, the attacks are likely to curb what enthusiasm remains for US activism in the Arab world as the fear of Islamist chaos overwhelms hope for the springtime of Arab democracy. Syrians hoping that the US will back Libyan-style intervention or arm the rebels will be disappointed. Others pray that the influence of Saudi-financed Salafis will be limited.</p> <p>Arab governments want to get on well with Washington but their relationships will always be vulnerable to provocations by extremists on both sides. For too many across the region, the Florida pastor Jones looks more influential than Obama.</p>",
  "<p>As anxiety around high and volatile food prices grows, global hunger is again prominent on the international agenda.

She faces a daily struggle to provide food for her children. Teso and her family are pastoralists who herd livestock and rely on their animals for food and income, but poor rainfall has depleted the herd and the remaining animals are weak and hard to sell.</p> <p>Diba's four-year-old son is being treated for severe malnutrition in Concern's outreach nutrition programme. \"My son Umuro started losing weight and getting sick, and I knew it was because I didn't have enough food in the house,\" she says. \"When Concern arrived at the village, they asked if I wanted to have my children checked and weighed and I was glad someone was seeing him finally. Now he is in the programme he is getting better and stronger, but food has really become a problem for us lately.\"</p> <p>Another programme featured in the exhibition aims to combat the effects of drought, one of the toughest problems the pastoralists have to face. A micro-irrigation project in Madowadi, a small settlement in northern Kenya by the Ethiopian border, 430 miles from Nairobi, provides pastoralists with an alternative livelihood. The programme participants are Borana \u2013 a pastoral people who have lost most of their animals to drought.</p> <p>The micro-irrigation project has now been running for two years. Before it was set up, people had to cut down trees for wood to use in construction projects, or for charcoal \u2013 hazardous work, because it is illegal to cut down the trees for charcoal. They would have to wait, entering the towns and villages when the ministry men were gone, or selling the fruits of their labour on the road outside.</p> <p>The micro-irrigation programme set up by Concern and its local partner, <a href=\"http://www.cifakenya.org/\" title=\"\">Community Initiative Facilitation and Assistance</a> (Cifa), has helped transform this settlement into an oasis of green in a usually dry landscape, providing the community with new sources of food. There are 30 households in the programme and each has a plot.</p> <p>From dawn to dusk, Jillo Dabassa, one of the programme's participants, works on her plot. \"I was divorced and left with with children, and I had to find a way of making a living,\" she says. \"I burned charcoal and borrowed money. I was looked down on in the village and no one helped me out. Then Cifa came to my community. They introduced me to farming and gave me training.\"</p> <p>Water is pumped from a pan built by Cifa and directed to tiny holes 20cm apart in plastic pipes. Plants are placed exactly where the water drips out, ensuring that the water seeps gently but effectively into the roots. Tomatoes, onions and kale are flourishing. The goal is to protect the community protect against the shock of future droughts, and building resilience is a key aim . Anne O'Mahony, Concern's country director, says: \"The problem that many of the most vulnerable people face is the uncertainty of how they will provide for their families. There are so many factors that are outside of their control. We are working out ways that address their immediate needs but, more importantly, enable people to secure their own stable futures. \"</p> <p>The exhibition, Four Stories about Hunger, is on until Thursday 20 September 2012 at the Guardian Gallery, Kings Place, London N1.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Chris Elliott is the Guardian's readers' editor and a trustee of </em><a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\"><em>Concern Worldwide</em></a><em> (UK).

  "<p>Germany's highest court has paved the way for the creation of a \u20ac500bn(\u00a3400bn) rescue fund to tackle the eurozone's debt crisis after a huge popular petition to block it was rejected.</p> <p>The decision by the eight justices of the constitutional court in the south-western city of Karlsruhe allows Germany to ratify the treaty to establish the European stability mechanism (ESM) and will enable it to become effective next month. But an important condition attached to the ruling means that Germany's liabilities will be capped at \u20ac190bn, unless parliament rules otherwise.</p> <p>The limitation will go some way to assuage the concerns of German taxpayers whose frustration at the prospect of having to bail out indebted southern European countries indefinitely has been on the rise. A poll before the ruling showed that 54% of Germans wanted the court to block the ESM.</p> <p>Markets reacted positively to the decision with the euro reaching a four-month high, after the conditions imposed by the court, which had been widely expected to reject calls to block the fund, were less burdensome than German parliamentarians and other ESM supporters had feared.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for whom the ruling is a personal breakthrough, allowing the go-ahead of the two-pronged approach of both bailouts and budgetary discipline in the form of the fiscal pact that she has consistently advocated, said the decision sent a strong signal of Germany's commitment to Europe, and was positive news for the German taxpayer. Addressing the Bundestag she said: \"This is a good day for Germany and a good day for Europe.\"</p> <p>Frank-Walter Steinmeier, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, expressed his relief that the ESM, whose creation had been substantially delayed by the constitutional court's deliberations, could now start to work. \"The significance of this decision for the future of Europe cannot be overestimated,\" he told the Bundestag.</p> <p>The court had been under huge pressure not to torpedo the ESM, amid fears that it would cause the destruction of the euro and have a chaotic effect on the global economy. Andreas Vosskuhle, the court's president, said \"the economic and political consequences\" of delaying the law's introduction were \"almost impossible to calculate reliably\".</p> <p>A little light relief amid the gravitas of an occasion which amounted to the most important ruling in the court's 61-year history was offered by a slip of the tongue by Vosskuhle who called the petitions to block the ESM \"justified\" before changing it to \"unjustified\" after being corrected by a colleague, as peals of laughter filled the courtroom.</p>",

Well, for one thing Blair is going on. His hair seems to be getting blonder but that could happen to anyone who spends much of the summer on the tennis court. According to reports, if the Glencore/Xstrata merger/takeover is completed \u2013 it's still in doubt \u2013 he may pick up $1m (\u00a3620,000) for work on the phone and a crucial session at Claridge's hotel.</p> <p>A handy addition to his fine collection of banknotes, it's all of a piece with the role the former prime minister has created for himself after being driven from office by Gordon Brown's cohorts in 2007, part businessman, part philanthropist \u2013 all those foundations for sport, faith and Africa \u2013 part roving statesman in the Middle East and elsewhere.</p> <p>He's made millions but, as I've written before, his friends sometimes warn him that he's spread himself too thinly and that he'll never make enough to be accepted on equal terms with the really rich. \"Do less better,\" they say, as some said in his heyday at No 10. I suspect it's not in his restless nature to be still or reflective for long.</p> <p>But all this goes on side-by-side with his parallel image as a fugitive from international justice, at least in the eyes of his detractors on both left and right, a very unholy and hardline alliance between a familiar chorus of America-bashers and the Blair-baiting Daily Mail tribe \u2013 John Pilger and Simon Heffer, Noam Chomsky and Stephen Glover, George Monbiot and Max Hastings. <a href=\"http://www.medialens.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=692:the-return-of-the-king-tony-blair-and-the-magically-disappearing-blood&amp;catid=25:alerts-2012&amp;Itemid=69\" title=\"\">Here's</a> a recent sample from MediaLens.</p> <p>Some of these people hate each other as much as they hate Blair (or the Tory ones hate David Cameron, for that matter), they're good haters and he's always in the Rolodex when there's a temporary shortage of targets and 1,000 words to write. Tutu's declared refusal to attend a conference where the man of blood was present was a cue for renewed attacks and speculations, including an imaginary \u2013 and rather improbable \u2013 account of Blair's future Old Bailey trial.</p> <p>The 2,000-word hatchet job was written for the Mail by a thriller writer called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cain_(author)\" title=\"\">Tom Cain</a> who turns out to be a recycled version of the fiftysomething Fleet Street journalist David Thomas. Hang on to the day job, David.</p> <h2>Aggression</h2> <p>No less a figure than the Guardian's own George Monbiot took time off from his day job guarding planet Earth from its despoilers to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/03/tony-blair-the-hague-iraq-war\" title=\"\">persuade loyal readers</a> that Tutu's pronouncement had helped \"de-normalise\" Blair and made more likely an eventual appearance in some foreign court charged with crimes of aggression in breach of international law. <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2009/10/26/arresting-blair/\" title=\"\">Here's</a> an earlier version.</p> <p>No, I don't ever expect this to happen, nor do I think it should. But I usually find the formidable Monbiot's arguments stimulating even when I disagree with them. Like William Rees-Mogg of the Times, a rather older curmudgeon, he illuminates the landscape in interesting and sometimes unpredictable ways \u2013 and can also admit to changing his mind, say on nuclear power or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/02/peak-oil-we-we-wrong\" title=\"\">peak oil</a>, which is a good virtue. Not everyone can do it.</p> <p>This year Monbiot has even <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2012/05/21/see-no-evil/\" title=\"\">resumed combat</a> with his former hero <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky\" title=\"\">Noam Chomsky</a> over the familiar controversy surrounding the shameful 1995 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/srebrenica-massacre\" title=\"Guardian\">Srebrenica massacre</a>, a dangerous thing to do considering the militant cult that guards the old man.</p> <p>In this instance I fear GM is re-ploughing muddy ground on the Iraq war and that most of his key points are open to dispute in a pretty fundamental way \u2013 arguments with which most people are familiar. To take up one of them, after much shilly-shallying the then attorney general, Peter Goldsmith, assured the fateful cabinet on 17 March 2003 that military action against Saddam Hussein would be legal.</p> <p>I read that \u2013 again \u2013 in Peter Hain's new memoirs (Outside In, Biteback \u00a312.99) last week: I know what you're thinking, but Hain was present and uncomfortable. He has never been a pushover either \u2013 not since his high-profile, high-risk sports boycotting teens. Others present in cabinet have said the same.</p> <p>It's also not true that ministers knew Saddam didn't have weapons of mass destruction and lied about it. Whitehall and Washington persuaded themselves that he did \u2013 as Saddam wished them (and his own people) to believe. And so on. Did UNSCR 1441 authorise the use of force? Its crucial ambiguity will remain just that.</p> <p>There's little point in rehashing all this much-disputed territory, though I have been pleased to note lately that adamant assertions of a one-million-plus death toll in Iraq are becoming more tentative and now acknowledge the lower 100,000 estimates of the carnage. In due course it may be possible to acknowledge who did most of the killing in the quasi-civil war unleashed by Saddam's overthrow and the incompetent occupation strategy. Not Americans, I think.</p> <h2>Bounty</h2> <p>George Monbiot's passion to nail Blair has resulted in the very interesting <a href=\"http://www.arrestblair.org/\" title=\"\">ArrestBlair website</a> and the offer of bounty money, for which a <a href=\"http://hongwrong.com/arrest-blair-bounty/\" title=\"\">Hong Kong activist</a> was paid \u00a32,420 for a failed attempt to collar the ex-PM in June. The theory is that there are at least 25 states \u2013 and rising \u2013 which now incorporate the crime of aggression into their domestic law. Hope springs eternal.</p> <p>I suppose that this sort of campaign is admirable if you feel very strongly about something, but for those of us who don't it's puzzlingly selective. Why Iraq, a complex situation then as now, with few untainted good guys? Why not so many other grisly failures of statecraft, some of which cannot be laid at Blair's or George Bush's door?</p> <p>And why are some people so much keener than others to shoehorn events into their own preconceived value system \u2013 west always good/west always bad etc \u2013 when real life is usually much messier? Some veteran anti-apartheid campaigners were even puzzled by the redoubtable archbishop's attack on Blair at a time when targets closer to home \u2013 the Marikana mine massacre \u2013 looked more urgent.</p> <p>Perhaps they told him because he later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/desmond-tutu-expresses-outrage-failing-politicians\" title=\"\">weighed in</a> on behalf of the striking miners and attacked his old ANC comrades, now in government. Good for him.</p> <p>But Blair remains an unusual example of a public figure with a very bifurcated status \u2013 both reviled and respected as only Margaret Thatcher has been on this scale in Britain's postwar politics and, in her case, the loathing is partisan, mostly from the left. Despite being Labour's great election winner \u2013 or is it because of it \u2013 Blair gets it in the neck from both sides but continues to lead his tanned and successful parallel life while his enemies fume.</p> <p>Puzzling. Yet it is far too soon to assess his place, if any, in the history of our times, both domestic and foreign. Why, only the other day I heard a well connected Arab suggest that yes, the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 had indeed been a trigger for the wave of democratic self-assertion now sweeping the Arab world with incalculable consequences. We'll see \u2013 and so will he.</p> <p>Meanwhile what has happened to the much-delayed Chilcot report, the latest doomed attempt to nail Blair for blame he doesn't deserve or widely shares (not least with the Tories)? It's now due next year, but don't hold your breath. Houdini's critics will not get their day in court.</p>",
  "<h2>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/12/uk-unemployment-fall-olympics-jobs\" title=\"\">latest job market figures</a> are once again encouraging, and support our belief that the UK economy has returned to positive growth in the third quarter. Employment is up, unemployment and the claimant count are down, and the rate of inactivity is at its lowest since 1991. These figures will no doubt raise more questions about the accuracy of the latest GDP figures, which show three consecutive quarters of negative growth.</p> <p>Despite this positive news, there are still some areas of concern. The number of people forced to work part-time because they cannot find a full-time job has reached a new high, and there are still too many young people unemployed. More deficit cuts in the coming months mean there will be a further reduction in public sector employment, although it is reassuring to see that the private sector is willing and able to create new jobs.</p> <p>Overall, it is clear that growth is still too weak, and problems in the eurozone will continue to put pressure on our exporters. The government must build on the positive job figures by implementing more policies that allow businesses to deliver growth. An effective growth strategy should include further deregulation, increased infrastructure spending and the creation of a British Business Bank.</p> <h2>Jens Larsen, chief European economist, RBC Capital Markets</h2> <p>Unemployment is steady, the employment rate is picking up and the inactivity rate is falling. Given the weak output performance, the result is continued weak productivity performance. Our best explanation is that the underlying drivers of weak demand and weak productivity are the same: if the financial sector is constraining consumption and investment demand, and also holds back the necessary re-allocation of resources, then both demand and productivity will suffer. Of course, it might be possible that GDP will be revised up, or even surprise on the upside. Wage growth continues to be restrained\u2014whether that reflects spare capacity in the labour market or weak productivity growth remains the key question.</p> <h2>John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist</h2> <p>Today's figures confirm that the UK continues to enjoy a jobs boom even though the economy is struggling to emerge from the double dip recession. An additional 236,000 jobs in a single quarter, more than 100,000 full-time, is a remarkable achievement at any time but in current economic conditions is near miraculous.</p> <p>Even more remarkable is the fact that the economy is adding so many jobs against a backdrop of a near static level of job vacancies. Indeed, the number of unemployed people per vacancy is slightly higher than in mid-2010. In other words, the labour market is proving really effective at filling whatever vacancies do arise even though, as a result of weak macroeconomic conditions, the economy isn't creating net extra vacancies. This probably in part reflects pressure on welfare claimants to seek work more actively and partly to the fact that jobseekers in general are more prepared than in previous decades to take whatever work is on offer, no matter what pay or hours are involved. Either way this amounts to a structural shift in the operation of the labour market. Consequently, the labour market is at least to some extent decoupled from the macro economy, albeit prolonged weak output growth may eventually have a negative impact on jobs and unemployment if it results in far fewer net vacancies to fill or increased redundancies.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit</h2> <p>The UK economy appears to be in rude health, creating a near-record increase in jobs over the summer, led by the private sector taking on staff in increasing numbers. The data are in line with the message from the business surveys that the economy is by no means in another downturn, as indicated by official economic growth data, but enjoyed a strong expansion so far this year. However, recent downturns in the surveys suggest that the startling job creation seen so far this year is set to wane unless demand picks up further. In that respect, we see some encouragement from recent developments to alleviate the eurozone crisis, which may well bring about a swift upturn in business confidence and remove one of the biggest causes of weak global economic growth in recent months.</p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics showed employment rising by an impressive 236,000 in the three months to July, the third-largest increase ever seen and taking employment up to 29.56 million, its highest since May 2008. Since comparable data were first available in 1971, the latest increase has only been exceeded by the 276,000 rise seen in the three months to July 2010 and the 239,000 increase seen in the three months to August 1987.</p> <p>It was not all good news though, with the unemployment rate \u2013 as measured by the labour force survey \u2013 rising to 8.1%. Unemployment now stands at 2.59 million, but perhaps more worryingly the number of people that have been unemployed for more than one year rose to 904,000, its highest since May 2006.</p> <h2>Ian Brinkley, director of The Work Foundation</h2> <p>The overall figures are remarkably good. This is the third quarter that total employment has increased despite the economy apparently being in recession \u2013 still not enough to confirm a trend, but definitely not a blip. The private sector has continued to hire in large numbers, although the overall performance may also have been boosted by a temporary slowdown in public sector job losses in the three months to June.</p> <p>What is striking is how little impact this has had on unemployment \u2013 despite the large numbers of jobs created, unemployment has fallen by just 7,000. Large numbers of students, retirees and people on long-term sick leave seem to be returning to the jobs market, putting extra pressure on it. The rapid growth of the working age population is also having an effect. This development shows just how much of the pain in the labour market has been hidden in the past. There is still a long way to go before unemployment returns to normal levels. Digging beneath the totals, the figures show some weaknesses. The majority of the new jobs were either part-time or self-employed. While any increase in employment is encouraging, a full labour market recovery must offer more full-time employee jobs. The number of people in part-time jobs who said they wanted a full-time job did not increase significantly, but is still at a record high.</p> <h2>David Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>There's no doubt the UK labour market is providing a good deal of solace to those fed up with hearing about the recession. The big puzzle in the data remains however how an economy that still has a level of GDP that is 4.5% below the level seen in 2008 Q1, just before the UK entered recession, can have a level of employment that is now 0.2% higher over that period. This implies a puzzlingly large loss of labour productivity in the economy. Many of the candidate explanations, such as significant labour hoarding, the impact of sectoral rebalancing or the possibility that GDP or employment is being mismeasured, appear to provide only partial explanations.</p> <p>For policy of course this is fiendishly difficult. The MPC can't realistically be confident about where domestically generated inflationary pressures will be in year or two's time if the level of employment could quite plausibly be lower or higher than today. Only time will tell and with the benefit of hindsight no doubt the committee will be judged as having got it 'wrong' one way or another. But one has to have some sympathy with policymakers having to play the rather confusing hand they are being dealt currently.</p>",
  "<p>Wind energy could provide 20-100 times current global power demand, according to <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate1683.html\" title=\"\">a study</a> published this week in Nature Climate Change. Other studies have shown similar results, but they do not mean that wind power is all we will ever need, says Ken Caldeira of Stanford University's Carnegie Institution, and co-author of the new study.\"We're always going to need a variety of energy sources,\" Caldeira told the Guardian.</p> <p>Nor does it mean installing enough wind turbines to power the world is practical or even feasible. There are significant technical and resource problems to overcome, not least of which is finding the money to construct millions of turbines, he acknowledged.</p> <p>\"It's a huge scale-up \u2026 but not unimaginable. The reality is this is what the global energy generation is right now.\"</p> <p>And right now humanity uses about 18 terawatts of power, <a href=\"http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2011/STAGING/local_assets/pdf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2012.pdf\" title=\"\">87% of which is from coal, oil, and gas.</a> Only about 0.2 terawatts comes from wind. (A terawatt is a trillion watts. A thousand watts or kilowatt is roughly the heat output from the average electric kettle.) Caldeira and colleagues calculated there is a potential of 400 terawatts of wind power at the Earth's surface and 1,800 terawatts of power from the upper atmosphere. The latter would be generated by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/03/renewableenergy.energy\" title=\"\">tethered turbines floating hundreds or thousands of metres in the air</a> where the winds are stronger and more consistent.</p> <p>It's a bit of mystery why billions of dollars of public money has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/23/fusion-power-is-it-getting-closer\" title=\"\">invested in researching fusion as an energy source</a> when practically nothing has been spent on airborne turbines. \"We know the wind energy is there. It is just an engineering problem,\" he says.</p> <p>Calderia says this study also further refutes the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/29/us-wind-farms-climate-idUSBRE83S0BG20120429\" title=\"\">erroneous notion that wind on this scale would generate enough heat to be the equivalent of doubling CO<sub>2</sub> levels</a>. Turbines create drag, slowing wind speeds as well as generating heat from friction. The study found that the climate effects of extracting wind energy at the level of current global demand would be small, as long as the turbines were spread out and not clustered in just a few regions.</p> <p>Clearcutting \u2013 the practice of felling and removal of all trees from a tract of forest \u2013 has a far higher impact on the climate, not to mention ecological impacts, than a concentrated windfarm of similar size, he said.</p> <p>\"Looking at the big picture, it is more likely that economic, technological or political factors will determine the growth of wind power around the world, rather than geophysical limitations,\" Caldeira said.</p> <p>Caldeira has also calculated the lifecycle carbon emissions of various energy sources in <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/1/014019/pdf/1748-9326_7_1_014019.pdf\" title=\"\">a 2011 study</a> and wind topped the list, offsetting the emissions involved in manufacture and installing in a matter of months, he said.</p> <p>The US Department of Energy (DoE) released <a href=\"http://energy.gov/pi/office-policy-and-international-affairs/downloads/2011-critical-materials-strategy\" title=\"\">its 2011 critical materials strategy</a> last December, saying shortages of rare earth metals needed for wind turbines over the next five years would constrain the industry's growth. Large turbines use permanent magnets made of rare earth metals. However new designs reduce size of permanent magnets or replace them with super-conducting generators.</p> <p>Transmission is the biggest hurdle facing wind today and in the near future, said Tom Levy, an energy expert at the <a href=\"http://www.canwea.ca/index_e.php\" title=\"\">Canadian Wind Energy Association</a>. The world's electrical transmission grids were purpose-built for large-scale coal, oil, gas and hydro generation. Solar and wind are different in that they are intermittent and decentralised.</p> <p>The next toughest hurdle to leap is finding suitable sites and communities willing to host windfarms, Levy said. Curiously, the Canadian government <a href=\"http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/consult/_2012/wind_turbine-eoliennes/research_recherche-eng.php\" title=\"\">announced last July it would conduct a new study on the health impacts of wind turbines</a>, 30 years after the first installations.</p> <p>\"I can't speculate on why the Canadian government has taken this step. But it is not a de facto moratorium on new wind installation as some have suggested,\" he said.</p> <p>Real change will only come from the grassroots, according to Caldeira. \"We have the resources to do it [transition to 100% renewables]. But it is not happening because it is not a high enough priority.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Leahy is an international environment journalist based in Canada</p>",
  "<p>Frankland prison in County Durham is notorious. The high-security, men-only jail has housed some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, including Charles Bronson, Harold Shipman and Ian Huntley. Three months ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/12/pair-killed-disembowelled-inmate\" title=\"\">two inmates there murdered and then disembowelled another</a>.</p> <p>It's not the sort of place where you might imagine a spot of cross stitch would go down well. But for more than six years Linda MacMullen, a grandmother and part-time French teacher, has been going to Frankland every fortnight to teach needlework to a group of 12 prisoners. She wears a personal alarm around her neck every time she goes in, and two prison officers stand outside the open door as she teaches.</p> <p>\"I know all the men who come to our class are in there for life sentences. I assume they are responsible for killing someone, but I don't know that. And I don't want to know. I just don't,\" she says. \"But I also think they are different people now to who they were. You can't be in a prison for 10, 15 years and still be that same person.\"</p> <p>MacMullen is one of 200 volunteers with <a href=\"http://www.finecellwork.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fine Cell Work</a> (FCW), a social enterprise and charity which trains prisoners in paid intricate needlework, producing cushions, wall hangings and quilts. Most volunteers help out at the charity's offices \u2013 but 60 of them, like MacMullen, go into jails to work directly with prisoners.</p> <p>On Monday, the charity was presented with the <a href=\"http://www.finecellwork.co.uk/news_and_events/events/218_queens_award_for_voluntary_service\" title=\"\">Queen's award for voluntary service</a>, the highest possible honour that can be given to a volunteer group. FCW's founder, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/20/lady-anne-tree-obituary\" title=\"\">Lady Anne Tree, who died in 2010</a>, spent decades lobbying the government to change the law to enable prisoners to earn money from their cells, before officially launching the charity in 1997. There are now more than 400 prisoners in 29 prisons across the UK making FCW products.</p> <p>It has been a busy time for FCW: the charity's first retail space opened last month (albeit a temporary one), <a href=\"http://www.finecellwork.co.uk/news_and_events/latest_news/203_fine_cell_work_pops_up_in_mayfair\" title=\"\">a pop-up store in Mayfair</a>. Products for sale include hand-embroidered cushions in retro geometric patterns, tote bags emblazoned with the word \"swag\" and pretty patchwork quilts. Big names in the craft world including <a href=\"http://www.emilypeacock.com/EmilyPeacockTapestry/Tapestry_Kits_designed_for_today.html\" title=\"\">Emily Peacock</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cathkidston.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cath Kidston</a> and <a href=\"http://www.daisydevilleneuve.com/\" title=\"\">Daisy de Villeneuve</a> came up with designs specifically for the shop, which the prisoners then stitched up. The pieces aren't cheap (there are cushions for \u00a3150), but reflect the painstakingly long hours that go into each item \u2013 one cushion can take 100 hours to make, while a quilt takes a year.</p> <p>Next week the shop will be hosting craft events as part of the <a href=\"http://www.londondesignfestival.com/\">London Design Festival</a>, including an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/353676964711854/\">all-day stitching session</a> where members of the public can drop in and sew a message to a prisoner. </p> <p>Almost all of the volunteers who teach needlework are women and the majority of the prisoners are men. It can make for a challenging dynamic, says Piero Donat, who works in FCW's head office. \"It is tough. We need to know the volunteers can work in a prison environment. Some prisoners haven't been taught by a woman before.\"</p> <p>Caroline Wilkinson is a retired teacher from south-east London. She started volunteering to teach patchwork and quilting at Wandsworth prison 12 years ago. Recently, the wing where she taught closed and the classes have since moved to Brixton jail.</p> <p>\"Wandsworth prison is pretty horrific. The physical surroundings are really intimidating. But inside the people are like you and me,\" she says. \"That's what I've come to appreciate.\"</p> <p>In the early days of her involvement with FCW, Wilkinson said she didn't want to go in a men's jail. But Katy Emck, the charity's CEO, persuaded her to give it a try. \"She said: 'It might not be as bad as you think.' And she was right.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson teaches three groups of 12 once a week. \"I did wonder how quilting would go down. It's not a very macho thing and I didn't think it would be attractive to them. But then 27 men turned up to my introduction, and I realised they just wanted to do something. The chance to earn money was a motivation, but not the only one. They are bored out of their minds and a lot of the prisoners just want to do something meaningful. And they can \u2013 just because they are in jail, it doesn't mean that they don't have practical or creative skills.\"</p> <p>Marjorie Coles is a former nurse who used to teach quilting to local women in her spare time; now she teaches a group of 10 male prisoners at Bullingdon prison in Bicester.</p> <p>\"Very occasionally there will be someone who I can tell is thinking, 'Oh, you're just a woman', but I ignore it,\" she says. \"My group is not aggressive or high-tension in any way, and works well together. They tell me they are much less wound up now when they are in their cells because they have something to do. I wouldn't say I know them very well, but I don't see them as prisoners. I see them as people.\"</p> <p>FCW prepares its volunteers for going into prison as much as it can. It advises them not to ask about crimes committed \u2013 \"The important thing is not the crime, but that the prisoner is trying to take a step towards changing his life,\" says Donat \u2013 and cautions against sharing personal details.</p> <p>But the volunteers say it's natural to form some sense of attachment and pride, especially when work is finished and handed in.</p> <p>\"The change you see in the men who come to the classes is amazing,\" says MacMullen. \"At first, they tend to be withdrawn. They won't make eye contact and won't talk, or lean away if you sit next to them. But slowly, with encouragement, they start to see what they are capable of. They start to talk, help each other. One man told me he was always being put in solitary [confinement] for fights, but that since he'd taken up stitching he didn't get put in there anymore. Instead of fighting, he's in his cell, stitching for hours and hours. That's the difference this makes.\"</p> <p>Hanging just inside the entrance to the pop-up store is a cream quilt with embroidered maroon birds in flight. It was made by one of Wilkinson's class members, and she called his sister to let her know it was there. \"She is absolutely devastated that he is in prison. It's the first time anything like that has happened to their family. But his sister is just so proud of the work he's doing, and knowing that has given him self-esteem too,\" Wilkinson says. \"It's just so extraordinary that craftwork can make such a difference.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 A volunteer will speaking about her experience of teaching embroidery to life-serving prisoners at the <a href=\"http://www.finecellwork.co.uk/\" title=\"\">FCW pop-up shop at 5 Grosvenor Street, London W1K 4DJ</a>, on 26 September.</em></p>",

Today's release is an important step towards realising the Library of Congress's vision of world in which cultural data is \"<a href=\"http://wiki.okfn.org/FutureOfBibliographicControl\">collaborative, decentralized, and international</a>\".</p> <p>Or imagine the energy and imagination that currently goes into creating social discovery services for music or films (a la <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm\">Last.fm</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix\">Netflix</a>) were applied to similar services for paintings or literary works (\"if you liked X and Y, you might also like Z\" or \"you are within 5 miles of a Paolozzi sculpture you'll probably enjoy\").</p> <p>And think of how data about cultural artefacts could be used in teaching and research. Students and scholars could curate and interact with customised collections of content relevant to them, explore items using maps or timelines, or use the data to analyse relations of influence between authors and texts. (The <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\">DM2E</a> project will soon be launching a series of scholarships to encourage innovative digital humanities projects building on the Europeana data - so if you're interested in this area, then <a href=\"http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-humanities\">watch this space</a>.)</p> <p>Europeana describe today's release as \"by far the largest one-time dedication of cultural data to the public domain\". Hopefully this will help to establish a precedent for <a href=\"http://openglam.org/\">other galleries, libraries, archives and museums to follow</a> - which will in turn help to bring us that bit closer to a joined up digital commons of cultural content that everyone is free to use and enjoy.</p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022 Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@theguardian.com\">data@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",

They faced multiple barriers to getting online, but a common factor was fear engendered by media scare stories.<br>It was evident as well, that quite a few of the people who came along had literacy problems. It amazes me that many people who promote the digital inclusion agenda fail to take into account that a fairly high degree of literacy is needed to use the internet, and that, many who don't go online avoid it for precisely that reason. <br>... One of the interesting queries was from the young woman who came in under the mistaken impression that we were selling broadband packages. She explained that she had no internet connection at home because her previous supplier had been too expensive. \"I'm not paying that for broadband,\" she said; \"that's a holiday\". I helped her search for a cheaper supplier. Which shows up the great irony.

  "<p>By the end of this year, James Cameron will have finished writing the scripts for both Avatar 2 and Avatar 3. As has been widely reported, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/james-cameron-three-avatar-sequels\" title=\"\">these movies will then be filmed concurrently with the first one tentatively set for release in 2015</a>. It's a risky strategy: plenty of other film franchises have attempted back-to-back sequel productions and, more often than not, at least one of those films has ended up being actively terrible.</p> <p>Think Back to the Future 3, or the endless finale to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92716/lord.of.the.rings\" title=\"\">the last Lord of the Rings film</a>. Or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/118698/pirates.of.the.caribbean\" title=\"\">Pirates of the Caribbean 3</a>, so long and impenetrable that watching it feels like spending a month in a Chinese prison. Or either Matrix sequel, both of which could easily vie for the title of Worst Anything That Has Ever Existed. By taking on the Avatar sequels in this way, there's a very strong chance that one or both of them will be bloated, directionless and painfully self-important. And this is a sequel to Avatar we're talking about. Imagine something even more self-important than a two-and-a-half hour environmental lecture about a planet of lanky blue aliens with sexual haircuts. Petrifying, isn't it?</p> <p>Luckily, it seems as if James Cameron has done his homework. <a href=\"http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2012/09/10/james-cameron-avatar-sequels-a-daunting-writing-task/\" title=\"\">In an interview with the LA Times this week</a>, ostensibly about the 3D Titanic Blu-ray release, Cameron revealed the films that he doesn't want Avatar 2 and 3 to become. \"I'm writing it as separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film. I don't want to suffer from the Matrix 2 problem, where it just ends, like, what the hell? It's gotta end. There's gotta be a sense of conclusion, but also a sense that the journey will continue, and that's a fine line.\"</p> <p>That's sure to come as a relief to just about everyone. Although only a madman would use the Matrix sequels as a template for anything \u2013 apart from maybe a complex hope-destroying torture system \u2013 it's still nice to have verbal reassurance to the contrary. The sheer scale and pressure of following up a global blockbuster by writing, filming and editing two sequels concurrently must be enormous, and that's why so many of these films end up being monstrous, distended, throw-everything-at-the-wall train wrecks that sacrifice economy and focus for misguided spectacle.</p> <p>But even with this in mind, the Matrix sequels were \u2013 and still are \u2013 heartbreaking. To create such a perfectly realised universe, and to break new technological ground, in the first film and then dump all over it with two separate movies full of hokey subplots and techno dance parties and symbolism that all but cracks you across the head with a cricket bat still seems like one of the worst fumbles in cinema history. No wonder so many people have taken to refusing that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92641/matrix.reloaded\" title=\"\">The Matrix Reloaded</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95856/matrix.revolutions\" title=\"\">The Matrix Revolutions</a> even exist.</p> <p>But at least James Cameron seems to know what he's up against here. Hopefully he's given himself enough time to pare down the scripts to an acceptable degree; to remove any mindless cliffhangers from the end of Avatar 2, to remove any extended car chase scenes and hard-to-follow kung fu scenes and techno parties, and any bits at the end where Sam Worthington literally becomes a blind version of Jesus Christ. Hopefully he'll avoid the same pitfalls that everyone else in his situation has plummeted into. Hopefully he'll manage to remember why people sort of liked Avatar in the first place. That's the best anyone can hope for.</p>",

Raves and other music events are also being proposed, that will focus attention on the cull and make it more difficult to carry out.</p> <p>A group of mainstream campaigners including the RSPCA, the League Against Cruel Sports, the Badger Trust and the Humane Society will continue to push the government to change its mind over the cull, which is designed to combat the spread of bovine tuberculosis (TB). They are still hoping that \"people power\" could force the coalition to reverse its decision to allow badgers to be shot.</p> <p>But it is also clear that if all legal avenues and political avenues are shut off, some people are determined to take direct action to sabotage the cull.</p> <p>Among those at a national rally against the cull held in Bristol on Tuesday were animal rights activists from Manchester who said they would be back in the west of England at the end of this month and the start of next when the cull is expected to start.</p> <p>One of them, who asked to be identified as Nuala Bug-Eye, said they would work within the law. \"We know who the cullers are,\" she said. \"We'll be in those areas making sure they can't come out and quietly go about their shooting. If you're in the area making noise, badgers are not going to come out and be shot. We feel the science has been ignored and badgers are being scapegoated.</p> <p>\"We can understand that it's awful for the farmers, it's awful for the cattle. Once they've done the badgers will they go after the deer? It's not going to end with the badgers.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LCN_MbtGaDE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LCN_MbtGaDE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The rally was a colourful one with some turning up in animal costumes, wearing badger masks or black and white face paint. Woody Fox (his real name, changed by deed poll) said he also feared the badger cull could open the door for other wildlife to be culled.</p> <p>\"We have hardly any wildlife left. There seems to be excuse after excuse to kill them all. I can understand the plight of farmers but it has never been proven that culls can work. It's another attack on wildlife. It goes on and on.

You could kill all the badgers in Britain and it would not stop the problem of bovine TB in cows.\"</p> <p>At the appeal court in London the Badger Trust's legal team had argued the cull would break the 1992 law protecting badgers, which allows culling to \"prevent the spread of disease\". They claimed the law is intended only to license culls for one or two landowners, not a mass cull. But three court of appeal judges <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/11/badger-cull-legal-challenge-fails\" title=\"\">decided the government's proposals did not break the law</a>.</p> <p>The trust will now decide whether to attempt to take their legal action to the supreme court.</p> <p>Gwendolen Morgan, a solicitor at Bindmans acting for the trust, said: \"It makes no sense economically, scientifically, ethically or logically, or in terms of public safety.\"</p> <p>Morgan, who worked on the trust's successful legal challenge against a badger cull in Wales, added that the proposed cull would actually spread bovine TB, based on the findings of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\">a landmark decade-long trial which showed that fleeing badgers carried TB to new areas</a>. The trial found that, at best, TB incidence was reduced in the cull area by just 16% after nine years.</p> <p>The government argues the cull is necessary to curb the rising number of tuberculosis infections in cattle, which led farmers to slaughter 26,000 animals in 2011 alone. Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/04/environment-owen-paterson-spelman-reshuffle\" title=\"\">is a strong supporter of culling</a>.</p> <p>A badger vaccination programme is replacing the cull plan in Wales, that was abandoned following legal challenges and the election of a new political administration. Vaccination is being tested by the National Trust in Devon and by the Wildlife Trust in Gloucestershire. The previous Labour government said an oral badger vaccine would be ready by 2015. The coalition cancelled five of the six trials of injectable vaccines and said a viable oral vaccine is \"years away\".</p> <p>One other avenue still open is a complaint at the Council of Europe from the Humane Society International (HSI), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/30/uk-badger-cull-breach-eu-law\" title=\"\">which argues the badger cull contravenes the Bern Convention that protects wildlife</a>.</p> <p>Mark Jones, the executive director of HSI UK said: \"As signatories to Bern, the UK is obliged to keep the badger population out of danger, a duty that is unquestionably abused by the plan to shoot and kill the vast majority of these magical animals in local areas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Zca2-ahY80?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Zca2-ahY80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"The badger is an iconic wild mammal, one of the few we've got left in the UK.

  "<p>The most memorable concoction that fizzed out of the brain of Douglas Adams was the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/babelfish.shtml\" title=\"\">Babelfish</a>, the universal translator. Even so, there were times during the first Global Chemical Industry Sustainability summit in Brussels where I could have used a gallon jar of Adams' other great concoction, the <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Pan_Galactic_Gargle_Blaster\" title=\"\">Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</a>, a cocktail to end all cocktails.</p> <p>Listening to some speakers was like being an architect of the Tower of Babel, watching aghast as the best-laid plans broke down into a welter of competing tongues. Perhaps I exaggerate slightly, but we really do have a language problem in this space, and it seems to be getting worse.</p> <p>One speaker showed a slide headed 'Sustainability is \u2026', spotlighting Shin-Etsu, a Japanese chemical company that suffered a major explosion. Instead of clamming up, as Japanese corporate leaders are wont to do, the CEO took a voluntary pay-cut and went out to apologise to the local community.</p> <p>Apologising to people when you have accidentally blown them up makes sense, most of the time, but in the context of the global challenges we face I struggle to see this as a definitive (indeed, even a legitimate) case of sustainability in practice.</p> <p>Then another speaker, this time from ExxonMobil Chemical, asserted that \u2013 based on the latest life-cycle assessment data \u2013 shopping bags made out of high density polyethylene (HDPE) are the sustainable option. Paper bags, he insisted, should be dropped because of the energy and water consumption involved. Ah. When the discussion period came, I asked whether the data had taken into account the great swirling gyres of plastic debris that now scar large areas of the world ocean? No, he admitted.</p> <p>For such people, as a speaker from BASF assured us, sustainability means we \"are on a journey\". Like many others, this German company has talked to a considerable number of stakeholders (350, by their reckoning) and boiled it all down to a shortlist of issues (just 40 of those). The main conclusion seems to be that we must all create more shared value while, simultaneously, shrinking our environmental footprints.</p> <p>Good, but by how much? That's a question that the sector finds it hard to answer, except in areas where there is a legal requirement that the use of particular chemicals be driven to zero, like hexavalent chromium. And, while most participants intensely dislike the idea of further regulation, there were those \u2013 including Peter Kunze of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association \u2013 who argued for much clearer signals on which chemicals would be banned ultimately, coupled with \"smart legislation\" to ensure that the process of conversion didn't undermine industrial or regional competitiveness.</p> <p>It was intriguing to see successive speakers through the lenses of vested interests. A panel of four speakers, for example, agreed that renewable feedstocks were very unlikely to make much of an impression on the industry in the next decade or two. Then a colleague from another chemical company whispered in my ear that three of the four companies were backwards-integrated into the oil sector, effectively making them fossil fuel junkies. Hardly surprising, then, that they find it hard to imagine \u2013 or at least publicly admit the possibility of \u2013 a radically different future.</p> <p>Behind the scenes people spoke quietly of lobbying that is underway by parts of the industry: in the US, for example, chemical companies are fighting tooth-and-nail to ensure suspect chemicals and products like formaldehyde and styrene continue to be allowed in LEED-certified buildings.</p> <p>On the upside, Nicholas Denis of McKinsey &amp; Co reported results of their recent market survey showing that green products are now seen much more positively by both consumers and industry executives, with between 82 and 93% of both categories saying they want to go greener, even though \"the road to green chemicals is harder than we thought initially\" and the notion of a \"green premium is still a Holy Grail for most companies.\"</p> <p>Procter &amp; Gamble promptly disagreed, to a degree, noting that their efforts to promote greener products like compact detergents had been stymied by the unwillingness of most consumers to change to seemingly smaller products at the same price-point. So the detergent industry went to government, asked for permission to avoid anti-trust rules, and moved as a group of companies to strip non-compact products from the shelves. \"I would love it if consumers wanted greener products, mused P&amp;G's Peter Kunze, \"because we would then have a business model!\"</p> <p>One of the most interesting moments was when Barend van Bergen, who heads up KPMG's climate and sustainability centre, reported the results of a survey they had done of different sectors looking at how much of their profits are at risk because of environmental and wider sustainability issues. The answer for the chemical sector: 43%.</p> <p>In contrast to most summit meetings, many of the people in Brussels were in the middle to upper-middle layers of their companies. They might argue that \"sustainable development is in the genes of our company,\" as one speaker from Solvay did, but too often they were fighting their battles in the foothills, either unable to see the wider landscape, or without the authority to break ranks and embrace disruptive concepts like zero, waste or toxics.</p> <p>But I and John Pearson, the entrepreneurial American CEO of Chemical Industry Roundtables LLP, relish a challenge. We agreed that we would aim to keep the sector under pressure and propose an event in 2013, using zero-based thinking as a means of stretching the sustainability agenda.</p> <p>And things may just be going our way. The <a href=\"http://www.wbcsd.org/vision2050.aspx\" title=\"\">Vision 2050</a> mapping done by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) contained a number of zero targets, but the news that WBCSD is now going to test its projections against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-solutions-based-scientific-analysis\" title=\"\">Stockholm Resilience Centre's nine planetary boundaries</a> suggests there could well be a lot more <a href=\"http://thezeronauts.com/\" title=\"\">zero, net-zero or towards zero</a> targets in a year or two.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chairman of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

  "<p>An increase in the number of people moving home in July drove up mortgage lending, according to figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML).</p> <p>A total of \u00a312.7bn was paid out to homebuyers and remortgagors over the month, a 7% increase from the \u00a311.9bn advanced in June and a 2% rise compared to July 2011.</p> <p>The total number of loans granted for house purchases was 49,500. The number of loans taken out by home movers was up 8% month-on-month and 4% over the year at 30,500, and totalled \u00a35.1bn, while 19,000 loans were taken out by first-time buyers. The latter figure was 1% lower than in June but 8% up on July 2011.</p> <p>Remortgaging activity remained low, with the number of mortgages taken out by homeowners switching lenders down by 23.5% year-on-year at 24,100.</p> <p>During July a price war broke out between mortgage lenders, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/23/mortgage-rates-battle-housing-market\" title=\"Mortgage rates battle to benefit housing market and borrowers\">borrowers offered the lowest ever rates on five-year fixed-rate deals</a>. However, the CML's figures are for completed mortgages so don't yet show if those deals provoked any kind of increase in lending activity.</p> <p>The figures cover the period immediately before the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/01/funding-for-lending-scheme-scepticism\" title=\"Funding for Lending scheme launches amid scepticism\">Funding for Lending scheme</a>, designed to boost the number of mortgage loans available, came into effect.</p> <p>The CML's director general, Paul Smee, said: \"July's figures show a gradual improvement in the market with lending approaching the sort of levels we saw at the end of the stamp duty concession.</p> <p>\"While overall market conditions remain tight, new initiatives such as Funding for Lending and NewBuy have the potential to help lending to continue to ease gradually.\"</p> <p>But Ashley Brown, director of mortgage broker Moneysprite, said the figures were \"in stark contrast to what we're seeing on the ground\". He added: \"From where I'm standing there has been less a gradual improvement in the market than a gradual decline. There is life in the mortgage market but it's not where the property market needs it to be in order to fully recover.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said there was little evidence of significant increase in activity. \"The CML data do little to dilute our view that house prices are likely to trend modestly lower over the coming months.\"</p>",
  "<p>A group of environmentalists in Glasgow has launched a campaign to improve some of the city's most dilapidated housing. Not with placards or postcards, but with peas, beetroot and thermal imaging cameras.</p> <p>Volunteers from the charity <a href=\"http://southseeds.org/\">South Seeds</a> are focusing on tenement blocks on the city's south side \u2013 home to some of Glasgow most dilapidated slum housing - in an effort to increase the buildings' energy efficiency and raise living conditions for residents.</p> <p>Maf Smith, a key figure in South Seed's managing committee and a renewable energy specialist, said the project also focused on working with tenants and residents, not housing officials, by training \"tenement champions\" to strengthen community bonds and foster a spirit of self-help. He said: </p> <blockquote> <p>Tenements are classed as 'hard to treat homes', and if improvements can be made in one area of the building, it's often only possible with the agreement of all the residents.</p> <p>That can be a real brake when people are trying to take action, so our Tenement Champions programme is trying to find people who can coordinate their neighbours and improve their buildings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Established in 2011, South Seeds has already worked to turn derelict sites in Glasgow into community gardens. The group is now expanding after receiving a \u00a3278,000 grant from the Scottish government's <a href=\"http://ccf.keepscotlandbeautiful.org/\">Climate Challenge Fund</a>, which provides money for community environmental projects.</p> <p>It will carry out thermal imaging of tenement blocks to identify the buildings most in need of insulation. It will offer advice on grants and incentives for repairs and property improvements, and produce online videos explaining how residents can increase the energy efficiency of their homes.</p> <p>Caroline Gausden, who lives with her daughter in a tenement flat in the south side district of Crosshill, said that South Seeds' efforts had had a noticeable effect on her and her neighbours' living conditions:</p> <blockquote> <p>We asked for their help to build a garden in our back court, which was very overgrown and had been used to dump rubbish.</p> <p>They worked with us to tidy it all up, cut the grass and put in vegetable beds. It used to be just an unused space, but this summer the neighbours have been out sunbathing and it's a safe place for my daughter to play.</p> <p>We've grown peas, beetroot, potatoes, courgettes \u2013 everyone's been really keen to get involved.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Gausden said before the project she had only really known neighbours on her own landing. Now she knows all the residents involved in the garden:</p> <blockquote> <p>We started talking about the state of the building. We had a really rubbish factor [property manager] who always said they were getting quotes for repairs, but the work was never done, so we got together and booted them out.</p> <p>Since then we've installed foam insulation in the loft and had treatment for damp, which has been a problem for the three years I've been here. We also helped an older lady with major repairs to her flat which she wasn't able to do on her own.</p> </blockquote> <p>Built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's tenements became notorious for their overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, with large extended families crammed into one or two small rooms. Their back courts commonly featured communal outdoor toilets and rubbish heaps known as middens \u2013 dumps for food scraps, discarded household and human waste.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396049818\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/9/3/1346680906071/South-Seeds-Glasgow-Agnew-003.jpg\" alt=\"South Seeds, Glasgow, Agnew Lane\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agnew Lane, Glasgow, before South Seeds began work. Photograph: South Seeds</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South Seeds</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The buildings have since been renovated. In some areas of the city tenement flats are sought-after for their thick walls, high ceilings and period features. But other buildings are in a poor state of repair; parts of the city may be seeing accelerating improvements in the housing stock but in some, historic problems endure.</p> <p>Govanhill, on the city's south side, has had a particular problem with tenements in slum conditions. Many flats bought by private landlords in the buy-to-let boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s have fallen into disrepair and now serve as cheap, poor-quality housing for recent immigrants.</p> <p>A spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/\">Glasgow City Council</a>, said it had invested \u00a310m over the past three years in such properties but it had been forced, because of the scale of the task, to prioritise the buildings in the greatest need of repair:</p> <blockquote> <p>We've had to do roof work and major structural repairs, deal with damp and rot and secure the foundations of tenements that were built over old mine-workings.</p> <p>Unfortunately a lot of these flats have been bought by people who didn't understand the need for ongoing investment in a property. We've had people with significant property portfolios who have been struck off the landlords' register.</p> <p>There can also be difficulties where residents are in agreement that work needs to be done, but one or two owners are unable or unwilling to contribute their share of the costs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Smith believes South Seeds' approach helps tenements residents take back some control of their lives and homes. They can give people on each stair confidence and support, even with just a very modest \u00a3278,000 to share around.</p> <blockquote> <p>The tenement champions can build up trust between neighbours. Once that's done, there's a lot that people can do for themselves.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>* This article has been amended to remove the name of the Glasgow city council spokesman.

Yet during his trip, those contradictions were barely acknowledged, despite the fact that the country is screaming out for decisive leadership and moral clarity.</p> <p>Last Thursday, Kim met President Jacob Zuma, finance minister Pravin Gordhan and other cabinet ministers in Pretoria, and then, down the road in Johannesburg, he praised the World Bank's local International Finance Corporation (IFC) staff, who are dedicated to private-sector investments, and <a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/a-great-day-in-south-africa-for-a-development-junkie\" title=\"\">even recorded a brief video</a> while visiting Mailtronic Direct Marketing, a successful, IFC-funded small business specialising in printing and posting.</p> <p>In his blog the next day, Kim was effusive about the trip, including \"possible collaboration on an issue dear to my heart: fighting the spread of tuberculosis\".</p> <p>Really? If this is not public relations gimmickry, and if Kim genuinely wants to tackle TB, it would mark a U-turn in the bank's historic trajectory. From 1951, the bank lavishly financed the then-apartheid regime's Eskom energy parastatal, which built coal-fired power plants and transmission lines that entirely avoided black townships and villages. The majority of the country's people were left to use dirty indoor energy (paraffin, coal and wood) for cooking and warming their shelters, regardless of the profuse particles produced that could lead to or exacerbate respiratory illnesses.</p> <p>Bank-financed electricity mainly supplied South Africa's mining houses and smelters, as is still the case (the main customer of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/01/medupi-world-bank-loan-vote\" title=\"\">Medupi coal-fired power station</a> currently being built will be BHP Billiton, which consumes more than 10% of the country's power to smelt aluminium). Then and now, this facilitated South Africa's notorious migrant labour system, with low pay to migrant workers who succumbed to TB in squalid, single-sex, 16-to-a-room hostels and shacks.</p> <p>Kim failed to address these historic issues, which are mirrored in his institution's current portfolio, especially the <a href=\"http://ciel.org/Law_Communities/Lonmin_17Aug2012.html\" title=\"\">IFC's controversial commitment</a> (approved by former president Paul Wolfowitz in 2007) of $150m in equity/credit lines to <a href=\"http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/spiwebsite1.nsf/0/f79e1c278b21ebc2852576ba000e2919?opendocument\" title=\"\">Lonmin</a> at the Marikana mine, as well as the $3.75bn for the Medupi plant north of Pretoria, pushed through by his immediate predecessor, Robert Zoellick.</p> <p>The 34 victims of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/south-african-police-shoot-striking-miners?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Marikana massacre</a> were mainly migrants from Lesotho and the Eastern Cape. Their migrant labour status replicates apartheid, including health vulnerability in disease-ridden shack settlements.</p> <p>Many more low-income South Africans have shifted to <a href=\"http://ccs.ukzn.ac.za/files/groundwork%20WB%20and%20Eskom.pdf\" title=\"\">dirty energy sources</a> (pdf) that spread TB, thanks to electricity price increases of 128% from 2008-12, justified by Eskom's \"build programme\", which features Medupi. Worsening price and access problems, in turn, have prompted thousands of \"service delivery protests\" that often became violent. The very day Kim arrived, hundreds of Medupi workers downed tools over grievances associated with outsourcing, and protests forced <a href=\"www.allzanews.com/2012/09/06/eskom-evacuates-plant-as-protest-turns-violent/\" title=\"\">an evacuation</a> of the construction site.</p> <p>\"Coal is a difficult issue,\" Kim said at his Pretoria press conference, while promising to help with South Africa's $100bn coal-centred infrastructure expansion. Medupi alone will spew 25m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> annually, more than the emissions total of 115 countries.</p> <p>Then Kim's spin turned surreal. \"There was a very strong sense that this clean coal project [Medupi] was the way to go,\" he said. The very phrase evokes a shudder, considering <a href=\"http://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/9553_coal-plants-health-impacts.pdf\" title=\"\">an estimated 10,000 people die annually from multilateral-financed, coal-fired power plants</a>, according to the Environmental Defence Fund. Given the ongoing mining chaos here, including widespread acid mine drainage wrecking eastern South Africa's water, \"clean coal\" is a contradiction in terms. The renewable energy piece of the Eskom loan was acknowledged as a \"fig leaf\" by <a href=\"http://openmediaboston.org/node/1250\" title=\"\">William Moomaw</a>, a bank consultant to the Medupi loan.</p> <p>What about Kim's enthusiastic praise for Mailtronic's \"great story\"? Organised labour here valiantly opposes \"tenderpreneur\" dealings that cause state shrinkage via outsourced tenders on behalf of entrepreneurs. The World Bank pushed Pretoria to privatise after Nelson Mandela took office in 1994, and it was insensitive for Kim to promote outsourced printing when the government should be building internal mass-communications capacity.</p> <p>Equally dubious was the claim that IFC's stake in Mailtronic's junk-mail paper/packaging waste \u2013 with its promotion of rampant consumerism \u2013 contributes to fighting poverty.</p> <p>As the neoliberal Columbia University <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/apr/27/world-bank-mistake-jagdish-bhagwati\" title=\"\">economist Jagdish Bhagwati</a> said of the US-led nomination and selection process in April, it was of a piece with the \"linguistic obfuscations that dominate American public debate\", and allowed Kim to gain presidency of the World Bank unfairly. Though I would quickly diverge from Bhagwati's agenda, Kim's visit here gives further reasons for him <a href=\"http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/04/16/why-jim-kim-should-resign-from-the-world-bank/\" title=\"\">to resign</a>, before more futile statements are uttered in defence of the indefensible at the World Bank.</p>",
  "<p>Spain's economic troubles have seen a fourth golf tournament fall by the wayside this year, after confirmation from the European Tour that next month's Andaluc\u00eda Masters has been cancelled.</p> <p>Already the Madrid Open, the Castell\u00f3 Masters and the Iberdrola Open have been casualties of Spain's dismal economic situation.</p> <p>The Andaluc\u00eda Masters has been staged at Valderrama since 2010, effectively replacing the Volvo Masters at the same venue, and last year Sergio Garc\u00eda supplied the spectators with a home victory, when the tournament offered a \u20ac3m prize fund. This year's tournament was due to have been played from 18-21 October.</p> <p>A change of government in Andaluc\u00eda has proved to be pivotal to the competition's prospects. Those who run the region \u2013 the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda \u2013 had been sponsoring the event due to a lack of corporate funding. \"Despite discussions with the Royal Spanish Golf Federation, and a formal legal agreement with the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, the tournament, won in 2011 by Sergio Garc\u00eda, will not take place,\" the European Tour said in a statement.</p> <p>George O'Grady, the chief executive of the European Tour, also suggested the body will now be looking for recompense. \"This is extremely disappointing news to receive, especially at such a late date,\" he said. \"This is an area we have a tight legal contract with which is being ignored. We have been long-term partners with the Junta for over 25 years.</p> <p>\"We have worked together to promote the region, and the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda and the European Tour have enjoyed an exceptionally strong and committed long-term partnership.</p> <p>\"We feel the disappointment not only for our members and all committed to broadcasting and reporting this tournament and the region on a global scale, but also for the many visitors, especially from northern Europe, who coincide their vacations with the tournament. We will work with the Junta to rectify this situation.\"</p> <p>The question now is if and how the tournament will be replaced from 2013, with O'Grady keen to highlight the merits of Valderrama, which became globally known after it staged the 1997 Ryder Cup. This year a lucrative matchplay event in Turkey \u2013 featuring Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald among others \u2013 will take place in early October.</p> <p>O'Grady added: \"This isn't Valderrama's problem. Valderrama has been tremendously helpful and supportive in the political arena. This is really down to a change of leadership in the area and how they do things.</p> <p>\"We always felt this one would be rescued, and we were prepared to go the extra mile with our own money, whether we cut the prize fund or things like that \u2013 but you can't do it if people won't talk back the other way. This is a big change in political leadership. The individual concerned probably doesn't understand what he's got with the Andaluc\u00eda Masters.\"</p>",
  "<p>The former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion has added his voice to those who want to extend two of England's largest national parks to include a much less frequently-visited but wonderfully wild landscape which currently lies between them.</p> <p>His intervention follows two previous poetic adventures in our northern hill country by the current Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy and Simon Armitage, both described in the <em>Guardian Northerner</em> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/01/blogpost-stanza-stones-simon-armitage-ilkley-literature-festival\">here </a>and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/15/carol-ann-duffy-poet-laureate-lancashire-witches-pendle\">here.</a></p> <p>Motion has called on the new Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, to expedite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/sep/28/lancashire-added-yorkshire-dales-national-park\">proposed extensions</a> to the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales national parks, so that they join at the M6's dramatic defile through the <a href=\"http://www.visitcumbria.com/peaks/howgills.htm\">Howgill fells.</a></p> <p>Sir Andrew took an excursion on land overlooking the M6 motorway to see the proposed extension areas and also climbed 609m (1998ft) <a href=\"http://www.mypennines.co.uk/howgill-fells/summits/middleton.html\">Middleton Fell</a> to get a panoramic view of spectacular landscape.</p> <p>Safely back at the bottom, he says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The boundaries of the National Parks were arbitrarily drawn and missed this amazing green landscape.

Now that Caroline Spelman has been replaced by Mr Paterson, campaigners are eager that the new secretary should speed up the process. Motion continues: </p> <blockquote> <p>The new Secretary of State should move the extension of the parks up the political agenda and get on with the public inquiry.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The poet, novelist and biographer looked down from his lofty excursion on to communities in the Lune valley area, as the guest of landscape charity <a href=\"http://www.fld.org.uk/\">Friends of the Lake District</a>, who are campaigning to increase the protection for this beautiful part of the world. They invited him in his capacity as president of the <a href=\"http://www.cpre.org.uk/\">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a> as well as to support their own efforts in Cumbria.</p> <p>One of the factors driving the campaign is the number of wind-farm proposals for areas just outside the protection of the national parks, including the breezy flanks of the Howgills. Giving extra protection to the 'in-between' parts of Cumbria and North Yorkshire takes on further significance with the Government's plans to shake up the planning laws.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>10.26am: Good morning all. It's the final week of the county blog this week and we're at four games today. Andy Wilson is at Glamorgan v Kent; Richard Rae will be taking in Derby v Hampshire; Richard Gibson is at Essex v Yorkshire and Michael Perkins will be watching Lancashire v Surrey.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>10.30am: Well, this is it, D-Day, according to Derbyshire coach Kark Krikken, <em>reports Richard Rae at the County Ground</em>. Division Two leaders Derbyshire will start the day 50-3, trailing Hampshire by 222 \u2013 and are not dissatisfied with that situation, according to Krikken. In fact had they been just two down, they'd have been \"fairly happy\". The key, quoth Krikken, will be for at least Usman Khawaja, currently in company with nightwatchman Tony Palladino, to get through the first half hour.</p> <p>\"After that it's usually a batting paradise against the older ball. This is a massive day for us. Whoever gets the lead in the game has a stranglehold. It's a funny wicket this \u2013 sometimes it turns and sometimes you expect it to and it doesn't. That will play a part but we've chased down runs on this wicket and we've also set totals in the first innings, so we are well in it.\"</p> <p>As of course are Yorkshire at Essex, and \u2013 just about \u2013 Kent at Glamorgan. We're set reasonably fair, albeit there's a cold wind, with rain not forecast (by the BBC) until 3ish. Off we go.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.36am: Morning all, after losing the first day to rain, Lancashire and Surrey are back for another go at Aigburth, <em>writes Michael Perkins</em>. We've just had an inspection but there will not be any play before lunch, which will be taken early. The aim then will be to start this game at 12.40pm. </p> <p>If we do get some cricket, don't rule out the possibility of still getting a result here. The conditions and a pitch which has had a day under the damp covers should be conducive to flurries of wickets.</p> <p>Despite securing their Division One status, Surrey look reasonably strong bar the omissions of Kevin Pietersen and Murali Kartik. Lancashire will have been frustrated yesterday that they couldn't begin the process of recovering from relegation to Division Two. Perhaps more exasperated than most will have been England under-19 wicketkeeper Alex Davies, who is set to make his debut. Ashwell Prince is Lancashire's major absentee.</p> <p>Fingers crossed I can bring you some cricket today rather than just searching for super sopper and trying to find fruit pastilles which have dispersed themselves throughout my rucksack.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>11.38am: There promises to be some twists and turns in this promotion race yet, and Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie last night admitted he has been keeping an eye on events unfolding elsewhere, <em>writes Richard Gibson</em>.<br> After securing a third batting point this morning, the White Rose can now be assured of promotion if they win this match at Chelmsford, as Kent can no longer catch them even with a full-points victory (and there has been only one of those in either division this season, would you believe.) Having started on 284 for eight, Yorkshire were on the threshold of that third point when Azeem Rafiq \u2013 whose half-century occupied 120 balls and included just one four \u2013 drove loosely and fatally at Graham Napier. A great roar from the visiting supporters greeted the single squeezed behind square on the off-side by Steve Patterson, whose stumps were splattered a dozen runs later by Napier. That completed a second five-wicket haul of the season for Napier, and Yorkshire's innings of 312.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>12.23pm: Kent have finally dismissed Glamorgan for 390, with Matt Coles collecting the two remaining wickets this morning to end with four for 76, <em>writes Andy Wilson from Cardiff</em>. But that leaves Rob Key's team with an awful lot of work to do to secure the win they need to have a realistic chance of overhauling either Yorkshire or Derbyshire in the battle for promotion.</p> <p>Both Peakites and Tykes may raise a glass at the end of the week to Jim Allenby, the Australian who turns 30 today, and ended unbeaten on 125, his second century of the season. Now Graham Wagg, a former Derbyshire man, is bowling at Key, with the highly-rated and in-form Sam Northeast at the other end.<br> It's lovely to be in Cardiff, but very sad to reflect on the decline of Glamorgan in recent years. They were such an uplifting story when they won the Championship in 1997 under the captaincy of Matthew Maynard, with a rising membership and terrific coverage from the Welsh media reflecting the genuine national interest in their fortunes. Now they're playing at a smart, if slightly soulless, international stadium, but have been struggling for most of the two division era, having been relegated in each of their seasons in the top flight since 2000. </p> <p>They are battling here to climb above Leicestershire and avoid the indignity of the wooden spoon, but have long been condemned to a seventh consecutive season in Division Two. That just feels wrong \u2013Glamorgan could and should be a leading county. </p> <p>It's instructive to compare the pedigree of the two teams in action here. Kent have had well-publicised financial problems which have even forced them to sell some of the family silver, but they are still fielding four internationals \u2013 Key, Geraint Jones, Brendan Nash and James Tredwell \u2013 plus a couple who are tipped to play for England in the future in Northeast and Coles. Darren Stevens, Mark Davies, Charlie Shreck and the former Glamorgan batsman Mike Powell are all experienced county pros, even if Powell had struggled in his last couple of seasons in Wales.</p> <p>In contrast Glamorgan must be the greenest team in the county game. David Lloyd and Michael Reed have made their debuts in recent weeks, Glover's came last year, the openers Will Bragg and Nick James are still proving themselves, and the only man in this team to have played international cricket is to retire at the end of this match \u2013 Robert Croft, a Welsh sporting institution who must be relishing the prospect of a farewell interview with his old England team-mate Dominic Cork, who is covering this match for Sky Sports News. Croft's last conversation as a Glamorgan player with Edward Bevan, the long-serving and erudite BBC Wales cricket guru who is one of the few members of that old media troop who remain, promises to be an even more emotional listen.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>1.05pm: Lunch finds Derbyshire on 167-5 at the County ground, <em>reports Richard Rae</em> \u2013 on the face of it, a decent morning for them considering they started on 50-3. </p> <p>Usman Khawaja has applied himself with appropriate circumspection in moving to 71, while Tony Palladino biffed away merrily and successfully in scoring 58 off78 balls, the highlight two hooked sixes in three balls off James Tomlinson. Once Palladino was out, however, it has looked a rather different game \u2013 Dan Redfern struggled before edging Sean Ervine to second slip, and Khawaja himself has looked far less secure. </p> <p>They're still 105 behind Hampshire's first innings, so the game remains very much in the balance. As such the news from Cardiff in particular is being monitored approvingly.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>1.06pm: Yorkshire have joined Derbyshire in the \"live\" Division Two table by taking three wickets, and therefore adding a bowling point to their three batting points, on the second morning at Chelmsford, <em>writes Richard Gibson</em>. </p> <p>Having posted 312 all out, Yorkshire then reduced Essex to 32 for three by the interval with some disciplined bowling. Jaik Mickleburgh had his off-bail trimmed via an inside edge to provide Steve Patterson with a 43rd County Championship success of the season, Tom Westley was trapped lbw by Azeem Rafiq's first ball, playing inside an off-break, and Mark Pettini then over-balanced aiming to leg to be pinned by a full delivery by Moin Ashraf, falling over on the stroke of lunch. </p> <p>I must say it's much nicer to be ensconced in this three-way tussle for promotion than having to think about England matters. Delaying the announcement of the squad will not make much difference to the players (those picked will be informed anyway) but it will only serve to increase speculation about the presence or otherwise of one Kevin Pietersen. Incidentally, it is seven years to the day that KP scored his defiant and glorious 158 against Australia at the Oval to the greatest fanfare I have seen inside a cricket ground. Let's say I enjoyed the Ashes drama more than this 2012 version.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>1.37pm: I think we've once again made the mistake of trying to start a game of cricket here in Liverpool, <em>writes Michael Perkins</em>. We got close this time. We even were issued with scorecards and had players warming up on the pitch. Unfortunately it was beneath nervy clouds though and their cue to open on this occasion was the umpires walking out to the middle to instruct the removal of the final set of covers from the wicket.</p> <p>We are now all covered up once again and play has been abandoned for the day. As one of my colleagues in the press box said the rain blob on the radar is \"massive\". This is the eighth full day of cricket Lancashire have lost to the weather this season. That compares to a total of only 250 overs \u2013 little more than two and a half days \u2013 being lost when they won the Championship last year.</p> <p>Lancashire's cricket director Mike Watkinson said: \"It is cold it is wet and it just sums up the season in many ways. \"On the field when we've had the chance to play we've not done what we're capable of. That's pretty obvious, but it has gone from being a remarkable 2011 to a forgettable 2012 for many reasons.\"</p> <p>\"We don't know what weather 2013 has in store, but what it will have is a lot of very committed cricketers working to put one or two things right and get us back on track again.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>3.41pm: Yorkshire have moved to the top of Division Two for the first time this season after reducing Essex to 119 for six at Chelmsford, <em>writes Richard Gibson</em>.<br> Although Derbyshire and Yorkshire were joint top after five rounds on 65 points apiece, the midlands county were official leaders by virtue of taking more wickets than their promotion rivals. Not a bad time for Andrew Gale's team to overtake them, I would suggest, and Gale had a hand in the sixth wicket that sealed the significant second bowling point. It was a bit-part to be fair, completing the most straightforward of catches at mid-on after Adam Wheater made a horlicks of a pull off Ryan Sidebottom. Wheater's stroke was horribly reminiscent of some of those that cost Yorkshire afternoon wickets yesterday. It took a stand of 63 spanning 21 overs between captain James Foster and Ryan ten Doeschate to provide the Essex innings with a coating of respectability after Owais Shah poked to slip off spinner Azeem Rafiq in the first over after lunch. However, Foster was then dismissed in the sixth over of Steve Patterson's probing second spell - another full delivery doing the damage. Ten Doeschate has stood out as the one Essex batsman to apply himself, and twice struck Rafiq for sixes over long-on, the second plopping into the River Can, on his way to a 74-ball 50.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>4.10pm: Frustratingly, the 30 overs of the morning session were all that were possible in the match between Derbyshire and Hampshire, <em>reports Richard Rae from the County Ground</em>. </p> <p>The rain set in as the players came out after lunch and hasn't stopped since \u2013 in fact it's harder now than ever. Those 30 overs featured an entertaining innings from Tony Palladino, whose 58 off 78 balls included two mighty hooks for six before he chipped a catch to mid-on, while Usman Khawaja remains not out on 71. </p> <p>The other wicket to fall was that of Dan Redfern, caught at second slip off the spin of Liam Dawson for 4. It means Derbyshire will resume still 105 behind and once again nervously eyeing the scores from Cardiff and Chelmsford, in the knowledge Yorkshire's bonus point haul means that as the table stands, they have been deposed at the top of Division Top for the first time since May.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>4.29pm: A lovely moment here in Cardiff, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>, as Robert Croft, the Glamorgan veteran who is making his farewell appearance, claimed the key wicket of Sam Northeast - who was not even born when he made his first-team debut way back in 1989. </p> <p>Northeast, the 22-year-old Harrovian who scored a crucial century in Kent's last game against Derbyshire, had made a stylish 62. But Croft tied him in knots in the last over before tea, and finally won an lbw verdict from the umpire Trevor Jesty - the 1,169th first-class wicket of the 42-year-old's career. </p> <p>Kent will resume after the break on 137 for three, still 253 behind - and the former Glamorgan batsman Mike Powell expected to join Brendan Nash.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>4.49pm: Some long handle from Tymal Mills during an entertaining 10th wicket stand removed the follow-on dilemma for Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale at Chelmsford, <em>writes Richard Gibson</em>.<br> Mills twice crunched Azeem Rafiq's off-spin for sixes on his way to a career-best 20 not out, the second of which took his side beyond the critical 162-run total. Mills shared 29 runs with Tom Craddock before the latter edged to second slip to become Moin Ashraf's third wicket in a 21-ball spell after tea. Graham Napier was dismissed in the same manner and Reece Topley was lbw first ball to plunge the hosts to 148 for nine. The evening session began with Ryan ten Doeschate holing out to deep midwicket off Rafiq for 62.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>6.25pm: And that's it for the county liveblog for the day \u2013 the comments will stay open for any more reports and debates.</p> <p>You can follow all the latest reports on our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket\">dedicated cricket site</a>.

Hoping you might agree, here is what I hear him saying in the new introduction to his collected lectures, <a href=\"http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/2535/faith-in-the-public-square-forthcoming-book-by-archbishop-rowan-williams\" title=\"\">Faith in the Public Square</a>, crucial elements lost <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9530382/Archbishop-launches-parting-attack-on-critics.html\" title=\"\">in the reports of last weekend's media</a>.</p> <p>He does criticise the way the economy is run when focused on growth for growth's sake. He does have a pop at his predecessor, Lord Carey, who has complained that Christians are being persecuted in this country. But what is missed in the headlines are the deeper, penetrating points. \"We have been hearing a lot about the dangers of 'aggressive secularism',\" he writes, but that noise obscures the fact that the notion of secularism does not describe where our society is at. (Keeping up the noise presumably suits the \"aggressors\".)</p> <p>Most people do not live in a disenchanted world. Public rituals persist. I write as the Red Arrows fly overhead, celebrating the Olympics. Why do acrobatic jets suit the moment? Is it the roar? The colour? It is hard to say, which is partly why the ritual works. So if we are to progress crucial questions about how society can be organised around a diversity of beliefs, Williams continues, hadn't we better be clearer about where we are actually at?</p> <p>The way he frames his interventions is striking too. To attempt to be a public commentator of any weight, he stresses, is to be doomed to failure. Some will accuse you of straying into their territory. Others will accuse you of platitudinous dumbing down. Others again will make the case for inscrutability. Williams knows he will fail. He signed up to that when he signed up to Christianity because Christianity recognises that failure is what human beings do. And yet, the recognition is not humiliating but liberating \"because it delivers us from aspiring to mythic goals of absolute human control over human destiny\".</p> <p>He practises the risk he preaches. In <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9529526/Archbishop-of-Canterbury-interview-I-dont-think-I-cracked-it.html\" title=\"\">the interview he gave at the weekend</a>, he floated the idea of a president of the Anglican communion to relieve the next archbishop of his global duties. He is undoubtedly right that the job is impossible and will become more undoable. That solution, though, would surely sink the church into further division and squabbles. Can you imagine the power struggle that would ensue in the selection of such a figurehead?</p> <p>In the book, Williams continues: \"The best thing to hope for is that at least some of the inevitable mistakes may be interesting enough (or simply big enough) for someone else to work out better responses.\" Which professional politician would and could express such mitigated optimism? Actually, I suspect Boris conveys a not dissimilar stance and that is part of his appeal. Maybe the hair does matter.</p>",
  "<p>As many kids have done before me, I lapped up Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when primary-school age. However, when I tried to tune in to the evening ITV show <a href=\"http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/861\" title=\"\">Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected</a>, I was forcibly ejected from the sitting room by my parents. The 70s title sequence of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqAavKou7Ck\" title=\"\">curvy female silhouettes dirty-dancing against a red background</a> was enough to signal to them that this smut was not for me.</p> <p>Thirty odd years on, the \"national treasure\" status of this complex character best known for his prolific children's fiction is now assured. It may not yet be printed in your average week-at-a-view desk diary but 13 September is <a href=\"http://www.roalddahlday.info/\" title=\"\">Roald Dahl Day</a>.</p> <p>I've recently re-familiarised myself with Dahl's junior output through my eight-year-old. The story CDs recorded in his own seductively velvety tones are a handy kids' bedtime device for their soporific quality. Now his often overlooked adult content \u2013 the thought of which so horrified my folks \u2013 is also being <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Search/QuickSearchProc/1,,,00.html?strSearch=Roald+Dahl&amp;searchProfile=UK-590614-global&amp;advSearchStr=&amp;adv=0&amp;retainableText=Roald%20Dahl&amp;path=&amp;textSearch=Roald%20Dahl&amp;homeNav=&amp;travel=&amp;sortBy=pubdateDsc\" title=\"\">reissued as audiobooks</a>, fittingly read by a brace of national treasures.</p> <p>Even if his best-known books date from the 1960s onwards, Dahl can still command headlines. When his supermodel granddaughter Sophie appeared on Radio 4's Today programme last year, the public were outraged that she seemed to be asking for public funding for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/sep/13/roald-dahl-fund-hut\" title=\"\">restoration of his writing hut</a>. The issue has since been resolved, and as part of Roald Dahl day the interior of the outbuilding has been <a href=\"http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/9599742.Roald_Dahl_s_Writing_Hut_goes_on_display_today/\" title=\"\">recreated</a> at the Roald Dahl Museum in his hometown of Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, funded by the family and his charitable foundation. The saga's twists and turns were meticulously covered by specialist site <a href=\"http://www.shedworking.co.uk/2011/09/controversy-rages-over-restoration-of.html\" title=\"\">Shedworking</a>.</p> <p>This controversy is absent from Michael Rosen's <a href=\"http://www.puffinvirtuallylive.co.uk/author/roalddahlday\" title=\"\">new biography</a> \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly given that it is published by children's imprint Puffin Books. Rosen includes new archival material \u2013 school photos and letters to Mama from his war hero and boarding school days. It's a warm portrait that largely concentrates on his young life and doesn't dwell on episodes like the breakdown of his first marriage because, as his publicist points out, it's primarily for 8- to 10-year-olds. Adult biographer Jeremy Treglown meanwhile labels Dahl \"a fantasist, an anti-semite, a bully and a self publicising trouble-maker\" and describes his extensive sexual liaisons when working in the US.</p> <p>It's the books themselves that fascinate most though: his adult material is not for prudes. The \"horny\" character Uncle Oswald, \"the greatest fornicator of all time\", gets a novel to himself and pops up in Switch Bitch \u2013 a collection of short stories that originally appeared in Playboy. In Bitch, following a scientific experiment to produce a scent that stimulates sexual attraction, he turns into a seven-feet penis that floats into space, declaring \"But tell me truly, did you ever see / a sexual organ quite so grand as me?\".</p> <p>There are running themes of vice and eroticism and as well as the darker cruel exploits and moralistic comeuppence that are familiar from his kids novels. The Great Switcheroo is a tale of wife swapping for a one-off darkened sex session between neighbouring couples without the wives knowing. Chocolate manufacturing or oversized peaches this ain't, but then again these stories were designed for an adolescent male audience in a pre-politically correct age where casual misogyny went more unnoticed than now.</p> <p>Hagiography is usually reserved for those who have departed us. Roald Dahl Day festivities are taking place at various venues across two countries. The <a href=\"http://www.norwegianchurchcardiff.com/content.asp?nav=160&amp;parent_directory_id=2&amp;id=707&amp;Language=\" title=\"\">Norwegian Church Arts Centre in Cardiff</a>, where Dahl was christened, has a day of activities. There is also a Roald Dahl gallery of the nearby Aylesbury County Museum, which recently ran a <a href=\"http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/bcc/museum/dahl_gallery/dahl_childrens_gallery.page?\" title=\"\">Roald Dahl festival</a>..</p> <p>His work may not be as zeitgeisty as EL James's Fifty Shades trilogy, but with amassed UK sales upwards of 37m books and more than a million of them shifted every year, Dahl still sells by the shed-load. Nonetheless, in the runup to Roald Dahl day some 22 years after his death, perhaps the two authors are not as far removed from each other as one might initially think.</p>",
  "<p>The papers are alive with the sound of a beleaguered chancellor scrambling for quick fixes to stimulate the economy and boost growth, amid declining popularity ratings. At the top of his agenda (yet again) is reform of the planning system \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.planningresource.co.uk/Policy_and_Politics/article/1058481/cameron-labels-planning-officials-enemies-enterprise/\" title=\"\">the so called \"enemy of enterprise\"</a> \u2013 where the green belt has been singled out for special attention.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/02/george-osborne-deregulation-planning-laws?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Speculation is rife that the government will allow green belt zoning to be relaxed</a>, letting major housing developments become national infrastructure projects and take key decisions away from local authorities in favour of national government. This would be a huge blow to localism, and signal the government's true intent (and political posturing) over giving local people a real chance to influence their futures.</p> <p>In the past, I myself have questioned the effectiveness of using green belts as a tool for sustainable development \u2013 and I make no apologies for this. This approach stifles innovative land use and its benefits can be limited by selective use of this approach around some of the larger cities in England and Scotland (there are no green belt areas in Wales). All too often, green belts don't act as positive agents for environmental and land use change.</p> <p>However, the idea of knee jerk reactions such as the sudden relaxation of green belts creates huge uncertainty \u2013 the real enemy of enterprise. What we need is a long-term vision of the kind of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland we all want to see, followed by a concerted effort to draw up a plan to achieve this. All government departments must also be on the same page.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) does not provide any meaningful spatial vision, and we are now seeing panicked responses that have no place in effective planning.</p> <p>All my research shows that a single-minded pursuit of the economy, society or the environment is fundamentally flawed. We need integrated plans for development that address all three of these components, otherwise we end up with disintegrated construction. For example, house building dominates the press, yet we are equally vulnerable to food, energy and climate crises that could halt the revitalisation of the economy.</p> <p>The answer is quite simple: we need to join up programmes across sectors \u2013 environment, education, transport, economy, and community \u2013 and scale down from global to EU to national, regional and local to achieve this.</p> <p>Instead of Osborne-led knee jerks we should have joined-up government across all departments on the future direction of our country and our economy. It may well be that the green belt should be reviewed, and I would welcome that. But that review should not happen simply to allow more house building, but to ensure that high quality green spaces are woven into the fabric of our urban and rural environments and are properly managed and used.</p> <p>I would implore Osborne to belt up and think about the long-term interests of planning and the economy \u2013 or he will be in for a very bumpy ride.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.bcu.ac.uk/research/-centres-of-excellence/centre-for-environment-and-society/our-people#alisterscott\">Alister Scott</a> is professor of environmental and spatial planning at the Birmingham school of the built environment, </em><a href=\"http://www.bcu.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Birmingham City University</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",

In his evidence to the education committee this morning, he came close to encouraging employers should devalue Welsh exam results. Here is a summary of the main points from the hearing.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Gove said that Welsh pupils would suffer as a result of<a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/09/11/leighton-andrews-orders-wjec-to-regrade-english-language-gcse-results-91466-31814517/\"> the Welsh government\u2019s decision to order GCSE results to be regraded </a>because in future employers would not value their qualifications as much as English ones.</strong> He said Leighton Andrews, the Labour education minster in the Welsh government, was being \u201cirresponsible\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that the children who have been disadvantaged are children in Wales. I think the decision by the Welsh education minister, Leighton Andrews, is irresponsible and mistaken. And I think that he has undermined confidence in Welsh children\u2019s GCSEs and I think that he should think again having made what I regard to be a regrettable political intervention in what should be a process free from political meddling ...</p> <p>He\u2019s in the wrong and the Welsh children are suffering. The difficulty, as pointed out by Ofqual yesterday, is that the same exam by the same board was sat by children either side of the English/Welsh border. Children in Wales did appreciably worse than children in England sitting the same exam. That reinforces what every interntional survey shows, which is that children in Wales have suffered as a result of education policies put forward by Labour politicians which have abolished league tables, ended the objective assessment of children at the end of key stage two and ensured that there is less rigour in the approach towards eduction.</p> <p>Now, finding himself in a fix and his education system in the dock, a Labour politician has attempted to shift blame. I think that is irresponsible and the children who suffer are the children from Wales who when they apply for jobs in England will hand over certificates which profess to be good passes and English employers will now say: \u201cI fear, through no fault of your own - I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the right person to be employed - but I cannot count your exam pass as equivalent to this other exam pass.\u201d And I think to have made the decision that he did, with the speed that he did, without appropriate consultation with Ofqual, was irresponsible and children in Wales, not just this year but in the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Graham Stuart, the Conservative chairman of the committee, said immediately after Gove finished these remarks that he agreed with 95% of them.</p> <p>Andrews explained his decision to order a regrading <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/michael-gove-does-not-own-gcse-brand-we-do\">in a powerful post on the New Statesman blog yesterday. </a>He said that as a result of Gove's decisions the exam system in the UK was fragmenting. \"We will, inevitably now I think, end up with largely separate exam systems in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland,\" he wrote.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He implicitly criticised the Lib Dems for refusing to accept that England already has a two-tier qualification system at GCSE.</strong> Gove wants to replace GCSEs with something similar to the old O-level, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/03/cameron-cabinet-reshuffle-politics-live1#block-504496d958f956c1a416afa7\">the Lib Dems have been insisting that the single-tier system must be preserved and that there must be no return to the era of O-levels for able children and CSEs for less able children.</a> But Gove said the GCSE was a two-tier qualification.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is that we already have a two-tier qualification system because of this distinction between the foundation and higher tiers ... I\u2019m not sure that many people outside the education world do know that there are two different types of GCSE, one of them the equivalent of the old CSE. You put people in for it, they cannot get better than a C, in the same way as top grade in an old CSE entitled you to an old O-level pass. I think it\u2019s wrong because it is an inherent cap on aspiration.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that grade inflation over recent years have been \u201cunfair\u201d on pupils.</strong> When he warned about the dangers of grade inflation when he was shadow education secretary, the then Labour government said he was \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cwicked\u201d because he was denigrating children\u2019s achievements, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, now that view has become the consensus ... And the children who have suffered are those children who every year have to endure a questioning of the credibility of their examinations, which is unfair on them and unfair on the teachers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said under Labour Ofqual took a decision to lower grade boundaries to make it easier for pupils to pass science exams.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the education committee was the best body best equipped to carry out an inquiry into the GCSE grading controversy.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to condemn ministers leaking information to the media.</strong> Asked if this was unacceptable, he said: \u201cI take a philosophical attitude towards leaks ... I think it\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk.\u201d The subject came up because it is widely assumed at Westminster that Gove was responsible for the fact that leaked detials of his plans to abolish GCSEs appeared in the Daily Mail earlier this year. Asked if he had ever leaked details of a a major announcement, Gove gave an evasive answer; he said that ministers took people into their confidence, and sometimes they could not control what those people did with the information.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he had \u201cno idea\u201d if leaking by ministers was covered by the ministerial code.</strong> Stuart, the committee chairman, said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by this admission.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-505059b2c0e37a1aa8682a16\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-12T09:45:23.744Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The committee is now asking Gove about policy relating to children.

For example, there were leaks about school building cuts. Legal advice was leaked. Private correspondence was leaked. His wife's private email advice was published on the front page of the Financial Times.</p> <p>Stuart says the committee deplores this. But will Gove deplore all leaks.</p> <p>Gove says it would not be conducive to the conduct of government to \"look back in anger\".</p> <p>Q: What sanction are there for ministers who leak to the media?</p> <p>Gove says he has no idea?</p> <p>Q: So you don't know about the ministerial code?</p> <p>Gove says he talks to many people. He should not waste his time worying about how is responsible for leaks.</p> <p>Q: So you seem to think it is alright for you to leak, because other people will leak against you?</p> <p>Gove says this is part of political life.</p> <p>Q: Would you leak information about a major announcement.</p> <p>Gove says he is not going to speculate about how ministers handle these matters. Ministers take people into their confidence. What they do with that information is a matter for them.</p> <p>Q: So you don't rule out major initiatives being leaked to the press?</p> <p>Gove says he won't comment, because they would be seen as a criticism of other departments.</p> <p>Stuart says Gove does not seem to be aware of what the ministerial code says about that. That \"flabbergasts me\", Stuart says.</p> <p>Gove says major announcements should be made to parliament first.</p> <p>But, when policy is being discussed, there are frank discussions. He would hope people will respect that confidence. But sometimes that confidence is breached. He won't say anything that could be interpreted as a criticism of other ministers.</p> <p>His ability to present information to parliament has been damaged by leaks.

  "<p>When it was originally unveiled, the iPhone was so universally revered that wags dubbed it the \"Jesus Phone\". Five years on, its power is so great that its latest iteration could perform the miraculous feat of saving the US economy.</p> <p>Apple's release of the iPhone 5 on Wednesday could materially impact US gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of the year, claimed JP Morgan's chief economist Michael Feroli in a note to clients. Boosting the bottom line of the world's most valuable company is one thing, but Feroli contends that iPhone sales could add between 0.25 and 0.5 of a percentage point to the US's sluggish economic growth rate.</p> <p>JP Morgan expects Apple to sell around 8m of the new devices in the fourth quarter and for the iPhone 5 to be priced at about $600. Subtracting about $200 in imported component costs would allow the government to factor in $400 per phone into its GDP calculations for the fourth quarter, according to Feroli's calculations.</p> <p>In his note, Feroli wrote: \"Calculated using the so-called 'retail control method', sales of iPhone 5 could boost annualized GDP growth by $3.2bn, or $12.8bn at an annual rate.\" Sales would help prop up the struggling US economy by limiting \"the downside risk to our Q4 GDP growth protection, which remains 2%\", he wrote.</p> <p>Feroli said the estimate of between a quarter to a half point of annualized GDP \"seems fairly large, and for that reason should be treated skeptically\". But, he added, \"we think the recent evidence is consistent with this projection\".</p> <p>The report met with some scepticism among Feroli's peers. \"God help us if we have to rely on the iPhone to underpin the US economy,\" said one analyst who wished to remain anonymous. Others questioned the math, pointing out that if people buy iPhones with money they had intended to spend elsewhere, there would be no GDP boost.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG said the larger point was what the story said about the US economy. \"There's no doubt that Apple are going to sell millions of these things,\" he said. \"But it underscores how weak the economy is that we even care about the possible impact of a quarter percentage boost to the economy.\"</p> <p>Of course there is always the tiny possibility that Apple will not be releasing the iPhone 5 at all. The notoriously secretive company has given no details of tomorrow's much anticipated launch. If it isn't a new iPhone, heaven help us all.</p>",
  "<p>The United Kingdom is facing forces that are trying to tear it apart. The Scottish nationalists grab most of the attention, but Wales has its own nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, and earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/23/leanne-wood-wales-plaid-cymru\" title=\"\">Leanne Wood, a 40-year-old former probation officer, became its first female leader.</a> I interviewed her at the end of last week and these are the highlights.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Wood said Wales was not ready for independence because it was not self-sufficient economically. </strong>Although Plaid Cymru is committed to independence as a long-term goal, Wood said \"it could not happen tomorrow\" because the Welsh economy was too weak and that it would take \"a lot of work\" to get to the stage where an independent Wales would be financially viable. <a href=\"http://www.clickonwales.org/2012/07/wales-breaks-10000-spending-per-head-barrier/\" title=\"\">(One recent report said that because public spending per head is higher in Wales, and tax receipts per head are lower, Wales has a fiscal deficit of \u00a35,783 per head, compared with \u00a32,000 per head in England.)</a> Wood said Wales had to make up for the fact that its economy had been in decline compared with the rest of the UK for the last 20 years and that giving more economic powers to the Welsh assembly would put the country on the road to recovery.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 She accused Iain Duncan Smith of perpetuating \"negative stereotypes\" about the Welsh. </strong>Referring to his comment about people in Merthyr being unwilling to travel to Cardiff to find work, she said: \"When was the last time he went there and spoke to people from Merthyr?\" She also said that the Welsh in general were still sometimes subject to ridicule because of their nationality and she singled out MTV's show The Valleys as a particularly \"awful\" example of anti-Welsh stereotyping.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Wood said she could imagine Plaid Cymru being led at some point in the future by someone who did not speak Welsh. </strong>\"I rarely use the Welsh language myself in my day-to-day work, so in some senses you could argue that they already have [a non Welsh-speaking leader],\" said Wood, who is the first person not fluent in Welsh to lead the party.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 She said Wales would benefit if it could become a multilingual nation. </strong>\"We could do an awful lot in Wales if we were eventually a multilingual nation,\" she said. \"There are a number of studies now that suggest that if people have more than one language, their minds are open to learning a third and a fourth and even more languages.\"</p> <p>We met in Wood's office at the Welsh assembly in Cardiff Bay. For me, it's a good place to contemplate long-term change because I started my career on the South Wales Echo in the early 1990s when Cardiff Bay was mostly derelict wasteland next to mudflats. Now there's a barrage, an attractive waterfront, a world-class concert hall and, of course, a mini parliament. Scotland and Wales both voted for devolution 15 years ago this month but nationalism in the two countries is very different. In Cardiff it's slow, and gradualist. Wood is not anticipating, or even demanding, full independence any time soon. But she thinks it will happen eventually. Here's what she had to say. You can decide for yourself whether you think she's right.</p> <h2><strong>Nationalism</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Why are you a nationalist?</strong></p> <p>A: I see Wales very much as a country which is not at the moment reaching its full potential. Wales has its own history, its own unique language and is a distinct geographic entitity; to me, it makes sense for it to be a political unit.</p> <h2><strong>Scottish nationalism and Welsh nationalism</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Since devolution, Scottish nationalism has done very well, while Welsh nationalism hasn't done so well. What's your explanation for that?</strong></p> <p>A: If you are talking about the success of the national parties, you've got a point. But the Welsh nationalist agenda has progressed quite significantly since the setting up of devolution. What we've seen happening in Wales is that the British parties, the unionist parties, have taken on a lot of the policies that we've been advocating. We advocated the reform of the Barnett formula, measures to defend the Welsh language, for example, and the parties have come on board, on to our territory. There's no difference between the parties on those issues. And the same goes for extending devolution, in terms of the referendum that we won last year. All parties are united around progressing that agenda.</p> <p><strong>Q: But in terms of the party, what went wrong for Plaid over the last few years?</strong></p> <p>A: What's been successful in Scotland was extending a very good settlement that they had to start with. We started from a very different position in Wales; we're obviously a different country. We started with a different devolution settlement. So there was a job of work to do to establish the principle of devolution in Wales, which did not have to happen in Scotland. But if we look at where we are now, we are in a very different place from where we were when devolution was first set up. And certainly now, since the economic crash in 2008, people's problems are very different to the ones that they were back then and, in terms of Wales's economic position, the situation is getting worse. So now we have an opportunity within this current context.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid's leadership</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: One explanation for why nationalists have done better in Scotland might be that the SNP have got this mega-personality, Alex Salmond, and Plaid have not been able to put up a leader with that sort of charisma. Do you think that has been a factor?</strong></p> <p>A: I tend to think generally that things are mostly about politics and not personalities, to be honest with you, and what we've got to do here in Wales is get to the point where the SNP are in Scotland. And that means we've got to become the biggest party, we have got to be in a position to put these arguments, and then a referendum, to the people of Wales.</p> <h2><strong>Scottish independence referendum</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: If Scotland were to vote for independence, what impact would that have on electoral politics in Wales and Plaid's position?</strong></p> <p>A: That would have a big impact. It would send shockwaves, really, through the entire system because the United Kingdom as it currently exists would be no more. Then it would be a matter for Wales to decide what role we wanted to have in a newly shaped United Kingdom. And I've advocated a system which looks much more like a partnership of equals so that there is a strong voice for Wales within that. We share an island. There is going to be much common ground between the counties that currently make up the United Kingdom after that eventuality. On what basis will we be working together? That's the kind of conversation I would like people in Wales to have alongside the developments in Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Q: And if Scotland votes no, is that setback for your party and Welsh independence?</strong></p> <p>A: I don't think it has to be necessarily.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why not?</strong></p> <p>A: I would prefer a yes vote to happen in Scotland. But I think there's still a debate to be had about how we govern ourselves and how we look after our own affairs. There is public support in Wales, for example, for more independence in our health service. I would argue, with the economic problems that we've got, more independence is needed in terms of looking at our fiscal levers and what we can do in terms of making changes to the economy that we need to turn it into a successful economy, not a declining one.</p> <h2><strong>Independence</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: What model of independence are you looking at? Or, to put it another way, how independent would you like Wales to be?</strong></p> <p>A: As far as people in Wales want to go. I am of the view that everything comes back to the economy, that we can't really get to grips with the root problems of our economy unless we have more autonomy and ability to control the levers that affect these things. We have made representations to <a href=\"http://commissionondevolutioninwales.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">the Silk Commission</a> that is looking at the new financial powers that will come to Wales as a result of the various changes that are happening in other parts of the UK and <a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/news/2012/02/09/plaid-cymru-publishes-silk-commission-proposals-for-improving-nations-economic-performance/\" title=\"\">we have advocated more independence in terms of our fiscal levers</a> so that we can make those changes that we need to help.</p> <p><strong>Q: But it's sometimes been unclear, at least to me, whether Plaid are going for what they call in Scotland \"devo max\", or whether you want Wales to be a fully independent separate state, with a seat at the UN and passports and everything.</strong></p> <p>A: I've been clear that independence means full membership of the United Nations and everything that goes with that. But we are not in the same place as they are in Scotland and we are not as near to it as they are there. And the reason for that is that we have a declining economy. That has got to be the issue that is addressed first and foremost.</p> <p>I mentioned earlier on that since the economic crisis there is a new layer of problems facing people in Wales. There are a whole host of statistics that show that people in Wales are facing cuts that are worse [than elsewhere in the UK] because the public sector here is greater, and the number of people claiming benefits here is greater. And our unemployment rates are higher, which means that there is more demand on the public purse.</p> <p><strong>Q: Doesn't that then become a drag on the case for independence?</strong></p> <p>A: That's why we have to turn it round. We have to turn that situation around.</p> <p><strong>Q: But if you get independence before you've got a self-financing economy, you're in trouble, aren't you? Before you became leader, who wrote an article saying,</strong><a href=\"http://en.leannewood.com/?p=269\" title=\"\"><strong> \"Most of us who want independence for Wales accept the weak state of the Welsh economy means we would struggle to afford the current Welsh welfare bill.\"</strong></a><strong> So, if you go the independence model that you want, where would the money come from? In Scotland they've got oil.</strong></p> <p>A: This is why I've been clear that it could not happen tomorrow. We have to do a lot of work before we get to the point where we are in a position to do that. But ultimately we can go up to a point so far and then we will be constrained in how successful we will be able to become economically because we won't have the control over the levers that will be able to take us all the way there. All of our effort now has to go into job creation, so we get to a situation where we get more people contributing into the tax pot than there is money going out. That's the basis of any other country in the world. Any independent nation raises what it spends and it is not unreasonable to suggest that Wales could not be any different to any other country in the world, I would contend.</p> <p><strong>Q: So is that a prerequisite for independence? Does the Welsh economy have to get to that state before independence becomes sensible?</strong></p> <p>A: I would not say that's a prerequisite in any way, because ultimately what will decide when and how far we go will be the people of Wales.</p> <p><strong>Q: But the people of Wales are not going to vote for it if does not work economically.</strong></p> <p>A: At the moment there are low numbers of people who support the general idea of independence for Wales because of our economic situation. People understand the importance of prioritising the economy. We have to put that at the front of our agenda. And unless we can answer people's concerns about the Welsh economy then I don't think we are going to win the independence argument.</p> <p><strong>Q: You have said that independence is not something that you would want tomorrow because of these economic problems. So what kind of timescale are we talking about? Are you thinking of decades? It takes decades, or generations, to turn around an economy.</strong></p> <p>A: A report that was published by our newly set-up economy commission, <a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/uploads/downloads/Offas_gap.pdf\" title=\"\">a report called Offa's Gap, </a>has shown that the Welsh economy has been in decline relative to the UK economy for the last 20 years. So we have got 20 years' worth of decline to turn around just to get back to where we were in around 1994, 1995.</p> <p><strong>Q: But even then, which was roughly the time I was writing for the Western Mail, Wales was a net dependent, not a net contributor to the UK exchequer. From what you are saying, you seem to suggest it could take 20 years or more to get the economy to a stage where independence becomes viable.</strong></p> <p>A: I would hope that as we gain powers and more control over the economic levers, we would be able to see success faster than we have seen decline. The effort, then, has to go into job creation. We favour new models of companies, for example, so that there would be a big push to support co-operatives and social enterprises. Those sort of companies that we'll set up will employ local people and not then up sticks and move to other parts of the world where labour is cheaper. We've got to think about ways of restructuring our economy so that jobs remain, wealth remains locked into local areas, in a way that has not happened before. So much of the wealth generated in Wales has left in the past. If we learn anything from history, we have to make sure that in the future, when we go back to making things again, that we lock that wealth into Wales and into the pockets of people in Wales.</p> <p><strong>Q: How certain are you that Welsh independence will happen? Are you 100%, bet-your-house-on-it certain that it will happen in your lifetime? Or is it more likely than not?</strong></p> <p>A: I think, to be honest, eventually it's inevitable. People will arrive at the conclusion that we can only really prosper if we do things for ourselves.</p> <p><strong>Q: And are you talking about full-blown independence?</strong></p> <p>A: It's the ability to control our economic destiny that's the key thing for me. People will realise that we can try to work within this system, we can devolve some aspects and make some changes, but ultimately we won't be able to make the leap that we need to make unless we fully control our own economic destiny.</p> <h2><strong>Tax policy </strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In Scotland, Alex Salmond has suggested that one reason he would like control over taxes is that he can do an Ireland, lower corporation tax and bring investment into the country that way. Would a Plaid Wales be a country with lower rates than England or the rest of the UK?</strong></p> <p>A: We would look at taxation in the round. The debates that are going on within the Silk commission, some tax-raising powers look as though they will be coming to Wales. As I understand it, corporation tax is one of those that is more difficult. This economy commission that I have set up will be coming out with a raft of proposals in terms of taxation policy, so the specifics will have to wait, I'm afraid.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid and the pound</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In an independent Wales, would Plaid keep the pound?</strong></p> <p>A: That's a matter for discussion in the runup to the debate on independence. I know that they have got to come down with a view on that in Scotland. We are not in the same place. We don't know where the euro is going, for example, and we don't know what is going to happen to all forms of currency in the future. So I would say let's not put things in tablets of stone in terms of what currency we'd be using.</p> <h2><strong>Defence policy</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: What about defence? Would an independent Wales have its own armed forces?</strong></p> <p>A: I would like to see a serious reduction in the amount of money we spend on defence in general. I would obviously like to see Wales's share of defence expenditure reduced and spent on useful things. I have said in the past that the amount of money spent subsidising the arms industry is unsustainable and unacceptable as well and that I think huge savings could be made to put into the public services.</p> <h2><strong>BBC</strong> </h2> <p><strong>Q: Would an independent Wales still have the BBC?</strong></p> <p>A: Again, these are matters for people to look at further down the line.</p> <h2><strong>Royal family</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: And the monarchy. What's the party's position? Would an independent Wales keep the monarchy?</strong></p> <p>A: Our policy is that, after independence, we would put the matter as a question in a referendum to people.</p> <h2><strong>Relations with England after independence</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: You have talked about the need, in a post-independence settlement, for a relationship with England and Scotland and </strong><a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/the-slate/2012/06/29/another-union-is-possible/\" title=\"\"><strong>the idea of a \"neighbourhood of nations\".</strong></a><strong> What do you envisage? Are you just talking about meetings a couple of time a year? Or would the post-UK nations need to set up some kind of supra-national structure to coordinate on immigration and the environment and all the rest of it?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes. I think it would make sense for some kind of body to co-ordinate those big macro issues, and things around the sea, for example, as well. But it would have to be very much on a different basis from the current set up, where, within the Westminster parliament, the needs of England dominate. We would advocate that partnership being much more on the basis of equals.</p> <p>What happens in Scotland will determine where all of this goes. Whatever happens, there is going to be a referendum. Whether the outcome is yes or no, I would argue that there would need to be a conversation about what happens post that referendum.</p> <p><strong>Q: Alex Salmond </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/25/alex-salmond-hugo-young-lecture\" title=\"\"><strong>in his Hugo Young lecture this year</strong></a><strong> described himself as a \"staunch anglophile\". Are you an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I would not say I'm not an anglophile, specifically. I'm a francophile, I like Spain, I like Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Q: But are you a francophile but not an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I don't have to choose as far as I see it.</p> <p><strong>Q: No, but if you are happy to describe yourself as a francophile are you happy to describe yourself as an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I would like to see myself as somebody who looks to nations all over the world. England would be one of those. But it would not be over and above any others particularly for me.</p> <h2><strong>National identity</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Do you think it is sensible to talk about national identity? Is there such a thing as an English national identity and a Scottish national identity and a Welsh national identity?</strong></p> <p>A: I do think there is such a thing. My approach to politics is very much as a civil nationalist. So for me Wales is about who lives here now and what contribution they want to make to building up our communities and our civic body politics, if you like. In a world that is becoming more Coca-Cola or Pepsi or McDonald's or Big Mac, people are going to want to find ways that mark their identity out as a bit different, find aspects of culture that are unusual and quirky, because I think that everything being the same is a bit boring and bland.</p> <p><strong>Q: Ed Miliband gave </strong><a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/06/07/ed-miliband-s-englishness-speech-in-full\" title=\"\"><strong>a speech earlier this year on Englishness</strong></a><strong> and he identified \"quiet determination in the face of adversity\" as a particular English trait, or the essence of Englishness. What's the essence of Welshness?</strong></p> <p>A: In terms of what's at the essence of Welsh politics, I would say that there is a public service ethos, that there is a want for politics to be done on a more co-operative basis and for the reduction of inequalities to be centred as part of our politics. The centre of gravity of Welsh politics is much nearer to those values than it is in the UK as a whole.</p> <h2><strong>Discrimination against the Welsh</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In </strong><a href=\"http://en.leannewood.com/?page_id=123\" title=\"\"><strong>one of the articles you wrote during your leadership campaign</strong></a><strong> you talked about the Welsh still being victims of discrimination and how it was acceptable to ridicule the Welsh? Can you give me some examples of that?</strong></p> <p>A: Jeremy Clarkson. Anne Robinson. Various snipes and jibes about the Welsh language that happen on a fairly regular basis. Then, when people complain about them, they are told that they are being over-sensitive. Those kinds of things really. I don't want to particularly dwell on those aspects because we get accused of whingeing about irrelevant things. But I do get a sense sometimes that there are some nationalities in the world, some groups of people, where it is still acceptable to ridicule on the basis that they are of a particular nationality. And, thankfully, in many other areas of life that has become unacceptable. But there is still a hangover of some being left. I think we need to move on from that.</p> <p><strong>Q: How do you feel about the way the way the Welsh are portrayed on TV? There was a Valleys comedy, Stella, on recently. Or Gavin and Stacey? Do you have a problem with those?</strong></p> <p>A: No. There's a bit of humour there. We can all laugh and enjoy programmes like that. I would be more critical of <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/the-valleys\" title=\"\">the latest MTV attempt to show the Valleys</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q: I haven't seen that.</strong></p> <p>A: Don't go there. It's awful. But they tried to pluck young people out of the sleepy hamlet of the Valleys and put them in the big bright lights of Cardiff.</p> <p><strong>Q: That's one of these reality programmes.</strong></p> <p>A: It's that sort of programme. There have been lots of sheep in the publicity shots, so I can guess where that's going.</p> <p>There have been a lot of negative stereotypes out there. A lot of them have been pushed by the Conservative party, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11605318\" title=\"\">like Iain Duncan Smith when he went to Merthyr and said people don't want to travel from Merthyr to Cardiff</a>, really stereotyping. When was the last time he went there and spoke to people from Merthyr? There are plenty of people I know who would travel, and do travel, an awful long way to find work but there isn't work out there for them. But I don't particularly want to contribute to further accusations of us just whingeing and not being able to take a joke.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid and the Welsh language</strong></h2> <p>Q: I posted<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/06/ask-plaid-cymru-leanne-wood?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"> a blog inviting people to suggest questions to ask you</a> and there were quite a few comments from people [like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18110465\" title=\"\">showmaster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18111334\" title=\"\">Temulkar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18114609\" title=\"\">yahyah</a>] saying they were put off Plaid by the sense that it was a party only for Welsh speakers. Do you accept that's a problem for the party?</p> <p>A: I would argue that nobody is excluded from Plaid Cymru and we seek to defend the rights of Welsh-language speakers in the same context as we seek to defend the rights of other minorities who experience discrimination. So for us it's an equalities issue and an issue about rights. But the idea that people would feel excluded from being part of Plaid Cymru would concern me, to be honest. It is never something that I've felt. I've learnt Welsh and I am still in the process of learning Welsh. I can't call myself fluent in it unfortunately yet. But certainly I have never felt any discrimination on the grounds of not being a fluent Welsh speaker.</p> <p><strong>Q: But this is what</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18115528\" title=\"\"><strong> one woman</strong></a><strong> said: \"It put me off joining Plaid, which I seriously considered, when it was made clear that although they will try and accommodate English speakers, they prefer to communicate in Welsh at my local meetings.\" She also said: \"The feeling among a lot of people I've spoken to here is that Plaid have some good policies, but despite the nice words about inclusivity in the Plaid manifesto, on the ground there tends to be a narrow-minded, insular, corrupt anti-incomer mindset.\" Other people said similar things. Why is that perception out there?</strong></p> <p>A: In some communities there are tensions where people are perceived to have lots of money, they move in and buy up inflated-priced properties. It could be a reflection of some of those tensions within communities. But generally I would encourage people like that to contact me directly so I can have a private conversation about where these problems are arising because I am really keen to ensure that Plaid Cymru is a party open to everybody, whichever part of Wales they are in.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can you ever imagine Plaid being led by somebody who did not speak Welsh?</strong></p> <p>A: Well, yes I can. I rarely use the Welsh language myself in my day to day work, so in some senses you could argue that they already have. I'm trying to learn and one of the reasons is political. I would say for many people in Plaid Cymru who are not first language Welsh speakers, we want to learn. But, equally, there are plenty of people who are members who are not learning. And that is fine. I would say there's no pressure to learn the language.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18110141\" title=\"\"><strong>One person</strong></a><strong> raised education as an issue in the context of this. He or she said: \"I am a welsh speaker but you must realise that statements from you, that all children in Wales will be taught partly through the medium of Welsh, are disastrous and instantly destroy support in non-Welsh speaking Wales.\" What do you say to that?</strong></p> <p>A: I'm not convinced that this would put people off. I come at this from an education perspective, in that I think we could do an awful lot in Wales if we were eventually a multilingual nation. There are a number of studies now that suggest that if people have more than one language, their minds are open to learning a third and a fourth and even more languages. And that minds are open to other subjects as well. So, in terms of a new approach in schools to look at becoming multilingual eventually, then to start with the two that we've got here, and then introducing a third and maybe a fourth later on within the school curriculum, we should be able to create a multilingual population which would give us an economic advantage in the future.</p> <p><strong>Q: You've talked about language as a discrimination issue. Are there any circumstances where people who do not speak Welsh are facing discrimination in Wales because they apply for jobs where Welsh is a requirement?</strong></p> <p>A: I have not seen any evidence of that. The accusation is often mentioned, but I have not seen any evidence of people being barred from getting jobs. If you think of language as another skill, for some jobs you have to have a certain skill set to apply for those jobs. You would not apply for a job as a data entry clerk if you could not use computers.</p>",
  "<p>Muhammad Yunus has been in the glare of the media's spotlight <a href=\"http://www.friendsofgrameen.com/dl/2011/02/GrameenBankFactSheet-August20121.pdf\" title=\"\">for all the wrong reasons</a> over the last two years. The Bangladeshi government's none too subtle attempts to effect a de facto nationalisation of the Grameen Bank fare sadly all too well known. No one knows where it will all end and I fear we are looking at a bad outcome unless there is a change of heart by the Hasina regime.</p> <p>Yunus is no saint, has made mistakes and no doubt will make more. Arguments will continue to rage about the complex impacts of microcredit and the pros and cons of the for-profit and non-profit models. His hard line on the definition of a social business is not for everyone.</p> <p>But his achievement is immense. Eighty million people, about half the population of Bangladesh, are users of Grameen services. Whether urbanites downloading their apps on to their Grameen phones or the street beggars who can borrow interest free, Yunus's social business group reaches into all corners of his country. Now that, my social enterprise friends, is what you call mainstreaming.</p> <p>Bangladesh is a very different place to the UK, where I write this and all social entrepreneurs journeys are unique but there are some leadership lessons we can all take from Yunus as we continue to find ways of creating a socially enterprising world.</p> <h2><strong>Consistency and resilience</strong></h2> <p>The Grameen group is incredibly diverse. Microfinance, savings, insurances, eye hospitals, mobile phones, solar energy, high nutrition yoghurt. The list goes on and on. But two things have never changed. The rejection of charity as a solution to poverty and the drive to create financially viable enterprises, owned by the poor themselves, based on high-volume, low-margin products and services. In a land with no public sector grants to keep the salaries paid or super-rich hedge fund mangers dabbling in social innovation, there is little choice but to be inventive when it comes to business models, but Yunus's breaking of the NGO or private business paradigm is impressive.</p> <p>So, social enterprise leaders, keep the main thing the main thing and pay close attention to your business model.</p> <h2><strong>Courage</strong></h2> <p>It has passed into legend that Yunus was told he was mad to lend money to poor people with no contracts or collateral. I love his willingness to start, not waiting for the perfect answer before taking that first step. He is a congenital starter and this is what is needed in a country like Bangladesh where the needs of people are so acute.</p> <p>\"The future of the world will not invented on an Excel spreadsheet, Liam\", <a href=\"http://www.ideo.com/people/paul-bennett/\" title=\"\">Paul Bennet of IDEO said to me</a> when we sat with some of Grameen's village borrowers.</p> <p>Yunus embodies this \"let's jump in and experiment because actually no one knows what the solution looks like yet\" spirit. As Elvis Presley should have said: \"a little less conversation a little more action social enterprise people!\"</p> <h2><strong>Scale and opportunism</strong></h2> <p>Not for Yunus the interesting little boutique social experiment. His purpose is to \"put poverty in the museums\". He wants it big and he wants it now.</p> <p>Some of his businesses are brilliantly original ideas but others are copied from elsewhere. His superbly efficient and successful eye hospitals, for example, are copies of Aaravind's <a href=\"http://www.aravind.org/\" title=\"\">superb model in India</a>.</p> <p>Innovation is overrated. Sometimes someone else has the great idea and your job is to execute it brilliantly where you are. The poor of rural Bangladesh don't give a hoot that Yunus didn't invent the care model that has given them back their sight. They are just delighted that their cataracts are gone.</p> <p>Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn said recently: \"A first mover is not the first one to launch; it's the first one to scale.\" That is so true and Yunus is very much a first mover in that sense. Anyone can have a bright idea at his or her computer or social innovation boot camp. Inventing stuff is the easy part. There is no shortage of great ideas. Executing the buggers is the trick that is so hard to pull off. Developing channels to the people who need the service on a mass scale and normalising it \u2013 now that's the really difficult bit especially in so-called bottom-of-the-pyramid markets.</p> <h2><strong>Relentless networking and giving people time</strong></h2> <p>Over 30 years, Yunus has created a global ecosystem including heads of state, business leaders, entrepreneurs, opinion formers, grassroots innovators and citizen organisations. And thank God he has. In his hour on intense need, as a corrupt and corrupting government regime seeks to ruin him, his network has been galvanized to action. I have no doubt his enemies would have tried to put him in jail or worse without his allies and friends around the globe as well as at every strata of Bangladeshi society speaking out.</p> <p>Despite the praise and awards heaped on him Yunus has not become one of those leaders who checks out how important you are before deciding how much of his time you are worth. I have spent many hours with Yunus at all sorts of events and he gives wide-eyed students as much of his time and attention as he does to presidents and chief executives. Many's the late night when I've stood there knackered as he gives yet another 18-year-old career advice. He wont leave a venue \u2013 ignoring my frantic watch pointing and finger across the throat signals \u2014 before everyone has had their book signed and their photo taken with him. (Oh yes, I forgot that bit \u2013 he has somehow found time to write bestselling books.)</p> <p>Not for Yunus the VIP social entrepreneur \"sorry you're not on the guest list\" elitism of the kind that goes on at, say, the Skoll World Forum or World Economic Forum.</p> <h2><strong>Great storytelling</strong></h2> <p>Yunus has a great facility with words and is a compelling storyteller and phrasemaker. His ability to use simple language to cut through to the chase about poverty and the structures that oppress people is a mark of that leadership calibre which attracts people to join his mission of eradicating injustice. How prescient this zinger from the early days: \"the question is not \"Are people credit-worthy\", but rather, \"Are banks people-worthy?\" I use that all the time when I speak to bankers.</p> <p>Let us hope against hope that the government of Bangladesh does not extinguish the lights of Grameen. But Yunus's legacy is secure. He has inspired millions around the world to rally to the cause of the poor. <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/yunus-lecture-en.html\" title=\"\">His 2006 Nobel prize acceptance speech</a> is well worth a read: \"We get what we want, or what we don't refuse \u2026 we wanted to go to the moon.
