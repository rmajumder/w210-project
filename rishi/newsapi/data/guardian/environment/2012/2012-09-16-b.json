  "<p>Sometimes, the future arrives with alarming speed. In the 1990s, and again in 2000, climate scientists warned that \u2013 unless urgent action was taken \u2013 the Arctic Ocean could be clear blue water in summer by 2050. This August researchers making a <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/climate-environment/rate-arctic-summer-sea-ice-loss-news-514271\" title=\"\">first analysis</a> of data from the European Space Agency's observation satellite CryoSat-2 were startled to find that the loss of sea ice \u2013 as measured both by depth, and by area \u2013 was far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">more dramatic</a> than <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/ice-loss-shifts-arctic-cycles-1.11387\" title=\"\">their own forecasts had predicted</a>. The summer Arctic could be an open sea within a decade.</p> <p>It is the ice cap that keeps the Arctic cold. Sunlight that hits white ice bounces back into space. Dark ocean absorbs light, and therefore warmth, making the next winter's ice pack thinner, and less enduring. The difference between the torrid tropics and the icy Arctic governs weather patterns in the northern hemisphere. The frozen ocean and permafrost at the perimeter prevents ground methane from escaping into the atmosphere and thereby accelerating global warming. The polar seas drive the marine ecosystem and fuel the north Atlantic fish stocks. So the consequences of ice loss could be considerable, although nobody with political authority seems so far to have sufficiently considered them.</p> <p>Bad news from the far north has just been matched by a bleak warning from the tropics. German, US and Australian scientists report in Nature Climate Change on Mondaythat the double menace of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and rising ocean acidity could spell the end for most of the world's coral reefs. These extraordinary and beautiful structures flourish at the limits of their tolerance. They like it hot, but not too hot. They tend to \"bleach\" and even die as temperatures rise: during 1998, 16% of all living corals perished in one exceptional tropic summer. Coral reefs deliver coastal protection, tourism and fishing for millions: the reefs are home, habitat and hunting territory for about a quarter of all marine species. The researchers used 19 different climate models to predict the effects of a 2C increase in global average temperatures, and found that by 2030 around 70% of the reefs would suffer what they politely call \"long-term degradation\".</p> <p>In fact, pessimists in the climate change community warn that within the next century global mean temperatures could rise by 6C. A <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/03aug_summer2012/\" title=\"\">fierce, sustained drought in the US</a>, with 170 all-time US heat records broken in June alone, has already hurt world food stocks. The global response to these signals of potential calamity has so far been feeble. Meanwhile Britain's \"greenest government ever\" has shown what it thinks of scientific evidence, by placing a homeopathic medicine enthusiast in charge of the National Health Service, and a reputed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/08/open-letter-environment-secretary\" title=\"\">climate sceptic as environment secretary</a>. The outlook is not promising.</p>",
  "<p>\"Next year's list could look very different indeed,\" predicted last year's Media Guardian 100. How right we were.</p> <p>As the digital era has progressed, the media industry has grown accustomed to casting aside old certainties. We don't read things, watch things, or listen to things in the way we used to. And we'd rather not pay for them either.</p> <p>However, the biggest force for change in the media landscape of late has not been a twentysomething wunderkind in a garage in California but a 63-year-old judge presiding over an unprecedented examination of the ethics and practices of the press.</p> <p>Lord Justice Leveson is the unexpected axis around which much of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediaguardian-100-2012\">2012's MediaGuardian 100</a> turns, with an influence that extends far beyond the printed press, into politics, broadcasting and the internet.</p> <p>Leveson's exhaustive \u2013 and in all probability exhausting \u2013 report will be published in November. The court cases resulting from the police investigations into phone hacking and related matters will be ongoing for some time after that. Several years, in fact.</p> <p>It feels appropriate, then, that Leveson, at No 10 in this year's list, should be one place ahead of Rupert Murdoch, with whom he shared some memorable exchanges at the royal courts of justice.</p> <p>Murdoch has topped this list three times in the past and has never before been outside the top 10. But the embattled 81-year-old media baron is not the force he was \u2013 certainly not in the UK, with a split of his broadcasting and publishing interests very much on the cards.</p> <p>James Murdoch's resignation as chairman of BSkyB meant that for the first time since 1999 there was no member of his family in one of the top jobs at the satellite broadcaster.</p> <p>Now all but entirely absent from the UK, he clings on at No 100, a reflection of the shadow he casts over this country's media \u2013 all the way from his office in New York.</p> <p>It is not all bad news for the media dynasty. Elisabeth Murdoch, untainted by the phone-hacking scandal, unlike her father and brother, is on the rise, fresh from delivering the MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh last month. Could she yet become the heir apparent?</p> <p>Google's chief executive, Larry Page, takes the top spot after a year in which the media world's biggest beast has accelerated its evolution from search portal into a content and hardware company.</p> <p>Page knocks Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, from the summit after the social networking company's disastrous stock market debut. Facebook is represented on this year's list by Joanna Shields, its vice-president and managing director in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, reflecting the panel's efforts to include more British-based figures with media clout. She is also this year's highest-ranked woman.</p> <p>There was no shortage of debate among our panellists about which was the pre-eminent social media phenomenon. Top of the politicians' call list? Google. Best for starting a riot? Facebook. First place I go after getting off a plane? Twitter (or smoking area).</p> <p>Twitter, this year represented by its chief executive, Dick Costolo, is in second place, followed by Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, and the corporation's new director general, George Entwistle.</p> <p>Entwistle, by coincidence, starts his new job today; his performance over the next 12 months will determine whether he leapfrogs his all-powerful chairman in the 2013 rankings.</p> <p>Others making the top 10 include the newly knighted Sir Jonathan Ive \u2013 chosen ahead of Tim Cook, who took over as Apple's chief executive following the untimely death of Steve Jobs last year. The Daily Mail's editor in chief, Paul Dacre, is the highest-ranked newspaper editor at No seven, ahead of WPP's boss, Sir Martin Sorrell, at eight and Simon Cowell, who remains in ninth spot.</p> <p>Now in its 12th year, the MediaGuardian 100 is a snapshot of media power today. Candidates are judged on three criteria \u2013 cultural, economic and political influence in the UK (although they do not have to be based in the UK to qualify).</p> <p>As we have made a habit of pointing out, it is intended to be a starting point for debate rather than the end of it. No list is definitive, nor can it hope to be.</p> <p>New entries this year include Maria Miller, the surprise new appointment as culture secretary; Simon Fuller (strictly speaking, a re-entry), the svengali to the stars who is some way behind his music and talent show rival, Simon Cowell; BBC Radio 1's controller, Ben Cooper; and Clare Balding, the star of the BBC's Olympics coverage and Channel 4's Paralympics coverage, and the most sought-after television presenter of the moment.</p> <p>There were big rises for two other BBC stars \u2013 Private Eye's editor (and Have I Got News for You panellist), Ian Hislop and Top Gear's presenter Jeremy Clarkson \u2013 as well as the Times columnist Caitlin Moran, a serial winner of journalism and book awards.</p> <p>Other new entries include Ian Livingston, the BT chief executive who is taking the pay-TV battle to Sky, and Michael Acton Smith, the man behind the global craze that is Moshi Monsters (try asking someone younger than you).</p> <p>High-profile casualties include Mark Thompson and Jeremy Hunt \u2013 one swapped the BBC for the New York Times, the other culture for health \u2013 and Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who will continue to make headlines but not for the reason he was included last year.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Job: </strong>chief executive, Twitter</p> <p><strong>Age: </strong>48</p> <p><strong>Industry:</strong> digital media</p> <p><strong>New entry</strong></p> <p>Dick Costolo was previously Twitter's chief operating officer, and took over from Evan Williams when the latter was on paternity leave in what was expected to be a brief sojourn; it hasn't turned out that way. The ex-Googler has shown a growing focus on making the social networking service, which now has more than 500 million active users worldwide every month, into something properly profitable. To that end he has experimented with ideas such as \"promoted tweets\", \"promoted trends\" and \"earlybird specials\", all aiming to make Twitter more of a vehicle for commercial content than it has been in the past.</p> <p>The latest scheme, announced at the end of August, is to slash prices on ads inserted into Twitter feeds (\"promoted tweets\") from 30p to 1p and let advertisers target users directly based on its reading of their interests, based on who they follow. Advertisers will be able to send tweets to appear in people's \"timelines\" (of tweets from those they follow) \u2013 so a football fan might see a link or tweet about sports clothing.</p> <p>Costolo's measures have annoyed third-party developers in particular, who have seen the company become more and more protective of its gigantic database of 140-character insights, which grows by another 340m every day. They have complained about restrictions on use that Costolo is implementing, putting a ceiling on the number of users that third-party apps which simply display tweets can have without getting special permission. Twitter has been using a mixture of carrot and stick to push third-party developers away from essentially copying Twitter's own apps; the developers are resisting hard.</p> <p>But Costolo, driving Twitter in search of more revenue, is unafraid to break some eggs to make a profitable omelette. For 2011 it generated $139.5m in revenues; the aim is to increase that to as much as $300m this year. Whether that will make it profitable is unknown, but with about $1bn of venture capital already sunk into the six-year-old company, it's becoming urgent.</p> <p>Twitter's position as a conduit for content, rather than a creator (as Google is becoming) means that it is favourably viewed by the media industries. News organisations note its power for breaking stories; others, its ability to build (and sometimes tear down) brands. It blocks links to pirate sites (often invisibly), while its role as an injunction-breaker has delighted more than a few newspapers and dissidents. But Costolo doesn't highlight any of those roles; the company's mission statement is \"to instantly connect people everywhere to what's most important to them\". (Google's, by contrast, is \"to organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\".)</p> <p>Unlike Google, Twitter didn't take part in any demonstrations over the US Stop Online Piracy Act in January; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/16/wikipedia-sopa-blackout-slammed-twitter\" title=\"\">Costolo said</a> that Wikipedia's blackout on the day was \"just silly. Closing a global business in reaction to single-issue national politics is foolish.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Job:</strong> vice-president and managing director of Facebook (Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa)<br><strong>Age:</strong> 50<br><strong>Industry:</strong> digital media<br><strong>New entry</strong></p> <p>Facebook will count 2012 as a year to forget after a botched flotation saw the social network's market value plummet. But away from Wall Street, Joanna Shields has led Facebook on its way to becoming a key marketing platform for Europe's top businesses.</p> <p>Shields makes her return to the MediaGuardian 100 two years after joining Facebook as its vice-president and managing director in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Previously a senior executive at Google, Bebo and AOL, Shields is seen as a safe pair of hands for Facebook in its biggest and fastest-growing market outside the US.</p> <p>She was recruited by Facebook chief operating officer (and former Google colleague) Sheryl Sandberg in 2010 and quickly reorganised its European base to focus on long-term partnerships with several high-profile businesses and startups.</p> <p>Facebook has since launched products with music services including Spotify and Deezer, and news outlets such as the Guardian and BBC, as it aims to turn the social network into a primary entertainment destination on the web. Deals with Burberry, Unilever and Nestl\u00e9 are part of the site's money-spinning efforts.</p> <p>Shields also oversaw Facebook's Explore London 2012 page on the Olympics, where users could interact daily with their favourite athletes and teams.</p> <p>Colleagues of Shields describe her as a \"fast-moving deal machine\" who has forged a reputation as a tough negotiator. But she is an unlikely leader in the global media scene, hailing from a small blue-collar town in the US where she worked as a child in her father's metal factory.</p> <p>At Facebook, she has seen the number of daily active users in Europe and Asia rise to 283m in June, up from 130m in June 2010. The money made from each active user has also risen, from $0.90 per European user in June 2010 to $1.43 in June 2012. Facebook's revenue for Europe and Asia hit $409m this year, 41% of its total of $992m and up from $159m in June 2010.</p> <p>Now Shields has her sights set on the Middle East and Africa, where half of the continent's 1 billion people have a mobile phone, according to recent estimates. The region is likely to be central to Facebook's plans to make more money from mobile access to its website beyond 2012.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Job:</strong> group chief executive, WPP<br><strong>Age:</strong> 67<br><strong>Industry:</strong> advertising, marketing<br><strong>2011 ranking:</strong> 8</p> <p>WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell admitted that he had \"misjudged the mood of shareholders\" after nearly 60% voted to reject his \u00a36.8m annual pay packet \u2013 topped up with a \u00a35.6m share windfall. It was the largest rebellion at a blue chip company since 90% voted against Sir Fred Goodwin's pension arrangements at Royal Bank of Scotland in 2009.</p> <p>Sorrell still reckons he's worth it, and over the past year WPP cemented its place as the world's biggest marketing services group with its best ever annual results, achieving \u00a31bn profits and \u00a310bn revenues for the first time. WPP is also switching its corporate HQ back to London from Dublin, after changes to UK tax law.</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne can look forward to welcoming WPP back following a shareholder vote in December that will ratify the move.</p> <p>Sorrell shifted WPP's tax domicile to Ireland in 2008 in protest at the prospect of \"double taxation\" of overseas profits \u2013 once abroad and again in the UK \u2013 but new legislation has prompted a return.</p> <p>Never one to rest on his laurels, in June he stunned the advertising industry by buying a majority stake in AKQA, one of the world's most well-known digital agencies and one of the last independent global players, in a deal with an enterprise value of \u00a3348m.</p> <p>Despite a hectic schedule plotting global advertising domination, Sorrell found time to slot in a quick session carrying the Olympic torch through the London borough of Redbridge.</p> <p>The 67-year-old showed a clean pair of heels in a fetching white tracksuit, and with no signs of him slowing down don't mention the words \"succession management\" just yet.</p>",
  "<p>Last week Arctic sea ice contracted to its smallest extent, before sub-zero temperatures arrived and the ice-sheet began to grow again. According to Norwegian scientists it set a new record, measuring 3 million sq km, 0.6 million sq km less than the previous record (set in 2007).</p> <p>This breakup is exciting for those hoping to sail the Northwest Passage but bad news for others, including polar bears.</p> <p>Closer to home, does Arctic sea ice have any bearing on our weather? Pinning down exact causes for individual weather events is not possible, but a warming Arctic may explain some of our weather trends.</p> <p>The jet stream \u2013 the high level winds that bring much of the UK's weather \u2013 is influenced by the temperature gradient between the equator and north pole. A warmer Arctic reduces the temperature contrast, which weakens the jet stream and makes it more likely to meander.</p> <p>Larger meanders increase the chances of big wet storms being spun up, and spat out north of the meander, as we've seen in the UK this summer. Meanwhile, lying south of a giant meander brings hot dry weather, as much of the US experienced this year.</p> <p>Scientists don't yet know why, but a meandering jet stream appears more likely to get jammed in position, bringing weeks and weeks of the same kind of weather. And whether it is constant sunshine or deluges of rain, being stuck under a jammed jet stream is no fun.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago today, a few hundred people went to Wall Street, gathering in the financial district in Lower Manhattan with the intention of staying there until the US noticed. I was lucky to be in Zuccotti Park that first day, with the much more courageous and steadfast Occupiers, who slept out, and planned often truly profound visions for social change.</p> <p>I was just there as a citizen, a baffled ordinary person. I thought that what President Bush had done, what Obama had done, to deal with the financial crisis since 2007-2008 \u2013 the Dodd-Frank regulations, the Financial Inquiry Commission, civil actions and settlements \u2013 had ended as a wink-wink, nod-nod to global financial behemoths. I felt disbelief in seeing that, in the press at least, matters were closed. So I stood outside, and looked for what I could do. But like many others of the rank and file, the non-visionaries, I went home at night. I slept in a warm bed. I worried what America and the world would make of us.</p> <p>Then a kind of miracle occurred. Occupy camps sprang up in every major US city, plus little demonstrations and pickets in every tiny town. Polls showed widespread support, and the press and TV were unexpectedly interested and kind at first, considering how easy we were to make fun of.</p> <p>Once you talked to newcomers at marches and rallies, however, it seemed less surprising. Ordinary Americans were truly strangled by debt \u2013 suffering in immediate ways that rarely made the news \u2013 while we knew that bankrupt institutions had been propped up, with money from our taxes, only to go on foreclosing on soured mortgages and compounding our credit card service fees. Even the business reporters who visited Occupy knew the system was rickety and wildly unfair. The only people who didn't experience it personally, alas, were the wealthy, who controlled national political decisions.</p> <p>Here is a letter from a small town resident in Illinois to a Wall Street executive: \"Our neighbours, with teenagers our children grew up with, are about to be evicted from their house. Their car was repossessed. Their father works in construction, and there hasn't been much of that going on since the real-estate market crashed, which you may remember. Whose fault was that \u2013 his? \u2026 People in your world are doing great (from what we hear, 'great' doesn't begin to describe it), while the rest of us are going down. It is a disaster and cannot continue.\"</p> <p>Within six weeks of the start, many of us began to get nervous that the economic points were getting lost. The direct and obvious message in the protests was increasingly submerged beneath two distractions. One was the endless police violence against the protesters, and the other an obsession with how so many people could live so close together without showers and toilets.</p> <p>You could feel the change occurring: the press started to think the camps were gross. And you could tell that the police were distancing themselves from us, deciding that we were \"them\", not citizens. When, on 26 October 2011, Oakland <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/26/scott-olsen-occupy-oakland-review\" title=\"\">police shot a protester, Scott Olsen</a>, in the head with a tear-gas canister or some other unconventional round, I despaired. Olsen had survived two tours as a marine in Iraq, only to have his skull shattered for exercising freedom of assembly at home. That's it, I thought, that's how non-violent protest ends. You can always pre-empt protest in democracies with sufficient brutality, carefully and stealthily applied, under the guise of crowd control or health and sanitation.</p> <p>That night, in the endless click-trance that bad news induces on the internet, I was passing through sites from different cities' occupations when I landed on an effort called Occupy the Boardroom. This website asked for letters from people who could never go to an Occupy encampment. It collected detailed, forceful messages composed by ordinary citizens directly to named executives of the big six US banks. Its promise was to deliver them, by email, while posting them to \"the mailbag\" so we could all read one another's words.</p> <p>\"The housing crash of 2008 was not an unfortunate accident, rather the fallout from careless gambling and calculated, short-term greed ... I don't expect you to do anything about it. I'd rather you just got out of the way so the rest of the country can start rebuilding. Take your business to Greece or Ireland. Oh wait, you already bankrupted them. I guess the US was just the next target.\"</p> <p>\"Just wanted to give you a pat on the back for collecting over $4,000 from a friend of mine on a Chase credit card with a $500 limit (on which she charged a little bit less than $500 worth of merchandise). It was a great example of innovation in your industry!\"</p> <p>The authors might be struggling to make a living, working at two jobs to save their home, or taking care of an ill or elderly relative. But they supported the protests, and intelligently explained like no source I had ever seen what Americans have experienced at the hands of our banks, and the reasons to speak out.</p> <p>For the 10 months since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/nov/15/occupy-wall-street-zuccotti-eviction-live\" title=\"\">eviction of Zuccotti Park</a>, these letters have given me direction through all the vicissitudes of Occupy. I met the website organisers and asked to use the only skills I have, as a writer and editor, to gather the best ones into a book. A group of volunteers and co-editors read all 8,000 letters. We selected 150. We contacted every author we could find for permission, and have published the letters as <a href=\"http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/the-trouble-is-the-banks-letters-from-ordinary-americans-to-wall-street\" title=\"\">The Trouble is the Banks: Letters to Wall Street</a>. I'm hoping to mail the book to Mitt Romney \u2013 and the president too, of course.</p> <p>People ask me if Occupy will continue, or succeed in anything, if it will change anyone's mind in power. I really have no idea what to answer. For my part, these letters, bound in print, mean that no one can any longer say that they didn't learn what had gone wrong in America, what Occupy arose from, or whether the citizenry supported it; or that they didn't know what solutions citizens clearly wanted, or the profound reasons for our discontent.</p>",

  "<p>Nasa's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2012/sep/14/astronomy-space\" title=\"\">Curiosity</a>, the rover now on Mars, may find evidence for creatures that lived early in Martian history; firm evidence for even the most primitive bugs would have huge import. There could be life in the ice-covered oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa. But what really fuels popular imagination is the prospect of advanced life \u2013 the \"aliens\" familiar from science fiction \u2013 and nobody expects a complex biosphere in those locations.</p> <p>Suppose, however, we widen our gaze beyond our solar system. Astronomers have learnt that other stars have planets circling round them. Nasa's Kepler spacecraft monitors about 150,000 stars, measuring their brightness sensitively enough to detect the very slight dimming (about one part in 10,000) that occurs when an Earth-like planet transits a sun-like star. The data already reveals thousands of planets. But we'd really like to see these planets directly \u2013 not just their shadows \u2013 and that's hard. To realise just how hard, suppose an alien astronomer with a powerful telescope was viewing Earth from, say, 50 light years away. Our planet would seem, in Carl Sagan's phrase, a \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g\" title=\"\">pale blue dot</a>\", very close to a star (our sun) that outshines it many billion times \u2013 a firefly next to a searchlight. But if the hypothetical aliens could detect Earth, they could learn quite a bit about it. The shade of blue would be slightly different depending on whether the Pacific Ocean or the Eurasian land mass was facing them. They could infer the length of the day, the seasons, the gross topography and the climate.</p> <p>In the 2020s, European astronomers hope to complete, in Chile, a telescope with a mosaic mirror 39 metres across. It will be powerful enough to analyse the faint light from planets orbiting other stars with enough precision to infer whether they harbour life.</p> <p>We know too little about how life began on Earth to lay confident odds. It may have involved a fluke so rare that it happened only once in the entire galaxy. On the other hand, it may have been almost inevitable, given the right environment. In the next two decades we can expect progress in understanding the biochemistry of life's origins: this is one of the great unsolved problems \u2013 fascinating to the most Earth-focused biologist, but also crucial in guiding astronomers on how and where to search for alien life.</p> <p>Even if simple life is common, it is, of course, a separate question whether it's likely to evolve into anything intelligent or complex. Indeed, evolutionists don't agree on how divergently our own biosphere could have developed if such contingencies as ice ages and meteorite impacts had happened differently. If, for instance, the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out, the chain of mammalian evolution that led to humans might have been foreclosed and it's not clear whether another species would have taken our role.</p> <p>Maybe the search for life shouldn't restrict attention to planets like Earth. Science fiction writers have other ideas: balloon-like creatures floating in the dense atmospheres of planets such as Jupiter, swarms of intelligent insects, nano-scale robots and more. (And it's often better to read first-rate science fiction than second-rate science \u2013 it's far more stimulating, and perhaps no more likely to be wrong.) The most durable form of \"life\" may be machines whose creators have long ago been usurped or become extinct.</p> <p>The great physicist <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/fermi-bio.html\" title=\"\">Enrico Fermi</a> famously argued that advanced life must be rare. Many stars are a billion years older than our sun. Life, were it common, would have had a head start around these more ancient stars. Why then, Fermi argued, haven't aliens already come here? Why aren't their artefacts staring us in the face? There is substance to this argument. However, we mustn't be too anthropomorphic: some advanced life could be unimaginably different from that on Earth. Others could be living contemplative lives, perhaps deep under some planetary ocean, doing nothing to reveal their presence.</p> <p>We may learn in the coming decades whether biological evolution is unique to the pale blue dot in the cosmos that is our home, or whether Darwin's writ runs through a wider universe that teems with life \u2013 even with intelligence.</p>",
  "<p>The government is poised to give the go-ahead to the first full-scale cull of badgers in England, under a policy that could soon mean as many as 100,000 of the animals \u2013 a third of the national population \u2013 are shot dead by farmers in an attempt to protect cattle from bovine tuberculosis.</p> <p>According to Whitehall sources, the first of two licences is expected to be issued as soon as Monday for a large pilot cull area in Gloucestershire, which is a hotspot for bovine TB.</p> <p>Previously, there have been localised trials to test the science behind such culls. Yet despite the mixed results of the tests, ministers have decided to push ahead with the national scheme after winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/12/activists-disrupt-bager-cull\" title=\"\">an appeal-court battle brought by campaigners</a> last week.</p> <p>In 2011, 26,000 cows were slaughtered because of the disease, which can also be carried by badgers.</p> <p>A decade-long scientific trial of badger culling concluded that such killing could make<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\"> \"no meaningful contribution\", and was \"not an effective way\" to control the disease</a>. But the government is going forward with the plan under intense pressure from British farmers.</p> <p>A Defra spokesman said: \"We will continue to work with the farming industry so badger control in two pilot areas can start as soon as is practical.\"</p> <p>As yet, no badgers have been killed as part of the cull, but with only straightforward administrative steps required after the granting of the licence, culling could begin within days.</p> <p>Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is a fervent supporter of the cull, having tabled a record 600 parliamentary questions on the issue while serving as environment spokesman in opposition.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/business/business-news/no-more-%E2%80%98clueless-urbanites%E2%80%99-in-defra-just-a-focus-on-reviving-rural-economy/49669.article\" title=\"\">interview with the Farmers Guardian</a> on Friday, Patterson appeared to cast the proposed cull as being of benefit to badgers: \"I find the attitude of those who want these wonderful animals to die of this disgusting disease [bovine TB] completely incomprehensible.\"</p> <p>But Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, said: \"The cull will cost more than it saves, put a huge strain on the police, and will spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers are disturbed by the shooting. Ministers should listen to the scientists and can this cull \u2013 which is bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.\"</p> <p>A source in Paterson's department said the controversial policy was causing great anxiety: \"The panic among senior officials outweighs anything since foot and mouth. It makes The Thick of It look tame and gentle.\"</p> <p>The government has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/25/badger-cull-high-court-challenge\" title=\"\">refused to release numerous documents under freedom of information rules</a>, including advice from the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, and communication with the National Farmers Union. The latter was blocked on the grounds that it was \"internal communication\".</p> <p>Natural England, the licensing body, said: \"We are working flat out with licence applicants on processing their applications. We will issue licences to enable control activity to commence in the pilot areas as soon as is possible.\"</p> <p>The licence will be issued to a group of farmers and landowners who will commit to killing at least 70% of the badgers on their land for at least four years in a row.</p> <p>The government's own impact assessment concluded that it would cost farmers more to carry out the cull than to do nothing and suffer any losses from bovine TB.</p> <p>The licence area must also have \"hard boundaries\", such as rivers, to prevent badgers fleeing and potentially spreading the disease and making the situation worse.</p> <p>The government pointed to the 16% cut in bovine TB found at the end of the 10-year trial but the new culls will use a different killing method. Instead of trapping then shooting \u2013 considered expensive \u2013 the badgers will be \"free shot\" by marksmen. The deaths have to occur before 1 February, when the close season for badger shooting begins and runs till 31 May.</p> <p>But the start of the cull could be halted by a legal challenge to the licence. The Badger Trust, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/11/badger-cull-legal-challenge-fails\" title=\"\">unsuccessfully challenged the government's cull policy</a> in the appeal court last week, stated: \"We will continue to pursue all legal means to stop culling. We will closely study any licences issued by Natural England.\" The trust was successful in a previous legal action against badger culling in Wales. Campaigners are also pursuing a complaint against the government in Europe under the Bern convention, which governs wildlife and habitat protection.</p> <p>A licence for a cull in Somerset is thought to be taking longer to process due to a legal issue involving the crown estate, but sources said they did not expect that to prevent the licence being granted in due course.</p> <p>Animal rights campaigners are determined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/12/activists-disrupt-bager-cull\" title=\"\">to halt the trials</a> through protests at the cull sites, whose location is not being made public. Volunteers plan to patrol the zones and stop the badgers coming into the open.</p> <p>The Gloucestershire and Somerset culls are trials meant to test whether free shooting is as effective as trapping and shooting.</p> <p>Critics say the short time of the trials will be insufficient for comparison with the decade-long trial, but if the government calls the trials a success, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/19/badger-cull-bovine-tb-spelman\" title=\"\">killing will happen across affected areas in England</a> and is expected to end the lives of 70,000 to 105,000 badgers \u2013 from an entire UK population estimated at 300,000.</p> <p>A badger vaccination plan is replacing the Welsh cull. Vaccination is also being tested in Devon by the National Trust, and by the Wildlife Trust in Gloucestershire.</p> <p>The last Labour government said an oral badger vaccine would be ready by 2015. The coalition cancelled five of six trials of injectable vaccines, and said a viable oral vaccine was \"years away\".</p>",

  "<p>In one area the Lib Dems show the way. They are ruthless about getting rid of their leaders. The Tories never got over ousting Mrs T. Labour knifed Tony Blair but not until he'd gone past his sell-by date. Then they fretted over the hapless Gordon Brown, with nobody prepared to play Brutus.</p> <p>But the supposedly cuddly party of the centre enjoys its coups. Charlie Kennedy was done for; then Ming Campbell was quickly shown the door. With his party floundering in the polls and with his personal ratings dire, will Nick Clegg suffer a similar fate?</p> <p>The dwindling band of Lib Dem members will gather for their conference in Brighton next weekend in a twitchy frame of mind. Opposition life was easy. They would fight on certain issues \u2013 civil liberties, the environment, Iraq \u2013 exploiting the hearings they were granted by a media traditionally disdainful of the third party.</p> <p>But, if the polls are to be believed, they have achieved precious little in government: no recognition of the \"pupil premium\" for schools or of work on climate change. The <a href=\"http:/ /www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/13/lib-dems-no-difference-political-reform? newsfeed=\" true\"\" title=\"\">only policy that appears to have registered with the public</a> has been taking low earners out of paying tax.</p> <p>There are two reasons for this: one is in Clegg's hands, the other is not. The first is the nature of compromise in a coalition. Much of the party's work in government \u2013 mainly through the quartet (David Cameron, George Osborne, Clegg, Danny Alexander) that runs the show \u2013 is based around negative compromise. It is about trimming the worst excesses of the Tories, with Cameron agreeing to go slow or drop a certain clause from a bill, as long as he gets the rest through. This is important, but thankless work, but making the Tories less nasty is not a compelling slogan for the 2015 election. It has been far harder for the Lib Dems to achieve positive compromise, in which they are able to push something through which bears their imprint.</p> <p>Clegg's problem is this: how can you do business with another team, while making clear that you do not share most&#xa0;of their values or aspirations? This&#xa0;lies at the heart of coalition politics,&#xa0;which continental Europeans have had far more experience of dealing with.&#xa0;What has been found to work is when, publicly but politely, one leader says: \"We advocated A, they advocated B, but we agreed to settle on C.\" All surveys in Europe suggest that the public respects an open airing and settling of differences. Yet the Lib Dem leader consistently dismisses this notion. Instead he has fluctuated from the mistaken love-in on the lawn and the kamikaze mission over tuition fees, to visceral anger over Cameron's undermining of the AV campaign and House of Lords reform.</p> <p>This month's reshuffle presents Clegg with an unlikely opportunity. He can now have no doubt about Cameron's intentions. The Conservative rump of the cabinet is as red meat as it could be \u2013 authoritarian and sceptical about climate change. Some of Clegg's team were taken aback by the changes. They shouldn't have been.</p> <p>With the coalition entering the second half of its projected five-year lifespan, the Lib Dem leader needs each and every day to tell the public what his party is seeking to do, what it will put up with, and what it won't. This can be done without petulance \u2013 at least on the Lib Dem side. If Tory backbenchers, in denial over their failure to win in 2010, wish to force an early election or go into minority administration, let them.</p> <p>There was nothing ignoble about entering into coalition with the Conservatives, just as it would be entirely desirable for a similar alliance with Labour \u2013 still the preferred option for most Lib Dems. But that will have to wait. Until 2015 the Lib Dems should keep lines of communication open with both sides. Ming Campbell is an important elder statesman for the party and sees virtues in co-operation with other parties \u2013 but not absorption. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/14/vince-cable-criticised-text-messages?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">he pointed out to Vince Cable</a>, there is nothing to be gained by ingratiation.</p> <p>Much of the attention in Brighton will revolve around Cable's supposed manoeuvres. He has outright support from a small circle; and Tim Farron, the party president, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545261/Lib-Dem-president-Labour-Why-not-Labour-We-can-work-with-either-party.html\" title=\"\">used a newspaper interview</a> to suggest that he, too, was in the market. But so far there is no sign among senior figures of a rebellion against Clegg (Tory conspirators and Boris groupies are hovering far more darkly over Cameron). For all the Lib Dems' unpopularity in the polls there have been remarkably few signs of indiscipline within the party.</p> <p>But the baubles of office should not dull the senses. With such things as a wealth tax and moves towards social mobility, Clegg has adopted a Blairite tendency of picking up an idea, giving it an outing, but then failing to pursue it. He needs to be able to show by 2015 that he has delivered a distinctive record of achievements, alongside the beginnings of an economic recovery. The new big idea for conference is affordable housing. That needs to be driven through, as part of a coherent set of policies to give substance to the economic re-balancing Clegg has spoken of in the past.</p> <p>This year's conference, and the ensuing 12 months, will define Clegg's leadership and longevity. He has kept the coalition going, through gritted teeth, unwittingly allowing himself to be portrayed as sympathetic to the Conservatives. Cameron has declared his hand. Clegg must, publicly and robustly, do so too. That is what coalition politics \u2013 and political survival \u2013 are all about.</p>",

  "<p>Fears have deepened in Dublin that up to 100 jobs could be lost at the Irish Daily Star, with unions predicting the media owner Richard Desmond would stand by his threat to \"close down\" the joint venture over the Duchess of Cambridge pictures scandal.</p> <p>The head of the National Union of Journalists in Ireland who spoke with Irish Daily Star staff on Sunday told the Guardian there was \"fear, panic and anger\" in its Dublin newsroom. Seamus Dooley, the general secretary of the Irish NUJ, claimed Desmond could use the furore created by the Irish edition's decision to run the topless photographs as an attempt to \"ingratiate himself with the British establishment in the post-Leveson environment.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/15/desmond-irish-daily-star-kate-photos?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">On Saturday night</a>, Desmond said he was \"very angry at the decision to publish these photographs and [was] taking immediate steps to close down the joint venture\". His company Northern &amp; Shell jointly owns the Irish tabloid with the remaining 50% owned by Independent News &amp; Media, which controls the Irish Independent, Sunday Independent, Evening Herald, Belfast Telegraph and Sunday Life, and said it would try to protect jobs. Dooley said he believed the owner of Express newspapers and the Star in the UK was \"not just taking a knee-jerk reaction\" to the images in the Saturday edition.</p> <p>Thirteen photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge were reprinted as well as a front page reproduction of the French magazine Closer. \"From what I am hearing this threat to close down the Irish operation is real,\" Dooley said on Sunday.</p> <p>\"There is grave concern among the Irish staff of The Star about the future. There is panic, fear, anger throughout the staff. From what we can gather Desmond is serious about pulling out of the Irish operation. He might see this as a chance to paint himself in a good light with the establishment in Britain especially in the context of the Leveson inquiry.\" Freelance writers and photographers, plus the Irish Daily Star's 70 strong staff, meant some 100 jobs were at risk.</p> <p>Journalists on the Irish Daily Star echoed Dooley's fears that Richard Desmond will withdraw his 50% stake in the paper's Irish edition. The remaining 50% is owned Independent News &amp; Media. Dooley welcomed remarks by INM chief executive Joe Webb, who said the company would be doing \"everything in our power\" to save the jobs at the newspaper.</p> <p>The NUJ in Ireland believed this was \"the one glimmer of hope\" that could save a third Irish-based newspaper from closure in the last three years. Dooley said that the News of the World's Irish operation along with the broadsheet Sunday Tribune had been closed down over the last few years with the loss of dozens of jobs. When Rupert Murdoch liquidated the News of the World the Irish Daily Star ran a front page with the headline: \"Good Riddance.\"</p> <p>Webb said INM would launching its own investigation into the decision to reprint the photographs. Publication had been \"the wrong decision.\"</p> <p>Referring to last year's successful visit by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to the Republic, Webb said: \"That visit was an important culmination of the work of the Peace Process. Since then Ireland has regarded the Queen and her family in the warmest light. Kate Middleton is a member of her family \u2014 and on behalf of INM, I wish to offer her my deepest apologies.'' A spokesman for Richard Desmond and Northern &amp; Shell declined to comment.</p> <p>St James's palace said on Sunday night that lawyers for the duke and duchess are to make a criminal complaint against the photographer to the French prosecutor on Monday. The couple want the photographer or photographers to be charged with invading their privacy.</p> <p>A palace spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that a criminal complaint is to be made to the French Prosecution Department tomorrow.</p> <p>\"The complaint concerns the taking of photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge whilst on holiday and the publication of those photographs in breach of their privacy.\"</p> <p>Once the complaint is made, it is up to the prosecutors to decide whether to investigate and pursue it.</p> <p>The former British prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/16/kate-topless-pictures-peeping-toms\" title=\"\">Sir John Major </a> said he hoped that the \"peeping toms\" behind the pictures would be prosecuted. Major, who was appointed as a guardian to the duke and his younger brother when Diana, Princess of Wales, died in 1997, said a boundary had been crossed. He told the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080bbs\" title=\"\">Andrew Marr show on BBC1</a> that it was \"absolutely right\" of Clarence House to take the publishers of the French edition of Closer magazine to court.</p> <p>\"The boundaries have plainly been crossed. I don't think we need to mince words about these photographs. The way they have been obtained is tasteless.</p> <p>\"It is the action of a peeping tom. In our country we prosecute peeping toms. That is exactly what they have done and they have been peeping with long lenses from a long way away. They are very distasteful.</p> <p>\"I have often in the past been critical of the British media. I thoroughly applaud the fact that they will not touch these pictures with a barge pole. They deserve credit for not doing so. It is a pity that other people overseas have lower standards,\" the ex prime minister said.</p> <p>Grant Shapps, the Conservative party co-chairman, said of the British press: \"So far we have seen some restraint.

  "<p>Six weeks after Mark Cavendish's bitter disappointment on the roads of Surrey in the Olympic road race, his return to the green hills south-west of London in the Tour of Britain was a happy one.</p> <p>The Manxman ended his 12 months in the rainbow jersey of world road race champion in the grand style yesterday, taking his 15th victory of 2012 in Guildford's cobbled high street. The overall title in the British Tour went to the Devonian climber Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, the first home winner of the relaunched event since its inception in 2004, but Cavendish had started the stage determined to honour the rainbow jersey to the very last pedal stroke, and he lived up to his word on an uphill finish that was not ideal for his sprint talents, on paper at least.</p> <p>\"I really wanted to win on my last day in the rainbow jersey, so that I could go out in style,\" he said after being greeted at the finish by his partner Peta Todd and their daughter Delilah. \"The team were incredible. There were breaks going all day but they took me all the way to the line. I'm really happy.\"</p> <p>Cavendish made a point of thanking the crowd for their support. They have been massive all through the race's eight days and it was the same all through Surrey. \"There was so much support on the road out there, it was like the Olympic Games, but it's been like that all round the country, rain or shine. It was really nice to see.\"</p> <p>Cavendish has worn the legendary rainbow stripes with immense pride, well aware of his status as the first British professional to wear them since Tom Simpson in 1965. His victory tally for 2012 that includes three stages in both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France and the Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne semi-classic, as well as wins in events as diverse as the Tour of Qatar and the Tour of Denmark. His haul for this week was three stages, in Dumfries and Blackpool as well as in Guildford.</p> <p>The final kilometres of the stage were controlled by Team Sky with Cavendish's personal watchdog Bernhard Eisel and the veteran Jeremy Hunt \u2013 who is set to retire at the end of this year after a career dating back to 1996 \u2013 doing much of the hard yards. But there was a major hiccup about 40km from the finish when the German team NetApp applied massive pressure on the short, steep climb of Barhatch Lane, hoping to dislodge Cavendish.</p> <p>The peloton split to pieces with Tiernan-Locke prominent as he has been all week whenever the going has got tough. Behind, however, Cavendish looked to be struggling momentarily but he and Sky, together with the race leader's Endura Racing team all kept their cool and brought the race back together. Coming into the finish, the world champion slipped back briefly before making his final effort as the road reared upwards, with the Dutchman Boy van Poppel trailing in his wake.</p> <p>After running out the overall winner of the British Tour, 18sec clear of the Australian Nathan Haas, Tiernan-Locke will join Cavendish next week when the Manxman rides in defence of his jersey on a hilly course in Limburg. In the further future the Devonian is expected to join Team Sky, where Cavendish may or may not be his team-mate depending on whether he negotiates an exit from the squad.</p> <p>This was a consummate victory that had looked likely from the first serious climbs in the Peak District last Monday, given Tiernan-Locke's obvious strength whenever the road went uphill. He took the leader's jersey after ripping the field to shreds on the twin climbs of Caerphilly Mountain on Friday afternoon, then reinforced his lead on Saturday in his native Devon.</p> <p>Tiernan-Locke finished fifth in his home Tour last year for the Rapha-Condor-Sharp team, who had revitalised his career after he took several years out to deal with the Epstein-Barr virus; this season he made headlines early on with victories in the Tour of the Mediterranean and Tour du Haut Var. But winning his home race when he was so strong and expected to do so was another massive stepping stone for the 27-year-old former mountain biker, who had further strengthened his credentials as the next big thing in British cycling, behind Cavendish, Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome.</p>",
  "<p>High-frequency trading (HFT) faces possible extinction in Europe as politicians from across the political spectrum join forces to impose restrictions on a practice blamed for two market crashes in recent years.</p> <p>Several influential MEPs are determined to clamp down on the use of sophisticated computer algorithms and fast connections to generate profits through huge numbers of high-speed trades, after seeing its role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/14/wall-street-flash-crash-taught-us\" title=\"\">the notorious 2010 US Flash Crash</a> and the collapse of Knight Capital <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/aug/06/knight-capital-computer-glitch-trading\" title=\"\">last month</a>.</p> <p>But behind the scenes, the UK Treasury is trying to water down attempts by EU legislators to impose tough limits on the fiendishly complicated trading systems that generate a significant slice of trading on Europe's stock exchanges.</p> <p>Analysts at the consultancy firm Tabb Group estimate that high-frequency trading accounts for 36% of UK stock market transactions. Advocates argue high-frequency trading HFT improves markets, provides liquidity and reduces transaction costs. But many institutional investors and a growing rising number of MEPs have told the <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/\" title=\"\">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a> that HFT increases volatility. They also cite an EU study showing the cost to buy equities increased 14% in the three years to 2009.</p> <p>Fuelled by fears over potential market shocks and unease that markets appear dominated by speculators, the European parliament is cracking down on the industry through the revised markets in financial instruments directive (Mifid), which shapes financial markets across the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/\" title=\"\">The bureau</a> spoke to six MEPs from a range of parties and found broad parliamentary agreement on reforms including introducing \"circuit breakers\" that halt trading at large, sudden movements in prices and limiting the number of orders that traders cancel \u2013 an idea said to be gaining ground.</p> <p>Sharon Bowles, the Liberal Democrat chair of the European parliament's powerful economic affairs committee, which is steering the HFT proposals, said: \"The jury's still out on whether high-frequency trading does anybody any good, and as more quite significant fund managers and others say they don't want it, it may be that it disappears.\"</p> <p>\"There are some systemic risks that need to be addressed,\" said Kay Swinburne, a Conservative MEP and former investment banker, who warned that European markets were not immune from the sudden shocks that have hit US markets. \"The flash crash could happen here: our system's automatic stops would kick in automatically so it wouldn't be as dramatic, but we could still have a 10% drop before the circuit breakers kick in.\"</p> <p>The UK's official response, made jointly through the Treasury and the City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, supports HFT, arguing it increases liquidity and cuts trading costs. While supporting \"steps to enhance stability and protect against market abuse\", the Treasury does not support European moves requiring HFT firms to hold equities for a minimum period.</p> <p>The Treasury's position is informed by a research project it commissioned from the Office for Science. Known as the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/about-us\" title=\"\">Foresight Group</a>, it consists of two advisory panels. The first is an eight-strong working group overseen by Clara Furse, the former London Stock Exchange chief executive whose tenure spanned the rise of HFT, and Andy Haldane, the Bank of England director responsible for financial stability and an outspoken critic of HFT.</p> <p>The second, the High Level Stakeholder Group, is a 31-member strategic panel appointed by former City minister, Mark Hoban. Of the 22 members from financial services, the bureau has found evidence to link 16 to the HFT industry.</p> <p>Last month, Foresight's interim paper, written by three academics, criticised virtually all the EU's proposals.</p> <p>A Foresight spokeswoman said: \"When the final report is published, it will take into consideration a wide range of evidence from academic studies, all of which have been independently peer reviewed to ensure that the findings are of a high standard.\"</p> <p>But a well-placed source close to the Foresight team said the High Level Panel \"is dominated by providers, not by users\". The three- to four-hour meetings, the insider said, \"tended to be dominated by industry \u2026 It is a concern that the group is like that.\"</p> <p>John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury select committee, said: \"It's the same old vested interests. The UK government is totally sold on the idea that financial markets are where the future is.\"</p> <p>He added that he would now draw issues raised by the bureau's investigation to the Treasury select committee's attention.</p> <p>Leading the HFT industry's response in Europe is Remco Lenterman, managing director of a Dutch HFT firm, IMC, and chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.futuresindustry.org/epta/\" title=\"\">European Principal Traders Association</a>, the HFT lobby group. The former Goldman Sachs banker said: \"If I heard of this phenomenon, coming after a massive financial crisis, and I was unfamiliar with these participants, you hear it's new [and] it appears to have no social value; it sounds like a personification of what's bad about the [financial] industry.</p> <p>\"When Foresight started, ([the Bank of England's Andy] Haldane was very critical. The committee's now coming to a different conclusion. The data tends to support the claims that we are making.\"</p> <p>Whoever is right, this multibillion-pound industry's fate will be decided&#xa0;by negotiations between European Union finance ministers and MEPs, which will conclude this year.</p> <h2><br>How high-frequency trading works</h2> <p>Equities and foreign exchange trading is no longer the preserve of raucous traders. It is now increasingly conducted remotely by very powerful computers surfing global financial markets logging billions of transactions to establish trading patterns.</p> <p>Stock exchanges sell space to high-frequency trade (HFT) computers, which use dedicated cables circling the world connecting markets to capture information at lightning speed. Specialist HFT firms, hedge funds and investment banks spray millions of orders every fraction of a second, before cancelling most of them. The idea is to sniff out what a buyer or seller is prepared to pay. Prices are arbitraged across dozens of exchanges exploiting tiny differences. Equities are held for a fraction of a second and sold at a wafer-thin profit.</p> <p>But as so many shares are traded in this way, the profits can be vast. But so can the losses, as the 2010 Wall Street Flash Crash and the Knight Capital debacle showed.</p> <p>Among the biggest companies in the industry are Getco, Knight Capital, which suffered a $440m trading loss last month, and IMC.</p> <p>HFT now accounts for 70% of the US stock market and 36% of the UK's. Its growth owes much to EU rules, which liberalised stock exchanges in 2007. HFT has vastly increased volumes of trades to the benefit of exchanges.</p>",
  "<p>Uwe Albrecht has what he calls a wonderful problem. In his office in Leipzig's fortress-like town hall, the deputy mayor says the city's population has grown so much in the past decade that he is having to build more kindergartens and schools.</p> <p>\"Ten years ago we were talking about closing schools,\" he said.</p> <p>Now Leipzig is one of the success stories of reunification. New roads, rail links and a redeveloped airport have sucked in investment and international companies. But none of it would have happened without a colossal 20-year bailout that has already cost the west \u20ac1.3tn. \"Without the transfers from the west, it would not have been possible.\"</p> <p>With Europe slumped in an existential crisis, looking both desperately and fearfully to Germany to supply the leadership and the money to match its clout as the EU's central power and biggest economy, it is often forgotten that Berlin is a past master at financial bailouts. Which is why it is also weary of them.</p> <p>The enormous costs the country has shouldered since 1989 have pushed many to the limits of their largesse, with people fed up with how much they have had to pay and for how long. \"People feel these transfers will never stop, that the money will just keep flowing,\" says Matthias Kullas of the Centre for European Policy.</p> <p>In a domestic debate that mirrors the rancour and resentments that have broken out across the EU as leaders bicker endlessly over who should pay to rescue the euro, richer German states now complain about constantly having to help out poorer states via the national federal subsidies system. Just as tens of thousands of Germans tried and failed last week to persuade the country's constitutional court to rule against the eurozone's bailout fund, the rich southern state of Bavaria is taking similar action to try to freeze payments to poorer areas. Some southerners are calling for Bavarian independence from Germany, arguing it would be better off. In addition to the subsidies, German taxpayers stump up a \"solidarity surcharge\" of 5.5% of income tax to fund the hefty costs of unification in an arrangement due to last until 2019. \"East Germany might well need another trillion,\" said Katinka Barysch, a German economist at the Centre for European Reform.</p> <p>Despite the unification fatigue, the project remains feasible for several reasons \u2013 patriotism, empathy with the less fortunate easterners, and because the process is subject to the same rules, laws, political system and culture and can be easily policed and monitored.</p> <p>None of this can be said about Europe. The German merger model is not a template that can be applied on a European scale. When the euro was being created 25 years ago, the then chancellor, Helmut Kohl, used to argue that German and European unification were two sides of the same coin. The euro crisis has punctured that notion.</p> <p>And in the debate now raging in Germany over Europe, it has become acceptable to assert that Kohl may have been a great chancellor, but he got one thing wrong \u2013 the euro.</p> <p>\"It's healthy,\" said Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot, of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. \"This is the first time that Germany is having a proper polarised discussion on Europe. Europe still resonates in Germany. But now the debate is different. Some say yes, some want it smaller, some say forget it and turn their backs on it.\"</p> <p>This polarisation is generating tremendous uncertainty and ambivalence as Berlin agonises over which way to turn, poised between giving Europe the cold shoulder or spearheading a big new integrationist push towards a much more centralised eurozone federation. For the moment it's a case of muddling through, but few believe that this can continue for long. Whatever the outcome, Europe's future \u2013 and that means Germany's future \u2013 will be decided not entirely but mostly in Berlin.</p> <p>Writing last week in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the historian Andreas Wirsching likened Berlin's current dilemmas over Europe to those of Otto von Bismarck in the 19th century, suggesting the tug of war over the euro reflected a similar political dynamic that in the past had resulted in real wars.</p> <p>Germany's position in Europe, he wrote, was \"semi-hegemonic. That means a problematic in-between position which is not dominant enough to impose its will on its European neighbours, but is strong enough to be seen as a threat, generating opposition, stirring alliances, and always running the risk of leading to isolation.\"</p> <p>That may sum up the position of the chancellor, Angela Merkel, after she was hijacked at an EU summit in June by the leaders of France, Italy and Spain over euro policy. Indeed, Merkel has acknowledged the \"semi-hegemon\" status, telling parliament in June that Germany may now be big and strong, but it is also overstretched and not big or strong enough to meet the expectations of rescuing the euro.</p> <p>Tensions, suspicions and misunderstandings between Germany and its eurozone partners abound. Germans feel aggrieved at being penalised for success, being asked to shell out for other people's failures. The beneficiaries of the bailouts feel bullied by Berlin dictating their budget and fiscal policies. They complain when Germany leads \u2013 and when it does not. \"It's always been viewed as common sense in Germany to be pro-European,\" said David McAllister, the prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony. \"But now for the first time there's a noticeable anti-European feeling.\"</p> <p>German competitiveness, for example, and the success of the \"made in Germany\" brand that has made the country a global exports champion, is frequently criticised by those on the other side of the euro debate, feeding German defensiveness and a sense of grievance.</p> <p>Hans Kundnani, editorial director at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that Germans are blinded by an \"export nationalism\" or have become too dependent on their exports, which generate nearly half of all German GDP. \"Germany needs to become less competitive, and contract its export sector in relation to GDP.\"</p> <p>Such advice is met with gasps of incredulity. \"We export like madmen to China, Latin America, Asia, India. We're an export machine whose success has nothing to do with Europe. We also did that when we had the deutschmark,\" said Wolfgang Nowak, a former aide to Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.</p> <p>Gunnar Beck, an expert on European law and a sceptic on Germany's so-called European vocation, said: \"Germany has not benefited from the euro nearly as much as many say. Asking Germany to focus less on exports \u2013 the backbone of the economy \u2013 would be like asking the British economy to focus less on the financial sector. There would be an outcry.\"</p> <p>The euro crisis has put paid to the fiction that Germany and France are equals at the top of the EU. But the German establishment has not yet resolved the issue of direction of travel. Take two voices from Germany's political elite, both of them social democratic. The signals could not be more different.</p> <p>Nowak, the former Schr\u00f6der aide, now directs Deutsche Bank's Alfred Herrhausen Society. He told the Guardian: \"Germans have taken it on the chin for far too long, and spent far too much money on Europe. And why did we do it? Because we swooned over the idea of the United States of Europe, hoping that people would forget that we're Germans \u2026 We felt liberated at the idea of being able to be Europeans. And others let us dream the dream as long as we always paid the bill.\"</p> <p>In stark contrast, J\u00f6rg Asmussen is playing a key role in trying to save the euro as the German on the executive of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and a former deputy finance minister. For him the answer is the United States of Europe derided by Nowak. Asmussen said: \"Every generation has to define anew how it deals with Europe and the European question. I wouldn't take it for granted that we can keep what we have achieved. Completing monetary union means four things \u2013 a banking union, a fiscal union, an economic union, a democratically legitimised political union. They belong together and depend on one another. And this integration will mean more freedom, more security, more jobs, more prosperity for the European citizen.\"</p> <p>This is the agenda Merkel also says she is pursuing, one that will tax all her qualities of leadership if she is to perform the double trick of coaxing her own people into acceptance as well as cajoling at least 16 EU countries into buying the federal Europe blueprint.</p> <p>The road to that Europe will be long and pitted with holes. Perhaps the most fundamental problem with the vision espoused by Merkel or her veteran finance minister and European architect, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, is that it is based not on enthusiasm or optimism, but has been born of crisis and fear. There is no upbeat dynamic, rather a dread that Europe will unravel into a patchwork of rival, resentful fiefdoms if it is not centralised.</p> <p>Besides, the French and the British are comfortable with the mantle of leadership \u2013 the Germans less so.</p> <p>\"Germans are very, very reluctantly dealing with the idea that they are the default leaders of Europe, that we're the ones that everyone's looking to for salvation,\" said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.</p> <p>\"Leadership by Germany was for decades the last thing that the world wanted and the Germans certainly would not have dreamed of doing so,\" added Jan Ross, a commentator for weekly newspaper Die Zeit. \"The word was taboo. Whenever the words 'leader' [F\u00fchrer ] and 'leadership' needed to be translated, it caused the tongue to knot.\"</p> <p>Now that everyone is pressing Germany to show leadership, it does not know how to respond, he said.</p> <p>Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, famously highlighted the dilemma in a speech last year in Berlin when he declared that he feared Germany's power less than its inaction.</p> <p>The acquired habit of relative passivity is proving hard to break. \"I think it's very good that Germany is hesitant to have a leading role,\" said Margot K\u00e4ssmann, former head of a Protestant churches' federation. \"The history of the last century has proven that was usually the wrong path to go down.\"</p> <p>In an internal paper distributed to German embassies this year, the foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, dwelt on the damage being done to Germany's image abroad by its handling of the euro crisis, warning that old stereotypes about the \"ugly German\" were being revived among the country's neighbours.</p> <p>The Der Spiegel columnist Jakob Augstein, alarmed that Berlin had blundered into self-righteous isolation over the euro, argued that it was better for Germany to be wrong but together with its EU partners than to be right on its own.</p> <p>\"I always felt a bit ashamed to be German,\" admitted K\u00e4ssmann. \"When I went to Yad Vashem for the first time I didn't talk German. I think I was 40 when I sang the national anthem for the first time.\"</p> <p>When World Cup football came to Germany in 2006 it marked something of a turning point. \"It was such a good feeling,\" recalled K\u00e4ssmann. \"My daughters wanted to put up flags in my house. I refused, but it showed me how they have no problem any more with their national identity and I think that's a good thing. Of course, it helped that our team came third, rather than first. To have won would have been a bit embarrassing.\"</p> <p>If modern Germany is more at ease abjuring the power and responsibilities of leadership in favour of a quiet, comfortable life, the frictions and misunderstandings making the European crisis worse are rooted in other psychological and cultural factors. In the midst of Europe's woes, it is difficult in the towns and cities of Germany to sense any trouble. The crisis is just not happening in a country with the second lowest unemployment in Europe. This mismatch makes it difficult to mobilise public opinion behind expensive action to fix problems that people do not feel affected by.</p> <p>\"I get the feeling that Germans are lounging on an island and not taking on board what the rest of the world is thinking,\" Elmar Brok, an MEP for the Christian Democrats, said recently. \"I sometimes have the impression that we Germans alone think we know what is right and that everyone else is somehow wrong.\"</p> <p>And despite complaints in Germany that they are paying the most to bail out the Greeks, Irish and the rest, Brok points out that the country is paying the same as everyone else in per capita terms. There just happen to be more Germans.</p> <p>Then there's the culture that makes Germans the biggest savers and most reluctant spenders, encouraging national stereotypes about the thrifty and the spendthrift, the scroungers and the stingy. Comparatively few Germans own credit cards, for example, and most are reluctant to take out a mortgage and are obsessed with saving.</p> <p>It is customary to ascribe these habits to a history of several currency reforms over the past century as well as the wheelbarrow inflation of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s.</p> <p>\"Hyperinflation and currency reform are firmly anchored as major traumas in the collective German psyche,\" said McAllister.</p> <p>\"Inflation is something that frightens us, and is one of the reasons why Germany included a debt brake in its constitution.\" It has also insisted that others in the eurozone follow suit. Facing an election himself in January, McAllister has made the ambitious pledge to eliminate his state's debt \"for the first time in our history\" by 2017.</p> <p>\"Germans have piggy bank genes, they save like mad,\" said Nowak. \"It's why they see Merkel as the mother of all piggy banks, defending their interests, their savings. The fear of hyperinflation is what makes the idea of printing money horrific to Germans.\" It also reinforces the allergy to bailouts and the growing disenchantment with the euro. Almost uniquely in Europe, Germany has no anti-EU party. But there is a growing band of eurosceptics who would like to see the country leave the euro, while the mainstream appears determined to control it.</p> <p>\"What won't happen is large-scale fiscal transfers without very strong central control,\" said Barysch.</p> <p>Guerot in Berlin added: \"The German political elite is very pessimistic about what is doable and still acceptable to public opinion. The Germans are eager to find a way of controlling other people's spending. If they're going to cover the others' debt, they won't do it for free.\"</p> <p>McAllister points to the power of the press and some reports that Germans are ingesting about the rest of the eurozone. \"A German reads that the average Greek retires at 58, 59, the average French person at 62. He or she feels that we've gone through all these structural reforms in the last few years, we've had little or no wage rises, we can expect to retire at 67, we've really worked hard to make Germany more competitive, yet the one who makes the effort is punished and those who don't do anything get away with it.</p> <p>\"Germans are distancing themselves from Europe and that's something we've never seen before.\"</p>",
  "<p>The man at the centre of Shell's controversial drilling programme in the Arctic has said he is aware of the responsibility on his head but is convinced the Anglo-Dutch oil group is acting in a fully responsible and accountable way.</p> <p>Speaking after a huge ice floe forced drilling 70 miles off the north-west coast of Alaska to be temporarily halted, Peter Slaiby, vice-president of Shell Alaska, insisted that the company had learned from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">Deepwater Horizon disaster</a>.</p> <p>\"We are raising the bar in the way we have been working with local communities,\" he said. \"We have made 450 different trips to consult and listen to any concerns. We believe the way we are doing this is important \u2013 not just for Alaska but for the wider Arctic region.\"</p> <p>Shell has spent more than $4.5bn (\u00a32.77bn) over four years preparing for work in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukchi_Sea\" title=\"\">Chukchi</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_Sea\" title=\"\">Beaufort </a>seas, off the state's west and north coasts, but has faced legal action, post-Deepwater Horizon drilling bans and a very short summer weather window.</p> <p>The Chukchi operation finally started eight days ago, on Sunday 10 September, only to be halted almost immediately by the threat of the ice floe, 30 miles long and 12 miles wide, heading towards the drill ship.</p> <p>The disruption triggered a call from Greenpeace for Shell to end its activities completely. It also precedes a report into what Britain should do to safeguard the Arctic, which is scheduled to be released on Thursday by a House of Commons select committee.</p> <p>Environmentalists say a spill similar to Deepwater Horizon would be catastrophic in a pristine environment badly affected by climate change and home to threatened mammals&#xa0;such&#xa0;as polar bears, bowhead whales and walrus.</p> <p>Asked if another major spill would destroy the company's reputation, Slaiby said: \"I feel there is a helluva responsibility on my head, but we have clear accountability models. I have the ability to do things in the right way and I have the backing of the most senior leaders in Shell to do things the right way.\"</p> <p>The company hopes to have Noble Discoverer, its drill ship, back on station any day now to continue its work, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2012/jul/16/greenpeace-activists-shell-petrol-station-video\" title=\"\">demands from Greenpeace and others to call off the operation</a>. Critics have many concerns, from wider fears about new oil production fuelling global warming, to more localised worries that Shell is not as prepared as it claims.</p> <p>Slaiby, said the company fully understands the impact of carbon on climate change but said oil and gas are still needed to meet growing global energy demand in the near term. \"The <a href=\"http://www.usgs.gov/\" title=\"\">US Geological Survey</a> says that about 25% of the world's remaining hydrocarbon reserves are here [the Arctic]. And 25% of those are here in Alaska. Oil and gas are part of the mix, a big part of the energy puzzle, and we have to ensure local communities benefit economically.\"</p> <p>As for safety, Slaiby insisted a \"very, very robust\" oil spill programme had been established to tackle any crisis. He rejected any idea that there could be a repeat of Deepwater, which damaged the beaches of the southern states of the US. \"These wells are very, very different from the Gulf of Mexico wells because they do not have the ability to flow at the rate you have in the Gulf: they are shallower. We are not dealing with deepwater wells. The geology is relatively simple and a third of the pressure [can be expected] in the Chukchi ... The sea conditions in terms of the wind, waves and currents are not even as extreme as the North Sea, although, clearly, there is no ice in the North Sea.\"</p> <p>The decision to move the drill ship once it had started drilling was a demonstration of how careful Shell will be in the event of ice in the region, Slaiby said. However, a freedom of information request by a federal employees group in Washington has shown that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/09/shell-criticised-limited-testing-alaska-drilling-containment?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">only two brief tests were undertaken on Shell's new containment dome</a> designed to prevent oil spewing into the ocean, and there appeared to be no independent verification.</p> <p>Slaiby, who has worked in the North Sea off Lowestoft in Suffolk, said these revelations gave a misleading picture because Shell had been in meetings over many months with regulators and others about a much wider safety plan. And it had been working for a long time with a third-party contractor and leading drilling safety experts, such as Wild Well Control of Houston.</p> <p>\"We even had the director of BSEE [<a href=\"http://bsee.gov/\" title=\"\">Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement</a>] out with me looking at the capping stack \u2026 I find these charges (of insufficient planning) groundless.\"</p> <p>The preparations made by Shell and others have been under review by the House of Commons environmental audit committee which will release its first report, Protecting the Arctic, on Thursday.</p> <p><strong>Leader comment, page 28 </strong></p>",
  "<p>Approximately 1,000 people shouted slogans outside the US embassy in central London in a protest inspired by the furore over a US-made anti-Islam film.</p> <p>A few hundred people, many of them associated with the hardline Hizb ut-Tahrir organisation, which seeks a unified Islamist caliphate in the Arab world, assembled in Grosvenor Square on Sunday before the scheduled 2.30pm start time. The numbers soon swelled, and police moved crowd barriers to pen in the larger crowd.</p> <p>Though targeted ostensibly at the film, Innocence of Muslims, which denigrates Islam and the prophet Muhammad and which sparked deadly riots around the Middle East, the placards held by many protesters were aimed at the US, saying, \"America \u2013 get out of Muslim lands\".</p> <p>Watched by a relatively low-key police presence, the gathering \u2013 the majority of whom were men at the front of the crowd, but with a number of women and children at the rear \u2013 listened to speakers condemning the film, US foreign policy and \"oppression\" of Muslims and Islam.</p> <p>Hizb ut-Tahrir, which organised the protest, is a controversial group with branches in dozens of countries. The Conservatives went into the last general election pledging to ban it in the UK, a vow yet to be realised.</p> <p>Last year the government's counter-terrorism watchdog, David Anderson QC, said in a report to parliament he could see no reason for Hizb ut-Tahrir, which has radical aims but espouses non-violent methods, to be outlawed</p> <p>Nazreen Nawaz, a spokeswoman for the group, explained why the group had chosen to gather outside the US embassy even when the film had no connection to the US government and had been condemned by it.</p> <p>She said: \"This was a movie that was produced, promoted and allowed to be promoted within the US. It comes within a context and an environment. You constantly have attacks against Islamic beliefs by politicians, whether it's in the US or elsewhere in the west.\"</p> <p>She had few details about what the group would like the US government to do about the film and its makers, beyond \"have it taken off air, of course\".</p> <p>Nawaz stressed that the group condemned violence, but she expressed understanding of \"the frustration that you see on the streets of Cairo and Tunis and Benghazi and Bagladesh\".</p> <p>She said: \"We're very clear today in saying that no violence against any ambassador or civilians is accepted in Islam. We're not calling for violent actions here. What we're saying is that Muslims must protest, and you must understand the anger of the streets in the Muslim world.\"</p>",
  "<p>The former cabinet minister David Blunkett will on Monday deliver a stinging attack on \"the dangerous overbearing imperialism of Germany\", as he makes a call to find new ways to end public disengagement with politics and strengthen the power of elected politicians to combat the power of unfettered markets.</p> <p>He accuses the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of trying to \"veto the voters\" in sovereign countries, and claims that without German-imposed austerity measures, the crises in Spain and Greece might not have happened.</p> <p>Warning about new levels of alienation from politics in the UK, Blunkett claims governments can only act as a counterweight to the debilitating global power of bond markets and technocrats if they have an engaged electorate behind them.</p> <p>He says in a pamphlet titled In Defence of Politics, with a foreword by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, that rebuilding interest in politics from the bottom up will need initiatives to help school governors, community health commissioning groups and even state funding of campaigns such as Make Poverty History. Recent constitutional reforms such as an elected House of Lords are irrelevant to re-engaging ordinary people with the potential power of democracy and collective action, he claims.</p> <p>\"The left has to put a shot of electricity back in the political system and find new ways of re-engaging people with government, or else it will be lost, and people will turn to the politics of grievance offered by extremists. A functioning, engaged political democracy has to be the countervailing force against the unfettered and unregulated market. You rebuild commitment to the political process from the bottom, and not from top-down reforms,\" he said.</p> <p>Blunkett, one of the older heads that advises Miliband, also addresses:</p> <p>\u2022 what he regards as the irrelevance of the Leveson inquiry. He believes it has failed to address the real risk that the entire traditional newspaper industry is on the brink of commercial collapse, leading to a decline in reliable journalism \u2013 a bulwark of democracy. He proposes a tax on search engines, such as Google, recycling journalism. \"If proper journalism goes down the pan, we are all doomed\", he said.</p> <p>\u2022 the likelihood that vast swaths of local government services will after 2015 be delivered by volunteers, or by fractured education and health services for which there is no true accountability.</p> <p>\u2022 the failure of Labour politicians to offer voters a coherent narrative for the causes of the banking crisis of 2008, so allowing the right and the bond markets to seize back control of the argument on the economy.</p> <p>In an accompanying interview, Blunkett says the bureaucracy and interference of the EU has been a force for alienation in the UK, saying we need to be crystal clear about what Europe does\". He singles out Germany for the way in which it has sought to impose its thinking across Europe on how to respond to the economic crisis.</p> <p>He said: \"Angela Merkel has behaved in a very dangerous, almost imperialist, manner. It is ironic that Europe was established to stop one individual government having overbearing power, and here we are.</p> <p>\"It could be described as nothing short of a coup in terms of what occurred in Greece, with the removal of the prime minister, and in Italy, with the removal of both the prime minister and the cabinet.</p> <p>Blunkett said: \"No sooner had the voters given their verdict than the chancellor of Germany was seeking to veto the voters with the argument that recently signed pacts cannot be easily unpicked by incoming governments. The tone and nature of the German response was, however, deeply unhelpful and the height of arrogance. Once again, the Germans were appearing to believe that they had the right (or their leadership had the right) to trump the decisions of voters in individual sovereign countries\".</p> <p>He claimed: \"If Germany had been willing to be flexible earlier, we probably would not had the last three years\".</p> <p>He also warns that greater transparency about the lives of elected politicians has increased rather than decreased voter scepticism. \"More is known about our professional politicians than in the whole of our history. Their lives, their income, their contacts are registered, surveyed and commented upon; a transformation from the much-revered and often grossly overblown view of the past. Taken together, the24-hour, seven-day-a-week news, instant communication through the internet and social media such as Twitter, has changed the terms on which we do our politics.\"</p>",
  "<p>Benjamin Britten and his successors have been progressively converting the abandoned maltings at Snape since the 1960s, but almost half the site is still in ruins. This is no bad thing, because any music organisation with an eye on the future will want a derelict building or two for more adventurous commissions. David Toop's intriguingly titled first opera, born out of Aldeburgh's pioneering <a href=\"http://www.aldeburgh.co.uk/jerwood\" title=\"\">Jerwood Opera-Writing Fellowship</a>, received its premiere in one of Snape's most dilapidated buildings, fittingly for a work that explores ideas of dereliction and the traces left by objects, sounds and people.</p> <p>The biscuit of the title is a memento belonging to the opera's protagonist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJxIrB1vOk\" title=\"\">Dora Maar</a> (sung by <a href=\"http://www.lorelixenberg.com/\" title=\"\">Lore Lixenberg</a>), depicted as stranded on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/sea-level\" title=\"\">sinking island</a>. The work follows Maar's struggle to choose between drowning in memories or in reality. She is aided in this by two ghosts, Euphosine (Elaine Mitchener), an 18th-century singer, and Seabrook (Jamie McDermott), an Edwardian explorer, who linger amid eerie lighting on the building's upper storey.</p> <p>There are fascinating ideas here in both the treatment and the music, where the chamber accompaniment and voices are used \u2013 through distortion and electronic manipulation \u2013 to figure physical absence rather than presence, and much to ponder for anyone seeking to relocate opera to the 21st century.</p> <p>But despite moments of beauty, the play of music and its spectres grew somewhat weary by the end, partly because the use of only two speakers effectively flattened the space. Lixenberg, a singer of astonishing range, who creates beautiful sounds just by silently opening her mouth, was unaccountably reined in by her vocal part. The libretto, too, seemed stranded awkwardly between obscurity and artlessness. Even as a piece of extended sound art, a sense of absorption was lacking. For much of it I found I was longing for silence. But then again, that may well have been the point.</p>",
  "<p>Schools are living through a period of rapid change and head teachers are looking outside education to politics and business for new models of leadership. As one headteacher said: \"We're probably not the only school to have played the theme music from West Wing at assembly when we first reopened.\"</p> <p>Delivering change and improvements fast is a common theme in business and increasingly, schools. CEOs and Barack Obama have stressed the importance of their first 100 days in office. The time frame maps neatly onto the first term in school, and resonates with heads tasked with turning a school around.</p> <p>For new heads who have inherited good or outstanding schools, implementing a ferocious programme of change would probably not be a wise strategy. But every head knows the importance of getting the first term right. We asked our panel for their advice to incoming heads on how to manage the first term in office.</p> <h2>Helen Mathiesson, principal, Marine Academy Plymouth</h2> <p><strong>Do the planning:</strong> All the planning has to be done prior to day one. I hired a senior vice principal, who was also a timetable specialist, and a corporate director of business and finance. The finances of an academy are different from a maintained school and we had to set a budget. For us, drawing up a new curriculum that met the needs of the school was a core piece of work. We didn't get much of a summer holiday.</p> <p><strong>Plan every day:</strong> You are being observed and everything you do \u2013 and don't do - sends out a message. Think carefully about how you spend your time.</p> <p><strong>Take stock:</strong> For a new head it's important to really observe and listen well for the first term. I liken it to moving into a new house and seeing the new garden. Yes, you have your plan, but it's important not to move things around too soon \u2013 you have to see how plants grow and respond to the environment.</p> <h2>Philip Cantwell, principal, Malcolm Arnold Academy</h2> <p><strong>Be welcoming:</strong> I had the whole of the staff out on the street welcoming the students back. It was like a wedding reception. All teachers were in business dress and the students were in their new school uniforms. We went directly to a series of assemblies and meetings where students were informed of expectations of their behaviour, their aspirations and attainment. After that, students went to lessons. I told the staff to teach the best lessons they'd ever taught.</p> <p><strong>Take the temperature:</strong> When we started the Christmas holiday intervention work, we had to know that enough students would turn up in their holidays.</p> <p><strong>The shakeout begins:</strong> By the end of the first term, ten to twelve staff had gone. There were seven actions taken as a preliminary to permanent exclusions for students for physical assaults on staff.</p> <h2>Simon Elliott, head teacher, Forest Gate Community School</h2> <p><strong>Deliver quick wins:</strong> These have to be genuine, but can boost morale and win support. Examples are improving an area of the school such as the toilet block. I reduced enterprise days from 20 to four a term \u2013 they were eating up too much curriculum time. It was an easy win.</p> <h2>Derek Trimmer, head teacher, Hove Park School</h2> <p><strong>Have a goal:</strong> Our goal was to be in the top one per cent of improved schools in the country. That broke down into two simple objectives: to raise standards and to narrow the gap.</p> <p><strong>State where you're going:</strong> It's really important that everyone knows where they are going and has something to aim for before your start unpicking things or doing any post mortem. Make the messages simple.</p> <p><strong>Stage manage meetings:</strong> The first week is crucial because it is a series of firsts; meetings with students, staff, parents, and statements to the press. These meetings carry huge weight and have to be carefully stage managed.</p> <p><strong>Be visible:</strong> I have two senior leaders who do learning walks every period of the day. I visit around 40-50 lessons every week. It's important because you get to see where inconsistencies are and it helps narrow the gap, which is one of our key objectives.</p> <p><strong>Stimulate progress:</strong> I built a wall of success in the entrance foyer. It charts every student's progress in terms of reaching the gold standard of five GCSE passes including English and Maths. The children's photos are moved around every time data is collected.</p> <p><strong>Recognise progress:</strong> I sent a personal, handwritten letter of congratulations to 250 students who had moved up a grade in one of their subjects. The letters were sent out on the Friday morning so they would be received on the Saturday and shared with their families.</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Every year, one typical coal-fired power station devours several million tonnes of fuel and produces even more carbon dioxide. Burning stuff has the virtue that it is simple but it is very brutal. That volume of carbon dioxide is damaging the atmosphere and, in the longer term, the fuel will run out. It is clear that the world needs an alternative to generating energy by setting fire to things.</p> <p>For a good few years now, nuclear fusion has looked like offering a solution to the problem. For every 100&#xa0;tonnes of coal we burn, fusion has the potential to deliver the same amount of energy, without any carbon dioxide emission, using a small bath of water and the lithium contained in a single laptop battery. Moreover, it would be inherently very safe and would not produce any significant radioactive waste. Lest there be any confusion, the science behind this way of harnessing the energy locked away inside the atomic nucleus is entirely different from that used in current nuclear fission reactors. It almost seems too good to be true \u2026 but it isn't.</p> <p>A fusion reactor called <a href=\"http://www.iter.org/\" title=\"\">Iter</a> is currently under construction in France and is due to start operation in 2020. Its principal goal is to determine the viability of fusion at the scale of a power station. Success is widely anticipated and there are already plans afoot to build a \"demonstration power plant\" to start operating in the 2030s.</p> <p>Fusion is the reason that our sun keeps shining. Deep in the sun's core is a hot, dense sea of electrons and protons \u2013 the remnants of hydrogen atoms that have been torn apart by the high temperature created as a huge mass of hydrogen falls in on itself under the action of gravity. Under these extreme conditions two protons can fuse together, releasing energy in the process. Without this, the sun would stop burning and collapse under the weight of its own gravity.</p> <p>The goal is to exploit the same basic physics to generate energy here on Earth. In fact, we are trying to do much better than the sun, which kilo for kilo is several thousand times less efficient than the human body at generating energy. Crucially, that is not because the energy released when two protons fuse is small. In fact a fusion reaction generates around a million times more energy than is released in a typical chemical reaction, like those that take place in the human body or when we burn a lump of coal. Instead, the inefficiency is due to the fact that proton-proton fusion within the sun is very rare: it takes a proton in the sun around 5bn years to fuse.</p> <p>For that reason Iter will not fuse protons; instead it will fuse deuterium and tritium. These are heavy partners to the proton (deuterium has an extra neutron and tritium has two extra neutrons). The extra mass helps to ensure that fusion is far easier to achieve and, combined with the fact that Iter will operate at a temperature 10 times that in the sun's core, it should be possible for Iter to generate energy at a rate of 500m watts \u2013 the level of a small power station. Unlike the sun, Iter cannot exploit gravity to compress the plasma (the name for the hot fuel mix): instead the idea is to squeeze it inside a doughnut-shaped container using magnets. The energy from a single deuterium-tritium fusion reaction is carried away by a neutron and a helium nucleus. The latter is used to heat the plasma, thereby reducing the need to heat it from an external source, while the neutron can be absorbed in the walls, heating them up. In a reactor, that heat can then be extracted and delivered to the grid.</p> <p>The fuel is not too hard to come by either, and it won't run out in the next few million years at least: deuterium is plentiful in seawater and tritium can be manufactured by reacting those outgoing neutrons with lithium.</p> <p>It used to be joked that fusion is always the fuel of the future, but that is no longer fair. In the words of Professor Chris Llewellyn Smith, director of energy research at Oxford University, \"with enough money we could probably build a fusion reactor now but it would not be economical. The challenge is to make it reliable and competitive.\" This confidence is built upon the fact that fusion is now a routine event at the <a href=\"http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/JET.aspx\" title=\"\">Joint European Torus</a> (Jet) in Culham,&#xa0;Oxfordshire.</p> <p>In many ways, Jet is a mini-Iter: the design is broadly similar and the basic physics is the same. Research at Jet over the past 20 years has led to continuous advances in understanding the behaviour of the plasma. These have led to reduced heat loss due to turbulence and that implies improved efficiency. It is research like this that makes the experts so confident that Iter's time has come. That is not to deny that challenges remain: materials to handle the heat and neutron damage need to be designed, the production of tritium using lithium needs to be demonstrated and the behaviour of a burning plasma has yet to be fully explored.</p> <p>The construction phase of Iter is projected to cost \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.5bn), a sum that is dwarfed by the annual subsidy to the fossil fuel industry, which the International Energy Agency estimated to be at least $400bn (\u00a3248bn) in 2010 alone. Moreover, the cost is shared between the seven Iter members (the European Union, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the US) and amounts to a UK contribution of a mere few tens of millions each year. The stakes are surely too high to quibble about funding at this level.</p> <p>If we want to get by without burning fossil fuels then there is a huge gap to fill. With the exception of solar power, renewable energy sources can't satisfy the demand and it is not at all clear that renewables will ever be cheap enough to stop people burning fossil fuels. The wise course must surely be to invest in research across the board. As for fusion, the bottom line is not whether we can do it but whether we can do it at a price people will be prepared to pay.</p>"
