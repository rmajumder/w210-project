  "<p>No man over the age of 40 who has ever had the misfortune to glance in a mirror will be surprised to hear that his sperm quality is not what it once was. You don't need a PhD in genetics to figure out that in biological terms you have long since peaked.</p> <p>Scientists at <a href=\"http://www.decode.com/\" title=\"\">deCODE</a> genetics in Iceland, however, have quantified an aspect of this decline in a new way. A 40-year-old father, it has been revealed, is approximately twice as likely to conceive a child with autism or schizophrenia as a man half his age. With all the speed of a nugget of juicy celebrity gossip, this story has spread across the world from the pages of science journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/fathers-bequeath-more-mutations-as-they-age-1.11247\" title=\"\">Nature</a>.</p> <p>Women are already familiar with this narrative. Reared in societies which expect them to achieve financial independence and career success, they are often at the same time criticised and mocked for delaying parenthood until their late 30s. Caught between the rock of science and the hard place of social expectation, the modern woman cannot win. Men can now be beaten with the same stick. Biologically speaking, it would appear that both men and women should be producing children a good decade before most of us actually do it.</p> <p>The biological clock will always tick louder for women than for men, not least because the age at which men stop reproducing is a matter of choice and circumstance rather than biological determinism. While many childless women in their late 30s and early 40s agonise over their declining fertility, men will never feel a definitive cut-off date looming ahead of them. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1421176/Murdoch-to-be-a-father-again-at-the-age-of-72.html\" title=\"\">Rupert Murdoch had a child at 72</a>, Saul Bellow at 84, Les Colley, an Australian miner, at 92.</p> <p>While only a minority of men are likely to think it is a good idea to continue having children beyond retirement age, this study opens up to men a question that perhaps has never troubled them before. Is it selfish to delay reproduction until it is convenient, knowing that your child's health may be adversely affected by this choice? All older mothers have faced up to this question and reached a conclusion that suits them. Now it appears men should think about it, too.</p> <p>The science, however, only gets you so far. Looking at the entire task of fatherhood, if one compares the suitability of a 20-year-old to a 40-year-old, the younger man has few advantages. As we age, our spermatozoa mutating away inside us, we also become calmer, more patient, less obsessed with personal ambitions, our lifestyles less frenetic. One of the great ironies of masculinity is that our physical decline, our gradual diminishing of virility, is what brings out the qualities likely to turn us into good fathers.</p> <p>As someone aged 41 who has just had a third child, I know I am a much better father now than I was nine years ago, when I had my first. We older fathers may be passing on slightly lower quality genetic material, but where it really counts, in the area of nurture, fortysomethings are likely to do a far better job than twentysomethings.</p> <p>There is also the environment to consider. A more significant factor in population increase than the number of children you have is the age at which you have them. A society of young parents will grow in number faster than one of older parents. If I were to have followed the geneticists' advice for optimum reproduction, my son would not be at primary school, he'd be at the maternity ward with his pregnant wife. On an overpopulated planet, late parenthood benefits everyone.</p> <p>Not too late, of course. Rupert, Saul and Les should probably have known better. But we must remember that the genetic material we pass on is only a small fraction of the job of a father. If you are too young to give yourself up to&#xa0;the needs of your children, you are too young to be a parent.</p>",
  "<p>Italy's Alex Zanardi could have one key advantage when he lines up with Paralympic cyclists on the course at Brands Hatch next week. The former Formula One driver knows the track inside out from his days driving round it at 200mph.</p> <p>\"Last time I was here I was going about five times faster but I still love this circuit,\" said Zanardi, 45, who has fought back from a horrific crash in 2001 that cost him his legs and is now aiming for Paralympic gold riding a three-wheeled hand bike.</p> <p>Zanardi's comeback is all the more incredible considering doctors never understood how he survived the side-on impact in a Champ Car race at Germany's Lausitz track 11 years ago that left him with less than a litre of blood in his body.</p> <p>Pulling out of a pit stop, Zanardi lost control and stalled on the track, forcing one driver to swerve round him before the Canadian driver Alex Tagliani collided with him at 217mph, hitting Zanardi's Reynard-Honda at its most vulnerable point behind the front wheel \u2013 slicing car and driver in two.</p> <p>\"What saved me was the clean break,\" said Zanardi, whose legs were severed above the knees. \"I could have easily died right there from the impact.\"</p> <p>After losing three-quarters of his blood and undergoing reanimation seven times, doctors were amazed he was still clinging on to life after being taken by helicopter to a Berlin hospital.</p> <p>\"They compared my injuries to a Nasa study that charts the critical point beyond which a human body cannot survive and told me I was officially a dead man,\" said Zanardi, a two-times Champ Car racing champion who also drove for the Lotus Formula One team.</p> <p>The Bologna-born driver was determined to compete again the moment he woke from his coma. \"The first thing I asked myself was 'How am I going to do all the things I want to do with no legs?'\"</p> <p>Within nine months Zanardi was racing again, switching to the World Touring Car Championship and racking up wins.</p> <p>\"To drive the BMW 320 I convinced the team to create a special brake pedal that I could use with my prosthetic leg,\" he said. \"Having no legs doesn't mean you can't drive fast and I wasn't going to be happy scoring the odd point, I thought it was possible to win and went for it.\"</p> <p>Zanardi used his knowledge of racing car design to build his own prosthetic legs, even producing a special set to allow him to go swimming with his son. \"If you take your legs off to swim you enter the pool like a sack of potatoes, so I changed the knee joints to make them corrosion proof and coated the legs with the same natural-looking foam we line racing car fuel tanks with to stop the fuel moving around.\"</p> <p>Looking for new challenges, Zanardi discovered hand bikes, where the pedals are turned by hands, not feet, and he took fourth place in the hand bike section of the New York City Marathon in 2007 after training for just four weeks.</p> <p>Then, in 2009, he retired from car racing with the aim of making Italy's hand bike team for London 2012, last year winning the New York marathon at his fourth attempt, where he narrowly beat Poland's Rafal Wilk, a former speedway racer who lost his legs in an accident.</p> <p>Relying on his experience as a test driver and calling on the expertise of friends in the car racing business, Zanardi has built his bike from scratch, using the on-board monitors that are now common in the sport to download and analyse data from training sessions.</p> <p>\"It's not much different to Formula One where they are improving the cars constantly,\" he said. \"The difference is every hand biker needs a different bike depending on their residual ability,\" he said.</p> <p>Zanardi moulded a carbon-fibre seat to fit perfectly around his rear and what remains of his legs \"like a Cinderella shoe\", helping him reach sprint speeds of over 37mph in practice ahead of the Paralympics, where a 15.5km time trial and 64km road race will send riders around the Brands Hatch course and out on to open roads.</p> <p>Hand bikers will race in one of four categories determined by the extent of their disability. \"I am H4, able to use my back so I can lean forward and get my body weight behind the pedalling,\" Zanardi said. \"People who can't move their back will be H1 to H3, and ride in a reclined position. They cannot use their body weight but they do get an aerodynamic advantage which makes them more efficient on the flat.\"</p> <p>If Zanardi can win gold, it will be down to his grit and determination as much as his bike. \"My parents taught me that I could always improve on things,\" he said. \"After my crash I never doubted it would be hard but I would be lying to say this new life has been a surprise to me. I did it because I thought it was possible.</p> <p>\"If some people could fly, Usain Bolt would feel disabled,\" he said. \"Doing the best with what I have is the biggest challenge.\"</p> <p>In a twist of fate, Zanardi's older sister died in a car crash when he was a child, prompting his parents to attempt to keep the boy off the roads. \"Knowing I was passionate about engines they gave me a go-kart so that I could fulfil my desire for speed in a controlled environment,\" he said. \"And that is how I got started in racing.\"</p> <p>Laughing, he said: \"Now I know that if I break a leg, all I need is a five millimetre screw to fix it.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Johnnie Walker Championship was afforded a fitting winner, in more ways than one. The Gleneagles crowd toasted Scottish success as Paul Lawrie endorsed his fine season with a four-shot victory. Lawrie's second European Tour win of 2012 is also pertinent with matters of the Ryder Cup in mind.</p> <p>Nicolas Colsaerts arrived in Perthshire looking for the top-two spot that would have sealed a place in Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal's European team for the meeting with the United States next month. Colsaerts was unable to achieve that but is expected, along with Ian Poulter, to be afforded the salvation of a pick from Olaz\u00e1bal back at Gleneagles on Monday lunchtime.</p> <p>For Lawrie, there is no need for Olaz\u00e1bal's intervention. The 43-year-old's career has undergone such an impressive renaissance that he will be a key and experienced part of the Europe team at Medinah. Lawrie's last and only Ryder Cup appearance was in 1999.</p> <p>\"I'm going into this one as confident as I was last time, I can't wait,\" Lawrie said. \"It's difficult to rank wins but this is obviously a huge one. I go into my second Ryder Cup playing nicely, hitting it lovely and looking forward to it.\"</p> <p>Olaz\u00e1bal has plenty cause for optimism as Europe's defence of the Ryder Cup draws closer. Lawrie and Sergio Garc\u00eda now have winning form while Rory McIlroy cantered to a win in the US PGA Championship earlier this month. At Kiawah Island, Poulter and Justin Rose also finished prominently.</p> <p>Yet concern for Europe will emanate from the dismal touch of Martin Kaymer, who remains in the final automatic position. Olaz\u00e1bal will hope the Ryder Cup environment can somehow kickstart the talented German.</p> <p>\"Once you have played one Ryder Cup you never want to miss another one,\" said Kaymer, who opted to miss this Gleneagles tournament. \"To go to America and play for Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda's team is going to be an amazing experience.</p> <p>\"I have been struggling with my game for the last few months but since the US PGA I have made a lot of progress with my coach and had some really good sessions. I am starting to feel confident with what I am doing again.\"</p> <p>Colsaerts, who briefly raced to the top of the Johnnie Walker leaderboard on Thursday, carded a final round 72 to finish 10 adrift of Lawrie in a share of 19th place. His match-play qualities \u2013 Colsaerts defeated Graeme McDowell to win the Volvo World Match Play Championship in May \u2013 are key to the surprise that would surround his omission from Olaz\u00e1bal's team.</p> <p>\"It has just been exhausting, the last two months,\" Colsaerts said. \"Every week, I felt like I was just one round away from getting an automatic spot. I didn't think I was very lucky.</p> <p>\"I think I have done everything I could to put myself in position and unfortunately just came up short. But then nobody really made quite a statement as I made in the last couple of weeks by travelling so much, getting myself over here at the last minute and showing that I still had a game even though I wasn't really fresh mentally or physically.\"</p> <p>Rafa Cabrera-Bello threatened to hand Olaz\u00e1bal food for thought but slipped back in the field. \"I would be really happy if I got a phone call tomorrow morning but I don't know if that's going to happen or not,\" Cabrera-Bello said.</p> <p>Further cheer for Olaz\u00e1bal was provided by Italy's Francesco Molinari, who signed off at Gleneagles with a 67 for an aggregate of 10 under par.</p>",
  "<p>Many Brazilians watched the closing ceremony of the London Olympics with trepidation. \"Do you think we will be able to manage anything more than a couple of carnival floats, some football and traffic jams?\" mused one of my friends.</p> <p>It is a few years since I have heard such expressions of national self-doubt. When I first arrived in Brazil, almost 10 years ago, the country had just elected its first leftwing president, Luiz In\u00e1cio \"Lula\" da Silva. Both the currency and stock exchange were in freefall as investors took fright. There had been an attempted coup against Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela the previous year and the pride of my Brazilian friends \u2013 who were mainly members of Lula's Workers' party \u2013 was mixed with some anxiety.</p> <p>Lula's first term in office combined cautious economic orthodoxy and some important social reforms. The minimum wage was raised significantly and an innovative cash transfer programme called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/nov/19/brazil-cash-transfer-scheme?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Bolsa Fam\u00edlia</a> introduced for poor families. A start was also made in reforming the Brazilian justice system. At the same time the government kept an eye on public spending, ran a primary budget surplus and began to reduce the national debt. Inflation remained low, which preserved the value of its social programmes, and living standards rose. Brazil shrugged off the world financial crisis, which Lula famously blamed on blue-eyed bankers, and was able to credibly launch a countercyclical spending programme, while simultaneously becoming a creditor to the IMF. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/31/brazil-oil-war-on-poverty?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">discovery of a massive oil field off&#xa0;the coast of Rio de Janeiro</a> was followed by winning both the next World Cup and Olympic Games. Who could argue with Lula's triumphant declaration that \"God is Brazilian\"?</p> <p>These days that proposition may have fewer takers. Economic growth stalled last year, choked by a hugely overvalued currency. This year looks even worse, as export demand has been hit by the global recession. While the government's success in reducing its still astronomically high inequality was a spur to domestic demand, economic growth was underpinned by the export of primary commodities such as soya, coffee and iron ore. But this masked two weaknesses in the economy: a terrible infrastructure and a bureaucracy that is vast, crushing and quite often corrupt.</p> <p>Viewed from this perspective, Lula's presidency, which ended with stratospheric approval levels, does not seem quite so successful. Reforms petered out in his second term. Government spending continued to expand, but most went on increasing the size of the grossly inefficient state. His handpicked successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dilma-rousseff?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Dilma Rousseff</a>, is being forced to make some tough decisions that Lula ducked.</p> <p>Teachers at federal universities have been on strike for three months now and have recently been joined by nearly half the federal workforce. Striking police have blocked roads and worked to rule at airports, causing travel chaos. Much of the judiciary is also on strike, having not received a single pay increase for over five years, while inflation has been chipping away at the cost of living. The strikes are largely led by Workers' party-affiliated trade unions and president Rousseff's determination to face them down has caused dismay among many of her traditional supporters.</p> <p>At the same time the party's prestige has been badly hit as the trial finally takes place of most of its previous leadership in relation to a corruption scandal that badly damaged Lula's first term. The supreme court is currently hearing allegations that the party siphoned money from state-owned enterprises to buy the votes of opposition members of congress, through a process that became known as the \"big monthly payment\" (mensal\u00e3o). Such practices may have been used by some of the party's opponents previously, but they fatally damaged its reputation as a \"clean-hands\" party.</p> <p>To her credit, Rousseff has taken a strong stand against corruption, dismissing a clutch of ministers from the Lula era who were facing accusations. This has won her support across the political spectrum and she may also gain credibility for her determination to restore some discipline to public finances. However, with no overall majority in parliament and growing opposition within her own party, facing down the corporate state will be a big challenge.</p> <p>Brazil is conscious that the eyes of the world will focus on its handling of the Olympics. As Rio's mayor, Eduardo Paes, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21560568\">put it when interviewed by the Economist</a>: \"For 30 years the only news on the BBC about Rio was violence. Now&#xa0;they are showing other things. There will be criticisms, but the city's image is being transformed.\" This will certainly be true if it can rise to the challenge. But, as Brazilians often joke, their country has a bright future ahead of it: and always will have.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 August 2012, crediting to an Economist interview a quote by Eduardo Paes</p>",
  "<p>With a repertoire that includes a Hairy Bikers chef, a boxing champion and Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead, Lucy Evans is a woman of many faces. The former trainee nurse goes by the stage name <a href=\"http://www.pixietruffle.com/\" title=\"\">Pixie Truffle</a> and is spearheading a thriving scene of colourful male impersonators in Manchester, fast emerging as the UK's drag king capital.</p> <p>Truffle believes drag kings could take female standup to the next level. \"I certainly think it's a way for women to breach the gender imbalance,\" says the 42-year-old founder of burlesque group Lesburlesque. \"A lot of female standups have relied on cakes, tampons, body image and the sexual inadequacies of men to express their comedy. I personally find this a bit wearisome.\"</p> <p>Female drag artists are playing a major role in this year's <a href=\"http://www.manchesterpride.com/\" title=\"\">Manchester Pride</a>, an annual festival for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, with a Drag King and Drag Queen competition taking place in the city's Sackville Gardens on Monday. \"The lesbian community is often mischaracterised as man-haters, when many of us actually feel a high regard for masculinity,\" says Truffle. \"The essence of drag-kinging is the diminution of femininity but it works so much better if a trace of womanhood is left behind. Just enough to see behind the disguise.\"</p> <p>Gizell Timpani, 47, who dons a tuxedo, top hat and goatee to perform as <a href=\"http://www.valentinoking.net/home-page#!__home-page\" title=\"\">Valentino King</a>, is also perfoming at Manchester Pride and is named as a role model and inspiration for many male impersonators. She cites Lady Gaga's adoption of <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-as-jo-calderone-britney-spears-is-hot-20110829\" title=\"\">male alter ego Jo Calderone</a> as a defining moment in bringing drag kings into the mainstream, and estimates there are 80-90 in Manchester. \"Some are performers, some like to cross-dress and can't do it at home,\" she says. \"They haven't got the confidence to perform as females; they are more successful as males in social environments and on stage.\"</p> <p>It's a view echoed by Lenna Cumberbatch, a 36-year-old Londoner who performs as used-car salesman Uncle Lenny and smooth operator Leon Daluva. She runs an annual drag-king competition called <a href=\"http://www.kotcdragking.com/about/\" title=\"\">King of the Castle</a>, hosted by Fiona King, AKA wheelchair-using soul legend Stevie Wonderful. \"You feel different in drag, some ownership,\" says Cumberbatch. \"Female comedians have problems getting into the same spaces as men. Male comics make money out of rape jokes; that's the environment we have to live in. But the best drag queens celebrate feminity, not mock it, and it's the same with drag kings.\"</p>",
  "<p>Walking on to a film set for the first time is always dislocating. You cross a boundary between a commonplace reality and a tight, compacted fictional space. It's a shock, like discovering a diamond in a lump of coal, or a woman on Mock the Week, or a Lib Dem canvasser on your doorstep.</p> <p>When the new series of The Thick of It was shot earlier this year, the wobbling stargate between ordinary space and the claustrophobic world of contemporary politics felt even more dramatic somehow. Production designer Simon Rogers and his team had conjured up the airless, gothic hellhole that is the opposition's headquarters within a blameless country house near Ruislip. You ascended a real, ancient staircase into a recreation of Labour's Victorian gloom-tank on Victoria Embankment. Suddenly that look of abandoned hope that seems to haunt Team Miliband made more sense. If a shadow cabinet meeting overruns they must all be on suicide watch. In the parallel telly universe it certainly doesn't improve the mood of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjAyazqtQj8\" title=\"\">Malcolm Tucker</a>.</p> <p>The show's coalition government ensemble inhabit a lighter, modern environment. But here the contrast between the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship set and its immediate environment was even more striking. The location was an amazing disused office slab in Walton-on Thames, half a century old, designed by architects Sir John Burnet, Tait and Partners in the \"Thunderbirds Modernism\" style. These days, a Ballardian wilderness hides the swinging 60s abstract sculpture and formal gardens, but the groovy aluminium facade still looks pristine. It's a lovely, long building, each floor a prairie of open space. The DoSAC set was hunched into a corner.</p> <p>On the \"real life\" side of the boundary, the space seemed fantastical, an optimistic dream world. There they'd have been, all those space-age ghosts. Doing the twist at the Christmas do, going on the pill, smoking pipes indoors, talking Tupperware, planning a holiday abroad. Everything was possible. Then you walked over the threshold of cables into the unreality of DoSAC. And you were plunged into this overcrowded rat cage, with fictional squabbling venal bastards at one another's throats in a grotesque travesty of consensus politics. And it felt as though this was the true space, this was the genuine reality. Here's Peter Mannion, the latest secretary of state, as beleaguered as the last. Mournfully, desperately looking for a corner to hide in, beset by civil servants, spads, his snarling coalition partners, the press. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZZYctmYfU\" title=\"\">And party strategist Stewart Pearson's fearsome shirts</a>.</p> <p>Uncomfortable space has been a tonal constant in Thick since 2005. As in real life, where we've watched successive administrations run out of money and credibility, so we've seen the characters in the show flail and suffocate in their analogue world of diminishing opportunity. Policy-making is reactive and panicky, expedient and reversible. Those notionally in power are choking under a brutal scrutiny.</p> <p>Small BBC budgets, of course, helped shape the spaces. Director Armando Iannucci and producer Adam Tandy have always improvised locations. The first series (now nailed historically by computer monitors the size of packing crates) was shot in a former brewery. A lot of bollocking and hiding takes places behind closed doors. We see hapless minister Hugh Abbott, played by the brilliant Chris Langham, eating biscuits in a pantry. Or tracked down by Tucker to his forlorn hiding place in a chair storeroom. At one point in the scene, Abbott even puts his head inside a cupboard.</p> <p>And series one established the classic Iannucci \"back seat of the car\" shot. Ministers and aides wedged in like terrified backbenchers under a three-line whip, desperately trying to pull soundbites out of thin air. It's a motif that continues into series four with an incredibly bad-tempered row between Mannion and his colleagues about how best to appear publicly concerned over something he didn't give a shit about half an hour earlier.</p> <p>In series two, largely shot in the BBC's own hideous media centre, DoSAC became part of a \"ministerial hub\". The characters were now spatially, literally in transparent government. Glass walls and clear sightlines through the communal open-plan office made it harder to hide from Tucker. Actually, the most farcical element of the building \u2013 a huge, overscaled staircase that has the effect of shrinking everyone on it to the size of a child \u2013 came into its own in series three. New minister Nicola Murray had to use the stairs because she had a fear of confined spaces and famously (\"See you, you're an omnishambles\") couldn't get in a lift. In the new series, Murray has a meltdown in an inter-city train vestibule. It's funny, but also almost unbearable to watch as the peerless Rebecca Front, who has publicly and bravely talked about claustrophobia, channels her own anxiety.</p> <p>In the past we've seen <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ioziwB9uQ\" title=\"\">Olly Reeder cornered by Tucker in a toilet,</a> John Duggan terrorised by Tucker in a bathroom, Glen Cullen assaulted by Tucker in a narrow hotel corridor. Nicola and Mannion and Richard Bacon in the radio studio, while the control booth teems with advisers. And this theme \u2013 lack of space, no room for manoeuvre \u2013 flows through the new series, perhaps most strikingly in the public inquiry scenes. Trapped in the witness chair, caught in the gaze of TV cameras, at the mercy of harsh inquisitors, our characters are in a familiar crisis.</p> <p>They've run out of time, and out of space.</p> <p><em>Ian Martin is a writer for The Thick of It.</em></p>",
  "<p>It may sometimes be tempting to dismiss the Conservatives in Britain as, at heart and in gut, a radical, government slashing, tax cutting, culturally reactionary party committed to dismantling everything about the welfare state and the social market. There are certainly some Tories who flirt, and more, with such ideas, though most of them don't have much influence in government. But in most of the party, sometimes uneasily, these impulses are held in check, especially at the top, by overwhelming political and economic realities.</p> <p>If, though, you want to see a party that really is all these things and proud of it, look across the ocean to the US Republicans, <a href=\"http://www.gopconvention2012.com/\" title=\"\">who meet in Tampa this week</a>, tropical storms permitting, to endorse Mitt Romney as their challenger to Barack Obama in November. If it's radical rightwing politics you want, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/25/republican-convention-romney-radical-right?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the Republicans of the post-Tea Party era</a> embody them. Politically speaking, it's a different world.</p> <p>Going into their 2012 convention, the Republicans are a party in which there is no significant internal division over the claim that taxes must be slashed, that all government programmes other than defence must be cut, that the government economic stimulus should be undone, the federal pension system privatised, the federal healthcare insurance law abolished, that climate change is a hoax, that a high wall should be built along America's southern border, that abortion in all but the tiniest exceptions should be a crime, that gun control laws are a threat to freedom, that civil partnerships and gay marriage should be outlawed, that Iran's nuclear programme should be destroyed and more Jewish settlements encouraged in the occupied Palestinian territories. Oh, and a lot of them still think Mr Obama isn't really an American too, while Mr Romney is a member of a church that believes Jesus travelled to America.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/08/27/120827taco_talk_cassidy\" title=\"\">How far Mr Romney himself really believes many of these things</a> may still, on some level, be an unknown. One of the important questions of the week will be the precise positions he stakes out on these and other crucial questions when he accepts the nomination on Thursday. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21560864\" title=\"\">While he was governor of Massachusetts</a> \u2013 less than 10 years ago \u2013 he supported abortion, gun control, health insurance and tackling climate change. Now he opposes them. In the recent past, Mr Romney has tried to present himself as a successful practical businessman who can get the American economy moving. But the reality now is that he has embraced his party's radical right, especially by nominating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/15/paul-ryan-paradox-us-politics\" title=\"\">Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running-mate</a>.</p> <p>Barring any surprise disclaimers this week, this embrace shows just how wide the political ocean separating America from Europe now is. The gulf has long been obvious on issues such as climate change, gay equality, the death penalty and abortion. Now, though, it seems just as wide on economic policy too. Both Mr Romney and Mr Ryan, like all European politicians of the right, and many of the left too, claim to be in favour of cutting their government deficits. But it's only the Republicans who propose to slash every bit of government spending except for defence. And it's only the Republicans who not only refuse to even consider raising taxes (which are comparatively extremely low) to balance the budget, but who also want to cut those taxes further across the board. Mr Ryan wants a tax system with just two bands, 10% and 25%, and would abolish most of the meagre taxes on things like dividends, capital gains and inheritance <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/colbert-king-time-for-mitt-romney-to-come-clean-on-his-taxes/2012/08/24/0a2ddb4c-ee0b-11e1-b0eb-dac6b50187ad_story.html\" title=\"\">which are almost the only ones</a> that people like Mr Romney (who paid 13.9% of his multimillion-dollar income in taxes in 2010) actually pay.</p> <p>In the global financial crisis, all incumbents are unusually vulnerable. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">Mr Obama's poll lead is narrow, too</a>.

  "<p>Leading water scientists have issued one of the sternest warnings yet about global food supplies, saying that the world's population may have to switch almost completely to a vegetarian diet over the next 40 years to avoid catastrophic shortages.</p> <p>Humans derive about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to drop to just 5% to feed the extra 2 billion people expected to be alive by 2050, <a href=\"http://www.siwi.org/sa/node.asp?node=52&amp;sa_content_url=%2Fplugins%2FResources%2Fresource.asp&amp;id=318\" title=\"\">according to research</a> by some of the world's leading water scientists.</p> <p>\"There will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food for the expected 9 billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,\" the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) said.</p> <p>\"There will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories and considerable regional water deficits can be met by a \u2026 reliable system of food trade.\"</p> <p>Dire warnings of water scarcity limiting food production come as Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. Prices for staples such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since June, triggered by severe droughts in the US and Russia, and weak monsoon rains in Asia. More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel.</p> <p>Oxfam has forecast that the price spike will have a devastating impact in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East. Food shortages in 2008 led to civil unrest in 28 countries.</p> <p>Adopting a vegetarian diet is one option to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in an increasingly climate-erratic world, the scientists said. Animal protein-rich food consumes five to 10 times more water than a vegetarian diet. One third of the world's arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals. Other options to feed people include eliminating waste and increasing trade between countries in food surplus and those in deficit.</p> <p>\"Nine hundred million people already go hungry and 2 billion people are malnourished in spite of the fact that per capita food production continues to increase,\" they said. \"With 70% of all available water being in agriculture, growing more food to feed an additional 2 billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on available water and land.\"</p> <p>The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm, Sweden, where 2,500 politicians, UN bodies, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to address global water supply problems.</p> <p>Competition for water between food production and other uses will intensify pressure on essential resources, the scientists said. \"The UN predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. This will place additional pressure on our already stressed water resources, at a time when we also need to allocate more water to satisfy global energy demand \u2013 which is expected to rise 60% over the coming 30 years \u2013 and to generate electricity for the 1.3 billion people currently without it,\" said the report.</p> <p>Overeating, undernourishment and waste are all on the rise and increased food production may face future constraints from water scarcity.</p> <p>\"We will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,\" said the report's editor, Anders J\u00e4gerskog.</p> <p>A separate report from the <a href=\"http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/SWW2012/\" title=\"\">International Water Management Institute</a> (IWMI) said the best way for countries to protect millions of farmers from food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia was to help them invest in small pumps and simple technology, rather than to develop expensive, large-scale irrigation projects.</p> <p>\"We've witnessed again and again what happens to the world's poor \u2013 the majority of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and already suffer from water scarcity \u2013 when they are at the mercy of our fragile global food system,\" said Dr Colin Chartres, the director general.</p> <p>\"Farmers across the developing world are increasingly relying on and benefiting from small-scale, locally-relevant water solutions. [These] techniques could increase yields up to 300% and add tens of billions of US dollars to household revenues across sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"They're either celebrating their good results, or they've abandoned life because of their bad results,\" says Jack Steadman from Bombay Bicycle Club, taking refuge from Reading 2012's torrent of teenage kicks in the press tent on Friday afternoon. \"Either way, they're gonna be wild.\"</p> <p>Reading is definitely getting an A* in Having It. When Serge Pizzorno from Kasabian demands everyone \"from the front to the back\" jumps in the air during Vlad the Impaler, he damn well gets it. The buzzing flood of teens racing from a frenzied Azealia Banks set to Florence and the Machine's main stage wailathon on Saturday afternoon is terrifying to be caught up in, and Florence herself admires the daredevil nature of her audience. \"What an amazing crowd!\" she coos, as another human pyramid throws its uppermost person into the air in a bout of Cirque du Soleil mate-flinging. \"You're full of acrobats!\"</p> <p>Even Bombay Bicycle Club themselves \u2013 despite not getting the circle pit they'd hoped for after watching Cancer Bats earlier that day \u2013 are welcomed like homecoming heroes on Friday afternoon, and with good reason. Accompanied by Lucy Rose, fresh from melting the metal-hardened heart of the Festival Republic stage with her Regina-lite folk, they conjure a form of refined, sophisticated funk-pop that's the polar opposite of landfill indie (Olympus indie, anyone?). Even though, at times, their math-rock fretwork seems so airy it's like they're trying to float the entire main stage away, like in Pixar's Up.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Reading is a worthy match for its audience's mania. Alt-J are Friday's clearest vision of rock future, melding hints of the xx, Two Door Cinema Club, Vampire Weekend, Foals and Stornoway into a hazy dopamine stew. If there's a sound for DNA strands linking or a cosmos developing its physical laws, Alt-J make it. They're drawing a cult-like crowd, too, their delta sign scrawled on foreheads and flashed by raised hands.</p> <p>Across the field \u2013 and the punk-rock divide \u2013 Graham Coxon is shouting, \"Everything up! Louder!\", like a man who's learned his lesson from Blur's inaudible Hyde Park swansong. He charges through the gritty garage punk of his new album A+E as if auditioning for At the Drive-In. Now officially better than Blur, Coxon delivers the North/South battle anthem Running for Your Life and the motorik threat of City Hall with passion, punch and not a little wit. \"You're at Reading, yeah?\" he says awkwardly, throwing a thumb towards the wings. \"He said I'd get cheers if I say stuff like that.\"</p> <p>Robert Smith could take lessons in crowdpleasing from Coxo. Stuffing the Cure's usual three-hour-plus set into a meagre 180 minutes, he cuts the between-song chat and piles into an opening hour of pure magic: some of their greatest post-80s atmosphere pieces (The End of the World, High, Open) warming up for a magnificent run of singles that few modern bands can match: Lullaby, Lovesong, In Between Days, The Walk, Pictures of You, The Caterpillar, Just Like Heaven. Having roused Reading to a pop peak with Friday, I'm In Love, however, Smith then virtually abandons the favourites altogether for another hour, thinning the crowd considerably with lengthy churn-und-groan indulgences like The Hungry Ghost and proto-goth tracks One Hundred Years, Primary and Play for Today. Perhaps they've signed some kind of audience donation deal with tonight's other headliners the Maccabees, but it's a sparse field indeed that's rewarded with an encore including Close to Me, The Lovecats, Why Can't I Be You and Boys Don't Cry. As Smith would no doubt argue, The Cure aren't a band solely for the casual festival hit-seeker \u2013 you must suffer for their art.</p> <p>Neither, it turns out, are Green Day, who do their damndest to avoid anyone seeing their \"secret\" NME/Radio 1 stage set on Saturday morning. They fail obviously: enough word gets around that their stage time has shifted forward an hour to 11am to ram the tent way past capacity and force the whole area to be cordoned off, with this blogger on the wrong side of the wire. We did, however, catch the admirable antics of Odd Future, rocking themselves up for the occasion by inviting Trash Talk on stage to grunt Radicals along with them and having their set inexplicably cut short. This was possibly something to do with demanding a stage invasion, antagonising security and miming what the tabloids call \"sex acts\" at them.</p> <p>Traditionally, Saturday is the day Reading syndrome strikes. The Shins' cuddly collegiate balladry and gentle Caribbean rock-outs are enlivened by a bunch of muscle men exercising by the sound desk, the mosh-pit politely running in circles and a string of bearded men dressed as Florence Welch traversing the crowd guided by a train of all-girl Mexican bandidos. A horde of nuns descend upon the Festival Republic stage to watch Jake Bugg enchant a packed tent with his nasal twang through That Beer-Ad Tune (ie Country Song). Santigold gets wholeheartedly into the spirit by dashing through Say Aha in a luminous green dress and eye-test glasses, like some sort of short-sighted personification of absinthe. And is that a punter dressed as Rasputin invading the NME/Radio 1 stage to pummel out synth-pop crescendos that sound like cymbal factories exploding? Oh no, that's the rather marvellous Miike \"Superfluous Vowel\" Snow.</p> <p>Early evening finds the Vaccines continuing their global mission to play every festival on Earth. Despite the anti-fame themes of some songs from their Strokesier new album Coming of Age (No Hope, Teenage Icon), they've become something of a festival mainstay, a regular rod around which the revelry revolves. Several people have worn wetsuits all day purely for the moment they can be hoisted aloft in celebration of the song of the same name, and there's some heroic bursts of crowd nudity during Blow It Up. One man stands starkers on his friend's shoulders in order to tackle-flash the overhead camera. Or perhaps he's just come dressed as Prince Harry.</p> <p>Those wetsuits soon come in handy. Florence and the Machine's worthy witchy warbling summons down a torrential deluge for their set. As much as Welch tries to embrace the elements to keep the mood up \u2013 and as great the relief is that, with two albums to draw from now, she no longer has to drag Dog Days Are Over out to half an hour, twice \u2013 her brand of padded-out harpy histrionics just isn't something to stand in drizzle to. Not when the Cribs are having a tent party up the back of the field, banging through Hey Scenesters!, Men's Needs and an ecstatic Be Safe to a tent busy dancing itself dry.</p> <p>On our way back to the main stage, we're drawn in by Katy B on the Dance stage claiming she's written a song about festivals. \"I love that you can look at the person next to you and feel the same emotion \u2013 everybody put your hand in the air and we can all feel the same emotion!\" I put my hand in the air. I look at the person next to me; they're feeling the same emotion alright \u2013 a vague why-have-I-got-my-hand-in-the-air? sort of feeling. We take our hands out of the air and go watch Kasabian.</p> <p>Kasabian, in accepted festival parlance, could be said to \"kill it\". With Tom Meighan strutting cockily about the stage in a skeleton T-shirt and Serge done up like a kung-fu shaman in black bandana and mystic's necklace, they achieve the very modernist feat of playing lad-friendly arena rock that still somehow manages to retain the boggle of Ibiza. Their songs traverse many genres (glam on Shoot the Runner, tex-mex mariachi on Let's Roll Just Like We Used To, space opera on I.D., skipping-rope pop on the brilliant Velociraptor!), but are never too far from a death-ray synth or a Balearic beat.</p> <p>There are minor signs of their callowness as festival headliners \u2013 Tom puts on a comedy American rock-star accent throughout and comes out with some hilarious crowd-rousing banter \u2013 \"Put your hands in the fucking heaven! Twat!\" \u2013 while Serge indulges in some Freddie Mercury dee-da-daaay-yos. But by throwing in snippets of the ET and Clockwork Orange themes, Iggy Pop's I Wanna Be Your Dog, The Prodigy's Fire, a full version of Fatboy Slim's Praise You and Tom's final a capella version of the Beatles' She Loves You as the band leave the stage, Kasabian keep the fun factor in the red. \"Smile!\" yelps a passing she-bear, with a bad case of Reading syndrome, hugging the Guardian as she passes, \"it's a beautiful day!\" Good point, Yogi.</p>",
  "<p>The Scottish government has been urged to stand firm over its plans to legalise same-sex marriage and not be derailed by an \"anti-gay agenda\", as the Catholic church in Scotland launched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/26/scottish-catholics-campaign-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">a campaign to maintain \"the universally accepted definition of marriage\" as a union between a man and a woman</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scmo.org/articles/cardinal-obrien-calls-on-politicians-to--sustain-rather-than-subvert-marriage.html\" title=\"\">In a letter</a> read out in all 500 of the church's parishes, Scotland's Catholic bishops expressed their \"deep disappointment\" that Alex Salmond's administration has vowed to pass legislation that could see the first gay marriage ceremonies by 2015. The letter called on worshippers to pray for their political leaders so that they may preserve the traditional nature of marriage \"for the good of Scotland and of our society\".</p> <p>Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the leader of the country's Catholic church, who last weekend <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19305232\" title=\"\">broke off direct talks</a> with the Scottish government on gay marriage, said: \"The church's teaching on marriage is unequivocal, it is uniquely the union of a man and a woman and it is wrong that governments, politicians or parliaments should seek to alter or destroy that reality.\" He added: \"While we pray that our elected leaders will sustain rather than subvert marriage, we promise to continue to do everything we can to convince them that redefining marriage would be wrong for society.\"</p> <p>Gay rights activists condemned the move. \"It is increasingly clear that the church has an anti-gay agenda that it wants to impose on the rest of society,\" said Tom French, policy co-ordinator of the Equality Network. \"We urge the Scottish government to stand firm on plans to introduce equal marriage and not give in to demands that would discriminate against LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people.\"</p> <p>Particularly worrying, said French, was any suggestion that the Catholic church would take the fight into schools. According to the bishops' letter, a National Commission for Marriage and the Family will be launched, which would be especially important for young people and children. O'Brien said the body would \"develop an online presence and produce materials and organise events\" to promote the cause.</p> <p>French said the Equality Network would be \"deeply concerned\" by any attempt to take these activities into schools. \"School should be a welcoming environment for all young people, regardless of their sexual orientation or their family situation,\" he said.</p> <p>In the face of intense pressure from not only the Catholic church but also Muslim&#xa0;organisations and evangelical and presbyterian churches, the Scottish government has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/25/scotland-legalise-same-sex-marriage\" title=\"\">continued with its plan</a> to legalise gay marriage. A draft bill is to be published later this year.</p> <p>Opinion polls have shown that about two-thirds of Scots are in favour of the changes.</p> <p>The government has insisted that no clergy would be forced to carry out same-sex weddings and has included new protections and \"conscience clauses\" for churches and individual clergy in the legislation. This has not, however, succeeded in placating opponents, foremost among them O'Brien, who in March drew criticism when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17249099\" title=\"\">describing gay marriage</a> as a \"grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right\".</p> <p>In the letter to followers on what was declared \"national marriage Sunday\", the bishops said: \"We write to you having already expressed our deep disappointment that the Scottish government has decided to redefine marriage and legislate for same-sex marriage. We take this opportunity to thank you for your past support in defence of marriage and hope you will continue to act against efforts to redefine it. We reaffirm before you all the common wisdom of humanity and the revealed faith of the church that marriage is a unique lifelong union of a man and a woman.\"</p> <p>It added: \"The bishops of Scotland will continue to promote and uphold the universally accepted definition of marriage as the union solely of a man and a woman.\"</p>",
  "<p>The last time a British prime minister endorsed an American president's plans for military intervention, it resulted in the US invasion of Iraq \u2013 one of the worst foreign policy blunders in recent American history.</p> <p>That is why last week's endorsement by David Cameron of a warning by Barack Obama that even the threat of chemical weapons by Syria could trigger a military intervention should be viewed with alarm on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>There is something in the psyche of Americans that gives British views on foreign policy more credit than they deserve. If the Brits say it is so, it must be so is the common reaction of many Americans to pronouncements by British leaders. Americans are inclined to believe their friends across the Atlantic, given their centuries of involvement with countries around the world, have acquired skills to deal with foreign policy issues that Americans \u2013 with barely a century of global domination \u2013 simply do not possess. This is simply not true.</p> <p>While there may be some truth to this belief in British prowess in dealing with other countries, there is an overriding reason to not give British support too much credence: The UK's support is rarely based on facts on the ground and objective analysis. It is driven instead by a self-serving exaggerated view of the \"special relationship\" with the United States.</p> <p>I have always believed that former President Bush would have had a very difficult time selling his unilateral invasion of Iraq to Americans had Prime Minister Blair refused to support American military plans.</p> <p>Why then would Britain, America's closest ally, the co-inventor of modern Iraq, with intimate knowledge of, and deep historical ties to, the Middle East, and with its powerful understanding of Arabs and Islam, not have influenced its American ally's actions more wisely?</p> <p>Dean Acheson, one of America's most gifted Secretaries of State, would have had a ready explanation for why it was not in Britain's best interest to oppose the United States' plans to invade Iraq.</p> <p>Addressing a student conference at the US military academy, West Point, in 1962, he presciently said, \"Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role. The attempt to play a separate power role, that is, a role apart from Europe, a role based primarily on a 'special relationship' with the United States \u2026 is about played out.\"</p> <p>The American invasion of Iraq destroyed the delicate balance of power relationships involving Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Sunni, Shia, and Kurd. A balance that Iraq's ruthless dictator had maintained for years.</p> <p>A precipitate collapse of the Assad regime in Syria would magnify this instability in the heart of the Middle East by, for instance, encouraging a push by Syrian Kurds for an independent Kurdish State \u2013 the worst nightmare of Turkey, one of America's closest allies in the Middle East. That is why Turkey, the country most affected by the mayhem in Syria (over 200,000 refugees have crossed into it for safety), is politically divided about militarily intervening in Syria.</p> <p>And, American military involvement in Syria, would further damage the relationship between the United States and Russia, Syria's benefactor. That would doom American and Nato plans to remove US troops and material from the war in Afghanistan through Central Asia and Russia; leaving Pakistan as the only route out of the Afghan quagmire. Is that in American national interest?</p> <p>If Britain wants to help re-engineer Syria, a country it helped to invent in the first place, it should be free to do so. But Americans would be wise to make it clear to their elected officials that they have no wish to intervene on one side of a civil war. America has other priorities for its blood and treasure, and they do not include another war in the Middle East.</p> <p>In this closely fought US presidential election season when President Obama is being hammered by conservatives to act militarily in Syria, what the world did not need is a public declaration of UK support for US military intervention in Syria. The US has been down this road before, in Iraq. Does anyone really want to repeat that movie?</p>",
  "<p>It takes Ian McEwan all of 23 words \u2013 three lines \u2013 to introduce into his new novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780224097376/sweet-tooth\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a> the word \"British\" . On that opening page, though, come other words and phrases: \"Anglican bishop\"; \"Queen Anne house\"; \"ancient herbaceous borders\". Both house and borders, we are told, sit in \"the cathedral precinct of a charming small city in the east of England\". Immediately we are in a world with which we might not be personally familiar but one that we nevertheless know to exist: that of provincial England and the respectable, God-fearing middle class that forms some of its inhabitants.</p> <p>It is not, to state the obvious, the world of Irvine Welsh's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780224087902/skagboys\" title=\"\"><em>Skagboys</em></a>, another of the \"big\" novels published this year. But neither would McEwan \u2013 nor Welsh, one imagines \u2013 expect or want it to be.</p> <p>Last week, in an interview with Scottish first minister Alex Salmond at the Edinburgh international book festival, McEwan made clear his views on the concept of Britishness as it applies to the business of writing fiction: <em>it doesn't exist</em>.</p> <p>English and Scottish writers, he maintained, are distinct from one another; their literary cultures have survived the Act of Union. And what's more, he continued, the novel draws its power from precisely that specific cultural and national experience. It is his suspicion, said McEwan, that \"all novels are provincial, and all the great novels are very rooted in a particular time and place\".</p> <p>I think he's exactly right, but one can also go further. A novel, or a short story, is not a documentary, nor a work of historical record; a writer who describes a cherry tree on the corner of a street in Basingstoke is not required to escort his or her readers there to prove that it actually exists.</p> <p>What fiction requires \u2013 to convince, to move, to be great \u2013 is that it explores the relationship between the individual and their environment, their culture, their history.</p> <p>McEwan's novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099507383/atonement\" title=\"\"><em>Atonement</em></a>, for example, is probably his most popular.&#xa0;Its country house setting could not be more evocative of a particular kind of Englishness; but McEwan also suggests that it is a setting we know through our literature, from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Richardson\" title=\"\">Samuel Richardson</a> and Jane Austen to LP Hartley and Evelyn Waugh and Agatha Christie. That <em>Atonement</em> gradually unfolds itself as a story within a story, where the lines between fiction and fact blur, neatly underlines his point.</p> <p>But this is not about Englishness, or Scottishness, or Britishness. Last week, at a live event, I interviewed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/08/news.pulitzerprize\" title=\"\">Junot Diaz</a>, the novelist and short story writer who was born in the Dominican Republic, emigrated to New Jersey as a child&#xa0;and has subsequently described that experience in all its bewildering complexity.</p> <p>An extraordinarily charismatic speaker, he held his audience spellbound, not least when he described the power of writing to make sense of our messy lives. The literature of his country is still recovering from the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13560512\" title=\"\">Rafael Trujillo</a> dictatorship; what&#xa0;people need, in art, he argued fiercely, are choices. A choice of what to read, of how to see the world, of how to think. What fiction \u2013 itself the art of subjectivity \u2013 can do is to provide a space for those choices to flourish and to multiply.</p>",
  "<p>The past weeks have been ones of fiercely polarised debate on a number of issues. They have raged around the war in Syria, the case of Julian Assange, in particular, and the issue of rape more generally. The arguments have been widespread, fragmented and&#xa0;bitter.</p> <p>There has been another story, underpinning all of these, which in the past few days has begun to push to the forefront. It is not about the rights and wrongs of these individual stories and how they have been described in the media. Instead, it's about the very question of how such issues are actually debated in the internet age.</p> <p>In the midst of a global recession and increasing distrust of both politics and the media, public conversation in western countries is already in the process of becoming more extreme and angry. Others have noted how, in the UK, old unwritten rules have come to be influenced by exposure to the more brawling style of the US. But the change in how we talk among ourselves has also been shaped by the constraints and opportunities afforded by the online world.</p> <p>It's a subject that was broached last week by the author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/patrick-ness\" title=\"\">Patrick Ness</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh world writers' conference</a>. There, Ness asked whether \"instead of bringing us all together in an omnipresent, multifaceted discussion, the internet instead has made sectarianism an almost default position\".</p> <p>It has not only been Ness. Two journalists from opposing sides of the political spectrum \u2013 Suzanne Moore and Peter Hitchens \u2013 were next to weigh in. They asked whether social media sites such as Twitter, far from encouraging debate, in fact did the opposite and acted as an \"echo chamber\" confirming our views.</p> <p>The questions now being asked are counter-intuitive. The internet, it was once claimed by theorists such as Clay Shirky, author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780141030623/here-comes-everybody-how-change-happens-when-people-come-together\" title=\"\"><em>Here Comes Everybody</em></a>, was supposed to be democratising and empowering, giving a voice to those marginalised by the elite of opinion formers dominating the media and politics.</p> <p>These days, even Shirky has moved to distance himself from that earlier utopian idealism, telling Journalism.co.uk three years ago he feared that he, like others, had got it wrong and that public pressure via the internet, far from leading to \"democratic legitimation\", could be seen as \"just&#xa0;another implementation layer for special interest&#xa0;groups\".</p> <p>All of which leads to an inevitable question \u2013 whether our new developing public discourse, largely mediated online, has made our conversation more open, democratic and accountable? Or, instead, more fragmented and poisonous?</p> <p>Among the pessimists has been the US academic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Sunstein\" title=\"\">Cass Sunstein</a>, who was early in proposing a more dystopian picture of how debate was being shaped online, noting a fundamental contradiction. \"New technologies,\" Sunstein has suggested, \"including the internet, make it easier for people to hear the opinions of like-minded but otherwise isolated others.\"</p> <p>He noted that while the internet was efficient in bringing together virtual communities of interest, it also encouraged participants \"to isolate themselves from competing views... [creating a] breeding ground for polarisation, potentially dangerous for both democracy and social peace\".</p> <p>In other words, virtual communities, unlike physical communities that are under constant pressure to compromise, are at risk of a tendency to organise around confirmatory bias. A tendency that, as neuroscientific research by Daniel Kahneman and others has argued, makes us confuse emotion for rational thought.</p> <p>Intriguingly, too, it has emerged that far from the structure of the internet imposing a new egalitarianism across the political spectrum, the opposite may be happening. Political blogs tend to conform \u2013 in how they encourage participation and debate \u2013 to the underlying political viewpoint they reflect.</p> <p>As Yochai Benkler and Aaron Shaw of Harvard University discovered in a survey of <a href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/04/11/which-way-does-your-blog-lean/\" title=\"\">155 US political blogs</a>, rightwing blogs were more likely to be hierarchical and individualistic, shorter and less likely to link to other sources, with only about 13% encouraging participation. Conversely, on the left, 40% of blogs had \"adopted platforms with enhanced user participation features\".</p> <p>Then there is the way that people actually behave online and why. A fascinating piece of research by Kristy Beers F\u00e4gersten into how users conducted themselves on hip-hop bulletin boards described behaviour that is familiar to anyone who has spent much time online. The purpose of participation, she observed, was seen in the \"clear tendency among contributors to use first-person pronouns in their postings\u2026 to assert their identities, express opinions and state self-serving purposes\".</p> <p>If there is a danger in all this, it is one, perhaps, that has been exacerbated by the mainstream media as they have tried to adapt to the new online reality and incorporate the popular principle of wider participation into their debates.</p> <p>Because of the measures of success in the new online world, including how many comments are attracted and the number of page views, it has been inevitable, some argue, that the loudest and most partisan voices seem attractive. Which leaves a burning question unanswered. How to quantify what all this means for those engaging in public debate, including bloggers, writers, journalists and commenters.</p> <p>Part of Patrick Ness's argument was that the often brutal nature of the online world has started to impose a culture of self-censorship as some have sought to avoid inevitable flame wars. Other writers have remarked the opposite to me, describing how, in reviewing his writing, he had gradually used fewer qualification in his arguments.</p> <p>There is a final issue, too familiar from my experience, that is a very natural desire when the language of debate is so toxic and aggressive \u2013 to avoid or disengage from all those places where one is likely to encounter abusive remarks, even if that abuse is motivated by a genuine passion. All of which leads to the most difficult question. How do those media organisations fashion a retooling of the online environment and, indeed, is it desirable?</p> <p>That would require dealing with a host of difficult issues, including the value of anonymity and how to \"moderate\" online conversation.</p> <p>In the end, perhaps the best that we can do is repeat what Shirky said three years ago. \"It is democracy in action, at such a young stage that we don't even know how to integrate it into the rest of the democratic mix.\" But in starting that process, we do need to consider how we speak to one another.</p>",
  "<p>Think of Ethiopia and what do you see. Perhaps a starving child, flies in her eyes and belly distended. Painfully thin adults in raggedy clothes, staring balefully at the camera in a fetid refugee camp. Or possibly a famous self-declared saviour from the west, striding purposefully past the decaying corpse of an animal beside a dusty road.</p> <p>Think again. See, instead, a booming capital city, its cafes filled with graduates and cranes lining the horizon. A nation that is one of the world's largest livestock producers and recently became the second country to take delivery of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19293543\" title=\"\">Boeing's new 787 passenger jet</a>. An economy that doubled in size this century and is growing at 7.5%.</p> <p>Few countries symbolise the disconnect between outdated western perceptions of Africa and fast-changing&#xa0;realities on the ground better than Ethiopia, the continent's second most-populous nation, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-meles-zenawi-dies-illneses\" title=\"\">long-serving leader, Meles Zenawi, died last week</a>. Although&#xa0;the example of one country can never fully explain a diverse continent, this ancient nation illustrates in many ways Africa's progress, potential and problems. Mostly, it is a picture of amazing progress, far removed from the usual stereotypes presented by much of the media and their allies in the aid lobby. They offer simplistic images of death and destruction, ignoring complex realities of a continent encompassing 54 countries and 11.6 million square miles in which life is becoming more peaceful and prosperous.</p> <p>Last week, Africa was in the news over the shooting of striking miners in South Africa, a disturbing echo of the dark days of apartheid. The tragedy highlighted the failure of the party of liberation to deliver social justice in government; the nation is now the world's most unequal society. But it is worth remembering the country is a democracy, with free expression, a fine constitution and some accountability for those deemed responsible.</p> <p>Ethiopia's Zenawi was part of what Bill Clinton and Tony Blair hailed as the new generation of African leaders, heralding an African renaissance alongside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame\" title=\"\">Paul Kagame</a> in Rwanda and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoweri_Museveni\" title=\"\">Yoweri Museveni</a> in Uganda. Politically, they failed to deliver, festering in office as despotic autocrats.</p> <p>But there is a new Africa emerging, powered by capitalism, embracing globalisation and finally shaking off the shackles of colonialism and the cold war that proved so crippling to development. Just look at the land of Live Aid: one of the world's fastest-growing nations, a sub-Saharan success story like six more of the 10 most expanding economies. Poverty is far from banished \u2013 it's a grinding way of life for millions \u2013 but their numbers are falling fast.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart\" title=\"\">global top 10</a> also includes Ghana, which grew by more than 14% last year and whose cherished democracy sets such a great example; Mozambique, rising like a phoenix from the devastation of a long civil war; and Nigeria, the continent's potential superpower. Bundle all African countries together and they have grown faster for much of the past decade than East Asia.</p> <p>Some dismiss this as just a consequence of the continent's rich resources at a time of rampant development in many parts of the globe. Certainly, oil has fuelled spectacular growth in several countries, while others have made recent discoveries of deposits that ensure Africa will play an increasingly critical geopolitical role. But Ethiopia does not pump any petroleum, relying instead on exports such as cattle, coffee and cut flowers; the value of these exports quadrupled in under a decade.</p> <p>This is the youngest continent, enjoying a demographic dividend with a working population growing by around 10-12 million people each year. An emerging middle class \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/may/05/one-three-africans-middle-class\" title=\"\">one-third of Africans</a>, according to one analysis \u2013 is behind an explosion in consumerism. Already, Africans spend more per head than Indians on goods and services.</p> <p>There are still huge hurdles, with sclerotic border controls, stifling bureaucracy, sluggish courts and sleazy corruption. Infrastructure, while improving, remains inadequate \u2013 one reason for the boom in mobile phones transforming everything from agriculture to healthcare. Young Africans \u2013 impatient for change, innovative and increasingly well-educated \u2013 are using mobile technologies to solve problems presented by poor services and political stagnation.</p> <p>And this vibrant continent is getting even younger, with plummeting levels of child mortality and falling fertility. Ethiopia, where nearly half the 84 million population is under the age of 15, is one of 10 countries seeing incredible falls in <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2012/05/africas-child-health-miracle-the-biggest-best-story-in-development.php\" title=\"\">infant death rates</a> of more than 5% a year. In Senegal, the decline is twice that, stunning figures without precedent in recent history.</p> <p>There has been no single cause of this child health miracle, attributed to a mix of better governance, new technologies and improved health policies, while for all the enduring chaos in the Democratic Republic of Congo, conflict is becoming rarer and more localised. Even Somalia, ripped apart by civil war, is making a faltering return to normality; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/somalia-first-parliament-inaugurated\" title=\"\">last week, it convened its first parliament since 1991</a>. As Michael Clemens, an economist at the Centre for Global Development, said: \"This will be startling news for anyone who still thinks sub-Saharan Africa is mired in unending poverty and death. That Africa is slipping away.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, this message is failing&#xa0;to filter through to the west, where too many people remain locked into stale narratives of Africa as a land of suffering in need of our salvation. This is to our long-term detriment, especially in Britain, with such strong historic ties, a common language in many countries and the soft power strength of pop music and Premier League football. Twenty years ago, there was virtual economic dependence on Europe; today, half of Africa's trade is with other developing nations \u2013 and not&#xa0;just China.</p> <p>The continent is on the edge of economic takeoff similar to those seen so dramatically in China and India. For all the problems that still exist, a recent&#xa0;survey found investors in Africa&#xa0;are overwhelmingly positive, while those not there are unfailingly negative. These anachronistic attitudes&#xa0;reflect the west's myopic view, but we cannot afford to cling on to them in a world changing so fast. It is time to recognise the emergence of the new Africa.</p>"
