  "<p>US campaign finance rules, which have allowed wealthy individuals to pour millions of dollars into the 2012 presidential election, have shaken public confidence in the political process, according to a report by the Global Commission on Elections, Democracy and Security.</p> <p>The commission, which is headed by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, and comprises former world leaders and Nobel prize winners, has identified a rise in \"uncontrolled, undisclosed, illegal and opaque\" political finance across the world as a key threat to electoral integrity, in a new report due to be launched in the UK on Friday.</p> <p>The report singles out the US as an example of a country where lack of transparency and controls in political finance have left it struggling to restore the public's confidence in its elected officials to act in their interest.</p> <p>The commission blamed a series of court decisions \u2013 in particular the controversial Citizens United ruling, which turned campaign finance reform on its head and spawned Super Pacs, effectively removing barriers to corporate and union spending to influence elections </p> <p>Citizens United has \"undermined political equality, weakened transparency of the electoral process and shaken citizen confidence in America's political institutions and elections\", the report said.</p> <p>It also criticises US states which have sought to introduce voter identification laws and other measures that have the effect of suppressing African American participation in the political process.</p> <p>Vidar Helgessen, secretary general of International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said that US system was cited as just one example of flaws in democracies worldwide. But, he said the US, as the most powerful nation in the world, had a responsibility to set an example.</p> <p>\"If a vast majority of citizens say the systems is undermining political equality and weakening transparency of the electoral process, then there is an issue of trust in the government,\" he said.</p> <p>Political finance was an important issue which had not received the attention and reform it deserved, he said.</p> <p>\"We are seeing increasing inequality and we are in a global economic recession and it is an issue that will only grow. It is not only in new and emerging democracies that provide challenges and have elections that lack integrity\"</p> <p>The report cited a national survey this year by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University law school, <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/national_survey_super_pacs_corruption_and_democracy/\">which found a majority of people</a> believe nominally independent Super Pacs to be a danger to democracy. </p> <p>\"Nearly two-thirds of Americans said that they trust government less because big donors have more influence over election officials than average Americans,\" the report said.</p> <p>It concluded that, although Super Pacs must disclose their contributors and may not coordinate directly with candidates by law, in practice, \"both constraints have been flouted\".</p> <p>It compared the US unfavourably to Canada, which has faced many of the same campaign finance struggles and concludes: \"In contrast to the USA, Canada has managed to strike a balance between safeguarding individuals speech and protecting the overall integrity of the electoral process.\"</p> <p>It argued that the rise of \"uncontrolled political finance\" was one of five major threats to democracy, which could rob it of its unique strengths to promote political equality, the empowerment of the disenfranchised and the ability to manage societal conflicts peacefully.</p> <p>The report looked at a host of problems, including post-election violence in places such as Kenya and Nigeria, illicit finance in Costa Rica, and disenfranchised populations in Europe.</p>",
  "<p><em>[Updated below - Update II (Fri.)]</em></p> <p>Vanity Fair just published <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\">a lengthy profile of Barack Obama</a> by Michael Lewis, a profile he was able to write by \"hanging around Barack Obama for six months, in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and on the basketball court\". How did Lewis get such extensive, unfettered access to the President? In large part, it was by agreeing that he would give the White House full veto power over any quotes he wanted to include, as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/161003362/michael-lewis-studies-obamas-way\">he told NPR today</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"'My whole goal was to create a very natural environment so I could observe him without lots of people worrying about how it was going to be made to look in print.<em> So the agreement I had with him was, 'Don't worry about me. I don't mind you vetting his quotes, and if you set me up with an interview with someone else in the White House and I want to quote that person, I'll show you those quotes, too', and that ended up happening</em>. . . .</p> <p>\"So I sent those in, and they did almost nothing to them. Very, very little. . . .\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's understandable that the White House exercised the quote-approval power he gave them \"very, very little,\" because most of the profile is filled with admiration, fluff, and awe. That's hardly surprising given this incredibly revealing passage, in which Lewis -- who is pictured at the top of the article strolling with the President as they both smile at each other -- watches Obama play basketball against younger men and then speaks afterward to one of those players [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"No one held back, no one deferred. Guys on [Obama's] team dribbled past him and ignored the fact he was wide open. . . .</p> <p>\"'No one seems to be taking it easy on [Obama],' I said.</p> <p>'If you take it easy on him, you're not invited back,' he explained.</p> <p><em>I thought to myself, It must be hard not to take it easy on the president</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an act of glaring and extreme projection, Lewis purports to imagine what it's like to play basketball with the president but is obviously revealing his own thoughts: it's \"hard not to take it easy on the president\", he writes. That is more or less the motto of modern American journalism.</p> <p>That's not to say that there are no revealing passages. Lewis writes that when Obama learned he won the Nobel Peace Prize, he spoke to his speechwriters and \"told them he intended to use the acceptance speech to make the case for war\". And Lewis wrote, presumably channeling Obama, that \"the Nobel Prize Committee had just made it a tiny bit harder for him to do the job he'd just been elected to do, as he could not at once be commander in chief of the most powerful force on earth and the face of pacifism\". </p> <p>But those were obviously facts the White House wanted the public to hear in the months leading up to the election. In fact, one can say the same about every quote in Lewis' article, since, by virtue of the terms Lewis agreed to, none could appear unless the White House gave explicit permission. Whatever that arrangement is, it is not journalism (as some media outlets are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/us/politics/national-journal-bars-quotations-tweaked-by-sources.html\">now acknowledging</a>). It's more akin to what someone would set out to do when they believe that \"it must be hard not to take it easy on the president\".</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: George Orwell <a href=\"http://quotevadis.com/post/25110952622/george-orwell-everything-else-is-pr\">famously wrote</a>: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations\". If a writer in advance promises the subject of their profile that nothing will be revealed except that which they explicitly approve, then it's not exactly difficult to determine in which of these two endeavors that writer is engaged.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE II (Fri.)</strong>: Several commenters have responded that there's nothing \"surprising\" about this quote-approval practice because it has been a common practice for so long. Leaving aside the fact that I never said or suggested there was anything \"surprising\" about any of this, there are several brief points worth making in response:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> Whether certain conduct is \"surprising\" is totally irrelevant to whether it is worthy of condemnation. That Behavior X is common (and therefore \"unsurprising\") does not remotely negate the view that Behavior X is wrong and destructive; the former point is a non sequitur to the latter. Indeed, this mentality -- that once a certain practice becomes common it no longer merits real condemnation -- is itself quite harmful, for reasons I <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/cynicism-as-enabling-force-for-power.html\">set forth recently here</a>.</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> The New York Times apparently did not believe that this practice was so common and long-standing as to be worthy of being overlooked, giving that, just two months ago, they published a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/us/politics/latest-word-on-the-campaign-trail-i-take-it-back.html?pagewanted=all\">long article blowing the whistle</a> on these quote-approval arrangements, ones offered to Obama campaign officials by several news outlets including the Times itself. That Times article prompted widespread discussion among media professionals, journalism professors, and media critics precisely because it was not very well known that this practice had become anywhere near this pervasive.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> There are many news outlets that clearly do not take such a dismissive stance toward this quote-approval practice because -- both before that Times article and since -- they prohibit their reporters from entering into such arrangements on the grounds that such agreements are journalistically corrupt. That includes <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/181346/ap-doesnt-let-sources-approve-quotes-beforehand/\">Associated Press</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/national-journal-bans-quote-approval_n_1694434.html\">National Journal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/07/mcclatchy-joins-quoteapproval-opposition-129624.html\">McClatchy</a> and others.</p> <p><strong>(4)</strong> The excuse journalists use here is the same one they use to justify the indiscriminate granting of anonymity: <em>we have to do this, or they won't talk to us, and it's better to get corrupted access than none at all</em>. I think the opposite is true: it's better to have no access than corrupted access, as there really is nothing worse for a journalist than to serve eagerly as a P.R. stenographer for a politician. </p> <p>But even if this excuse were convincing, its premise is factually inaccurate. Politicians need media to cover them and convey their messages. If journalists stopped offering politicians corrupt arrangements -- quote-approval power and the ability to hide behind anonymity for no good reason -- then politicians would be trained to know that such arrangements would not be available to them and would stop expecting them. These excuses are nothing more than attempts to wrap what is plainly careerist, access-desperate, subservient behavior into a pretty package of noble journalistic justification (<em>we're just doing this, as distasteful as we find it, in order to keep our readers informed</em>). </p> <p>No readers are being \"informed\" by the publication of a profile in which the subject of the profile has the power to decide what does and does not get printed. They're being propagandized.</p>",
  "<p>As final negotiations over the future of the Olympic Stadium enter a crucial stage, the West Ham United vice-chair, Karren Brady, has insisted that the club's proposal will deliver a lasting legacy.</p> <p>Boris Johnson this week took personal control of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), moving the chairman, Daniel Moylan, to a new role chairing an aviation review after less than four months in the job. One of the mayor's most pressing tasks will be to try to strike a deal with West Ham amid protracted negotiations over the terms of any tenancy deal. On top of the \u00a395m in public money already pledged to convert the stadium into a permanent venue with a full roof and hospitality facilities, the east London club are believed to want the LLDC to contribute towards retractable seating and other costs.</p> <p>Brady will make the argument that by handing the main tenancy to a Premier League football club, it will bring benefits to the Olympic Park and wider area&#xa0;above and beyond its rental contribution, including enhancing the value of naming rights and helping make it a popular destination.</p> <p>\"I noted with interest Lord Coe's comments on Sunday about his desire to find a workable solution where athletics and other sports can operate together side-by-side,\" Brady said. \"His comments instantly struck a chord with me, as I firmly believe that our proposal will ensure that his vision would become a reality should we be given the opportunity to do so.\"</p> <p>It is understood that Johnson is keen to conclude a deal and anxious to avoid any potential delay in reopening the park from July next year onwards. But the LLDC's interim chief executive, Dennis Hone, will be keen to ensure that the figures add up and some on the board believe the success of the Olympics, which proved the stadium will work as an athletics and music venue, have strengthened their negotiating hand with West Ham.</p> <p>\"In addition to bringing the most exciting and most watched football league in the world to Stratford, we would ensure that the stadium retains the Olympic legacy that Lord Coe feels so passionately about,\" Brady argued. \"The truly multi\u2011sport capabilities of the arena would mean our award-winning community sports trust, which already helps tens of thousands of children a year, can further extend its multi-sports coaching to the next generation of potential Olympic&#xa0;athletes.\"</p> <p>The saga of the future of the \u00a3468m stadium has been long and drawn out, punctuated by missed opportunities, legal battles and expensive mistakes. The original deal with West Ham had to be scrapped amid legal challenges from Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient.</p> <p>But Coe said at the close of the Games that it remained \"perfectly within the wit and wisdom of all of us to make a multi-purpose sporting arena work for track and field\". The LLDC hopes to reopen the south end of the park, including the stadium, by spring 2014.</p> <p>Brady said that West Ham's bid would also help further the legacy aims of the LLDC and the government.</p> <p>\"Our bid revolves around creating a sporting hub that the community of east London and beyond can use to better themselves; whether that be through sport, education or simply living a healthier lifestyle,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We have all watched in wonder at the historic scenes created in the Olympic Stadium and I believe it would now be unthinkable to not maintain this new global landmark as a stunning, world-class sporting venue that can inspire hundreds of thousands of people through the power of sport.\"</p>",
  "<p>Greg Barker, the climate change minister, personally asked the Environment Agency (EA) about a permit application being submitted by a US energy company that was also paying one of his departmental advisers as a consultant, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/climate-change-minister-links-adviser\" title=\"\">Emails released under freedom of information legislation</a> show that Miriam Maes, a paid \"delivery adviser\" at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) who was also acting at the same time as a consultant to the US energy firm Air Products, helped to engineer a meeting between Barker and Air Products the day before the minister went to visit the Environment Agency for a regular \"update\".</p> <p>On 6 February 2011, Maes emailed Barker \u2013 without copying in a Decc official as she was meant to \u2013 requesting a meeting with \"one of my clients Air Products\". She added: \"I will send a formal request in through [redacted] but could you give it a gentle nudge if needed?\" She also forwarded Air Products' \"meeting objectives\", which included \"Highlights of Tees Valley Project\" and \"Path forward\".</p> <p>Less than an hour later, Barker replied: \"Of course, let's get it in the diary but let's have a chat rather than email.\" Maes replied: \"Ok understood!\" A meeting took place between Air Products, Barker, Maes and Decc officials on 1 March.</p> <p>At the meeting with the EA the following day, Barker asked about the permit application that Air Products needed, in addition to planning consent, to receive the green light to build the world's largest renewable energy plant on Teesside.</p> <p>Six weeks later Maes emailed Barker, again without copying in a Decc official, to say: \"Although it is a while ago, were you able to discuss the Air Products' situation with [redacted] from the Environmental Agency?\" Just under three hours later, Barker replied: \"I did!\"</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian if she had asked for Barker to personally inquire about the permit, Maes said: \"I absolutely never asked Greg Barker, ahead of his March 2nd 2011 meeting with the EA or any time before or after about Air Products' permit application for the Teesside plant.\"</p> <p>She also played down her relationship with another company, Salix, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/energy-minister-greg-barker-david-cameron\" title=\"\">secured a \u00a35m contract from Decc</a> and was listed on her website as part of a network of partners. \"The Decc officials had prepared as usual a ministerial briefing note prior to the meeting with Salix, including the recommendation [to award a contract],\" she said. \"I did not have any input into this briefing note prior to the meeting and was only asked to join the meeting with Salix at the last moment. When asked for my views in the meeting with Salix, I said that I agreed with the recommendation from the Decc officials.\"</p> <p>Both Maes and Salix insist no money changed hands between them. But the revelations about Air Products raise questions about the appropriateness of Barker's relationship with Maes and in particular his judgment in allowing Maes to pursue her consultancy client's interests while also being paid as a Decc adviser.</p> <p>Barker met Air Products three times in 2011, the company says, and featured at least twice in publicity photographs taken for the company. He also agreed to a positive quote, drafted by Air Products in his name and forwarded for his attention by Maes, to be used in an Air Products press release in August 2011, announcing that the Teesside plant had been granted planning permission. Maes emailed Barker, without copying in an official, on 10 August 2011 to say: \"Many thanks for accepting the quote!\"</p> <p>Labour has called on the prime minister to conduct a fresh investigation into the affair following revelations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/climate-change-minister-links-adviser\" title=\"\">published in the Guardian this week</a>. On Wednesday, David Cameron said the cabinet secretary and Decc's permanent secretary had already looked into whether Maes was properly appointed as an adviser and concluded nothing was untoward. However, it is still unclear when this investigation took place, if it examined all the newly released emails or whether its remit included Barker's judgment in dealing with Maes, a former personal adviser to him before he became a minister in 2010.</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian to explain the Air Products \"situation\", referred to in Maes's email to Barker on 18 March 2011, an EA spokeswoman said: \"The EA's chief executive Paul Leinster and chairman Lord Smith meet with Decc ministers to update them on our frontline work, such as the administration of carbon trading schemes. At the meeting on 2 March, 2011, with Greg Barker we were asked a question about a proposed permit application by Air Products for a gasification plant on Teesside that aimed to use new technology. We provided factual information about the permitting process.\"</p> <p>The spokeswoman later confirmed that it was Barker asked EA the question. She said: \"The minister wanted clarification that the new gasification technology was understood in relation to the permitting process. We provided a factual update about the permitting process.\"</p> <p>She added that the permit was granted by the EA in April this year after a \"robust 11-month assessment in line with strict terms of the Waste Incineration Directive. The resulting permit sets limits on emissions and lays out reporting and monitoring requirements to ensure the environment and local community are protected.\"</p> <p>When it opens in 2014 on the site of a former ICI factory near Billingham, the 49MW energy-from-waste plant will provide power for up to 50,000 homes in the north-east by burning 350,000 metric tonnes of non-recyclable waste from landfill each year.</p> <p>People close to Barker defended his actions. The email from Barker suggesting that he and Maes should talk about Air Products rather than email was sent because Maes often sent several long emails: \"Barker could not see them on a BlackBerry and found it quicker to discuss issues instead to stop her filling up the inbox,\" said a person close to the minister.</p> <p>Barker had raised the Teesside project with the EA because he was worried its knowledge of the technology was \"out of date\". Sources close to the minister also defended Maes, saying: \"[She] was certainly the most qualified woman in the whole distributed energy field in London. We were extremely lucky to have her on board.\"In reference to Barker's offer to \"nudge\" officials about an invoice, Barker had not pressed officials to pay the money, only to make sure it was dealt with.</p> <p>An Air Products spokeswoman said: \"During the period February 2010 until November 2011, Air Products engaged Miriam Maes as a consultant to advise us on the UK energy market which included engagement with potential power purchasers in the UK. As part of this process, we met with Greg Barker in March 2011 following a formal meeting request to his private secretary. We had first established from Mrs Maes that there was no legal or ethical barrier to the minister being briefed on a new energy-from-waste technology within his ministerial portfolio. Further separate meetings were held with Mr Barker as part of his Green Trade Mission to the USA in March 2011, organised by UKTI and again at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011.\"The spokeswoman added: \"The [first] meeting [with Barker] took place at 4pm on Tuesday, 1st March 2011 at which Greg Barker and Miriam Maes were present along with civil servants from Decc. The meeting was held at Decc's office on 3 Whitehall Place.\"</p> <p>A Decc spokesman said: \"The minister raised this concern during a routine meeting with the Environment Agency. It is part of his and the department's work to pursue issues raised by industry.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2012. An editing error led the original to incorrectly refer to \"a permit application for a \u00a35bn contract being submitted by a US energy company\". An earlier version of this footnote pointed out that the figure of \u00a35bn was not the value of a contract but incorrectly said it was the value of the company, Air Products. In fact \u00a35bn was a rough approximation of the annual revenues generated by Air Products (actually $10.1bn, or about \u00a36.2bn). Further, we would like to clarify that there is no connection between the permit application submitted by Air Products and a \u00a35m contract between Salix and the Department for Energy and Climate Change, mentioned elsewhere in the story.</p>",
  "<p><strong>From 2009 until the May 2010 election</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Miriam Maes, CEO of environmental consultancy firm Foresee Ltd, served as an adviser to Greg Barker while he was in opposition. In 2011, her website described the role as \"supporting the then shadow climate change minister on a variety of new energy policies and public-sector energy issues\".</p> <p><strong>September 2010</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Maes is formally appointed as a \"delivery adviser\" to Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) on a contract worth nearly \u00a320,000. She describes the role on her websites and in some internal emails as delivery adviser to the UK minister of state.</p> <p><strong>6 February 2011</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Maes sends an email to Barker asking him to meet with one of her consultancy clients, Air Products (AP), which is seeking planning permission for a renewable power plant in Teesside. She promises to send through a \"formal request\" but asks Barker to give it a \"gentle nudge\" if needed.</p> <p><strong>2 March 2011</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Maes thanks Barker for meeting AP, noting the executives were \"delighted\" and are trying to set up a further meeting in Philadelphia. She follows this up with an email to Decc officials the next day trying to get this meeting set up.</p> <p><strong>9 March 2011</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Maes asks Barker to intervene in a contractual dispute between herself and Decc civil servants, who want weekly updates on her activities, which she says is \"out of the question \u2026 in particular as I am doing a lot of confidential work for you\". She mentions she is trying to secure an extra \u00a310,000 for her contract. Her message concludes: \"I really appreciate your personal support in trying to solve this issue.\"</p> <p>Barker responds later the same day: \"I am sorry about the continuing aggro with your invoice, I really am going to bang the desk about this today.\"</p> <p>Later, as the dispute continues, Maes keeps informing Barker of developments and asking for his involvement. One begins: \"Please find below answer from Colin Church [DECC official]. Over to you\u2026?\"</p> <p><strong>18 March 2011</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Maes emails Barker asking if he had been able to \"raise the Air Products situation\" with the Environment Agency. He responds a few hours later with \"I did!\" Later inquiries by the Guardian reveal Barker had asked the agency's chief executive about AP's Air Products permit application for the Teesside plant.</p> <p><strong>9 April 2011</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Miriam Maes asks Barker to intervene with civil servants to say he wants her to run a project, the Whitehall district heating scheme, which they have put under someone else's jurisdiction. She drafts an email for Barker to send to officials: \"I wish for Miriam Maes as my Delivery Adviser to chair this project\" and concludes \"Trust this is a helpful first draft.\"</p> <p>Two days later Barker forwards an email to Maes including the following: \"I also clearly indicated again that given the obvious need for strong commercial leadership, I wanted Decc Delivery Adviser Miriam Maes to chair this project. So I was extremely concerned that this was not happening. Please rectify this with immediate effect.\"</p> <p><strong>27 April 2011</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>A civil servant tells Maes her contract has been extended: she will receive an extra \u00a310,000 payment, but the duration of the contract will not be extended.</p> <p><strong>24 June 2011</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Maes emails Barker to keep him posted on her application for a new advisory role at Decc through an open tender process. \"Recruitment process is definitely proceeding well so make sure you get it in in time, we dont [sic] want that sort of slip up!\" Barker responds. Maes later secures the role.</p> <p><strong>10 August 2011</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Air Products secures planning permission for its Teesside plant, and issues a press release including a supportive quote from Greg Barker. An unknown individual emails Maes to thank her for her \"help on getting the quote\".</p>",
  "<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, we must begin this week with a&#xa0;confession. Lost in Showbiz would never pretend to be any kind of expert in what it fears we must term \"body art\". Tattoos and tattooing represent a foreign country to&#xa0;Lost in Showbiz, something that was brought home to it quite forcefully when it walked past a tattoo parlour in Brighton and noticed it was touting for business by displaying in its window what was presumably an example of its recent work: a large depiction of Harry Hill pulling a face, with which a customer had decorated his right buttock. The message seemed to be: if you're the kind of person who wants to spend the rest of their life walking around with a drawing of a primetime comedian pulling a face on your backside, we're very much your go-to guys. Not LiS's idea of a winning business pitch, but then they presumably know their market. For all LiS knows, it may be standing room only in there and a waiting list like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/may/06/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-dabbous\" title=\"\">dinner at Dabbous</a>. Customers might be trampling each other to death in the crush to get to the counter and ask: can you do Dom Joly poking out of the top of my pants?</p> <p>To compound matters, LiS would especially never pretend to have a grasp on the enigmatic subsection of body art pertaining to hip-hop and R&amp;B stars. Here is a world where the rapper Gucci Mane celebrated his release from a mental health facility <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/what-does-gucci-manes-ice-cream-cone-tattoo-mean-20110113\" title=\"\">by having his right cheek emblazoned with an enormous ice-cream cone</a> featuring two lightning bolts coming out of the top and the word \"brrrr\" across it, apparently confident that few things say \"I am a man in full possession of my mental faculties\" quite like having a big ice-cream cone with the word \"brrrr\" across it tattooed on your face. \"It's a reminder to his fans of how he chooses to live his life. Cool as ice. As in: 'I'm so icy I'll make you say \"brrrr\",'\" offered his spokesman in explanation.</p> <p>And finally, LiS would never presume to offer guidance to singer, rapper and the world's favourite domestic abuser Chris \"Breezy\" Brown, on the grounds that all evidences suggest he has something of a quick temper. But, in the admittedly unlikely event that LiS were called upon to offer advice to Brown on what he should have tattooed on his neck, it would say this: Chris Brown, you are an international superstar. You have sold millions of records and had umpteen Grammy nominations. You get whatever you want tattooed on your neck. But if it may be so bold, LiS would suggest one tiny little caveat. Look at the design and ask yourself: regardless of what this is supposed to look like, does it in any&#xa0;way whatsoever resemble the horrifying photo taken of my former girlfriend Rihanna following the globally famous incident in which I&#xa0;savagely beat her? If the answer to that question is: \"You know what? It does have a certain something about it&#xa0;that recalls the aftermath of that time I left her with major contusions on either side of her face, a bloody nose, a split lip and bite marks on her arms and fingers\", then it may be best to give it a swerve.</p> <p>Use that as a general rule of thumb. Looks nothing like the globally infamous photo of Rihanna's face after I beat her: fill your boots! Get \"ink\" \"done\" to your heart's content! Definitely has a ring of the globally infamous photo of Rihanna's face after I beat her: get something else \u2013 I hear an enormous ice-cream cone with the word \"brrrr\" across it is considered quite the thing these days. Because if it&#xa0;does look like you've had a tattoo based on your former girlfriend's beaten face a) it will be the single worst tattoo design in history, and LiS speaks as someone who has seen a man with Harry Hill's face on his arse, and b)&#xa0;people might tend to think you're even more of a loathsome misogynistic knobshiner than they already do: no,&#xa0;LiS wasn't 100% certain that was possible either, but apparently it is.</p> <p>But let us not be too quick to judge Brown's tattoo. His spokesman pointed out that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/13/chris-brown-tattoo-rihanna?\" title=\"\">the tattoo was supposed to be of a sugar skull</a>, a symbol associated with the Mexican Day of the Dead. Before you say: \"Well, it doesn't look like a Mexican sugar skull, does it? It looks like Rihanna after he beat her up\", it's perhaps worth checking out a&#xa0;photo of the unfinished tattoo that appeared on a website called <a href=\"http://thechrisbrownblog.com/\" title=\"\">thechrisbrownblog.com</a> last month, with the caption: \"No clue what it's supposed to be but I'm sure it'll look dope once completed.\" How wrong, you wonder, can a man be?</p> <p>In fairness, it just looks like a woman's face, which rather begs the question: what happened in the interim? Perhaps it was altered on Brown's instruction, but LiS prefers to imagine that the tattooist just got a bit carried away, largely because it likes to imagine the conversation that took place between tattooist and client when the latter saw the finished piece. \"So \u2026 happy?\" \"Oh, for CHRIST'S SAKE, this is EXACTLY WHAT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN!\" \"What are you talking about?

  "<p>With its first iPhone, Apple let us take the web everywhere. It combined earlier technologies with some innovative extras, and once the company allowed third-party developers to create native applications for the device, a revolution in mobile communications was under way.</p> <p>That revolution's first phase is over, and Apple is the overwhelming winner so far. It doesn't sell most of the devices, but most of the profits from phones and tablets accrue to what is now, by far, the most valuable enterprise on the planet. The iPhone 5, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/sep/12/iphone-5-launch-apple-live-coverage\">launched this week</a>, will add billions of dollars to Apple's profits and, I'd guess, at least another $100bn to its market value.</p> <p>The new iPhone is about evolution, however. For all of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/12/iphone-5-review-features-4g\">improvements</a> it brings to the previous model \u2013 and they are real \u2013 the device exists in a marketplace where recent major innovations have come not just from Apple, but increasingly from the competitors <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/22/apple-samsung-patent-dispute\">it claims</a> have risen to prominence by copying. In some obvious ways, Apple is now doing a lot of the imitating, and that's a good thing.</p> <p>So let's cheer, among many other incremental improvements: the new iPhone's larger, 4-inch screen, even if it's still a lot smaller than screens millions of us have chosen from other manufacturers. (May we be permitted a snicker or two at the legions of Apple worshippers who, until Wednesday, assured us that a 3.5-inch screen was the absolutely perfect size for a smartphone, because, of course, Apple said it was the perfect size?)</p> <p>Let's applaud Apple's move to create its own mapping system to compete with Google's (and Nokia's). Even if Apple saw <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18393993\">ditching Google Maps</a> as a tactic in its war against the Android operating system \u2013 which now powers a <a href=\"http://whatsyourtech.ca/2012/09/10/looking-at-the-balance-of-power-in-the-mobile-industry/\">majority</a> of smart phones, and which Apple is trying to shut down in a global \"sue everywhere\" strategy \u2013 we users of technology should be glad for the competition.</p> <p>Let's note the radios and software that will let Apple sell the same device for use on the mish-mash of semi-compatible networks, including new, high-speed \"<a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2409610,00.asp\">LTE</a>\" systems around the world. In all of these improvements, and lots of others, let's respect the way Apple has poured a multitude of large and small tweaks into a device that still elicits something bordering on love from many of its users. (One tweak that will annoy iPhone fanatics is having to buy a new adapter so they can keep using the peripheral devices they bought for earlier iPhones, since Apple has changed its proprietary connector.)</p> <p>Apple is still Apple, of course \u2013 the world's most control-freakish consumer products company. Apple tells everyone in its ecosystem what they are allowed to do with the devices they buy or support \u2013 in the latter case, by creating peripherals or apps or content. It manipulates the media too often, substituting uncritical fan-boyism for journalism, though the surprisingly <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57511654-37/apple-has-sprung-a-leak-scoops-about-iphone-5-right-on/\">accurate leaks</a> ahead of Wednesday's announcement suggests that Apple employees are less scared of CEO Tim Cook's wrath than they were of Steve Jobs'.</p> <p>Moreover, Apple shows no signs of moderating its patent war on Android, which, contrary to the company's pious pronouncements, is much more about avoiding competition than protecting actual innovation. With more than $100bn in cash, and more rolling in every week, Apple can launch lawyers at everyone indefinitely.</p> <p>I've chosen not to be part of the Apple ecosystem \u2013 call me crazy, but I like making my own decisions \u2013 and I don't feel remotely deprived of innovation in smartphones. In fact, the iPhone is still lacking features I've had on my Android phone for some time now. One is a larger screen; the one on my current phone is 4.3 inches, and I'm eyeing one that is slightly larger yet. The Android OS is much more adaptable, and my home screen is configured in ways Apple forbids its customers from doing for themselves.</p> <p>If I'm jealous of anything about the iPhone 5 and its immediate predecessor, it's the excellent camera and the knowledge that when the OS is updated, Apple will do its best to bring those improvements to older iPhones. When it comes to OS updates, Android users get routinely screwed by handset makers and carriers that would much rather sell a new device than do the right thing for the people who've already spent their money.</p> <p>There's another big commercial innovator lurking in the mobile world: Microsoft. The more I learn about Windows 8, the more I suspect it could carve out a serious market share, not least because Microsoft's pockets are nearly as deep as Apple's. I would not be at all surprised to see Microsoft buy Nokia outright in the relatively near future, not just use Nokia as a flagship for its mobile phone operating system. Nokia makes world-class hardware, with brilliant industrial design, and Microsoft needs more of this to ensure that people take mobile Windows seriously.</p> <p>I'm also keeping an eye on Mozilla, Ubuntu and other free software players who are trying to move into the mobile space. Android is more open, today, than iOS. It may not be tomorrow: Google has corporate imperatives, too. We need the open-source people more than ever to keep the commercial operators honest.</p> <p>In a couple of weeks, meanwhile, Apple worshippers will be lining up at the company's stores, so they can be the first to spend their money on the latest thing from the company they love. They'll be buying the latest and greatest that Apple sells, no question. What's encouraging to me is that the iPhone 5 still won't be the best phone on the market.</p>",
  "<p>It's extreme stuff from the Federal Reserve in two ways. First, instead of throwing a lump sum of a few hundred billon dollars at the Treasury market, the US central bank will buy $40bn of mortgage-backed securities every month.</p> <p>Second, it won't stop buying until the outlook for employment improves, implying it is prepared to tolerate a sizeable degree of inflation when recovery arrives.</p> <p>What does it all mean? The Fed is clearly alarmed by the sudden stall in the US jobs market \u2013 but we have known that for months. The new ingredients may be shock at the slowdown in China's economy and horror that the eurozone has produced only another sticking-plaster solution to its woes. This may be a case of the Fed getting its retaliation in first.</p> <p>Markets initially love big props to asset prices, of course. But the second week's reaction is usually the one to watch. Do not be surprised if the focus switches to an assessment of quite how gloomy the short-term outlook for the global economy has become. In other words, this dose of monetary medicine may not turn out to be the one that stirs revival and creates jobs; it may, yet again, just be enough to preserve stability in the face of deep global trade imbalances.</p>",
  "<p>House prices across Britain have slumped by almost 10% since 2007, mortgage lending is stagnant and rental markets are overheating thanks to the inability of a generation to save enough for a deposit.</p> <p>But the land of the super-rich is another country, and in one highly exclusive corner of it \u2013 specifically, a discreet address just to the south of Hyde Park in west London \u2013 a house thought to be the most expensive ever marketed in Britain is seeking buyers, at an asking price of \u00a3300m.</p> <p>With an elegant stuccoed facade overlooking the park, seven storeys and no fewer than 45 bedrooms, the property at 2-8a Rutland Gate would certainly make an appealing pied-\u00e0-terre for someone with deep pockets, a love of trees (68 of its windows have a park view) and a large family. They would not be cramped at least: the 60,000 sq ft on offer is only slightly smaller than the playing surface of a football pitch.</p> <p>Those wanting to have a peek are likely to be disappointed, however. The house has been available for several months, according to sources, but is not for sale on the open market; instead, it is being offered discreetly by a number of agents to a very select handful of potential purchasers with a third of a billion to spare.</p> <p>The mansion, originally built as four family homes until being knocked into one dwelling, was formerly the London residence of Rafiq Hariri, the billionaire former prime minister of Lebanon, until his assassination in 2005 in a Beirut car bomb. Following his death, the Financial Times reported, it was made over to Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, thanks to Hariri's close personal and business ties to the Saudi royal family. The prince died in October last year.</p> <p>Even considering its luxurious spec \u2013 the property is rumoured to include a swimming pool, vast kitchen and lavish interior decor incorporating millions of pounds worth of gold leaf \u2013 the asking price of \u00a3300m is unprecedented, dwarfing the \u00a3140m paid last year by Russian banker Andrey Borodin for Park Place near Henley, previously Britain's most expensive house. The penthouse suite at One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, the flagship development of the Candy brothers, had previously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/16/knightsbridge-flat-sold-for-136m\" title=\"\">sold for \u00a3136m</a>.</p> <p>So who will be picking up the particulars of a property whose stamp duty alone will come to \u00a321m? \"The list of people who can afford it would be very brief, and will be on the Forbes 500 list,\" said the property expert Henry Pryor. \"The person who buys it will be looking for the opportunity to have one of the best addresses in London \u2013 it's a trophy rather than an investment.\"</p> <p>Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, described the house as a \"completely unique property, not just in a London context but a global context\". In such an uber-rich market, where national borders are irrelevant and sums of tens of millions represent small change, there were three core potential purchaser markets, Cook said: the former Soviet Union, north Africa/the Middle East, and \u2013 to a far lesser extent \u2013 western Europe.</p> <p>Britain's economy may be moribund, but the continuing bumptious demand at the very top of the housing market continues to drive up average London prices, even as the rest of the country shows no sign of reanimation. Overseas cash buyers helped push the capital's sale prices up 6.5% in the 12 months to July, according to Land Registry figures, compared with 0.3% nationally. In that month alone, the last for which figures are available, 34 properties were registered as selling for more than \u00a35m. The most expensive of them, in Farm St, Belgravia, changed hands for \u00a328,134,500.</p> <p>Oliver Hooper of the purchasing agency Huntly Hooper said the Hyde Park property \"is one of London's most unique residences and really only comparable to two others\" \u2013 Bridgewater House, a Victorian mansion next to St James's Palace, and Dudley House in Mayfair, both owned by foreign billionaires. As they are not for sale, Hooper said, \"I suspect this will be the only chance to get a house of this size in the area for a good number of years.</p> <p>\"Properties like these are in such short supply that for them to become available for purchase is a very rare opportunity. I suspect the buyer will be foreign and the purchase of it kept very confidential.\"</p>",
  "<p>Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke pledged to keep injecting money into the US economy until it recovers Thursday as it announced a rolling program to buy $40bn a month in mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>The widely anticipated third round of quantitative easing \u2013 dubbed QE3 \u2013 comes after Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had said he was increasingly concerned about the recovery.</p> <p>Bernanke said the plan was aimed at reviving the jobs market by stimulating the still troubled housing market. \"This is a Main Street policy because what we're about here are jobs,\" he said at a press conference.</p> <p>He said the Fed stood ready to take more action if the situation deteriorated further and that the he would not \"rush to tighten policy\" even when signs of a stronger recovery emerge.</p> <p>Wall Street cheered the move, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring over 200 points. Gus Faucher, senior economist with PNC Bank, said the open-ended nature of the mortgage bond buying scheme \u2013 a marked break from previous QE efforts \u2013 sent a clear signal that the Fed was committed to propping up the US recovery.</p> <p>\"It was much more aggressive than we were expecting,\" he said. \"Bernanke clearly feels that the recovery in the jobs market just isn't there.\"</p> <p>On top of the new scheme, the Fed said it would continue its action to bring down long-term interest rates, dubbed \"Operation Twist\", through the end of this year. Together the schemes will pump $85bn a month into the US economy.</p> <p>Bernanke said there were signs of recovery in the housing market and in the wider economy, but the Fed feels the economy is not yet strong enough to go it alone. </p> <p>His move so close to the election is likely to draw fire from Republican critics, though a response to the announcement from presidential candidate Mitt Romney was notable by its absence.</p> <p>The open-ended nature of QE3 will infuriate those who already argue Bernanke is too interventionist. But Faucher said that if the latest stimulus program had been given an expiration date, investors would once again have been asking what comes next. \"He's done this twice already. This is a way of saying we are sticking with it,\" he said.</p> <p>The Fed chairman refused to be drawn on precisely what signs would have to emerge before he turns off the spigot. \"We are looking for ongoing, sustained improvement in the labor market. There isn't a specific number in mind but what we've seen in the last six months isn't it,\" he said.</p> <p>The statement came after clear signals from Bernanke that he was preparing to act. The economy was \"far from satisfactory\" and the continuing high rate of unemployment threatened to \"wreak structural damage,\" Bernanke said in a speech at the high-powered annual economic summit of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City last month.</p> <p>Since that speech, the economic situation appears to have deteriorated. In August, the US added just 61,000 new jobs, half what many economists had been expecting. The unemployment rate ticked down from 8.3% to 8.1% but was driven down not by hiring but by 368,000 Americans leaving the labor force.</p> <p>Worrying economic news has continued to emerge since the job's report. On Thursday more evidence of a weakening global economy emerged as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development issued its latest report. The OECD found indications of slower growth in the US, Japan, China, India and Russia among others.</p> <p>The Fed chairman warned that the US still faced \"headwinds\" most notably the so-called fiscal cliff, a year end deadline for the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and the imposition of massive spending cuts. Unless a political solution is found to the fiscal cliff, the US could be plunged back into recession, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p> <p>He said the uncertainty over the fiscal cliff had been a major topic of conversation among the Fed's committee members and that uncertainty was a drag on the economy. \"A lot of businesses are waiting to see whether that problem will be resolved and if so how,\" he said.</p> <p>Bernanke's actions are likely to spark a furious backlash from some members of the Republican party, who have criticised his past interventions. The Fed chairman has become a whipping boy for the right, and Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's vice-presidential pick, has clearly stated he is against more stimulus.</p> <p>\"I'm not a fan of more stimulus or more easing,\" Ryan said last month in a CNBC interview. \"The benefits are clearly outweighed by the long-term costs of this. Iit's not working, and all this loose money from the Fed is basically bailing out the fact that President Obama has failed on fiscal policy.\"</p> <p>All but one of the Fed's committee, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted for the new stimulus package.</p>",
  "<p>The boss of British Airways has claimed that the question of hub airport capacity needed resolving urgently if UK citizens were to \"sustain a decent standard of living in decades to come\".</p> <p>Keith Matthews, chief executive of the national flag carrier, said that BA itself was now in an enviable position after the acquisition of bmi gave it 42 slots at Heathrow, and could \"get on with what we need to get on with it\".</p> <p>But, he added: \"This is an issue not for aviation but the UK.\"</p> <p>Referring to the new commission set up by the government to address airport capacity, led by Sir Howard Davies, he said: \"However relaxed the deadlines set for him, time is not on the country's side.\"</p> <p>Williams, who took over after the merger with Iberia saw former BA chief Willie Walsh take the helm of the newly formed IAG, has been seen as a more conciliatory figure after Walsh's clashes with unions. But in a speech to the Aviation Club in London he hinted that the era of BA cost-cutting was far from over.</p> <p>He said the industry had \"added capacity beyond sustainable levels \u2026 and failed to bring our costs into line\".</p> <p>\"There are welcome signs of a returning sense of discipline and also realism about the challenges ahead. British Airways was not \u2013 and is not today \u2013 immune from these challenges.\"</p> <p>Williams also claimed the BA brand was \"getting back to where it belongs\" and pointed to \"accolades\" for its TV commercial urging people to support the home team and not to fly during the Olympics \u2013 despite some in the industry querying the wisdom of the key message. Passenger numbers at Heathrow, where BA is the dominant airline, fell during July and August, while other airports reported gains.</p> <p>Williams praised the Heathrow Olympic operation but fired a warning shot to the UK Border Agency after signs that passport queues \u2013 which all but disappeared during the Games \u2013 were starting to return to the levels that garnered unfavourable global headlines earlier in the year. Citing passenger complaints of renewed waits at immigration, he said: \"If that [Olympic] performance is not maintained, we will do something about it, and tell the public.\"</p>",
  "<p>The row within the UK government over energy policy has been reignited ahead of the party conference season, with the former Tory environment secretary Lord Deben taking on George Osborne over the controversial role of gas.</p> <p>The row is crucial because the outcome of the war within the cabinet over whether gas should be favoured above renewable energy, as the chancellor wants, will determine the shape of the UK's energy infrastructure for decades to come. Hundreds of billions of pounds in potential investment also hang on the result.</p> <p>Lord Deben, formerly John Gummer when he served in the cabinet under John Major, took the highly unusual step of <a href=\"http://hmccc.s3.amazonaws.com/EMR%20letter%20-%20September%2012.pdf\" title=\"\">writing publicly</a> to the prime minister, David Cameron, warning that the government was in danger of breaching its own commitments on climate change through its strong backing for new gas-fired power stations.</p> <p>In his first public act as the new chairman of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the statutory body set up to advise ministers on how to meet its legal commitments to cut carbon, Lord Deben wrote to \"express great concern about the <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/wms_ro_lm/wms_ro_lm.aspx\" title=\"\">recent government statement [in July]</a> that it sees gas as continuing to play an important role in the energy mix well into and beyond 2030\".</p> <p>He pointed out that such an extensive use of gas-fired generation \"would be incompatible with meeting legislated carbon budgets [and] unabated gas-fired generation could therefore not form the basis for government policy\".</p> <p>Unabated gas means gas power stations that have not been fitted with carbon capture and storage technology to stop the carbon emissions resulted from burning it entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change.</p> <p>Green campaigners and renewable companies applauded the letter. Doug Parr, Greenpeace chief scientific adviser, said: \"So now it's clear, the chancellor's expensive and polluting dash for gas is not only economic madness, it's potentially illegal. Unabated gas is too high carbon to be a fuel of the future when the Climate Change Act commits us to cut emissions.\"</p> <p>Gaynor Hartnell, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association, said: \"This important letter from the CCC clearly explains one of the reasons confidence is flagging across the renewable power sector.\"</p> <p>The letter puts Lord Deben at odds with the chancellor, as Osborne's aides have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/21/budget-2012-chancellor-dash-for-gas\" title=\"\">briefing heavily in recent months</a> that gas must play a much more prominent role in energy generation, while subsidies to renewable energy should be cut.</p> <p>Osborne and his advisers want to increase the share of gas in the electricity mix because it is a quick way to build new power-generating capacity and because they believe that the price of gas is likely to fall sharply in future. However, that assumption does not fit with analysis by the International Energy Agency and other authorities, which have suggested that the price of gas is likely to continue to rise.</p> <p>The letter continued with a warning that investment could be damaged by the row within government: \"The apparently ambivalent position of the government about whether it is trying to build a low-carbon or a gas-based power system weakens the signal provided by carbon budgets to investors. It makes more pronounced the perceived risk that the Electricity Market Reform (EMR) will perpetuate the current stop-start approach to investment in low-carbon technologies. As a result, the cases for low-carbon business development, capital allocation, innovation and supply chain investment are undermined, damaging prospects for required low-carbon investments.\"</p> <p>The row is likely to continue at the party conferences in the next six weeks, and will come to a head this autumn when the government is supposed to formulate its gas strategy. Ed Davey, energy and climate secretary, said in response to the CCC letter: \"We are currently considering a 2030 electricity decarbonisation target but our existing plans are consistent with significant decarbonisation of the power sector. We are absolutely committed to meeting our statutory carbon budgets.\"</p> <p>The question of whether the UK builds more gas-fired power stations in the next few years is crucial to the much-needed overhaul of the country's creaking energy infrastructure that ministers are desperate to encourage, as older nuclear and coal-fired plants are taken out of service and new generation capacity is needed to keep the lights on. New gas-fired plants built today will have a useful life of at least 25 years, and unless fitted with as-yet unproven and expensive technology to capture and store carbon emissions, they will continue to emit greenhouse gases well beyond the amount consistent with the UK's long-term commitments on climate change.</p> <p>But the government has argued that new gas-fired plants can still be built. Some of the row deals with detailed points such as whether they can be used as a major source of generation until or after 2030, or only as back-up in emergencies.</p> <p>Davey said: \"After 2030 we expect that gas [for electricity] will increasingly only be used as back-up, or fitted with carbon capture and storage technology. But, alongside up-scaling of renewables, nuclear new-build, and eventually with carbon capture and storage, gas has an important role to play in the transition to a low carbon grid.\"</p> <p>His officials said this position was consistent with the government's long-term plan on climate and energy, as set out in various policy documents.</p> <p>Finessing the finer points of whether gas plays a \"major\" role after 2030, or what a major role consists of, may allow the government to stay technically within its own previously stated positions. However, whether the UK builds new gas-fired power plant or renewable energy generation will be determined by where private sector investors are prepared to put their money, and they are much more likely to be swayed by the clear political signals being given by the most prominent members of the cabinet.</p>",
  "<p>Did an inflammatory anti-Muslim film trailer that appeared spontaneously on YouTube prompt the attack that left four US diplomats dead, including US ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens? American officials have <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/13/161044872/u-s-probes-whether-libyan-attacks-were-planned\">suggested</a> that the assault was pre-planned, allegedly by of one of the Jihadist groups that emerged since the Nato-led overthrow of Libya's Gaddafi regime. So even though the deadly scene in Benghazi may not have resulted directly from the angry reaction to the Islamophobic video, the violence has helped realize the apocalyptic visions of the film's backers.</p> <p>Produced and promoted by a strange collection of rightwing Christian evangelicals and exiled Egyptian Copts, the trailer was created with the intention of both destabilizing post-Mubarak Egypt and roiling the US presidential election. As a consultant for the film named Steve Klein said: \"We went into this knowing this was probably going to happen.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/sam-bacile-in-hiding_n_1876044.html\">The Associated Press's initial report</a> on the trailer \u2013 an amateurish, practically unwatchable production called The Innocence of Muslims \u2013 identified a mysterious character, \"Sam Bacile\", as its producer. Bacile told the Associated Press that he was a Jewish Israeli real estate developer living in California. He said that he raised $5m for the production of the film from \"100 Jewish donors\", an unusual claim echoing Protocols of the Elders of Zion-style fantasies. Unfortunately, the extensive history of Israeli and ultra-Zionist <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/168374/sugar-mama-anti-muslim-hate\">funding</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175334/tomgram:_max_blumenthal,_the_great_fear_\">promotion</a> of Islamophobic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2fnTHyyvzWg\">propaganda</a> in the United States provided Bacile's remarkable statement with the ring of truth. </p> <p>Who was Bacile? The Israeli government could not confirm his citizenship, and for a full day, no journalist was able to determine whether he existed or not. After being duped by Bacile, AP <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_EGYPT_FILMMAKER?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\">traced</a> his address to the home of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a militant Coptic separatist and felon convicted of check fraud. On September 13, US law enforcement officials <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP/status/246252690190004224\">confirmed</a> that \"Sam Bacile\" was an alias Nakoula used to advance his various scams, which apparently included the production of The Innocence of Muslims.</p> <p>According to an actor in the film, the all-volunteer cast was <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5942748/it-makes-me-sick-actress-in-muhammed-movie-says-she-was-deceived-had-no-idea-it-was-about-islam\">deceived</a> into believing they were acting in a benign biblical epic about \"how things were 2,000 years ago\". The script was titled Desert Warrior, and its contents made no mention of Muhammad \u2013 his name was dubbed into the film during post-production. On the set, a gray-haired Egyptian man who identified himself only as \"Sam\" (Nakoula) chatted aimlessly in Arabic with a group of friends while posing as the director. A <a href=\"http://casting.backstage.com/jobseekerx/viewjob.asp?jobid=TXYxNuSgxoQo3eKH2L2DW8iOkP2v\">casting notice</a> for Desert Warrior listed the film's real director as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003085\">\"Alan Roberts\"</a>. This could likewise be a pseudonym, although there is a veteran Hollywood hand responsible for such masterpieces as The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood and The Sexpert who goes by the same name.</p> <p>Before Nakoula was unmasked, the only person to publicly claim any role in the film was Klein, an insurance salesman and Vietnam veteran from Hemet, California, who emerged from the same Islamophobic movement that produced the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik. Styling themselves as \"counter-Jihadists\", anti-Muslim crusaders like Klein took their cues from top propagandists like Pamela Geller, the blogger who once <a href=\"http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2008/10/how-could-stanl.html\">suggested</a> that Barack Obama was the lovechild of Malcolm X, and Robert Spencer, a pseudo-academic expert on Muslim radicalization who claimed that Islam was no more than \"a developed doctrine and tradition of warfare against unbelievers\". Both Geller and Spencer were <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2011/summer/the-anti-muslim-inner-circle\">labeled</a> hate group leaders by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p> <p>Klein is an enthusiastic commenter on Geller's website, Atlas Shrugged, where he recently complained about Mitt Romney's \"support for a Muslim state in Israel's heartland\". In July 2011, Spencer's website, Jihad Watch, promoted a rally Klein organized to demand the firing of Los Angeles County sheriff Lee Baca, whom he painted as a dupe for the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>On his personal Facebook page, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/ALTAR-or-ABOLISH/270356598857\">Altar or Abolish,</a> Klein obsesses over the Muslim Brotherhood, describing the organization as \"a global network of Muslims attacking to convert the world's 6 billion people to Islam or kill them\". Klein urges a violent response to the perceived threat of Islam in the United States, posting an image to his website depicting a middle-American family with a mock tank turret strapped to the roof of their car. \"Can you direct us to the nearest mosque?\" read a caption Klein added to the photo.</p> <p>In 2011, during his campaign to oust Sheriff Baca, Klein forged an alliance with <a href=\"http://www.atvsat.com\">Joseph Nasrallah,</a> an extremist Coptic broadcaster who shared his fear and resentment of the Muslim Brotherhood. Nasrallah appeared from out of nowhere at a boisterous rally against the construction of an Islamic community center in downtown Manhattan on September 11, 2010, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEJMRDqsMCE\">warning</a> a few hundred riled-up Tea Party types that Muslims \"came and conquered our country the same way they want to conquer America\".</p> <p>Organized by Geller and Spencer, the rally was carefully timed to coincide with the peak of the midterm congressional election campaign, in which many rightwing Republicans hoped to leverage rising anti-Muslim sentiment into resentment against the presidency of Obama.</p> <p>Through his friendship with Nasrallah, Klein encountered another radical Coptic separatist named Morris Sadek. Sadek has been banned from returning to his Egypt, where he is widely hated for his outrageous anti-Muslim displays. On the day of the Ground Zero rally, for instance, Sadek was seen <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAAKiDPdnmw&amp;feature=relmfu\">parading</a> around the streets of Washington, DC, on September 11, 2010, with a crucifix in one hand and a Bible implanted with the American flag in the other. \"Islam is evil!\" he shouted. \"Islam is a cult religion!\"</p> <p>With another US election approaching, and the Egyptian government suddenly under the control of the Muslim Brotherhood, Klein and Sadek joined Nakoula in preparing what would be their greatest propaganda stunt to date: the Innocence of Muslims. As soon as the film appeared on YouTube, Sadek <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/hollywood-connection-film-rage-libya\">promoted</a> it on his website, transforming the obscure clip into a viral source of outrage in the Middle East. And like clockwork, on September 11, crowds of Muslim protesters stormed the walls of the US embassy in Cairo, demanding retribution for the insult to the prophet Muhammad. The demonstrations ricocheted into Libya, where the deadly attack that may have been only peripherally related to the film occurred.</p> <p>For Sadek, the chaos was an encouraging development. He and his allies had been steadfastly opposed to the Egyptian revolution, fearing that it would usher in the Muslim Brotherhood as the country's new leaders. Now that their worst fears were realized, Coptic extremists and other pro-Mubarak dead-enders were resorting to subterfuge to undermine the ruling party, while pointing to the destabilizing impact of their efforts as proof of the government's bankruptcy. As Sadek <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/09/201291214042970150.html\">said,</a> \"the violence that [the film] caused in Egypt is further evidence of how violent the religion and people\".</p> <p>For far-right Christian right activists like Klein, the attacks on American interests abroad seemed likely to advance their ambitions back in the US. With Americans confronted with shocking images of violent Muslims in Egypt and Libya on the evening news, their <a href=\"http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/musamsurvey.htm\">already negative</a> attitudes toward their Muslim neighbors were likely to harden. In turn, the presidential candidates, Obama and Romney, would be forced to compete for who could take the hardest line against Islamic \"terror\".</p> <p>A patrician moderate constantly on the defensive against his own right flank, Romney fell for the bait, baselessly <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/mitt-romney-obama-libya_n_1877406.html\">accusing</a> Obama of \"sympathiz[ing] with those who waged the attacks\" and of issuing \"an apology for America's values\". The clumsy broadside backfired in dramatic fashion, opening Romney to strident <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-na-libya-campaign-20120913,0,1662505.story\">criticism</a> from across the spectrum, including from embarrassed Republican members of Congress. Obama wasted no time in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/09/report-drones-headed-to-libya-135317.html\">authorizing</a> a round of drone strikes on targets across Libya, which are likely to deepen regional hostility to the US.</p> <p>A group of fringe extremists had proven that with a little bit of money and an unbelievably cynical scam, they could shape history to fit their apocalyptic vision. But in the end, they were not immune to the violence they incited. </p> <p>According to Copts Today, an Arabic news outlet focusing on Coptic affairs, Sadek was seen taking a leisurely stroll down Washington's M Street on September 11, soaking in the sun on a perfect autumn day. All of a sudden, he found himself <a href=\"http://www.coptstoday.com/Copts-News/Detail.php?Id=32549#.UFD6Fc_DDg4.twitter\">surrounded</a> by four angry Coptic women. Berating Sadek for fueling the flames of sectarian violence, the women took off their heels and began beating him over the head.</p> <p>\"If anything happens to a Christian in Egypt,\" one of them shouted at him, \"you'll be the reason!\"</p>",
  "<p>The New York City board of health has approved Mayor Michael Bloomberg's controversial plan to limit the amount of sugary soda drinks that can be purchased at food outlets to 16 ounces (473ml).</p> <p>When Bloomberg first announced his plan over three months ago, he sparked a nationwide debate about the extent of government control over an individual's healthcare choices. In June, we asked you to share your thoughts with us about the idea \u2013 is the plan a plausible solution to the obesity epidemic in the US? Or is the legislation just another example of Bloomberg's 'Nanny-stateism'?</p> <p>Since then, the mayor has imposed age restrictions on tanning beds and introduced \"Latch On NYC\", an initiative to teach new mothers the \"breast is best\" principle. But while Bloomberg continues to be accused of overextending his authority, obesity rates in the US continue to rise and other cities, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/healthcare-network/2012/aug/10/london-new-york-chronic-disease\">like London</a>, are looking to NYC's health policies as future models.</p> <p>We revisited our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/31/obesity-food-drinks-peoples-panel?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">people's panel participants</a> and asked them whether or not they've changed their mind about the soda ban.</p> <h2>Jennifer Mo</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396116347\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/13/1258123322843/avatar-blue-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar blue\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar blue Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Now:</strong> I still have mixed feelings about the soda ban. While I agree with the end goal, I think the criticisms of nanny-statism are also fair. The question is: would the soda ban have a meaningful impact on health? And if so, does that benefit outweigh the individual's right to live without being nannied? I am cautiously in favor of voting for the ban, evaluating its impact, and making another, more informed decision to keep / repeal the ban based on the data at that point.</p> <p><strong>Then:</strong> Instead of bans, I support more subversive measures that reward good behavior and make it easier to choose well and punish bad behavior and make it inconvenient or expensive to choose poorly. And education. The bigger problem is lack of nutritional education and exercise, and an increasing disconnect with food.</p> <h2>Keith Aiken</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396116348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/30/1262172344336/avatar-environment-green-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar environment green\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">avatar environment green</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Now:</strong> The large-size soda ban is a big step towards reducing teen obesity. Poor lifestyle habits also contribute to ill-health, but there is a clear link between sugary drinks and teen obesity. If I was a New York taxpayer, I would applaud the mayor.</p> <p><strong>Then:</strong> An appropriate step which other cities will follow. \"Nanny-state\" charges may hold some truth but people generally need protection. Every process must have a beginning. History will show this decision to be a wise one.

Consumers won't be drinking any less soda, they'll just be buying more drinks. Aren't refills free? I can't see this doing anything at all other than making it appear as if the government is \"concerned\" and \"active\". Doing something useless is worse than doing nothing.</p> <p><strong>Then:</strong> Ridiculous. If I can't buy a 32oz soda, I'll get two 16s. Which will result in two cups, lids, and straws to be thrown away. If we focused on teaching proper habits rather than prohibition, the result would be much better in the long run.

However, by itself I fear it is doomed to failure. Such a ban can only succeed if advertising such products is curtailed, ingredients like glucose-fructose syrup withdrawn and an overall message of moderation preached.</p> <p><strong>Then:</strong> I think the soda ban is a perfectly acceptable solution to a burgeoning problems. While there might be cries of 'nanny state' 16 ounces is getting on close to a pint of sugary liquid \u2013 and with cases of type 2 diabetes rising it seems a logical step to take.</p> <p><strong>Over to you \u2013 what do you think of the legislation?

  "<p>The army of volunteer games makers, rightly celebrated as the heroes of the Olympics and Paralympics, are a partial vindication of the \"big society\" idea.</p> <p>Politicians such as Boris Johnson have expressed hope that the Games' legacy will be to inspire many more people to volunteer, so that the aims behind the big society \u2013 shrinking the state and public debt \u2013 can be realised.</p> <p>Away from the excitement and glamour of a global event, much voluntary work is tough and thankless. Volunteering and charities may be important, but abundant evidence shows that expecting them to take over state services is unrealistic. Many of them rely on government grants and are having to scale down their services, or even close, as a result of cuts.</p> <p>In my new report for the British Academy Policy Centre, <a href=\"http://www.britac.ac.uk/policy/Big-Society-and-neighbourhood-problems.cfm\" title=\"\">The 'Big Society' and concentrated neighbourhood problems</a>, I draw on extensive research to chart the history of community-centred activity in the USA and the UK, showing the big society idea as part of a long tradition of community organisation and social movement. There is little evidence that the big society, as opposed to the big state, will on its own carry us through the difficult challenges we face.</p> <h2>We need government action too</h2> <p>The state cannot withdraw from its overarching responsibility towards society as a whole, and neither can private interests, at whatever level, adequately fill those roles, particularly in poor communities. The tortuous American reform of health care, the sub-prime mortgage and banking crises, the eurozone crisis and steep energy price rises have shown just how vulnerable weaker members of society are, and how much we rely on co-operative action at government level as well as in communities.</p> <p>The big society started out as an idea about the small scale at which communities organise their survival. My research shows that community self-help and mutual aid are lifelines in the workings of society and neighbourhoods. However, the more closely we examine the complementary functions of state and civil society, the more interconnected they become. Major challenges such as climate change, energy shortages and skills mismatches will rely increasingly heavily on community resilience and new kinds of community capacity. But they will rely equally on the wider function of the state and also on inter-governmental co-operation.</p> <p>Community organising does not deliver in a vacuum; communities rely on a response from powerful sections of society, including the state, to equalise conditions by distributing power, responsibility and resources more fairly. When the gap between the top and the bottom of society grows too wide, then the response is too weak. This is a major factor in societal breakdown, affecting modern, wealthy but highly unequal societies.</p> <h2>Three conditions for success</h2> <p>In the move towards strong communities there are three conditions for success. Firstly, the state must recognise and reinforce its long-run role as broker of different interests in favour of communal justice, the rule of law, enforcement of basic conditions and equalisation, holding together increasingly diverse and sometimes divided communities. We need to balance the power of citizens to form groups and to take collective action with the power and duty of the state to enforce openness and underpin these efforts, requiring transparent, fair and firm regulation, a clear, supportive legal framework and financial transparency.</p> <p>Secondly, the state must redeploy public resources in favour of disadvantaged communities through locally responsive services, devolving some decision-making to targeted community-level organisations, within a widely supported public framework of legal, regulatory and financial safeguards. Co-operatives, development trusts, non-profit mutuals and small local private enterprises flourish within a strong framework of support, training and access to information. They also require collaborative structures, as European countries demonstrate. This approach has enabled several hundred tenant management organisations (TMOs) to grow in council estates, making them a constant source of inspiration.</p> <p>Thirdly, citizens in small community-based groups cannot tackle widespread, complex and costly problems alone. They lack the power, the technical know-how, the resources and the broad consensus of support that is necessary. They need a supportive, responsive state. There are some problems that are simply beyond what any one group or series of groups can do; they require higher level governmental action. Getting this balance right has become the art of government.</p> <p>Current cuts in public spending are undermining the long-run community infrastructure built up over decades alongside the evolution of the state. State withdrawal particularly undermines the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Yes, communities and individuals are capable of organising and delivering many basic forms of help. The state is inevitably more remote, bureaucratic and less sensitive to local problems. However, as individuals and members of small social groups, we are all part of something bigger, called society.</p> <p><em>Anne Power is professor of social policy at LSE and British Academy Policy Centre author</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Where is the ice? We are now at 83.20N which is very close to the north pole yet still there is no continuous ice cover (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\">head here for more on</a> my journey through the Arctic). We are mostly among small, thin, one- and two-year-old floes, with very little of the older, harder and more resilient \"multiyear\", or permanent ice that you would expect in these latitudes.</p> <p>Our ice pilot, Arne Sorensen, went up in the helicopter and found little change even as far north as 83.50 \u2013 just 350 miles from the pole. Just finding an ice floe big enough to moor the 50 metre-long Arctic Sunrise for the scientists aboard to conduct their experiments has proven harder than expected \u2013 something that many think is almost unheard of at this latitude.</p> <p>The obvious inference is that the ice has retreated far further this year than before and we will need to check previous years' satellite data to confirm this. But there may actually be far less ice in the Arctic than the satellite figures suggest.</p> <p>In winter when the sea surface is frozen up here, scientists can be pretty sure how much ice there is. But in the summer months when the ice is melting and there's much more water around, the satellite can become confused.</p> <p>It can think that melt water sitting on the ice floes is open water; it may not be able to tell the size of the floes or the distance between them; it can have problems \"seeing\" the ice because of clouds and fog.</p> <p>In short, the melting effect makes it much harder to quantify the amount of ice there is and the satellite tends to see more ice than there actually is. That's why monitoring groups such as NSIDC or the university of Bremen try to compensate with weather filters or by calculating the ice extent over a number of days rather than on individual ones.</p> <p>We know, here on the ship, how misleading the satellite data can be.</p> <p>Here, possibly only 50% of the sea is covered in ice. Yet the data is telling the scientists that there is continuous ice cover at this latitude.</p> <p>That's why Julienne Stroeve, ice expert from NSIDC the folk expected to flag the record minimum ice extent record in a few days' time \u2013 has been filming the ice conditions every few hours.</p> <p>When she returns, she hopes to match her real-time observations of the ice conditions with the satellite data. She speculates that the low fog conditions we have experienced could be making it seem there is more ice than there actually is.</p> <p>Either way, the situation is deadly serious. Both satellites and human observation suggests that the ice is now so thin over much of the arctic that it doesn't matter how much it freezes in winter, because it will melt in the summer. That would mean ice-free summers in the arctic coming far sooner than the models have predicted.</p> <p>Strangely, what we are beginning to see is just what the old Arctic explorers and visionaries such as Elisha Kane, Isaac Hayes, Captain W E Parry and Sir John Barrow hoped to find. It was widely believed from the 16th century that there was a tepid lake at the north pole, and that another continent lay beyond the ice. The problem facing explorers then was to get beyond the icepack which barred the route. It was this prospect of Arcadian lands that spurred these adventurers.</p> <p>Today, the prospect of an ice-free Arctic and easy access to the other side of the world has become the dream of oil, mining and shipping companies. The profits they see inn in the ice free sea are similar to those seen by the British from a clear passage over the top of the world to China and the east.</p> <p>But as Shell found off the coast of Alaska this week, nature bites back. No sooner had the company started preliminary drilling for oil in the Arctic Chukchi sea <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2012/09/10/2619205/shell-halts-chukchi-sea-drilling.html\" title=\"\">it had to abandon the work because of freezing conditions</a>.</p>",

It's adorable. Human hearts will go out to this rare African primate, already listed as \"vulnerable\" even as it first enters the annals of science.</p> <p>It is impossible not to fall for this face \u2013 but why?</p> <p>The photograph captures a sensitivity and intelligence that makes this monkey look like it is sitting for its portrait by Rembrandt. It reveals a staggeringly insightful, wise, and melancholy face. Like Rembrandt's son Titus in the portrait of him by his father <a href=\"http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/183\" title=\"\">that hangs in London's Wallace Collection</a>, the lesula looks right back at its beholder, calm and pensive, examining you as you examine it. Its eyes have the depth and frankness of those seen in moving portraits on <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_image.aspx?image=ps303902.jpg&amp;retpage=15473\" title=\"\">Roman-era mummies from the Fayoum</a>, or in <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/antonello-da-messina-portrait-of-a-man\" title=\"\">Antonello da Messina's haunting portrait</a> of a man gazing back out of a glassy oil panel.</p> <p>Animals have occasionally been portrayed with the same degree of empathy and intensity, especially by 18th century British artist George Stubbs, whose brown-eyed horse Whistlejacket <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-stubbs-whistlejacket\" title=\"\">stares passionately at visitors to the National Gallery</a>. But when it comes to eliciting human sympathy, the lesula starts with a couple of advantages.</p> <p>Like us, monkeys have their eyes on the front of their faces. It is an arrangement that evolved to give the best view and distance-calculating abilities to animals that live by swinging and jumping from branch to branch high in the trees. We got our own front-facing eyes, <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/timage_f?object=50724&amp;image=11607&amp;c=\" title=\"\">which make for such moving portraits</a>, for the same reason, even though our ancestors eventually decided to come down from the trees. This lesula's eyes are rounder than ours yet somehow the positioning is incredibly \"human\", like looking in a magical mirror. A painting by El Greco <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/what-we-do/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/1731/an-allegory-f%E0bula\" title=\"\">compares a monkey's face with human visages</a> to reveal their comparable character . Moist and almost tearful-looking, the lesula's eyes glisten with what looks like compassion and tenderness. This vulnerable creature appears saddened by its plight as popular prey for hunters seeking bushmeat. It has been observed to be highly social, so perhaps, like us, it uses its face <a href=\"http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_TheExpressionoftheEmotions.html\" title=\"\">as a crucial means of communication</a>.</p> <p>A long human-looking nose completes the anthropomorphic sense that we are looking at a close relative. Monkeys are not as closely related to humans as chimpanzees or gorillas are but still, we swung together once, a long time ago, assessing the next leap with those keen eyes.</p> <p>It's been a long time. Meet the lesula. This monkey may be new to human catalogues but its profound and tragic gaze suggests it knows us of old.</p>",
  "<p>The universities minister, David Willetts, is to launch a global drive to \"protect Britain's reputation\" and spread the message that it remains open to students from overseas in the wake of the government's curbs on student visas.</p> <p>He is also to set up a \u00a32m hardship fund to help \"legitimate overseas students\" at London Metropolitan University, who face extra costs as a result of the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/05/london-metropolitan-university-protest-foreign-students\" title=\"\"> home secretary's decision to strip it of its licence to sponsor overseas students</a>.</p> <p>But Willetts stopped short of demands from vice-chancellors to remove overseas students from the government's drive to reduce net migration to below 100,000 by the next election.</p> <p>Instead, Willetts told a universities conference in Keele that the Office for National Statistics would publicise statistics that made clearer the separate contribution of overseas students to immigration and try to improve estimates how many go home at the end of their studies.</p> <p>The university lecturers' union said it appeared the government was finally recognising the damage its student visa policy was doing to Britain's international reputation.</p> <p>Willetts's olive branch to the higher education sector over the government's drive to curb numbers of students from overseas came as 21 September was fixed as the date for the high court to hearing for London Met's legal challenge to the revocation of its Home Office sponsorship licence.</p> <p>The minister also suggested it was necessary for higher education to develop a longer protection scheme for foreign students \u2013 similar to the Abta guarantee when travel agents fail \u2013 should other universities face a similar situation.</p> <p>Universities UK said it welcomed the setting up of the \u00a32m London Met hardship fund and would take part in talks over a protection scheme. While it welcomed changes to the immigration figures to show what contribution students were making to reductions, it wanted the government to go further and remove students from the net migration target entirely.</p> <p>The University and College Union's general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: \"It appears the government is finally recognising the damage its student visa policy, coupled with threatening to deport thousands of fee-paying overseas students, is doing to our international reputation.\"</p> <p>The National Union of Students said the immigration statistics already gave details of overseas student flows in and out of Britain, and criticised the \u00a32m hardship fund as offering \"scant relief\" to students who faced an average bill of \u00a34,610 each as a result of moving university.</p> <p>Willetts told the universities conference that the London Met issue must not be allowed to jeopardise the success story of the 400,000 overseas students who bring in almost \u00a38bn a year in export earnings. He said it was necessary to take short-term action \"to protect our international reputation\" beyond the London Met hardship fund and the mini-clearing operation that will start next Monday.</p> <p>\"We have already used our Foreign Office posts to signal that we remain open to overseas students,\" Willetts said, before announcing a joint publicity drive with Universities UK in key newspapers \"in our target markets\", explaining that overseas students are welcome in Britain and reminding them of what a great opportunity it is to study in the UK.</p> <p>Willetts acknowledged that the public did not regard overseas students as immigrants and saw \"someone coming to study for a time and then going back home as different from someone permanently coming to Britain as a migrant\".</p> <p>But the minister made clear that they would not be removed from the overall net migration count: \"We will publish disaggregated figures. We will disaggregate the headline totals for net migration so that people can see the student element within that. We are not removing students from the totals. We are improving the quality of data on students leaving the country.\"</p> <p>Home Office ministers argue that the international definition of an immigrant covers anyone who goes to a country for more than 12 months and that removing them from the net migration statistics would look like the government \"fiddling the figures\" to meet their 'below 100,000' target. The latest net migration figure shows that 216,000 more people to live in Britain in 2011 than emigrated abroad. Students accounted for 232,000 of the 566,000 who were classified as long-term immigrants to Britain in 2011.</p>",
  "<p>Here's my recipe for academic success: mix two parts student effort to one part teacher/institutional effort, liberally sprinkle with attentive parenting and mix vigorously. Bake for 13 or 14 years in a stable, nurturing environment with an expectation that students will succeed (rather than end up in jail) and the chances are that they will. Seems simple enough, but is it?</p> <p>Let me give you some context for this theorising on social mobility and academic success: on 9 September, the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9530337/Cambridge-rejects-call-for-universities-to-admit-poorer-students-with-lower-grades.html\" title=\"\">Telegraph</a> ran a story about the universities (namely Cambridge and Reading) who were resisting pressures to make \"adjusted offers to working-class candidates\", as requested by Les Ebdon, the new head of the Office for Fair Access (Offa).</p> <p>Ebdon said universities should take contextual evidence into consideration when making their admissions decisions; former director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, Geoff Park, said doing so would be a \"cruel experiment\". Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Park said: \"Our bottom line would be that it actually would be a really, really cruel experiment to take a bunch of students and hypothesise that they have what it takes to thrive at Cambridge and then see them fail because they don't.\"</p> <p>Today has seen a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9538764/Cambridge-admissions-chief-rejects-social-engineering.html\" title=\"\">follow-up piece</a>, this time quoting the current director of admissions, Mike Sewell, as saying that \"lowering entry requirements for students from poor-performing comprehensives would undermine standards\".</p> <p>But does it?</p> <p>Consider the evidence from medical schools, which have some of the highest entry requirements of all undergraduate courses. With its extended medical degree programme (EMDP) Kings College London could be said to engage in 'social engineering' - the programme admits students who may have not reached their potential in state schools - yet a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/30/teaching-hospitals-students-lower-grades\" title=\"\">report into widening participation published by the British Medical Journal</a> found that students from underperforming schools, without AAB grades, were just as likely to succeed as other medical students.</p> <p>Despite the evidence, this debate is likely to run and run and while there might be no single right answer, we'd like to hear your views - both national and international perspectives: how should universities improve access for disadvantaged students without compromising their standards?</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Britain is split down the middle on the question of Heathrow expansion \u2013 in a manner that reflects political splits in the coalition.</p> <p>That is the finding of new research prepared for this week's <a href=\"http://www.yougov.polis.cam.ac.uk/?p=3396\" title=\"\">YouGov-Cambridge forum</a>, at which the Guardian is media partner. It shows that while 34% of voters believe a bigger airport would \"encourage trade, travel and get the economy moving\", another 34% say they are more concerned by the potential damage of noise and carbon pollution.</p> <p>There is, however, a strong party slant to the figures. By a two-to-one margin of 50% to 25%, Conservatives emphasise the economic gains over the environmental damage. By contrast, Labour voters are slightly more inclined to take the environmental perspective \u2013 by a 35%-33% margin \u2013 as are Liberal Democrats more emphatically, by 45% to 34%.</p> <p>The findings come the week after David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/06/heathrow-third-runway-noise-grows\" title=\"\">risked the rage of the greener among his Liberal Democrat coalition partners</a> by shunting out a transport secretary, Justine Greening, who was opposed to expanding Britain's biggest airport, and appointing an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/07/owen-paterson-climate-change-sceptic?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">environment secretary, Owen Paterson</a>, who has previously spoken out against windfarms and in support of certain fossil fuels.</p> <p>The poll suggests post-reshuffle tensions at Westminster are mirrored among the two ruling parties' supporters. The difference is not so much that Conservatives are in denial about the environmental consequences of airport expansion \u2013 63% believe it will cause a great deal or a fair amount of damage, which is less than the 72% of Lib Dems who say the same, but broadly in line with the 66% of voters overall who take this view. Rather, it is that Conservatives appear to give more weight to kickstarting the economy than to the environment.</p> <p>Respondents were asked to rank various potential investments in energy or the economy for the amount of environmental damage they would do. Voters revealed a hierarchy of polluting policies that fits pretty closely with the green movement's campaigns. A \"net damage score\" can be calculated by subtracting the proportion of voters who regard each project as doing little or no damage from the proportion who regard it as doing a great or fair amount of damage. New coal power stations are rated as the most damaging, with a score of 48 percentage points, and expanding Heathrow comes close behind with a score of 43 points. Easing planning to encourage homebuilding and building new roads come mid-table, with respective scores of 20 and 19 points.</p> <p>New nuclear power stations have divided environmentalists, with some regarding them as a necessary means of containing climate change and others bitterly opposed. Among the public 51% believe they will do considerable damage, against 36% who expect little or none, to give a net damage score of 15 points.</p> <p>The High-Speed 2 train line, which is planned to run from London to Birmingham and then eventually to Glasgow, is promoted as a way to encourage the movement of traffic from dirty roads to cleaner rails, but is being resisted by campaigners concerned about the countryside it would cut through. The public give it a relatively low net damage score of five points.</p> <p>Resistance to windfarms has been growing within the Conservative party, but not \u2013 according to the poll \u2013 among the public. Only 26% of respondents said they did great damage or a fair amount of it, as against 64% who said they did little or none. That gives a negative net damage score of -38, meaning windfarms are deemed a far cleaner investment than any of the alternative options. Underlying this pattern is, once again, a party divide. While a majority of Tory voters, 58%, do not believe windfarms cause significant damage, a substantial minority of 37% take the contrary view. That compares with far small number of wind sceptics among Labour supporters (19%) and Lib Dems (18%). Conservative modernisers may point to this survey as underlining the political dangers of pandering to anti-windfarm campaigns that play well with a section of the party's core vote, but would appear to have less resonance beyond this.</p> <p>Interesting additional party splits emerge in the ranking of the various projects. Labour voters look rather more kindly on coal than their counterparts \u2013 only 66% of them regard new coal power stations as doing great or a fair amount of damage, as against 70% of Tories and 81% of Lib Dems. By contrast, while both Lib Dem and Labour voters lean firmly against nuclear \u2013 with respective majorities of 57% and 56% suggesting new power stations would do substantial damage \u2013 the Conservatives are evenly split on the nuclear question, with 46% taking the same dim view and another 46% believing more nuclear stations would do little or no damage.</p> <p>\u2022 Between 9 and 10 September 2012, YouGov questioned 1871 GB adults. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all GB adults (aged 18+).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396116366\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347552759883/Heathrow-Graphic-001.jpg\" alt=\"Heathrow Graphic\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heathrow Graphic Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

The country is hosting the World Cup in 2014, and the Olympics come 2016, and fashion, never to be outdone, is ready to make its own handover. On course to become <a href=\"http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/emerging-markets/am/expert-focus\">the fifth largest economy by 2025</a>, Brazil has the resources to become the next fashion capital, and the international industry is beginning to take notice.

This is especially true with Rio making a bid to become the fifth fashion city. \"Out of all the fashion weeks we have covered, Rio is one of the most slick,\" says Duboc. \"They want to sell clothes.\" In a bid to fit into a global idea of beauty, admirable points of difference such as the acceptance of transgender models may get lost in translation. </p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\" http://www.vice.com/en_uk/fashion-week-internationale/rio-fashion-week-part-1\">Watch the Vice documentary Rio Fashion Week in full</a></em></p>",
  "<p>As scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond\" title=\"\">Jared Diamond</a> has made clear, it is most often lack of water that brings kingdoms to their ends. The ancient Jordanian city of Petra stands as a reminder that civilisations cannot easily withstand desertification. The medieval textile producers and traders of Bruges did not know that the greatest threat to their business came not from Florence or Antwerp, but from the falling water levels in the river Zwin, a threat they were powerless to halt. Can businesses now do better than the burghers of Bruges or the treasurers of Petra?</p> <p>Throughout the hottest North American summer in memory and the worst drought in 56 years, industries from shipping, food production, manufacturing and insurance have lost money, products, customers and access to markets.</p> <p>Some of these losses have been in industries where we expect to see an impact. The drought has threatened the livelihood of Midwest farmers, whose corn and soybean crops have been devastated. Bloomberg reports that yields in Ohio are expected to be lower than normal by 29% (corn) and 12% (soy). Purdue University predicts that Indiana will see its worst corn and soybean yields in the past 75 years.</p> <p>The precipitous rise in the cost of corn has had less obvious results as well. The nascent US ethanol industry faces <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444082904577605763027744608.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">calls to waive</a> the regulatory supports that mandate the use of corn for fuel. The drought is already having an impact on the retail food industry. <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/drought-threatens-small-businesses.html\">Magnolia</a>, a cupcake bakery chain in New York City that does not use corn, faces far higher costs for its wheat flour and for trucking its supplies. Unfortunately, the drought has not increased the amount its customers' are willing to pay.</p> <p>Perhaps the most dramatic consequence of this drought is the failure of the most important inland shipping route in the United States.</p> <p>The Mississippi River has dropped 3.6 metres (12 feet). The water level is so low that sections are now impassable for the barges that for decades have moved ore, manufactured goods and crops from the central USA to the Gulf of Mexico to be shipped to markets throughout the world.</p> <p>On 20 August, 97 vessels were stranded near Greenville, Mississippi. Shippers are losing tens of thousands of dollars as their vessels remain stranded. According to the American Waterways Operators, 566 million tons of goods are shipped on the river annually. Barges haul $180bn worth of goods. To keep traffic (and the US economy) moving, the coastguard is directing barges through the reduced stream, and the Army Corps of Engineers is dredging critical channels.</p> <p>Manufacturers have depended on the Mississippi for generations. For now, the barges are likely to get through \u2013 though carrying less, costing more and moving achingly slowly. But there is more risk and less certainty than there was a year ago. Such risks demand costly redundancies in systems and reduce the margins within which businesses must operate.</p> <p>Companies deal with unmanageable risk by buying insurance, and insurance companies buy reinsurance. The scale of this year's drought damage has overwhelmed them, too. Crop insurers stand to lose more than $5bn because they underestimated the risks of such a massive failure. Reinsurers are affected, too: Munich Re recently announced that it had lost nearly $200m because of the drought.</p> <p>Sustainable businesses have attempted to mitigate their long-term risk by implementing conservation measures, closed loop operations and more accountable sourcing of raw materials. But these aren't answers to sudden environmental change. Our supply chain-based models of sustainable business are most useful when the degradation of the environment is measurable, predictable and observable. We are learning to find new and better suppliers and to convince our customers of the value of more sustainable inputs. But little of this is valuable when the building blocks of commerce, such as roads, rivers and electrical power, become unstable and uncertain.</p> <p>Managers cannot always look outside the box in order to prepare for threats; there is simply too little extra time to worry about century storms and disastrous droughts. After the political failures of climate change conferences in Copenhagen, Johannesburg and Rio, world leaders have urged business to collaborate with other sectors to reduce the threat of global warming. The partnerships they advocated among thinktanks, environmental NGOs and industry associations can help businesses anticipate Black Swan events, and to think the unthinkable.</p> <p>Such initiatives are already underway. For instance, a number of large companies have partnered with the World Resources Institute to create the <a href=\"http://insights.wri.org/aqueduct/welcome\">Aqueducts project</a>, a water risk-management tool. By working with government data and the WRI's scientists, these companies have helped make useful forecasts widely available. These consortiums have yet to address the risk of catastrophic or sudden change.</p> <p>Sustainable businesses might be able to reduce their footprint, pilot better technologies, or bring fair trade commodities to broader markets. But to remain sustainable, they must also stay in business when rivers silt up. To carry on, businesses will need to work with their partners both to assess risks and to prevent future harm. Together with their partners, businesses can identify and advocate for policies to mitigate new risks. It may no longer be enough to be responsible purchasers and careful risk managers. Businesses and their partners may need to look at mitigating large, systemic risks, such as the impact of climate change on shipping and agriculture.</p> <p>No longer can we imagine that we live in a world in which the only victims of environmental damage are rare owls, subsistence farmers and island nations. This summer, we have discovered that not only the richest farmers but the biggest manufacturers in the US are vulnerable to drought risks. Firms identified with sustainability will assume a bigger role in society's discourse about environmental decline. We must not imagine we are powerless to stop it.</p> <p><em>Alison Kemper teaches management at York University and has worked with the Michael Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School since 2005.

  "<p>For nearly a century the Mediterranean city of El Azizia in northern Libya has held the official title for having been the hottest place on Earth ever recorded.</p> <p>But the world record was taken away on Thursday after an investigation by the <a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.html\" title=\"World Meteorological Organisation\">World Meteorological Organisation</a> found the measurement was probably bungled by someone who misread a thermometer.</p> <p>A panel of experts convened by the WMO raised five serious concerns over the historic claim that the mercury reached 58C in 1922 at what was then an Italian army base on the Libyan coast.</p> <p>The inquiry began in 2010, but was suspended when Khalid El Fadii, who played a leading role as director of the Libyan National Meteorological Centre, went silent for eight months after fleeing Tripoli during the recent revolution. He later resumed the work.</p> <p>Doubt was cast over the Libyan record when the group ruled it was inconsistent with subsequent measurements taken at the same site and at nearby weather stations. The reading was also taken over an asphalt surface, which would be hotter than its desert surroundings, and the operator was likely inexperienced and using equipment that was already obsolete in 1922, the inquiry concluded.</p> <p>A full report by the international team, which included climate scientists from Britain's Met Office, and the US, is to appear in the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00093.1\" title=\"Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society\">Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</a>.</p> <p>In striking out the Libyan record \u2013 after 90 years to the day \u2013 the title of the hottest ever place on Earth passes to Death Valley in California, where the temperature reached <a href=\"http://wmo.asu.edu/#global\" title=\"Arizona State University: World Weather / Climate Extremes Archive\">56.7C in 1913</a>, the WMO said.</p> <p>The record has been amended in the meteorologists' equivalent of the Guinness Book of Records, known as the WMO Commission of Climatology World Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/david-parker\" title=\"Met Office: David Parker\">David Parker</a>, a climate scientist at the Met Office's Hadley Centre in Exeter, who took part in the investigation, told the Guardian the WMO launched the inquiry to ensure it had its facts straight about the past.</p> <p>\"In the past 10 years or so there has been a lot of data archaeology \u2013 that is, rediscovering old manuscripts and putting them into digital form and so on, and that is what enabled this. There is much more information available now,\" he said.</p> <p>One particularly damning piece of evidence was tracked down in the original log of the reading in El Azizia. A review of the document revealed that the person who took the measurement consistently misread the Six Bellini thermometer used at the Libyan site.</p> <p>The instrument was similar to the maximum-minimum thermometers sold at garden centres today. The device had a pin on each side of a U-shaped glass tube of mercury. One pin recorded the day's highest temperature, the other recorded the lowest. The temperature should be read off the bottom of each pin, but if the top were used, the measurement would be wrong, and up to seven Celsius higher than the actual maximum temperature.</p> <p>\"They presumably roped in an inexperienced person that day. If the observer had read the correct end of the pin and there had been grass or sand underneath the instrument instead of asphalt, the problem wouldn't have been so bad,\" said Parker.</p> <p>In striking out the El Azizia record, has the WMO sparked a war over bragging rights between the city and Death Valley? \"The people who made both observations have long since passed away. Their grandchildren might be disappointed that their grandparent hadn't broken the world record, but it's unlikely to have any serious impact,\" Parker said.</p> <p>\"The importance of getting the record straight is maybe not just to science, but to modern adaptation to climate change. If you have a correct perception of past extremes, you are more likely to assess recent extremes better, and know whether extreme high temperatures are getting more frequent and so to adapt to them,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Central banks need credibility. The ability to credibly commit to a policy shapes expectations in financial markets, and transmits important signals to the real economy. More recently, Fed credibility allows it to use its \"communications tools\", providing forward guidance to manipulate expectations, presumably for the betterment of overall economic activity.</p> <p>Viewed from that perspective, the Fed very clearly has to increase its large-scale asset purchases (quantitative easing) after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/ben-bernanke-us-economy-federal-reserve\">the meeting concludes on Thursday</a>. It has said repeatedly that it has policy options it would use if economic conditions merited it. As witnessed by the most recent four employment reports \u2013 none of which showed <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-11/job-openings-in-u-dot-s-dot-decreased-58-000-in-july-hiring-declined\">employment growth</a>, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-10/stagnant-incomes-signal-restraint-in-spending-by-u-dot-s-dot-consumers\">income growth</a>, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/07/us-usa-economy-idUSBRE88604Y20120907\">labor force growth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/us-adds-only-96k-jobs-august\">unemployment declines</a> \u2013 economic conditions are quite weak. Moreover, the US faces global headwinds from a reduced pace of growth and the specter of financial shocks emanating from Europe.</p> <p>If the Fed fails to act, markets can only conclude that either the Fed doesn't understand economic conditions, which is not likely, or that its credibility has been reduced. The Fed won't risk that conclusion.</p> <p>That doesn't mean that further intervention will be effective in stimulating growth. As <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/31/usa-fed-bernanke-idINL2E8JUBD120120831\">Chairman Bernanke said in Jackson Hole</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Monetary policy cannot achieve by itself what a broader and more balanced set of economic policies might achieve; in particular, it cannot neutralize the fiscal and financial risks that the country faces.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The US needs fundamental tax and spending reforms \u2013 especially in health and retirement programs \u2013 for which monetary policy simply cannot substitute. Indeed, the case can be made that neither \"<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_15070.htm\">Operation Twist</a>\" nor \"<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2010/11/03/news/economy/fed_decision/index.htm\">Quantitative Easing II</a>\" (QE2) had a substantial impact on output or employment growth. Put differently, while the Fed's interventions during the crisis were instrumental in turning the economic tide, not much it has done since has had a big impact.</p> <p>A fair response is that monetary policy may have small benefits, but it is still worth trying. Fair enough, if there are low or no costs to action. Unfortunately, there are significant costs. First, further expansion of the Fed balance sheet makes the exit strategy even more complicated \u2013 and that is already unknown territory for the Fed and markets alike.</p> <p>Second, the larger the balance sheet policy, the more likely the US will face a noticeable uptick in core inflation. Historically, the Fed tends to move late in tightening during economic recoveries. This particular Fed is populated with significant and influential voices (notably Chairman Bernanke and Vice-Chair Yellen) whose focus on deflation risks will ensure a slower exit. The exact timing of the uptick is not obvious, but it is nearly baked into the cake already. Further QE raises the onset and size of <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443779404577641573330724332.html\">inflation</a> risks.</p> <p>Third, action now reduces the flexibility for action later. The Fed remains a powerful buffer against financial market turbulence. Given the state of European banking and sovereign finance, it is sensible to be concerned about the potential for a large shock at any moment. It makes little sense to give up some of the option to insulate from these shocks.</p> <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, another move risks politicizing the Fed, a very serious cost. The events surrounding the Fed's QE2 in 2010 are instructive. Consistent with their communication strategy, Chairman Bernanke began to lay the groundwork for action during his August address at the Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The messaging was repeated and deepened throughout the fall of 2010, which was also the key campaign period during a very tumultuous election that featured <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/04/democrats-resist-gop-effo_n_635085.html\">backlash</a> against big government, big spending and large debt.</p> <p>Viewed from the perspective of challengers seeking office, particularly the large number of conservative, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/09/palin-criticises-bernanke-quantitative-easing\">Tea Party</a> candidates, the Fed essentially spent the entire election season telling Americans that it stood ready to buy whatever treasury debt the Obama administration deficits would generate. The simplistic conclusion that the Fed was actively aiding the administration, and Democrat incumbents, generated <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2010/11/10/quantiative-easing-bernanke-markets-equities-criticism.html\">political outrage</a> and strong public criticism of the policy.</p> <p>A strong, credible, independent Federal Reserve is an important element of US economic policy-making, and an imperative for its future. With its actions Thursday, the Fed may endanger its credibility, its independence or both.</p>",
  "<p>If the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/12/richard-skeleton-king-remains-bosworth\" title=\"\">remains</a> found under a council car park in Leicester prove to be those of Richard III, the dispute about just how deformed the notorious medieval monarch really was can finally be settled. But more importantly, perhaps, it will have brought to light that beneath our cities and towns are layers of history, trenches of earth littered with the fragments of the past.</p> <p>The recent discovery of the remains of London's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/07/rediscovery-shakespeare-curtain-theatre-matters\" title=\"\">first theatre</a> in Shoreditch (known simply as the Theatre), the Curtain theatre (where Romeo and Juliet probably made its debut), and now possibly Richard III's remains remind us that our knowledge of history rests upon ever-shifting ground. We can't always be confident in what we think we know. \"Facts\" we thought were certain become less so and we realise just how fluid the past actually is. For example, for years it was assumed that the roof of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/07/shakespeare.shoreditch\" title=\"\">the Theatre</a> in Shoreditch built in 1576 (the 1599 Globe's predecessor) was made of thatch like most roofs of London theatres built thereafter. But not a trace of thatch was discovered on the site; instead there is evidence that the roof may have been constructed from tiles. This tells us something about the nature of theatre building at the time and about the importance of the area and the environment in which a theatre was located.</p> <p>If experts discover there is very little evidence of deformity in the spine of the skeleton in Leicester, what implications would this have for our understanding of Shakespeare's play of Richard III? Would it cast the playwright once and for all as a Tudor propagandist? Obviously, Shakespeare was drawing from a tradition in Tudor historiography of depicting Richard III as more physically deformed than he was. But this discovery would nevertheless force us to read the play with fresh eyes and a deeper understanding of the material reality of the Plantagenet king.</p> <p>Just over 20 years ago when <a href=\"http://www.globe-theatre.org.uk/sam-wanamaker.htm\" title=\"\">Sam Wanamaker</a> was busily planning the reconstruction of the Globe theatre, the remains of the Rose and the Globe theatres were discovered by Museum of London archaeologists; perhaps the most important discoveries for the history of English theatre. The size, shape and capacity of the Rose, in particular, became explicitly clear to scholars. And the sheer variety and number of materials found there have told us not only about theatre building during the Elizabethan period, but also about the lives of the players and theatregoers themselves. Pins, beads, combs, makeup brushes, shoes, remains of food and a huge number of other personal items were discovered at the Rose and Globe. So from this we can begin to create more vivid narratives about the people who regularly occupied the great playhouses of London while Shakespeare was serving up new plays.</p> <p>Why should these discoveries matter today? In a world in which digital technology is creating a greater distance between us \u2013 although the pages of books and historical artefacts are being made more accessible online or in applications \u2013 material history is emerging from beneath the mud and concrete to remind us of our tangible connection to the past. These discoveries matter too because even if they do not answer questions about historical events or figures, they force us to ask new ones. For lovers of history, theatre and Shakespeare, it should be comforting, not disconcerting, to realise that knowledge evolves, that the past cannot always be determined and there is still so much to be uncovered.</p>",
  "<p>\"We are among the world's leading businesses tackling climate change,\" <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/sustainability-report-2011/downloads/sr2011-climate-change.pdf\" title=\"\">says the Co-operative Group</a>. No wonder there was outrage among environmentalists recently that a member of the group, Co-operative Travel, is sponsoring an anti-aviation tax campaign.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afairtaxonflying.org/\" title=\"\">A Fair Tax on Flying</a> is a campaign being run by the Airport Operators Association (AOA). Cait Hewitt from the Aviation Environment Federation says:</p> <blockquote> \"It's extraordinary that it seems the Co-op is using their customers' money to support industry lobbying to cut aviation taxes\". </blockquote> <p>The campaign has adopted the American political lobbying tactic of having a title mimicking those run by environmental groups \u2013 there is already <a href=\"http://www.fairtaxonflying.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fair Tax on Flying</a>, run by campaigners who would like to see aviation pay more tax.</p> <p>Motorists pay 20% VAT on fuel, cars and repairs, but aviation pays zero VAT on aviation fuel, planes and servicing. Even airport alcohol and tobacco sales are VAT-free. Air passenger duty (APD) currently raises about \u00a32.5bn per annum, whereas the motor industry is estimated to pay about \u00a350bn in taxation every year. However, Darren Caplan, chief executive of the AOA says:</p> <blockquote> \"It is wrong to compare aviation with forms of private transport, such as car travel; it is a form of public transport.\" </blockquote> <p>The Aviation Environment Federation estimates that if aviation had to pay VAT like the motor industry, it would owe the taxman about \u00a311bn. As even budget flights are dominated by the rich, this tax subsidy takes from the poor in lost services and higher taxes and gives to the rich tax breaks for their holidays abroad.</p> <p>APD on all economy European flights is a modest \u00a313 a flight, a small increase of about \u00a35 in real terms since 1994, when awareness of global warming was largely nonexistent. APD on long haul flights to places like New Zealand is considerably more expensive, reflecting the enormous carbon footprint involved.</p> <p>(A small note of explanation on APD: while it was explicitly a green tax at the outset, the Treasury no longer count it as an environmental tax; the Office of National Statistics <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/environmental/uk-environmental-accounts/2012/stb-ukea-2012.html?format=print\" title=\"\">say it still is</a>).</p> <p>The recent inclusion of aviation in the European emissions trading scheme (ETS) will gradually increase European flight tickets by between \u00a31.50 and \u00a37 by the end of the decade depending on their carbon emissions, according to <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05533.pdf\" title=\"\">a recent report by the House of Commons library</a>.</p> <p>So why, in complete contradiction to all their loudly declared ethical standards, is the Co-operative group sponsoring a campaign to lower APD on such climate change-exacerbating flights? Craig Brownsell, spokesman for the Co-operative group, told me:</p> <blockquote> \"Historically, we have always argued for a system which is fair on consumers and fair on the climate \u2013 at present the tax is not put back into projects which reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\" </blockquote> <p>John Stewart, a trustee of Campaign for Better Transport, and chair of HACAN Clearskies, sums it up when he says:</p> <blockquote> \"The involvement of Co-operative Travel with this campaign badly tarnishes its claim to be green and ethical. Many of its members will be shocked at its decision to join this alliance.\" </blockquote>",

  "<h2><strong>1. Coming off the Gold Standard in 1931</strong></h2> <p>Winston Churchill during his time as chancellor put Britain back on the Gold Standard at its pre-war rate of $4.86 against the dollar with disastrous consequences. The economy was already struggling and returning to the Gold Standard made UK exports uncompetitive. The global downturn following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 deepened the slump and make it impossible for the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald to hold the line, despite unpopular welfare cuts. Leaving the Gold Standard for good helped the economy recover in the 1930s but split the Labour party.</p> <h2><strong>2. The devaluation of 1949</strong></h2> <p>Britain paid a high economic price for victory in the second world war. The country was flat broke and its industrial base, battered by six years of conflict, needed to be converted back into civilian use. The Attlee government negotiated a loan with the Americans, but was forced by Washington to make sterling convertible with the dollar in return. Britain was unable to compete with the much more productive US economy, and this resulted first in the crisis of 1947, followed by the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80 two years later. Labour won a general election in 1950, but only just, and was ousted from power in 1951.</p> <h2><strong>3. The devaluation of 1967</strong></h2> <p>The UK performed less well than its main rivals in the so-called Golden Age of the 1950s and 1960s. Growth was strong and jobs plentiful, but Britain found it hard to compete with the United States, France and Germany. The Labour government of Harold Wilson came to power in 1964 with an ambitious National Plan designed to accelerate Britain's growth rate, but made the blueprint stillborn by refusing to devalue the pound immediately. Instead, Wilson and his chancellor, James Callaghan, imposed austerity measures to keep the pound's exchange rate at $2.80 before giving up the fight in November 1967. Consumers were squeezed so that resources could be diverted to exports, and Wilson \u2013 to his surprise \u2013 lost the 1970 election.</p> <h2><strong>4. The IMF comes to town</strong></h2> <p>In the mid-1970s, Britain suffered a number of unpleasant economic shocks. Ted Heath's 1970-74 Conservative government had caused industrial chaos and left office with the country on a three-day week and inflationary pressure rising. Wilson's second spell in Downing Street saw the advent of stagflation \u2013 rising unemployment and inflation that reached a post-war high of more than 25%. Wilson handed over the reins to Callaghan in March 1976 and the scorching summer that followed saw pressure mounting on sterling, even though it was by now a floating currency. Eventually, the UK had to swallow a package of spending cuts to secure a loan from the IMF. Callaghan lost power, narrowly, to Margaret Thatcher in 1979, but the humiliation of the IMF bailout haunted Labour for more than 15 years.</p> <h2><strong>5.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2012/sep/12/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\" title=\"\"><strong>Black Wednesday</strong></a></h2> <p>The stain of the IMF was only removed from Labour when the Conservatives suffered a disaster of equal magnitude: the inability of the UK to continue with its membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in the face of wave after wave of speculative selling of the pound. In many of the other crises of the 20th century, the Conservatives were fortunate that they had left office before the full extent of their economic blunders had been exposed. That was true in 1931, 1967 and 1976, when Labour had a rotten inheritance. In 1992, however, the Conservatives' luck ran out. Black Wednesday was followed in 1997 by the biggest electoral defeat suffered by the party in 150 years.</p>",
  "<p>A number of key themes emerged from last month's <a href=\"http://www.worldwaterweek.org/\" title=\"\">World Water Week</a>: the importance of businesses and NGOs forming partnerships between with governments, nexus thinking (the interdependency of energy, food and water) and water allocation (who gets what). However, the world is running out of time to reach a consensus. Today, 1.1 billion people live without clean drinking water and almost the same number go hungry. By 2050, when we have a world population of nine billion, these figures will be far worse.</p> <p>To discuss the action that needs to be taken, we assembled a panel of experts and invited the Guardian Sustainable Business community to pitch questions during a live discussion. The panel included Marielle Canter Weikel, director of corporate freshwater strategies at <a href=\"http://www.conservation.org/global/celb/Pages/main.aspx\" title=\"\">Conservation International</a>; Conor Linstead, senior water policy advisor at <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WWF</a>; Andy Wales, head of sustainable development at <a href=\"http://www.sabmiller.com/\" title=\"\">SABMiller</a>; Samantha Hoe-Richardson, head of sustainable development and energy at <a href=\"http://www.angloamerican.com/\" title=\"\">Anglo American</a>; Jeff Erikson, senior vice president at <a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\">SustainAbility</a>; Greg Koch, managing director of the global water stewardship at <a href=\"http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Coca-Cola</a>; and Kari Vigerstol, hydrologist on the global freshwater team at <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/\" title=\"\">Nature Conservancy</a>.</p> <p>Here's a summary of the main points to come out of the debate.</p> <h2>Nexus thinking at World Water Week</h2> <p>After an \"exciting and exhausting\" World Water Week, Greg Koch said he was somewhat disappointed about the lack of representation from agribusiness and farmers. Agriculture uses some 70% of the world's freshwater, so \"it was a miss not to have that sector present\", said Koch.</p> <p>The food-water-energy nexus was \"a huge theme\" of discussion that came up time and again throughout the week, said Marielle Canter Weikel. The panellists were unanimous in stressing the importance of nexus thinking. Andy Wales summed it up by saying that, \"understanding the resource nexus - how water, food and energy supplies can be managed in a connected way - is critical to green growth\".</p> <p>However, Kari Vigerstol raised an element that she felt had not been given enough air time: the critical role of healthy ecosystems. Healthy rivers help ensure a sustainable fish population, which billions of people depend on for their main source of protein, she said - \"and a healthy population of pollinators (like bees) play an important role in agriculture\".</p> <h2>Working in partnership</h2> <p>While private sector companies are often criticised for their water usage, Wales suggested that government policies could often hinder rather help companies trying to do the right thing.</p> <p>Government departments working in silos, setting separate policies for water, food and energy, needed to start working together, said Wales. He offered the examples of the World Economic Forum's <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/issues/water/index.html\" title=\"\">Water Resources Group</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/news/water-partnership-south-africa-launched-world-economic-forum-africa\" title=\"\">Strategic Water Partners Network</a> in South Africa as programmes that were attempting to pull together government and private sector thinking.</p> <p>However, partnerships do not simply refer to those between governments and the private sector. Businesses must also work together, in particular bigger businesses with supply chains. Rosie Helson asked for the panel's views about Walmart becoming the first retailer to join the <a href=\"http://www.fieldtomarket.org/\" title=\"\">Field to Market Alliance</a> for sustainable agriculture. Vigerstol said she believed it was a very exciting step in the right direction and hoped that other retailers would follow, saying it was a great example of, \"working across the supply chain to improve sustainability of agriculture. If we are going to make a real impact ... we need to engage the growers, the commodity market, the food producers and the retailers.\"</p> <p>Koch agreed, saying that many retailers and manufacturers, such as his own organisation, Coca-Cola, were realising the need to switch to a more direct relationship with farmers to \"secure supplies as well as the safety and sustainability of that crop\".</p> <h2>New ways of collecting water</h2> <p>Brian Williams contributed a question about whether the water from hurricanes and typhoons, and subsequent flooding, could be collected. WWF's Conor Linstead stated that collecting water from extreme weather events would be too costly due to the damage such events could cause the equipment.</p> <p>This prompted a discussion about innovative forms of water harvesting. One participant raised the prospect of better seawater usage, but Linstead said the existing technology used a lot of energy, \"which generally means carbon emissions, so you just end up trading one problem off against another\".</p> <p>A positive example offered by Wales was that of water re-charge. A project by SAB Miller in Rajasthan, India, is attempting to harvest the intense monsoon rains that typically run off with little effect to the overall groundwater level. In conjunction with the Confederation of Indian Industry, the drinks company has built six structures over naturally occurring fissures that lead directly to the ground water, thus helping recharge the aquifer, said Wales \u2013 \"and we have seen a significant rise in water levels since they were put in place\".</p> <p>In Australia,, the response to the extreme flooding events of recent years had been a \"rain immunisation programme\" including underground water storage, said Samantha Hoe-Richardson. Ironically, with \"weather unpredictability becoming the norm, we were able to make the business case\", she added.</p> <h2>Changing behaviours </h2> <p>One of the biggest challenges for water conservation is that of changing behaviours. As Linstead put it, \"business as usual is not only undesirable but not possible\". Indeed, contributor wjk7 challenged the panel to address the \"elephant in the room\" of population growth. Wales responded that while population growth was an important factor, \"the trajectory is already set\". More important, said Wales, was ensuring that the new population better understood the interdependency between water, food and energy.</p> <p>Jeff Erikson pointed out that while UNEP defined water scarcity as less than 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, the average American consumed about 2800 cubic meters per year. With the most commonly cited unsustainable behaviour being eating red meat, Erikson continued, \"as developing countries become more prosperous, meat consumption generally increases. So a big change in attitudes \u2013 or price \u2013 must occur in order for meat consumption to decline.\"</p> <p>Canter Weikel picked up the point, saying that as the world's population outpaced nature's capacity to deliver fresh water, consumers would have to be better educated about water use and supply. Bibi Rodgers asked the panel what ordinary people could do about such a seemingly global problem. A good first step, Linstead advised, was to understand your personal water footprint and use it to guide purchasing decisions and dietary choices.</p> <p>Both Erikson and Koch made the point that as well as educating ourselves as to where our water comes from, we needed to make our politicians aware of the issues, especially in water-stressed regions. As consumers and voters, our actions at the supermarket and the ballot box were what would ultimately change the behaviours of those in power, they said.</p> <p>To read the full discussion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/water-food-energy-security-nexus-where-next\">please click here</a>. </p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business\">Guardian Sustainable Business</a> in association with SABMiller.

  "<p>Talking to any gardener or veg grower this year I hear a fairly consistent line: \"it's been a hard year\". The weather has been all over the place. I know that those of us who live on this group of islands like to have a good moan about the weather and more often than not it tends to be just something to talk about, but it really has been a shocker this year. I know from my own garden that I've seen a handful of cherries when last year I was cropping 40lb off the tree (and those were the ones I could reach!); I was podding peas and clamping carrots on a weekly basis to cope with the glut. The damson tree was purple with fruit, while this year I don't think I've eaten one, and I had a freezer full of stewed apple which most certainly won't be the case for the coming winter.</p> <p>It's not just the fruit and veg side of things that's suffered: growing livestock has also had its trials. Where I live we didn't really get a winter, frosts were few and far between and despite a few days of heavy snowfall, it was generally mild. A good fortnight of sub-zero temperatures helps to \"cleanse\" the land, and although it may seen tough on the chickens, they are adaptable creatures quite capable of surviving the cold, and their environment does benefit from it. But that wasn't what we got: one local breeder reported his first sightings of red mite in a chicken coop as early as March.</p> <p>The weather has been kind to the grass, which has flourished, but that makes mowing difficult \u2013 and long grass harbours parasites. Internal worms and pests survive easily in long grass as they are not killed by the sun's rays. Keeping grass short, particularly where young growers are ranging, helps reduce the incidence if parasites, but this year I've heard more reports of breeders battling with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidiosis\">coccidiosis</a> than I have in years gone by.</p> <p>That said, much like my early sowings of chilli peppers and broad beans, the early hatches have thrived and survived this season: it's the later ones that have had to contend with wet weather, lack of sun and lower temperatures. This has meant much of their energy has been spent on keeping warm, when normally they would be basking in sun or foraging for food. </p> <p>This morning I was walking around the grower pens, and those birds that hatched back in February and March are looking good. The pullets are starting to come into lay and the cockerels are now on a fortnight-long corn-only diet to ready them for the freezer. Those hatched in April and May though could really do with another month of summer. To breed and grow good birds, it's crucial to get them outdoors as early as possible, but with the wash-out that was July it's evident that the extra heat and light I gave them was no match for the benefit they get from the summer sun. They'll come on eventually, especially if we get an October like we did last year, but if not, roast chicken dinners with all the home grown trimmings followed by a handpicked fruit crumble will be more of a luxury than a mainstay of the winter menu.</p> <p><em>This post is part of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog+series/talking-chickens\">regular series on poultry keeping</a> from Andy Cawthray, a self confessed chickeneer who writes for a number of magazines, provides talks &amp; courses on keeping poultry at home and shares his experiences on his personal blog <a href=\"http://thechickenstreet.wordpress.com/author/thechickenstreet/\">TheChickenStreet</a>. </em></p> <p><strong>Carbon Gold competition</strong><br>Congratulations to Celine Mcilmunn of Glasgow, Katherine Hepburn of Aberdeen, Karen Scott of Slough, Amy Walker of Stockport, Susan Hill of Grangemouth, Jackie Ponting of Bootle, Roland Gibbons of Ormskirk, Sheila Cobham of London, Jane Berrow of East Yorkshire and John Nicholson of Maidstone, who were all winners in our recent competition to win Carbon Gold compost.</p>",
  "<p>When I first pitched my blog series, <a href=\"http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/two-worlds-colliding\" title=\"\">Postcards from the Participatory</a>, I intended it to be a collection of narratives exploring <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/08/mooc-coursera-higher-education-investment\" title=\"\">Massive Open Online Courses</a> (MOOCs) from the inside. I was engaged in the almost year-long <a href=\"http://change.mooc.ca/\" title=\"\">#change11 MOOC</a>, and I wanted to explore how the experience intersected with \u2013 and departed from \u2013 my teaching and learning within university walls. I thought the series might share a few stories about the resonances and challenges of participatory education, and explore the implications of distributed learning networks for conventional higher education. Basically, I thought it was time for higher education to start thinking about MOOCs.</p> <p>Ahem. Apparently bigger fish than me had a similar idea.</p> <p>Days after my first post was published, <a href=\"http://mitx.mit.edu/\" title=\"\">MITx was announced</a>. In the months since, I've watched agog as the word MOOC has proliferated and spiralled into the higher education buzzword of the year. Trying to keep on top of it makes me feel vaguely like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XChxLGnIwCU\" title=\"\">the sorcerer's apprentice in Fantasia</a>, frantically scurrying as the brooms divide and double.</p> <p>When you have worked in academia for 15 years, you get used to a relatively glacial and circular pace of change. This nouvelle vague of MOOC hoopla, then, has been disorienting. But there's no denying it. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/education/moocs-large-courses-open-to-all-topple-campus-walls.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">In mainstream newsspeak</a>, it appears MOOC now signifies some material manifestation of the <a href=\"http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/06/26/disruption-excuse-politically-motivated-changes-essay\" title=\"\">'disruptive innovation'</a> everybody's sure is upon us but can't quite pin down.</p> <p>Educational enterprises tagged with the letter X are fruitful and multiply. University presidents are dismissed \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/poll/2012/jul/13/university-of-virginia-reinstates-sullivan\" title=\"\">if later reinstated</a> \u2013 for failing to change fast enough, though the terms and targets of change are never explicitly specified. And Udacity and the xEd mega-MOOCs, with their overt emphasis on data collection and vaguely-defined business models, begin to look like trojan horses for mass-scale automation of teaching and marking.</p> <p>When the cavalry charge is being led by the most prestigious HEIs in the market, it's hard to assume it'll all just blow over. Clearly, higher education is thinking about MOOCs and the tone of that thinking gets a little bit more portentous and apocalyptic all the time. I find myself musing on Yeats, wondering <a href=\"http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html\" title=\"\">what rough beast</a> the MOOC is morphing into?</p> <p>Words become buzzwords because they capture a sentiment or zeitgeist burbling under the skin of a culture. They give name to latent hopes and fears, and they capitalize on our secret hubris \u2013 rampant in academia \u2013 that we are knowers, that we can name the future.</p> <p>The problem, of course, with buzzwords is that they end up empty. In this case, each new media iteration of the term 'MOOC' seems to tie it more closely to the behemoth of elite power and rapid change that drives the frenzy around disruption in higher education.</p> <p>Yes, higher education is changing. Its funding and knowledge structures and its place in culture have shifted drastically in the past generation or two, on multiple axes and in often-conflicting directions. It's under intense pressure to function in an increasingly corporate fashion, with increasingly little public funding. Globalization and the push for participatory collaboration all challenge the role of the traditional classroom. Things fall apart, we hear from every corner. The centre cannot hold.</p> <p>The problem with apocalyptic thinking is that it predisposes us towards simple solutions and salvation narratives, even in complex situations. If we're interested in being part of the conversation around the future of higher ed, we need to stop talking about MOOCs as buzzwords and begin talking about the interests that determine the specific shape of particular MOOCs as they emerge.</p> <p>MOOCs will not inherently gut faculty positions in higher education. They do not have automation and robot grading built into their conceptual structure. They certainly offer the capacity for these things, if backed by scale and prestige and neoliberal values of efficiency and market niche domination: they offer the potential to look like disruptive innovation while consolidating the market interests of elite brands within higher education. Udacity's partnership with Pearson? Perhaps a case in point</p> <p>MOOCs grew, initially, as learning networks of emergent knowledge focused around educational technologies \u2013 in other words, around complexity and disruptive innovation in higher ed. Oh, the irony! In their first inaugurations, led by George Siemens, Stephen Downes, and Dave Cormier, MOOCs weren't especially aimed at disrupting the university at all. They weren't about the university, but about an alternate environment for learning. As Downes put it, \"MOOCs don't change the nature of the game; they're playing a different game entirely.\"</p> <p>I've participated in a couple of MOOCs within this tradition. Instead of leaping to grand-scale automation, they've gone the opposite route, attemptiung to build sites for participatory conversation and networking around emergent technologies, practices, and ideas. There will be another, the biggest yet, offered this coming autumn. Its topic? The current and future state of higher education.</p> <p>My final postcard, then, says forget the buzzwords. The hype around MOOCs only clouds the conversation, consolidating power back in the hands of those who have the most to lose if the universities as business entities do not adapt. But those of us who teach and learn have ties to these entities too \u2013 just little to gain from robot grading. It's complex, this future of higher education. Maybe MOOCs can be a different kind of Trojan horse for change.</p> <p><em>Bonnie Stewart is a PhD student at the </em><a href=\"http://home.upei.ca/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Prince Edward Island</em></a><em>, Canada.

  "<p>In the current economic climate, all companies are under pressure to achieve more with less, in terms of both capital and resources. Moreover, many consumers now demand that companies demonstrate the social value that they or their suppliers provide. Nick Temple, of <a href=\"www.socialenterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise UK</a>, sees procurement as a \"big opportunity both for social enterprises and the private sector to demonstrate their credentials and achieve positive social impact\".</p> <p>With annual reports and company websites increasingly containing bold claims on social impact and announcing new local partnerships with social enterprises, many companies are talking the talk, but are they walking the walk? For a select few the answer seems to be \"yes\".</p> <h2>Wates Group building links with social enterprise</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.wates.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wates Group </a>, one of the UK's largest construction firms, is an example of a sizable company that is actively seeking to procure from social enterprises. Since 2010, Wates has committed to a pioneering policy of ensuring that it engages with at least one social enterprise on each new construction project. To date, Wates has traded with over 30 social enterprises on supply contracts exceeding \u00a33.5m.</p> <p>Rachel Wooliscroft, Wates' head of corporate responsibility, has explained that for Wates, \"working with social enterprises gives us the opportunity to support organisations that share many of our values and goals.\"</p> <h2>O2 thinking big and influencing others</h2> <p>In February 2012, O2 published its <a href=\"http://www.o2thinkbig.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Think Big</a> commitments that the company is aiming to achieve by 2015. One of those commitments was to establish processes to get more SMEs and social enterprises into its supply chain. Keithley Martin, head of supplier development of O2 UK, states that by \"working with a social enterprise we have an opportunity to use some of our considerable procurement spend to do social good without impeding our business objectives. So it's a virtuous circle, both a good thing to do and one that makes business sense.\"</p> <p>There is now a real focus on removing unnecessary barriers to participation by social enterprises and other SMEs. One option is for purchasers to enable enterprises to participate by offering innovative financial solutions to help them with payment terms additionally there is an increasing amount of opportunity to work with social enterprises and build their capacity to participate in the commercial market place.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/\" title=\"\">O2</a> has seen an opportunity to use its influence to open up not just its direct supply chain but also its extended supply chain. One challenge for larger companies is whether smaller social enterprises can deliver the goods and services at sufficient quality and quantity. While a contract may be too large or complex for a smaller social enterprise to deliver, it may not be an issue if they work as a sub-contractor to a larger direct supplier.</p> <p>Martin explains that another key aspect is \"working with SMEs and social enterprises to help them develop their ability to comply with our sustainability expectations of suppliers with regards to labour, environment, ethics and H&amp;S standards. This will make them more attractive to us and to others.\"</p> <h2>Intra-trading amongst social enterprises</h2> <p>When talking about how procurement can help social enterprise, most people think of commercial companies buying from social enterprises. However, as social enterprises and social businesses have grown, they themselves have become buyers, with the power to drive change as both a supplier and a customer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://hctgroup.org/\" title=\"\">HCT Group</a>, a social enterprise operating in the transport industry and On Purpose placement host, is working hard to expand both the number and range of social enterprises within its supply chain. Patrick Reyburn, strategic development manager at HCT Group, explains that, \"being a good social enterprise isn't only about the outcome. It's about the process as well. Who HCT spends its money with matters as much as who we spend our money on.\"</p> <h2>No trade-offs on quality</h2> <p>For HCT Group, regardless of an organisation's ethical stance, delivering quality remains key. Reyburn explains, \"Our contracts are won on price and quality. We compete against the likes of large multi-nationals and win. We deliver quality, and expect the same with no exceptions. We believe that a social enterprise must be an enterprise first. What we do with our profits after is what differentiates us.\"</p> <p>For Reyburn, \"there does not need to be a compromise between quality, price and ethics. Our growth and that of other social enterprises proves this. You can successfully trade as an asset-locked social enterprise and still deliver. How you spend your money is a vote for different ways of doing business \u2013 by spending in more ethical ways you can inspire customers and other companies alike to seek alternatives to traditional models of business.\"</p> <p>Nick Temple agrees and states that \"quality, price and delivery are crucial\". The challenge for any buyer is to do careful due diligence measuring both the quality of goods and services and the social value it provides.</p> <p>For social enterprises to increase their impact, they need to be competitive. Buyer due diligence is becoming more sophisticated, and this may help to boost quality and social impact of social enterprise goods and services. Equally, successful social enterprises are emerging themselves as buyers; Social Enterprise UK is currently campaigning for social enterprises to trade more with each other, with so-called \"inter-trading\" a focal point of its own plans for <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/advice-support/notice-board/social-enterprise-day-2012-planning-stages\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise Day </a>on 15 November 2012.</p> <p>For social enterprises to grow, they need to force their way into the supply chains of larger companies. However, this can only happen if there is a continued focus on quality and delivery at competitive prices. A limited number of larger companies have realised the potential for social enterprise to improve their supply chains, encouraging and supporting their growth, but these remain in the minority and, for social enterprise, this will need to change.</p> <p><em>Evgenia Sivtsova and Jon Khoo and are 2012 On Purpose associates.

  "<p>A new report has criticised the government over its local enterprise partnership (LEP) policy, claiming an \"unco-ordinated\" approach between departments is acting as a barrier to engagement with local businesses.</p> <p>The claims were made by the all party parliamentary group for local growth, LEPs and enterprise zones, whose report into the effectiveness of enterprise partnerships made eight recommendations for Whitehall.</p> <p>Among the suggested changes to make LEPs more effective at stimulating local growth was the need for a stable policy environment, greater access to data and a commitment to core funding from government, so that LEPs are able to act independently.</p> <p>The report is critical of the relationship between the three main departments responsible for LEPs and enterprise zones: Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Treasury.</p> <p>Black Country LEP told the committee: \"Lack of communication with the Treasury is a real issue [and] there is still a tendency for departments to act as 'gatekeepers' rather than develop a more 'partnership-based' culture.\"</p> <p>Committee members concluded that this poor relationship resulted in delays, bad communication between LEPs and government, and between LEPs and the business community, and unrealistic expectations about what could be achieved.</p> <p>Chair of the committee Brandon Lewis MP, said: \"Economic growth and getting the economy moving is the only game in town so the recommendations of this report are both timely and hugely important. Much has been achieved but the findings of this report show that there are clearly still gaps and weaknesses that all parties including government must address as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>\"I would urge government to consider and accept these recommendations so that improvements can be taken forward.\"</p> <p>Speaking at the launch of the report, communities secretary Eric Pickles called it \"an excellent piece of work\" and said he would be happy to implement most of the recommendations.</p> <p>A government spokesman confirmed that core funding was being discussed. \"Ministers have been considering the funding issue and will make an announcement in due course,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest vacancies in your area</strong></p>",
  "<p>People and their wellbeing need to be at the centre of development, with less emphasis on economic growth, according to a new report, but this requires philanthropic and development organisations to challenge current thinking.</p> <p>\"Development is political,\" said the final report of the <a href=\"http://www.bellagioinitiative.org\" title=\"\">Bellagio Initiative</a>, a six-month exploration into the future of philanthropy and international development. \"Not everyone can be a winner at the same time, but if no one among the winners is prepared to give up just a little in order to reach politically sustainable solutions, then we will all lose out. The real wellbeing challenge is not just to find ways to live well, but for us to find ways to live well together.\"</p> <p>Care work was cited as an example of an area that would receive greater attention under the new approach. Care for children and the elderly \u2013 work often done by women \u2013 is systematically undervalued and overlooked in the development agenda, said the report. A case in point was how the burden of coping with the day-to-day challenges of the global economic crisis has fallen unequally on women around the world.</p> <p>\"This means that in times of crisis \u2013 because of their neglect of the care agenda \u2013 international development and philanthropy organisations are complicit in processes of disinvestment in the raising of children, in building good families and communities and in creating the social contexts in which people can thrive,\" said the report.</p> <p>Other areas in need of rethinking included: the consequences of rapid and unplanned urbanisation as both threat and opportunity for wellbeing; the role of the natural environment in protecting and promoting the wellbeing of poor people who depend on it; and how wellbeing is to be considered for people who are increasingly mobile in their search for livelihoods and security.</p> <p>The Bellagio Initiative said the foundations of a new theory of development are well established, much of it inspired by <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198297581.do#.UDzoD79Z2IY\" title=\"\">Amartya Sen, the economist and Nobel prizewinner</a>, along with a groundswell that <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2012/08/what-is-development.php\" title=\"\">development theory is complex</a>. \"But there is a need to make this sometimes high-level conceptual work more relevant and more widely accessible for those making development choices and practices,\" said the report.</p> <p>It went on to say, as well as making new approaches more relevant, there is the need to engage more effectively with what people themselves are saying they need, even though what people demand cannot always be given.</p> <p>The recommendation has echoes of the <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:20622514~menuPK:336998~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:336992,00.html\" title=\"\">World Bank's project, Voices of the Poor</a>. In 2000, the bank collected the voices of more than 60,000 poor women and men from 60 countries in an effort to understand poverty from the perspective of the poor themselves.</p> <p>Changes in ideas and in priorities must be supported by changes in what is measured, with the report pointing out that significant work has been done on assessing wellbeing by Canada, Australia, Bolivia, Bhutan and the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslifemeasuringwell-being.htm\" title=\"\">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) group of industrialised countries</a>.</p> <p>In October, the OECD published a report, <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslifemeasuringwell-being.htm\" title=\"\">How's Life</a>, giving a comprehensive picture of wellbeing in OECD countries and other major economies by <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2012/05/30/why-everyones-trying-to-measure-well-being/\" title=\"\">looking at people's material living conditions and quality of life</a>. As part of its efforts to measure wellbeing, the OECD launched an online tool called \"<a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\" title=\"\">Your Better Life Index</a>,\" which allowed people anywhere to rank the importance of each factor on the list, and then compare how ideal with real-life statistics.</p> <p>\"In order to protect and promote human wellbeing, it will be necessary to increase awareness of alternative human-centred measures as development indicators, find out where and how they are being used, and consider how they can be adapted by development and philanthropic organisations,\" said the report.</p> <p>The Bellagio Initiative was commissioned by the <a href=\"http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Rockefeller Foundation</a> and involved the <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Development Studies</a> at the University of Sussex, and the <a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/\" title=\"\">Resource Alliance</a>, a global network for philanthropy. Participants discussed how philanthropic organisations and international development organisations could protect and promote wellbeing, expressed in terms of social justice, dignity or rights.</p> <p>A persistent theme of discussions was a loss of trust in those agencies and organisations charged with protecting wellbeing, including official donors and NGOs. Risk aversion was another finding of the initiative, with philanthropic organisations adopting narrow evaluation approaches and limited time horizons because of the pressure to be seen not to fail.</p> <p>The report said: \"At the heart of both these major problems lies the 'technocratic' character of the current development approach \u2013 in which solutions to development 'problems' are considered to lie in the hands of the development 'expert'. This was seen as contributing to mistrust in major development agencies and as fuelling the perceived remoteness and irrelevance of many development organisations.\"</p>",
  "<p>My grandad threatened to give up driving for many years before he was forced to do so by the cancer that also killed him. \"I think that's it for me now,\" he would say, after my dad informed him that he had run another red light. \"You or Tom can have the car. I'll take the bus from now on.\" But he'd always end up giving it one more go. As someone who, by his 30s, was already frequently inclined to absentmindedly place his lit pipe in strangers' coat pockets and mistake himself in mirrors for another remarkably similar-looking bald, bespectacled man, it must have been hard for him to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/21/tom-cox-grandad-dozy-gene\" title=\"\">distinguish between natural doziness</a> and the mental frailties of old age. </p> <p>He was one of a generation of glove-wearing men who considered driving a minor artform, his car engines attended to no less conscientiously than his own body. Due to his trusting nature, the secondhand vehicles he enthusiastically purchased rarely arrived home in the healthiest state, but they very soon looked and smelled fantastic.</p> <p>When I part-inherited my grandad's <a href=\"http://www.toyoland.com/photos/1976/corona.jpg\" title=\"\">1976 Toyota Corona</a> in the mid-90s, I showed little appreciation for its astonishingly low mileage or spotless interior. At that stage of my life I viewed cars largely as stereos on wheels, and the fact that the Toyota had no cassette player on which I could play my H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth\" title=\"\">Sonic Youth</a> albums made me myopic regarding its plus points. </p> <p>It's only since then that I've realised that its tinny MW- and LW-only stereo was significantly responsible for making me admit to myself I far preferred the extrovert rock music of the 70s to its sludgy late-80s and early-90s equivalent, and that, at a time when I was living with my parents, over a mile from the nearest bus stop and several more from my friends, the car itself connected me to the world in a crucial way, taking me through the country lanes that surrounded us, past burned-out Ford Escorts and pheasant-shooting gamekeepers and beyond, towards what I told myself was civilisation.</p> <p>Since then, the Corona has taken on mythical status in my mind. I often sighingly refer to it as \"the best car I ever had\" \u2013 partly because it just might be, but also because, as a man over the age of 35, I'm contractually obliged to have a car in my past which I sighingly refer to as \"the best car I ever had\". With every passing year, I've become more regretful regarding the moss I allowed to grow up its wheel arches, increasingly chiding of my youthful inability to see it as a minor design classic.</p> <p>I could get another, but that wouldn't be the same. There's a big difference between an old car you've kept and loved for many years and an old car you've bought recently because it looks cool. I live in a part of rural Britain where many old car drivers are proper old car drivers \u2013 septuagenarian men who drive the same <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Morris.minor.bristol.750pix.jpg\" title=\"\">Morris Minors</a> they bought when they were 30 \u2013 and they'd soon rumble me for a pretender.</p> <p>I'm often tempted by classic cars, because they suit my delusional fantasy of living in an unrealistically edited version of the early 70s. I always chicken out, though, beset by visions of myself on the hard shoulder, crying and shyly asking a member of the RAC to hold me. A lot of people say owning a vintage car is showing off but it strikes me that it's actually an act of kindness, since you leave the most fun part of the experience \u2013 admiring its exterior while you drive \u2013 to others. </p> <p>Being less generous than that, I instead prefer to drive a small, six-year-old car with no discernible personality. It makes life simpler because, as a vehicle with few ambitions, it asks very little of me. I do sometimes feel I need a fix of oldness as a I drive it, but cater for this by only cleaning it once a year and only getting its broken bits repaired when I'm really keen to say hello to the nice black labrador at my local garage who often looks after the reception desk for the place's owner. I also drove through a giant puddle not long ago and lost half of my reg plate, making me briefly feel almost as special as someone with a personalised registration but without the expense and mock Georgian house in Surrey.</p> <p>I still look longingly at old cars, though. I recently made myself 20 minutes late for a meeting by crawling in the slow lane of the A11 behind a <a href=\"http://damox.com/cars/wallpaper/Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_green.htm\" title=\"\">1969 Dodge Challenger</a> similar to the one in the film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONChzy1Aiw8\" title=\"\">Vanishing Point</a>. Well, I say \"a meeting\": I was actually on the way to a record fair in Norwich where I'd heard there was an original copy of the <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/barefoot-jerry-mw0000874529\" title=\"\">second LP</a> by the 1970s stoner southern rock band <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsDbjVTJo4o\" title=\"\">Barefoot Jerry</a>, which was arguably an even bigger sacrifice. </p> <p>My intrigue finally got the better of me a fortnight ago, <a href=\"http://www.forevercampervans.com/\" title=\"\">when I hired a 1972 VW campervan from Taunton</a> to drive to the <a href=\"http://www.endoftheroadfestival.com/\" title=\"\">End of the Road festival</a> in Wiltshire, where \u2013 to add to the feeling of entering the past \u2013 there was no way of connecting to the internet on my phone. Or, to put it another way: three good friends and I shouted \"WHAT DID YOU SAY?\" at one another for 66 miles, spent four days crawling about, bruising and cutting our heads on various perilously designed bits of wood and metal, then shouted \"WHAT DID YOU SAY?\" at one another for another 66 miles.</p> <p>I make this sound slightly less enjoyable than it was: Freddie, our van (apparently all VW van owners name them), had plenty of character and his own bunk beds, and, going up a hill not far from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerne_Abbas_Giant\" title=\"\">Cerne Abbas Giant</a> in Dorset, with the control-free fan blowing hot air in your face and the smell of diesel fumes in your nose, you realised that a lot of the sensual side of driving is lost in a quiet modern car. But I'm not sure End of the Road was the ideal environment to get the full, romantic, rarefied retro experience of driving a 40 year-old VW van. Waking up and appraising the caravan field on the first morning, 12 of Freddie's close relatives could be seen from our front window. \"Had their owners too begun to view second gear less as a driver's right and more as an elusive, magical concept you might occasionally visit, with luck upon your side?\" I wondered. \"Had their side doors also stopped working altogether, upon the second opening?\" </p> <p>So many of us fantasise about a simpler life in the past, with none of the distractions of modern conveniences, but we overlook the small print. Sure, it's idly browsing the internet that sucks our life away today, but in 1972 other activities did similar damage: spending half an hour in front of an incomprehensible door, trying several different combinations of keys and turning methods to open it, say, or waiting for roadside assistance. Time marches on, but our ability to waste it has a way of staying constant.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Tom Cox's latest book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9781847399878/talk-to-the-tail-adventures-in-cat-ownership-and-beyond\" title=\"\">Talk to the Tail</a>, is out now in paperback.

  "<p>Analysts and trade unions have raised concerns over the proposed \u00a329.8bn merger of BAE Systems and EADS, amid concerns that the transaction faces significant regulatory hurdles and will lead to job cuts in the UK if it is successful.</p> <p>Unite, Britain's largest union, said it would seek an urgent meeting with the business secretary, Vince Cable, and the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, in order to secure guarantees over jobs at BAE, Britain's largest manufacturing employer. The combined business will employ 48,000 people in the UK, encompassing a range of manufacturing sites from BAE's shipyards in Govan, Scotland, to the Airbus wing facility in Broughton, north Wales. BAE has cut thousands of jobs in the wake of the government's strategic defence review. It is shedding around 2,000 jobs at its aerospace division and is reviewing its shipbuilding arm, which could result in the loss of more than 1,000 employees at BAE's Portsmouth yard. In May it announced plans to close the historic Armstrong factory in Newcastle upon Tyne as part of a further 620 jobs at its UK business.</p> <p>Ian Waddell, Unite's national officer, said: \"Our first priority will be to safeguard jobs and skills. Any merger will need political approval in Europe and the USA. Questions need to be asked about when the UK government knew about this and what they will do to safeguard jobs.\" He added: \"We will be seeking an urgent meeting with Vince Cable and Philip Hammond and demanding guarantees from the company that a merger will not result in slashing jobs to cut costs. The new company would be the largest manufacturing company in the UK, employing tens of thousands of people in critical defence manufacturing and at Airbus. It is vital that the government ensures these jobs are protected in the UK before approving the merger.\"</p> <p>The Prospect union, which has around 700 members at BAE, said private sector defence contractors had been under \"immense pressure\" due to spending cuts. \"Whether the news of this merger brings reassurance or not for the workers depends on whatever plans for consolidation or growth the merged company will provide. Prospect will be seeking early dialogue with the companies,\" said Mike Clancy, the union's general secretary designate.</p> <p>Sources close to the deal have indicated that the British government has been made fully aware of the implications of the deal with EADS, which is co-controlled by the French and German governments, alongside the Spanish state as a minor shareholder. A government spokesperson said last night that the UK would ensure that the \"public interest\" was protected, but declined to comment on jobs.</p> <p>A source close to the deal played down the concerns. \"It is not about redundancies. Their activities and geographic strengths are largely complimentary. In terms of cost-savings the cuts will be in sourcing and procurement.\" However, the source added that one long-term fear about EADS's UK operations - that the Airbus wing business will move from the UK to Spain - will be eradicated by a successful deal.\" Referring to BAE's proposed 40% shareholding in the combined business, the source said: \"BAE would not take a 40% interest in Airbus only to let those jobs go abroad.\"</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re, a key shareholder in EADS, said on Thursday it would closely examine any tie-up between the owner of the planemaker Airbus and BAE before accepting any deal. The French media-to-aerospace group, which owns a 7.5% stake in EADS, said: \"The Lagard\u00e8re group intends to ensure that all consequences associated with the proposed EADS NV-BAE Systems plc merger are taken into consideration in determining the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction before it consents to the deal.\"</p> <p>The Lagard\u00e8re holding in EADS is part of a pact designed to maintain the balance between the company's French and German shareholders. The French state also owns 7.5%, while the German carmaker Daimler holds 15%.</p> <p>BAE and EADS have largely complementary businesses, with BAE specialising in defence from the UK nuclear submarine fleet to armoured vehicles for the US army, while EADS is Europe's largest civil aerospace contractor as the owner of Airbus, the Toulouse-based maker of the A380 superjumbo.</p> <p>The regulatory concerns over the deal are twofold: the clearing of any competition hurdles; and receiving clearance from multiple governments that have defence contracts with BAE and EADS. Guy Anderson, a defence analyst at IHS Jane's, said: \"A merger between BAE and EADS is unlikely and wouldn't happen without a lot of trials and tribulations. It would have to navigate onerous regulatory hurdles and sell off many overlapping chunks along the way. If it did go ahead it would create a goliath in terms of scale, putting BAE/EADS ahead of Boeing in revenues, but there is no telling how much of the combined offering would have to be sold off to satisfy regulators.\"</p> <p>However, Anderson said political concerns might be less difficult to overcome, referring to BAE's statement that the UK government would receive a new golden share in the business, which would safeguard its defence interests. \"There is a political dimension. The fact that the UK will keep a stake of sorts in the combined group bodes well and the UK-France defence pact shows that pragmatism can prevail.\" Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners, told the Financial Times that the deal would be a \"tough sell\" to the US government, BAE's biggest customer. He said it would be difficult to persuade them \"that they should allow one of their top five prime contractors [BAE] to be part of a European group when one of their major concerns over the years has been about transfer of intellectual property\".</p> <p>One of the biggest rivals of a combined BAE and EADS, Boeing, was relaxed about the deal on Wednesday night despite the raising of regulatory concerns. Jim McNerney, Boeing's chief executive, said: \"I have a pretty deep and abiding faith in our company's strength, so I don't see this as something that is going to threaten us fundamentally.\" McNerney added that BAE and EADS were pursuing a strategy of balancing commercial and military units that Boeing and others were attempting to achieve as well. \"It does reflect a global consolidation that is beginning to happen,\" he said.</p>",

It will lead to another rocket, and another, that will eventually lead to the first manned mission to Mars. The first human footprint on another planet.</p> <p>The sad truth, that struck me watching Curiosity land, is that these footprints will never be mine. I am too old. &#xa0;The first man or woman to one day walk on Mars is, today, a child. They are a young boy or girl, most likely a teenager sitting in a classroom somewhere in the world.</p> <p>Their journey to Mars will not be easy. After years of budget cuts and waning political will, the future of manned space travel hangs perilously. This year marks the 40th anniversary of Apollo 17, the last time a human being stood on another celestial body. As the world mourns Neil Armstrong, it is hard not to feel pessimistic. </p> <p>There are, however, two powerful forces at play that may help these children get to Mars. The first is the increasing democratisation of space, a new space economy where the private sector is giving more people access to space. The second is an increasingly connected world, with unparalleled opportunities for learning, collaborating and the sharing of ideas online.</p> <p>These two forces, when harnessed and combined, have tremendous potential as demonstrated by a recent Google initiative called YouTube Space Lab \u2013 a global competition giving teenagers the opportunity to design a science experiment that could be carried out on board the International Space Station.</p> <p>Thousands of students, from 80 different countries around the world, submitted their experiment ideas for microgravity in the form of short videos uploaded on YouTube.&#xa0;Professor Stephen Hawking and other world-renowned scientists, along with astronauts, educators and millions of people on YouTube watched and voted for their favourite ideas \u2013 the two winning experiments have now been sent to space.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YV1WHjNs4E\">Amr Mohammed</a> is 18 and from Alexandria, Egypt. He wants to see whether the Zebra jumping spider will be able to adapt to microgravity to catch its prey, overcoming millions of years of evolutionary instinct. This may one day help us better understand how our own bodies can adapt to the rigours of inter-planetary travel.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjRSGs6agWQ\">Dorothy Chen and Sara Ma</a> are both 16 and from Troy, Michigan. They want to know whether the probiotic bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, will become more virulent in space. This kind of research could help us develop new ways to fight superbugs on Earth.</p> <p>This Thursday from 3:30pm BST \u2013 as the ISS soars through space, 250 miles above the Earth \u2013 the results of these two experiments will be broadcast live on <a href=\"http://youtube.com/spacelab\">YouTube</a>, for you and the whole world to see.</p> <p>Amr, Dorothy and Sara - as well as the thousands who entered Space Lab - represent the future of the space programme. Their potential was always there. But they have been now given an opportunity to begin a journey that may well lead to new worlds beyond our own. Space, and its future, can be for them.</p> <p>I will never get to Mars.

  "<p>The benefits of an alternative nuclear fuel that could offer a safer and more abundant alternative to the uranium that powers conventional reactors have been \"overstated\", according a new government report on the potential of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/01/what-is-thorium-nuclear-power\" title=\"\">thorium</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/nuclear/reactor_report/reactor_report.aspx\" title=\"\">The report</a> says the UK should continue to be engaged with the technology but downplays claims by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/sep/09/thorium-weinberg-foundation\" title=\"\">thorium proponents</a> who say that the radioactive chemical element makes it impossible to build a bomb from nuclear waste, leaves less hazardous waste than uranium reactors, and that it runs more efficiently.</p> <p>\"Thorium has theoretical advantages regarding sustainability, reducing radiotoxicity and reducing proliferation risk,\" states the report, prepared for the Department of Energy and Climate Change by the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL). \"While there is some justification for these benefits, they are often overstated.\"</p> <p>Some of NNL's hesitance comes from UK utility companies' unwillingness to invest the money in research and development necessary to draw out thorium's advantages.</p> <p>\"Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that worldwide there remains interest in thorium fuel cycles and this is not likely to diminish in the near future,\" the report concludes. \"It may therefore be judicious for the UK to maintain a low level of engagement in thorium fuel cycle research and development by involvement in international collaborative research activities.\"</p> <p>The report notes that thorium's advantages would be most noticeable in reactor types other than the conventional solid fuel, water-cooled reactors used in almost all of the world's commercial nuclear electricity stations today.</p> <p>In particular, a design known as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_temperature_reactor\" title=\"\">very high temperature reactor</a> is \"especially well suited to thorium fuels,\" NNL states. The old UK Atomic Energy Authority built and operated an experimental thorium-fueled high temperature at Winfrith in the 1960s and 70s. The reactor, nicknamed Dragon, <a href=\"http://www.research-sites.com/winfrith-site-operations/quick-facts\" title=\"\">is partially decommissioned</a>.</p> <p>Several thorium initiatives are under way outside the UK. In the US, Flibe Energy is developing a thorium reactor based on designs developed in the 1960s by the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.</p> <p>China is also developing different types of thorium reactors, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/01/india-thorium-nuclear-plant\" title=\"\">India is expected to start construction in four or five years</a> of one that uses solid thorium fuel.</p> <p>Thorium is an abundant, mildly radioactive element that occurs naturally around the world. The largest reserves exist in Australia, the US, Turkey, India, Brazil and Venezuela, according to the World Nuclear Association.</p>",
  "<p>Helen Goulden has recently found herself cast as one of the leading decision-makers in a wide movement in the UK to inspire more people to give more time, money and expertise to good causes, and to help make giving a cultural norm.</p> <p>The director of Nesta's Public Services Lab is responsible for the<a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/giving\" title=\"\"> Innovation in Giving Fund</a> - a \u00a310m fund launched in September 2011 by Nick Hurd, Minister for Civil Society, as part of a \u00a334m package to increase levels of giving.</p> <p>So far two strands of the fund have been launched. Firstly a call for 'game-changing innovations', which was open to ideas from all sectors and types of organisation to increase the giving and exchange of time, assets, skills, resources and money. And secondly the Open Innovation Programme, which will support 28 medium-to-large charities to begin partnerships with existing giving innovations, and develop these ideas within their own organisation.</p> <p>Goulden says one noticeable gap among the applications for the initial open call for ideas was that there were numerous applications from digital entrepreneurs, start ups, social enterprises, local authorities, and even from universities, but hardly any from charities.</p> <p>\"Of 450 applications, I think only one charity actually applied to the first round of funding,\" she says. \"We were surprised.\"</p> <p>She says feedback has shown that some small charities in particular might have been inhibited by the application process, which involved submitting a short video clip in which an organisation needed to explain its idea. But she says, if this was the case, then that feedback in itself was interesting.</p> <p>\"If you look at the rise of crowdfunding sites and the ways in which people are fundraising now, it is increasingly moving towards involving rich media,\" she says. \"So it's something that we've taken away as a learning to think about how we can support the sector to develop those skills.\"</p> <p>Although only two of the five planned strands of the fund have been launched so far, Goulden says she has already started to notice some strong themes emerging in today's giving environment.</p> <p>One is the growing focus on developing innovative approaches to integrate giving more seamlessly into people's everyday lives. Goulden gives the examples of the Pennies Foundation, which allows people to top up a bill to the nearest pound, with the additional money going to charity, or the Good Gym, which enables people to combine exercise with volunteering.</p> <p>There are also ideas, she says, to potentially try to use Oyster cards for giving at tube stations, instead of asking people to give cash to collections tins, when often people do not have cash readily available.</p> <p>\"It's about transactions that don't require much thought and are quite easy to do,\" she says. \"There's one question to consider with this trend though: how tolerant is the general public of being consistently and persistently asked to give small amounts?\"</p> <p>Another theme that Goulden has watched grow it reciprocal giving. \"We see a load of ideas that focus on offering rewards or incentives that reciprocate for your social action,\" she says. \"It's a little bit controversial because the longer term evidence suggests that extrinsic motivation or rewards actually erode your intrinsic motivation to do things. Although research is hugely polarised on that.\"</p> <p>Goulden says that if charities were to look more carefully at rewards for giving, they should draw expertise from the commercial sector. \"If you look in the commercial world and look at rewards, they are very closely aligned to loyalty,\"</p> <p>she says. \"If you are accruing and building a relationship which is reciprocal, that feels like it has longevity, not like a campaign or a gimmick.\"</p> <p>Goulden says one of the final three strands of the Innovation in Giving fund will focus on business giving. This strand, which is still being designed, will be launched in the Autumn, and is likely to focus on SMEs and family business giving, she says.</p> <p>\"We know there's lots of work that happens in the corporate sector, but it's not very visible, it's not really acknowledged and they can probably do more without doing very much,\" she says. \"I think the first thing was to think about how we could make it more visible.\"</p> <p>Another of the strands will focus on volunteer centres, says Goulden, given the \"incredible challenges\" many of them are facing.</p> <p>\"We are acknowledging that, yes, volunteer centres haven't quite got enough money to do what they used to do, and we want to ask: does that represent a decent opportunity to fundamentally re-examine what it is they do?\" she says. \"Whether new technology can help, or whether there are more compelling ways of developing volunteering opportunities that appeal to a much wider audience.\"</p> <p>The final strand of the fund will focus on \"mass civic particpations\". Goulden says she is interested in how mass participation can be bought about, without it necessarily being linked to a unique event like the Olympics.</p> <p>\"We know that things like the Olympics volunteering, and giving to the Haiti appeal happen because they are unique or catastrophic events,\" she says. \"If you take away that unique quality, galvanising the same amount of participation and enthusiasm is very, very hard.

  "<p>A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team</p> <h2><a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/07/eu-to-banks-assume-all-pcs-are-infected/\">EU to banks: assume all PCs are infected &gt;&gt; Krebs on Security</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>An agency of the European Union created to improve network and data security is offering some blunt, timely and refreshing advice for financial institutions as they try to secure the online banking channel: \"Assume all PCs are infected.\"</p> </blockquote> <p> From a few weeks ago, but very relevant.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/\">iPhone 5 - View countries with supported LTE networks &gt;&gt; Apple</a></h2> <p>Worth noticing: different models exist and will work with different networks (or not) in different countries. The good news: the UK ones work in Germany, Australia, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33642_7-57509530-292/windows-8-gets-browser-ballot-amid-eu-antitrust-probe/\">Windows 8 gets 'browser ballot' amid EU antitrust probe | Windows 8 - CNET Reviews</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Microsoft is pushing out an update to Windows 8 users to enable the \"browser ballot\" screen, even though the forthcoming operating system's release date is set for over a month away.</p> <p> Windows 8 users in Europe are now given the choice of which browser - including Microsoft's own Internet Explorer - they wish to install.</p> </blockquote> <p> Good for Chrome, if it has a Windows 8 Metro version. Does it?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/apple-as-the-last-hope-for-growth-in-business-pcs/\">Apple as the last hope for growth in business PCs &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>In a broad report on global information technology spending that it plans to publish on Monday, Forrester Research estimates that government and business purchases of computers will grow a meager 1.7%, to $146.6bn, in 2012 from the year before. Forrester includes tablet computers like the iPad in its forecast; sales of iPads to businesses are booming. Forrester estimates that business spending on iPads will rise 76% to nearly $10bn this year.</p> <p> That growth, along with a 9% increase in business spending on Macs to $6.7bn, will help offset what Forrester expects to be a dismal year for PCs and tablets that run Windows.</p> </blockquote> <p> An unimaginable headline only a few years ago.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-wrote-all-2179-words-of-facebooks-s-1-founder-letter-on-his-phone/\">Zuckerberg Wrote All 2,178 Words Of Facebook's S-1 Founder Letter On His Phone | TechCrunch</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>In a riveting conversation today at TechCrunch Disrupt, Zuckerberg underscored and underscored and underscored again the importance of mobile for Facebook. He gave a telling and sort of chilling anecdote, for those of us who know how difficult it is to monetize mobile: \"Want to know something sort of funny?\" he told TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, \"You know the Founder's Letter in the S-1, well I wrote that on my phone.\"</p> <p> Zuck's feat is super impressive, considering the letter is about the size of your average MG Siegler post -- 2,178 words according to my Word document word count, if you don't include Zuckerberg's signature.</p> </blockquote> <p> It includes the letter, which is extremely long. He may have written it on the phone, but we suspect it was edited on a larger screen. But it points to a key trend: smartphones can be content creation devices for more than trivially short content. (Did he dictate it, we wonder? That would be really interesting.)</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/09/12/key-disclosure-laws-can-be-used-to-confiscate-bitcoin-assets/\">Key disclosure laws can be used to confiscate Bitcoin assets &gt;&gt; Forbes</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Key disclosure laws may become the most important government tool in asset seizures and the war on money laundering. When charged with a criminal offense, that refers to the ability of the government to demand that you surrender your private encryption keys that decrypt your data. If your data is currency such as access control to various amounts of bitcoin on the block chain, then you have surrendered your financial transaction history and potentially the value itself.</p> </blockquote> <p> There's bound to be some good news about BitCoin out there somewhere, surely?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/12/13/what_alec_baldwin_doesnt_know_about_air_travel/\">What Alec Baldwin doesn't know about air travel &gt;&gt; Salon.com</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Can a cellphone really interfere with a plane's systems and avionics? The answer is that it's highly unlikely, but possible. That's not the answer you want, I know, but like almost everything in commercial aviation, it depends. For example, although a plane's electronics are designed with interference in mind, if the shielding is old or faulty there's a greater potential for trouble.</p> </blockquote> <p> We've sailed around this buoy before; if the shielding is old or faulty, it needs replacing for reasons other than phones. The key reason to ban hard-edged objects flying around the cabin if there's an emergency.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/12/3319822/tube-map-radio-yuri-suzuki\">Designer builds functioning radio with London tube map circuit board &gt;&gt; The Verge</a></h2> <p>The first clickbait headline ever that is not controversial. You simply have to see this. (Thanks @tehgreatgonzo for the link.)</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/design/2012/09/iphone_design_documents_from_the_samsung_trial_reveal_more_than_ever_about_apple_s_secretive_design_process_.single.html\">'It smelled something like pizza': how the iPhone was made &gt;&gt; Slate Magazine</a></h2> <p>Good compression of the rambling testimony from the Samsung-Apple trial to tell the tale of the iPhone's genesis: </p> <blockquote> <p>Jobs himself was particularly taken by two features that Bas Ording, a talented user-interface designer, had built into the tablet prototype. One was \"inertial scrolling\"--when you flick at a list of items on the screen, the list moves as a function of how fast you swipe, and then it comes to rest slowly, as if being affected by real-world inertia. Another was the \"rubber-band effect,\" which causes a list to bounce against the edge of the screen when there were no more items to display. When Jobs saw the prototype, he thought, \"My god, we can build a phone out of this,\" he told the D Conference in 2010.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.
