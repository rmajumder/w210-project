  "<p>With its intimidating Washington headquarters and teams of crack young policy wonks jetting into troubled countries to read the riot act, the International Monetary Fund has a reputation as a bastion of economic orthodoxy.</p> <p>But Christine Lagarde's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/11/act-bravely-economy-christine-lagarde\" title=\"\">intervention last week at the fund's annual meetings in Tokyo</a>, where she warned the world's finance ministers against slashing public budgets too far, too fast, showed that in the topsy-turvy world of economics after the crunch, the most conservative institutions have sometimes been in the vanguard of the intellectual revolution.</p> <p>In the midst of the deepest and longest-lasting economic malaise since the Great Depression, you might expect practitioners of economics to be wracked with self-doubt, academic departments from California to Cambridge sweeping away the old thinking that gave intellectual heft to the claims of City investment firms to be spreading risk and making the financial world a safer place.</p> <p>But as the Nobel committee prepares to announce this year's winner of the economic sciences laureate tomorrow, David Blanchflower, the US economist and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, says most people in the profession have sailed on unperturbed: \"Economics proceeds as if nothing has happened since 2008. Everybody's going on doing exactly the same things they always did, teaching the same classes.\"</p> <p>As for the forecasting record of many of the world's most eminent economic institutions, not least the Bank of England, he says, \"In many ways, we would have been better off to hire a monkey to throw darts at a dartboard.\"</p> <p>The Bank, as well as the independent office for budget responsibility established by George Osborne, and the vast majority of thinktanks and City forecasters, failed to anticipate the severity of the Great Recession, and the painstaking nature of the recovery.</p> <p>Yet many economists persist in clinging to their cherished mathematical constructions of the world, simply postponing the upturn each quarter when confronted with the reality that it has failed to materialise. And few have conceded that some of the fundamental tenets of their work \u2013 that individuals are perfectly rational, or markets always clear at the right price \u2013 need to be junked.</p> <p>There are islands of resistance. Two former winners of the economics Nobel, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, have used their prominence as public intellectuals over the past five years to issue repeated rebukes to policymakers for failing to grasp the scale of the crisis, and take sufficiently radical action to protect the economy from the worst ravages of the downturn.</p> <p>Maverick thinkers such as <a href=\"http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/\" title=\"\">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>, the author of <em>Black Swan</em>, whose latest book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846141560\" title=\"\"><em>Antifragile</em></a>, on the fragility of systems, was cited by Sir Mervyn King in a speech last week, have sought to popularise the fact that model-based, mathematised economics is based on fundamental misunderstandings of the world.</p> <p>But Krugman and Stiglitz were already well-established as radicals, with strong sympathies for the Keynesian analysis that premature public spending cuts would inflict untold damage.</p> <p>The IMF's shift, from cheerleading for austerity to advocating a gentler approach, shows just how much old orthodoxies are crumbling in the face of the facts. Five years after the onset of the crisis, the eurozone is on the brink of collapse and the UK is mired in a double-dip recession, despite embracing drastic deficit cuts.</p> <p>Eric Beinhocker is the executive director of Oxford's Institute for New Economic Thinking, part of a transatlantic effort to rethink the basic tenets taught to students over recent decades. He says: \"The crisis has revealed enormous gaps in economists' understanding of the linkages between the financial system and the broader economy. Before the crisis, few economists would have predicted that trouble in an obscure corner of the US mortgage market could cascade into a global calamity.\"</p> <p>He argues that there is lots of work going on to address these shortcomings, but \"some advocate tweaking existing models, while others feel a more radical rethink is needed\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-portes\" title=\"\">Jonathan Portes</a>, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, falls into the latter camp. He's a fierce critic of the government's deficit-cutting strategy. But he says that in microeconomics \u2013 the bottom-up study of individual firms and markets \u2013 it would be wrong to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p> <p>\"I don't think the crisis tells us much about the fundamental underpinnings of microeconomics,\" he says. However, he believes where economists failed was in assuming that finance worked just like any other market: \"When it came to financial companies, it turned out we needed to think about them completely differently. More markets are not necessarily better.\"</p> <p>He adds that one lesson economists may need to learn is to be more humble about the predictive power of their economic models, however neat and precise the mathematics that underlies them. Complex mathematical equations have replaced what Blanchflower calls \"the economics of walking about,\" as the foundation of the modern subject.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/jun/21/capitalism-red-tooth-claw-keynes\" title=\"\">Lord Skidelsky, economic historian and biographer of Keynes</a>, agrees: \"It may be that there's no perfect model, and that the quest for one is an error. Maybe we need different models, different theories, for different situations, and that's the best we can do. Keynes said economics was a moral science, not a natural science \u2013 by which I mean that it has to take into account the variability of human situations.\"</p> <p>In other words, economics is not physics, because people are by their nature unpredictable. No one is going to discover an economic \"God particle\" that explains why someone decides to sell their house, hire an extra worker or buy a new car. \"There's no new paradigm; and perhaps the search for one is a bit misguided.\"</p> <p>As for tomorrow's Nobel prize, Skidelsky says it may tell us more about passing intellectual fads than fundamental truths about the economic world. \"My general feeling is that Nobel prizes in economics very closely follow current fashions in the discipline.\"</p>",
  "<p>Incomes per head in the west have increased 40 fold over the last 250 years. Capitalism has not accomplished that remarkable feat by itself. It is more down to the combination of science's capacity to transform how we live and a capitalism constantly pushed and prodded by democratic governments towards exploiting those opportunities. Growth in Britain and the west will return when that combination of innovation and good capitalism is rekindled.</p> <p>It is the great general purpose technologies (GPTs) \u2013 the steam engine, the aeroplane and the computer \u2013 that transformed our lives and economies. A GPT is a technology whose extraordinary usefulness demands that the original is constantly reinvented and updated.</p> <p>Thus, today's high-speed passenger train derives from the same technology as a 19th-century steam train, even if the model has been radically transformed. What's more, a GPT has multiple benefits for the economy and society. The train, for example, was not just a means of getting from A to B. It helped create the nation state, transformed the nature of war, fostered urbanisation and served as a catalyst for the growth of national newspapers \u2013 and much more besides.</p> <p>In the 1930s, evolving GPTs helped drive economic recovery, aided by a capitalism that had been reformed after the excesses of the 1920s. Recovery from today's barely contained depression will require the same alchemy. The trouble is Britain, first into the Industrial Revolution, has only thought fitfully about what constitutes a good productive capitalism and the innovation process. And this is etched into our culture and economic thinking.</p> <p>Innovation is much more complex than inventors' light bulb moments, the profit motive and the \"magic\" of markets. In essence, it is about jumps across boundaries to combine something new with the old. But success involves three key preconditions. It needs originators and load bearers of ideas; it needs recipients who are open to the arrival of the new; and it needs mechanisms for sharing and mitigating the existential risk that is associated with innovation.</p> <p>Innovation happens best in open societies that invest in the creation and spreading of knowledge, but also where there are institutions and social contracts to handle the risk. Britain, by this reckoning, should be innovative. What is missing, however, are the systems able to translate the new into great companies.</p> <p>The issue can no longer be dodged. There is no vast imperial market, no North Sea oil, no prospective credit boom to bail us out. Unless Britain can create the networks, the open innovation culture and the institutions to support innovative risk-taking, we will be locked in stagnation for decades.</p> <p>Some foundations are in place, in our great research-based universities. Nearly all are aware of both their responsibilities and their opportunities. The question is how to proceed fast and effectively when in so many areas \u2013 life science, genomics, the brain, sustainable energy, new materials, big data \u2013 the challenges are so huge, the avenues down which science might proceed so many and possibilities for mistakes so expensive. In this context, conventional approaches to research are inadequate.</p> <p>Our great universities are cash constrained, hoping their teams will deliver the breakthrough that can be patented to deliver rich returns, with the research councils reinforcing this approach with ever tighter terms for research grants.</p> <p>What is needed is a revolution. Universities need to be freed from the suffocating inhibition to create patents and copyrights for themselves through go-it-alone research, which often means they replicate each other's work (in areas where, in any case, the chance of success are small).</p> <p>Instead, they should become transformative, open, innovation hubs aiming to create knowledge as a public good. One model is the <a href=\"http://www.thesgc.org/\" title=\"\">Structural Genomics Consortium</a> at Oxford, host to eight leading drug companies that are co-funding frontier research that none could do on their own. This has already achieved more in two years than any single company could have achieved in 10.</p> <p>The issue is risk. Only by co-creating, pooling effort and underwriting the science with public investment many times larger than today's are the breakthroughs likely to happen. The US could be the global leader, given the strength of its universities and the scale of federal support for science. But it is mired in a culture of patenting and copyrighting everything; plus the Republican party wants to slash the crucial state funding. Britain could strike out in a different direction. We should aim to be the world's leading open innovation hub, a magnet for scientific endeavour and creator of public knowledge.</p> <p>But our entrepreneurs and businesses have to be organised to benefit from this shift. Otherwise, we are simply offering the rest of the world a free lunch. We need a German-style system of knowledge transfer into the private sector. We have the <a href=\"http://www.innovateuk.org/\" title=\"\">Technology Strategy Board</a> and business secretary Vince Cable is creating \"Catapult\" centres to undertake commercially orientated research. But the ambition is too limited and the pace of roll-out painfully slow.</p> <p>Our intellectual property regime needs to be reorganised to favour open innovation, experimentation and cheap licensing. The Intellectual Property Office is beginning to tiptoe towards less restrictive patenting; it should be encouraged to go further faster. We need companies to recognise for themselves that innovation is a collaborative process, opening themselves to outside influences and new ideas.</p> <p>One of the aims of the <a href=\"http://biginnovationcentre.com/\" title=\"\">Big Innovation Centre</a> (which I chair) is to provide a catalyst for this way of thinking. But to capitalise on the opportunity, our companies need to be better owned, with committed shareholders dedicated to growing through innovation. They need a financial system that will supply them with the capital and loans they need. Large companies and government alike need to be early adopters of new ideas to provide markets for innovation. And Britain must remain a member of the European single market to offer our companies the chance of producing at continental scale.</p> <p>Better ownership, better finance and open innovation are thus mutually reinforcing \u2013 key ingredients of a new capitalism. Put aside grim austerity and mindless public deficit cutting: the road to nowhere. Britain must set out to be a leading global innovation hub and strain every muscle to pull it off. It is the only conceivable future.</p>",
  "<p>The party political conference season drew to a close last week. The annual ritual is not what it once was, but then neither is the electorate. In the 1950s, nine out of 10 would cast their vote in elections; that era has passed. It may seem difficult to imagine now, but passion, rebellion and agenda-changing debates were once the conference mainstay.</p> <p>In the 90s, for instance, Norman Tebbit won a standing ovation when he embarrassed John Major's government as he railed against the EU's Maastricht treaty. Again, when Tony Blair told conference he was dropping Clause Four and Labour's commitment to nationalisation, that, too, was an electrifying moment, the significance of which reached far beyond the conference hall.</p> <p>Currently, the scale of the challenge facing Britain is immense: how to achieve growth; the impact of deep cuts to the welfare state that stretch beyond 2016; stagnating wages; ever-increasing food and fuel prices; and the continuing EU crisis, to name only a few. But have the parties used their conferences to provide us with the means to address these challenges? In key respects, the answer is no. The appeals made to the electorate have appeared at best muted and disconnected, at worst divisive, shallow and misanthropic, pitching one nebulous tribe against another, \"us\" against the affluent \"them\", strivers against skivers.</p> <p>This year, more than ever, in format, rhetoric and content, the Liberal-Democrats, Labour and Conservative conferences seemed out of touch, not least with their own dwindling band of supporters, many of whom have neither the time nor the budget to attend a jamboree over several days in which, robust fringe debates apart, docility and deference are the norm.</p> <p>We live in an era of social media, phenomena such as the global, web-based <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks\" title=\"\">TED talks </a>and innovatory grassroots activism such as the internet-based <a href=\"http://www.38degrees.org.uk/\" title=\"\">38 degrees</a>. In that context, as Katie Ghose of the <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Electoral Reform Society</a> points out, the unchanging conference paraphernalia of platform, podium and captive audience add weight to the notion that the past three weeks have been the exclusive business of a traditional travelling political class that rightly or wrongly, in the eyes of many of the electorate, are \"all the same\". That has to change.</p> <p>The centrepiece of this conference season was, inevitably, the resurrection of the reputation for leadership of each of the leaders. In the event, Miliband surprised the most, springing to life as a rounded man with a prodigious memory; Cameron defensively sought to define in greater detail his \"compassionate Conservatism\"; while Clegg struggled to explain, with little oratorical polish, how he is not like the other half of the coalition of which he is a part. Propaganda and political posturing are a traditional part of conference life, particularly so in midterm. However, now more than ever, that familiar format needs to be set aside in favour of more serious, inclusive and imaginative speeches and debates about the choices ahead and the outcomes of the different strategies proposed by each of the parties. And the outcomes will undoubtedly be very different.</p> <p>Even once growth is restored, we face a profoundly altered social terrain that demands fresh political responses. We need to define the economy we wish to establish and decide how we think the tensions and imbalances between its constituent parts are organised. It is time for politicians to be honest about the hardships that lie ahead. This will require party leaderships to explore radical policies that have so far been relegated to the fringe of debate.</p> <p>A new element in the reshaping of the welfare state ought to include the living wage. Set at \u00a37 20 an hour against the minimum wage of \u00a36 19, it has growing support from a range of employers and across the political spectrum, including Boris Johnson. It offers the beginning of a realistic basic income, it helps to tackle child poverty, and it takes a step away from taxpayers subsidising the wages of the poorest because too many employers pay too little. It was, however, a marginalised issue during the conference season, as was the question of childcare. How childcare is made available to all who require it, the manner in which the cost is shared and the methods by which quality is maintained are all part of a discussion vital for the prosperity of the country.</p> <p>Just as party leaders should embrace radical, fresh ideas, so too should they eschew simplistic characterisations that sow divisions. Demonising groups in society is a dangerous tactic. Tory attempts to scapegoat lone mothers in the 1980s backfired, as it became obvious that everybody knew somebody who was a lone parent and who defied the scrounger stereotype. Likewise today, a third of the population at some point in their lives receive benefits. The major challenge is not fecklessness but how good people weather the insecurity of perpetual short-term, dead-end jobs.</p> <p>The electorate is increasingly sophisticated. It is well aware that choices taken now will define the basic principles of fairness, social justice and community cohesion (or the lack of it) that mould our society for decades to come. Yet, according to the political research charity, the <a href=\"http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hansard Society, </a>the public is \"disgruntled, disillusioned and disengaged\" with politics That is alarming; a derogation of democracy. As citizens, we have a duty to vote. However, not voting may be more than apathy\u2013 it can be a political act. In the last election, 16 million did not use the ballot box. Over half of those who did cast their votes, voted for a loser. Frustration is palpable.</p> <p>According to the pollsters YouGov, the \"big beast\" political performances at conference have made little impact on ratings. At a time when we need the voting population to be most engaged, too many are turning away. Recent aborted attempts at political reform can't have helped. \"If the medicine's not working,\" Ed Miliband said in his conference speech, \"you change the medicine.\" Before addressing the antidote, it is imperative that politicians of all parties consider whether they have the correct diagnosis of what the electorate seeks in a modern-day democracy.</p>",
  "<p>The etymology of the word \"jacksie\" has recently become a source of dispute among Scotland's amateur linguistic community. Long held to have its origins in obscure cockney rhyming slang, recent tales have emerged placing it much closer to home. For it seems that the word may have been commonly used in the west of Scotland decades before the great 18th-century Clyde vowel shift that divides north-east Glasgow from the south-west. This is the oral faultline that sees the word \"sacks\" become \"secks\" when it reaches Newton Mearns.</p> <p>I have my own theory, though. I think \"jacksie\" was beginning to fade from general use until the great Celtic and Scotland full back Tommy Gemmell, in front of a global television audience, booted Helmut Haller up the arse during a World Cup qualifier between the countries in 1969. Gemmell, incensed at a typically sly ankle tap by Haller, chased the terrified German for fully 20 yards before indeed \"<a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5224180280891536653\" title=\"\">booting him up the jacksie</a>\". Anyone who has witnessed footage of the incident will agree that no other word for the human posterior would have done justice to it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/tommy-gemmell-pays-tribute-to-german-1376529\" title=\"\">Haller</a> was an integral part of the great West Germany team that was unjustly beaten by England in 1966 and reached the semi-finals four years later in Mexico. The match in which he encountered Gemmell's size 10 was a winner-takes-all game played in Hamburg. The Germans eventually triumphed 3-2 in a high-octane thriller that swung this way then that before the World Cup runners-up scored nine minutes from the end against the depleted Scots.</p> <p>Who knows, though, what might have transpired if Gemmell had not been sent off. One of Scotland's two goals that night was scored by Gemmell's Celtic club-mate Jimmy Johnstone. These two, along with the Celtic midfielder Bobby Murdoch, were regarded as the only three world-class players operating in Scotland during that period.</p> <p>Two years previously, they had helped Celtic to become the first British club to lift the European Cup. Yet only very rarely did these three ever play in the same Scotland team. This was due to a selection policy by successive Scotland bosses that regularly put journeyman professionals ahead of three of the best players the nation had ever produced. Consequently, Scotland never qualified for the latter stages of any tournament in this period, despite having the most richly endowed squad ever available to a Scotland manager. One can only guess at the reasons why Celtic's Lisbon Lions earned so few caps between them.</p> <p>At least, in 1969, Scotland's World Cup dream evaporated against the best country in Europe. They had been in contention for a place in Mexico until the final game. Forty three years later, almost to the day, the current Scotland team's hopes of qualifying for Brazil in 2014 ended at the hands of a Welsh side that might not even be the best team in Wales. The <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/scotland-got-what-they-deserved-in-2-1-defeat-1376597\" title=\"\">2-1 defeat in Cardiff</a> on Friday night was an abject performance from a team who were outplayed by the Welsh for almost the entire 90 minutes.</p> <p>Craig Levein, our saturnine manager, seems destined to be removed from his post very soon after winning just three out of his 11 competitive games. The former Dundee United manager deserves no sympathy for he has had a stronger squad available to him than any of his recent predecessors. Eight of the players who featured in Cardiff have played regularly in the English Premier League, the most competitive league in the world. The Scotland displays under Levein seem always to reflect the manager's outlook: permanently gloomy with outbreaks of rain. If a football match had featured in the film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/\" title=\"\"><em>Blade Runner </em></a>Craig Levein's Scotland would have got the gig.</p> <p>In truth, he never recovered after putting a team on the park against an average Czech Republic side that contained no forwards whatsoever. That was an act of folly. Yet he refused to put on a lifejacket that appeared in the form of Steven Fletcher, the only Scottish footballer of the modern generation who can score goals in the Premier League. Levein, though, banished him until it was too late.</p> <p>Miscreants from other countries can get caught racially abusing colleagues; shagging their team-mate's wife; shagging their brother's wife and calling their own governing body twats and still they will be selected for their country. Steven Fletcher sent a text to one of Levein's assistants stating that he didn't want to be selected for the next game. It was not a sin that cried out to the Lord for vengeance. Rather, it required a swift boot up the, well, jacksie followed by a robust verbal rebuke and then an arm round the shoulder. Everyone knows the psyche of a professional footballer is as fragile as a prepubescent schoolgirl's and that they must be treated as such until they retire and can then be readmitted into normal society.</p> <p>But such mismanagement is a motif that constantly occurs in the depressing narrative of Scotland's international football team. In the 60s and 70s, the selectors largely overlooked Celtic's mighty Lions and in the 90s we denied ourselves the services of Duncan Ferguson, the last Scot who knew how to score goals regularly in England's top division. For the last 40 years, with one or two exceptions, we have chosen second- and third-tier managers to manage Scotland while paying them a salary of an English Championship manager. And that's why we get an international team that resembles Huddersfield Town.</p> <p>By the time Scotland's next chance of competing at a World Cup occurs 20 years will have elapsed since our last appearance. This matters because it casts a shadow over our nation. Yes of course I am as jocund and elated as the next chiel at the success of Andy Murray and Chris Hoy and all those nice rowers and sailors. Being good at football, though, matters so much more than these boutique pastimes of the bourgeoisie.</p>",
  "<p>Shisha cafe culture is spreading across the UK, prompting health campaigners to call for venues allowing customers to smoke the distinctive pipes to be subject to tough new licensing laws.</p> <p>Experts fear many shisha smokers are unaware of the health risks they are taking. They claim that shisha smoking \u2013 inhaling flavoured tobacco smoke after it has passed through a water basin \u2013 is significantly more damaging than smoking normal cigarettes.</p> <p>A survey soon to be published by the anti-smoking group Ash says an increasing number of people have tried smoking shisha pipes. \"Around one in 10 adults have tried shisha but sustained use is very rare,\" an Ash spokesman said. \"Users are typically younger men and from particular ethnic communities.\"</p> <p>Figures collected by the British Heart Foundation detail a 210% increase in the number of shisha bars in the UK over five years. In 2007, there were estimated to be 179 bars, compared with 556 this year.</p> <p>In some cities the number of shisha cafes is soaring. Manchester City Council has launched an eight-week health awareness campaign warning of the health risks of smoking shisha pipes after finding that around 30 new shisha bars had opened in the city since 2009.</p> <p>\"There has been an alarming rise in the number of shisha bars and the number of young people taking up smoking through this route,\" the city's public health director, David Regan, told <em>Environmental Health News</em>.</p> <p>Experts said they were concerned many people were unaware of the risks associated with smoking shisha pipes. The BHF survey found that 84% of people thought that using a shisha pipe for an hour was equivalent to inhaling the smoke of 10 cigarettes. In fact, according to the BHF, it is like more than 100.</p> <p>\"The worrying perception is that shisha is safer than cigarettes, but it's not,\" said Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation. \"Despite the wholesome-sounding flavours, shisha tobacco is just as dangerous and is linked to the same life-threatening diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.\"</p> <p>Knapton said there was a need for a change in the law.</p> <p>\"At the moment, you don't need a licence to sell tobacco and shisha but we'd like this to change,\" he said. \"Positive licensing means local councils would have the power to control the number of places selling tobacco and shisha in their area and monitor places for harmful activity such as underage smoking, or smoking indoors. It also means we'd know definitively how many shisha bars there were, and where they were located, so we could target health awareness campaigns more effectively.\"</p> <p>This year the BHF staged pretend shisha lounges at a number of festivals around the UK, which showed a short film on the health risks of shisha pipes.</p> <p>In Westminster, there are now an estimated 150 shisha cafes. The council says some are allowing customers to smoke inside \u2013 the equivalent of a pub lock-in \u2013 and it has taken action in recent months against a number of shisha cafes that let customers smoke in their basements.</p> <p>\"The smoking ban was introduced for health reasons and there have been several prosecutions where shisha has been smoked in the basements of premises, whch really is playing fast and loose with people's wellbeing,\" said Alastair Moss, Westminster city council's deputy cabinet member for the built environment.</p> <p>\"Because of the smoking ban, more and more shisha activity is appearing outside the front and rears of cafes. The trend shows no signs of slowing and the concentration of smells appears to be another issue we will have to look at.\"</p>",
  "<p>One end is a Jewish settlement across the Green Line, the other is close to Israel's haunting memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, Yad Vashem. In between, Jerusalem's light railway travels through Palestinian districts, skirts ultra-orthodox enclaves, grazes the ancient walls of the Old City, turns along historic Jaffa Street, passes the chaotic and colourful <em>shuk</em>, or market, crosses the stunning Bridge of Strings at the city's entrance and heads up to Mount Herzl, where Israel's fallen soldiers are laid to rest. It is an emblematic, as well as a literal, journey through the city.</p> <p>Inside its sleek carriages is a microcosm of Jerusalem's complex population: every degree of Jewishness from bare-headed secular to black-hatted ultra-orthodox, Palestinians, khaki-clad soldiers, recent Russian immigrants, tourists and pilgrims. It seems appropriate, following last week's announcement of a general election in January, to take the political pulse of the city along the artery of the light railway.</p> <p>\"Bibi's going to win,\" shrugs Ran Huri, using incumbent prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's nickname. \"He's charismatic and he has the courage to say what he means. And most people in Israel are rightists.\" The 26-year-old, who is waiting for a train in the settlement of Pisgat Ze'ev, plans to vote for the small pro-settler Jewish Home party \u2013 but, like others, he views Netanyahu's victory as inevitable. \"There's no one better than him,\" says Shmuel Moshe, minding his <em>pitzutzia</em> \u2013 a small shop selling cigarettes, spirits and lottery cards \u2013 near the light railway's tracks. \"There's no one who can beat him. Anyone else will destroy the country.\"</p> <p>\"Bibi's on 33% and Shelly Yacimovich [his nearest rival] is on 20%. It's difficult to believe that gap will change,\" says Mishael Kinkulkin, a 20-year-old soldier drinking coffee in the shuk with his assault rifle across his lap. \"I'll vote Labour because I believe in helping the weakest part of society, but at the end of the day the hottest issue is always security. And that's why Bibi will win.\"</p> <p>\"For sure, Likud [Netanyahu's party] will take it. There's no one else, only Netanyahu. Bibi is a good economist, and is tough on security,\" said Yaakov Halima, 79, an Iraqi-born Jew, who has voted Likud at every election for 60 years. \"Security is the most important issue. There's no one dying from hunger here, everyone has a bit.\"</p> <p>Istavsky Yvgenia, 56, a Russian immigrant, says she knows nothing about politics and has not made up her mind who to vote for. \"But Bibi will win,\" she says, pulling her shopping trolley on to the train on her way to the market.</p> <p>Polls reinforce the views of these random Jerusalemites. <em>Israel Hayom</em>, a giveaway newspaper owned by US casino magnate Sheldon Adelson (who is also Republican candidate Mitt Romney's principal bankroller) predicted that Likud would get 29 out of 120 seats in parliament. The party's nearest rival, Labour, was forecast to win 20, Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu 15, with smaller parties trailing behind. A survey in <em>Haaretz</em> gave 68 seats to the rightwing bloc. On personal ratings, Netanyahu had the backing of 57% of voters \u2013 more than twice that of his nearest rival.</p> <p>According to Tamar Hermann of the Open University of Israel: \"Netanyahu is the only leader on the horizon. There is no other figure on Israel's political scene equal to him in experience, capability and clarity of views.\" Furthermore, she adds, he is a hardliner on security. He looks almost certain to lead another coalition government, the result of Israel's electoral system of proportional representation. \"The balance between the left and right blocs will stay more or less the same, there's no real movement,\" says Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</p> <p>On the left, Labour has made some recovery after a decade of infighting, but its leader, former journalist Shelly Yacimovich, is seen as inexperienced, especially on security, defence and foreign affairs. She has shifted the party's focus away from the Israeli-Palestinian peace process to the social and economic issues voters say rank high in their concerns. Polls predict Labour could win 17 seats compared with its current eight. Meretz, to the left of Labour, and Hadash, an Arab-Jewish communist party, are each forecast to win three or four seats.</p> <p>The demise of the left, which dominated Israeli governments for 30 years after the creation of the state, is due to \"a plethora of reasons\", says Hermann. She cites the collapse of the peace process, the identification of the left with the \"old elite\" of Jews of European heritage, the influx of Russian immigrants who \"dislike anything 'pinkish'\", and the resentment of Mizrahi Jews \u2013 originating from the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 who \"see the left as responsible for their socio-economic isolation\". According to Anshel Pfeffer, writing in <em>Haaretz</em>, the \"moribund\" left has also isolated itself. \"Their voices of conscience, such as authors Amos Oz and David Grossman, have no influence beyond their little bubbles of the already converted.\"</p> <p>The centre ground of Israeli politics is also struggling to challenge Netanyahu's hegemony. Kadima \u2013 the party formed by former prime minister Ariel Sharon after he broke from Likud \u2013 has gone into freefall. In the 2009 election, it emerged as the biggest party with 28 seats, but was unable to form a coalition government. Polls last week predicted it would probably slump to a catastrophic seven seats in January's election.</p> <p>A new party, Yesh Atid, led by former TV presenter Yair Lapid, could make headway, perhaps winning around 17 seats. Its policies are largely unknown, but it is likely to position itself on the centre-right and some predict it will join Netanyahu as a coalition partner.</p> <p>Its place in the polls is attributed to the appeal of its urbane leader. \"Now the leader of a party is of prime importance,\" says Hermann. \"In the past it used to be ideology and party loyalty. This is a process of the Americanisation of Israeli politics in the past 10 years or so.\"</p> <p>Two issues are expected to dominate the three-month election campaign: the economy and security. Last summer saw protests in Israel over food prices, house prices and the cost of raising a family. \"In the past, security was top of the list,\" says Hermann. \"Socio-economic issues were further down. Now they are on an equal footing with security.\"</p> <p>Security, for Netanyahu, primarily means Iran's nuclear programme. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not expected to be a significant factor. Many Israelis are content with the current situation of relative calm and do not dwell on Israel's 45-year occupation. Diskin says Iran will trump all other issues. \"Netanyahu believes there is a real threat. And when there's an external threat, people unite and move to the right.\"</p> <p>In Mahane Yehuda market, shopkeeper Abraham Levy, 63, considers Netanyahu's record. \"Is he a good prime minister? Not 100% on the economy. The lowest parts of society have suffered a lot \u2026 People wait until the end of the day to buy, when prices go down. But on security, he's great. He's tough on the Palestinians, and he is the one to deal with Iran. I've always voted Likud, and I will vote for them again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Such were the state-level machinations behind the failed merger of BAE Systems and EADS, both companies should put the UN on a retainer alongside their investment bank advisors in case they attempt to go through that tortuous rigmarole again. History enthusiasts will have revelled in the revival of Bismarck-era realpolitik by Angela Merkel, who saw through the benefits for Britain's largest defence contractor and the owner of Airbus, and decided there was nothing in it for Germany.</p> <p>But if the past is to be a guide to what BAE does next, then we should cast our minds back to the 1970s, when the British state owned equity in industrial champions such as Rolls-Royce and British Leyland. The Unite trade union had called the proposed BAE/EADS merger an \"unequal negotiation\" because Britain did not own a block of shares in its biggest manufacturing employer, while France and Germany owned 22.35% each. Without such an interest, Unite argues, it does not have the leverage to seek a jobs guarantee from talks. Instead the UK has a \"golden share\" in BAE that blocks foreign ownership but leaves it in a more passive role when France and Germany are actively negotiating the future of EADS and what happens to its 133,000 employees.</p> <p>However, this deal was about Britain trying to reclaim a golden share in another business: Airbus. BAE, and thus much of our high-skilled manufacturing base, is wired into mature defence markets in the UK and US, with Airbus offering lucrative diversity as a civil aerospace powerhouse. The UK used to, effectively, own a golden share in Airbus through BAE's stake in the business, which it sold in 2006. The consequences of that have been clear to view over the past month: David Cameron cheerleading BAE's reintegration into Airbus as a means of securing the future of one of the UK's remaining industrial giants. The government has returned to the 1970s with a strategy of picking industrial winners and aerospace is one of them, but the damage was done when Labour sold the Airbus stake in 2006.</p> <p>Now we must ensure that, having been locked out of the Airbus tent by the French and German governments, the UK remains a leading player in aerospace. The government must act as though it has a golden share in the entire industry and pump money, policy efforts and diplomacy into maintaining Britain's status as the go-to nation for everything from carbon-fibre wings and airliner engines to search-and-rescue helicopters.</p> <p>The UK does 15% of Airbus manufacturing work, at world-class wing facilities in Broughton and Filton, but that used to be closer to 20%. Only by continuing to produce the best aerospace whizzes in the world will it have any hope of maintaining that. Tom Enders, boss of EADS, warned last year that aircraft manufacturing would no longer be a Eurocentric activity at Airbus. \"The best way [to retain Airbus work] is for governments to finance and invest in intellectual infrastructure and support research and technology so that we have a basis to work in the UK in the long term,\" he said. Despite his German nationality, Enders is concerned only with competing in a global market where China is set to break open the Boeing-Airbus duopoly.</p> <p>Maintaining the UK's position as an industrial power \u2013 which it still is, once you cast aside nostalgia for the 70s \u2013 in the face of this competition requires political consensus, as any aerospace executive will tell you. The seeds of the technological breakthroughs in Broughton and Filton were sown decades ago, as evidenced by the number of former apprentices at the top of BAE's and Airbus's UK operations.</p> <p>If France and Germany will not let the UK have corporate influence over the commanding heights of civil aerospace, then successive administrations will have to keep the country there on merit. That means announcements such as this year's \u00a360m investment in a centre of excellence for aerodynamics need to come regularly, and often.</p> <h2>In Love with Swann<br></h2> <p>WH Smith: isn't it wonderful? Don't you love being badgered at the till to buy a cut-price chunk of chocolate? Isn't it great how it's one of the few places at airports you can buy a bottle of water to replace the one that's just been confiscated at the security gate?</p> <p>For most shoppers, the answers to these questions will be a resounding \"no\". It's irritating to be invited, by staff clearly bored of repeating their lines, to load up on Terry's chocolate oranges. And it's only natural to resent the chain's status as near-monopoly supplier of water at airports. A WH Smith's is not a place to cheer the soul.</p> <p>But the business is a minor retailing miracle. WH Smug, as it was dubbed decades ago by Private Eye, has become WH Savvy during Kate Swann's nine years at the helm.</p> <p>As she announced her departure as chief executive this week, the financial statistics for Swann's reign are impressive. Total shareholder return \u2013 dividends plus increase in share price \u2013 since 2004 has been roughly 300%, second only to Next among major retailers. Yet back then, sceptics thought WH Smith was travelling the same sorry road as Woolworths because of its reliance on CDs and DVDs.</p> <p>Swann's key strategy \u2013 and where the leaders of Woolies failed \u2013 was to act early and boldly. The old entertainment lines have been shrunk from 25% of the business to 2%. She also recognised that shops in airports and railway stations offered two gifts to any retailer: they have a captive audience, and the rents are usually turnover-related, which substantially reduces risk. So get more of them. Much of the rest of the revolution relied on a never-ending search for efficiencies in the distribution network.</p> <p>A retail genius? No, just a skilled nuts-and-bolts operator who doesn't waste time on visionary flim-flam. Any number of large retailers could use one of those \u2013 the job offers will come thick and fast. Just don't expect the shopping experience at Swann's next employer to be as uplifting as the share price.</p> <h2>Branching out<br></h2> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland was forced to announce on Friday that it had abandoned its attempt to sell off 316 branches to Santander. That's bad news for Stephen Hester, for whom the deal was meant to mark the latest successful stage in the complex task of shrinking the bailed-out bank.</p> <p>He will now have to cast around for other potential buyers, whose bargaining power is bound to be boosted by the fact that he is under pressure to pull off the sale by the end of 2013, the deadline set by the European commission when the taxpayer rescued the bank.</p> <p>For any of Britain's put-upon bank customers hoping for an upstart to shake up the market, however, Santander's withdrawal could just be good news. The government has been angling for new \"challenger banks,\" to threaten the stranglehold of the Big Four. Whether it's Virgin, the Co-op \u2013 which is already buying more than 600 Lloyds branches \u2013 or startup NBNK, a cut-price fire sale may be another small step towards giving the big boys a run for our money.</p>",
  "<p>Both of Britain's Royal Ballet companies have been dancing <em>Swan Lake</em> this month, and both have seen significant debuts. In Birmingham, Trinidad-born C\u00e9line Gittens became the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/23/celine-gittens-tyrone-singleton-interview\" title=\"\">first black dancer to perform the lead</a> with a British company, while at&#xa0;Covent Garden former Bolshoi star&#xa0;Natalia Osipova gave her own highly individual account. Both dancers were visibly feeling their way in the dual ballerina roles of Odette and Odile.</p> <p>Gittens is not by nature a lyrical, legato performer, but she dances from the heart and with her huge, expressive eyes, and involves you from the first moment in her character's story. As <a href=\"http://www.brb.org.uk/masque/index.htm?act=Production&amp;urn=537\" title=\"\"><strong>Birmingham Royal Ballet</strong>'s Black Swan</a>, she is less vamp than exultant teenager, thrilled at her newfound sexual power and dispatching her fouett\u00e9s with breathless, look-at-me excitement.</p> <p>But then this is a performance of touchingly blurred boundaries. Gittens is not yet a dancer of consummate fluency, but she offers herself to the audience with a trust that is as moving as it is irresistible. It helps that she is framed by one of the world's finest productions of the ballet. Peter Wright's choreography (after Petipa and Ivanov) is crystalline in its beauty and narrative clarity, while Philip Prowse's darkly atmospheric designs suggest the 19th-century gothic revival of Pugin. Tyrone Singleton's sensitive, world-weary Siegfried provides Gittens with a fine romantic foil, partnering her with self-effacing tact, and William Bracewell is a sympathetic and elegant Benno. Delia Mathews, who also made a notable debut as Odette-Odile this month, commands the attention with a Swan Maiden of serene authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397637566\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/11/1349975599352/Swan-Lake-by-the-Royal-Ba-008.jpg\" alt=\"Swan Lake by the Royal Ballet\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Swan Lake at the Royal Opera House. Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The contrast with the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/swan-lake-by-anthony-dowell\" title=\"\"><strong>Royal Ballet</strong> production</a> is striking. Few would take exception to Anthony Dowell's assiduously researched choreographic text, but aside from the swan passages, this is now buried under layers of specious business.</p> <p>Act 1 is a near-illegible rout, with Carlos Acosta's Siegfried pacing for what seems like hours among fatuously quaffing courtiers, emptily gesturing bystanders and tidal waves of gurning peasantry. Act 2 starts badly too, with an inane scene of comedy drunkenness from Siegfried's companions. And then, effortlessly transcending the foolishness around her, Osipova makes her entrance.</p> <p>Like Gittens she is not a natural Swan Queen. Petite and gamine, she is a natural soubrette, and it's unlikely that she would have been given Odette-Odile at the Bolshoi (which is undoubtedly one of the reasons why she left, and is now principal dancer with the Mikhailovsky Ballet in St Petersburg and with American Ballet Theatre). If she doesn't quite succeed in convincing us of Odette's tragedy, however, she does give us dancing of exquisite assurance and control. No grandstanding, no exhibitionistic Russian port de bras; all is pared back to choreographic first principles, to steely line and form. It's an affecting, intelligent and closely considered reading. This is Odette as creature of&#xa0;the wild, flinchingly shy but gradually and warily warming to Acosta's courtship.</p> <p>As Odile, Osipova is on more familiar ground, cutting loose with a display of minxy mischief culminating in fouett\u00e9s of eye-popping speed and virtuosity. At times her comic playing becomes a little broad, but in this she may be influenced by the breathtaking vulgarity of the Act 3 set and the dismayingly low-camp behaviour around her. Acosta provides noble support, and there are fine individual performances by Claire Calvert, Paul Kay and Yuhui&#xa0;Choe, but not even a star of Osipova's lustre can disguise the&#xa0;fact that this production has long since run its course.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Homeland</strong> (C4) | <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/homeland/4od#3421065\" title=\"\">4oD</a></p> <p><strong>Wonderland: I Was Once a Beauty Queen</strong> (BBC2) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01ncgvl/Wonderland_Series_5_I_Was_Once_a_Beauty_Queen/\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p> <p>The scriptwriters for <strong>Homeland </strong>faced two big problems when they sat down to plot the second series. The first was what to do about Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes), the brilliant but unstable intelligence officer who is one of two lead characters in the show. The second was what to do about Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), the all-American military hero and covert jihadist who is the other lead character.</p> <p>What lent both Carrie and Brody such volatile dynamism in the first series were their split personalities: her sharpening bipolarity and his stealthy duplicity. But the beginning of the second series found them both worryingly grounded.</p> <p>Brody had reached his dramatic climax in last season's finale deep within the bunker of the State Department. In a scene of near-fatal tension, he backed out of blowing up the smarmy vice-president and himself. Come the moment of truth, he&#xa0;revealed himself as a lover of life, not death. For the sake of his family and, more critically, the second series, he just couldn't cut it as a martyr.</p> <p>In Carrie's case, having reached a peak of visionary mania with her colour-coded wallchart, she was drummed out of the agency and submitted herself to electric shock treatment to cure her obsession with&#xa0;Brody.</p> <p>In the opening episode of the new series, she was living quietly, teaching English to foreign students, and self-medicating her way to contentment, while Brody was safely ensconced in his new role as a congressman and loving father and husband.</p> <p>So how to return them to the frontline of terror and personal crisis? The answer was quickly and with minimum fuss. Estes (David Harewood), the CIA boss who had destroyed her career, simply commanded Carrie to go to Beirut to meet an informant as a matter of utmost national security. And that was it, she was off.</p> <p>And just as effortlessly, Brody was re-recruited to the jihadi cause by a posh minx of a journalist covertly working for the arch-baddie, Abu Nazir. He deliberated for all of a suspenseless second before lamely falling into line.</p> <p>Both manoeuvres left a lot to be desired in terms of character motivation and audience persuasion, but then the writers no doubt realised that it would take two or three episodes to set up convincing scenarios, if such things could even be constructed.</p> <p>So instead \u2013 wham bam \u2013 we're back to where we were. Except there were several new developments of varying degrees of shockingness. At the least surprising end of the scale was the news that Israel had bombed Iran's nuclear facilities. But by some way the most astounding turn of events was the discovery by Brody's wife that her husband was\u2026 a Muslim.</p> <p>Had she spotted him emerging from a pod beside his own corpse, Mrs Brody couldn't have been more horrified. As she protested, as though witness to some catastrophic transgression of the universe's fundamental laws of nature: \"This cannot happen!\"</p> <p>One of the side pleasures of <em>Homeland</em> is the confident manner in which it yokes global affairs and familial ties. The effect works best in the relationship between Brody and his teenage daughter, where religious conviction and adolescent angst merge with such cunning as to be almost impossible to tell apart.</p> <p>Brody thinks it's his duty to attack the American establishment because he is a Muslim, whereas his daughter is attracted to the otherness of Islam because she's so appalled by the establishment face of America. Alienation is their private bond.</p> <p>The other notable plot point is that the informant Carrie has been sent to see in Beirut is the wife of a Hezbollah commander. I'm not sure if it was ever made explicit in the first series, but it was certainly and obviously implicit that Abu Nazir was part of the international hotch-potch of Sunni extremist groups with links to the Saudi state.</p> <p>But you don't need to be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gardner_(journalist)\" title=\"\">Frank Gardner</a> to know that Hezbollah is a Shia organisation backed by Saudi Arabia's great enemy, Iran. Are we about to see a pragmatic unification of two historic antagonists to rival the Soviet-Nazi pact for its rhetoric-defying implausibility? And more importantly, will Carrie ever sleep with Brody again? It's surely appropriate that the answer to these two separate spheres of drama lies with a bipolar secret agent.</p> <p>Proving once again that there is nothing so distant as the recent past, <strong>Wonderland: I Was Once a Beauty Queen </strong>journeyed back to that far-off era, the 1970s. This was a time when, as one former beauty queen noted, up to 20 million people would watch young women in swimming costumes and high heels doing not very much at all. But in those days a similar number would watch televised darts and snooker, so all we know is that when there were only three TV channels 20 million Britons would watch <em>anything</em>.</p> <p>As they were over 18 at the time, none of the women complained of being molested by Jimmy Savile, but they none the less had to put up with some painfully antediluvian male attitudes. During an on-stage interview&#xa0;in 1970, when one hopeful announced that she had hopes of becoming a bank manageress, a gawkily lecherous David Vine was astonished. \"I had no idea that there was such a thing,\" he said, trying boyfully to sound like a man.</p> <p>On another occasion, an oleaginous announcer outlined a contestant's attributes. \"Those measurements you&#xa0;see are 37-25-37,\" he said smoothly.&#xa0;\"She measures the same, exactly, upside down.\" At that time, talking about women as if they were cars was thought to be almost as sophisticated as talking about cars as if they were women.</p> <p>But what of the women themselves? Thirty or 40 years on, they expressed few regrets. In fact, none of them demonstrated much in the way of personal insight, let alone a wider social perspective. With one or two exceptions, their moral outlook on life was based on the understanding that beauty is a hallmark of material entitlement. And a series of footballers, businessmen and wealthy playboys did what was necessary to support that understanding, at least while their beauty lasted.</p> <p>The only note of dissent came from one former Miss UK who bemoaned the quality of men she tended to attract in her youth. They were all, she said, of the \"drunken, obnoxious\" type. The next moment, in what might be seen as an inspired or unfortunate piece of editing, depending on whether or not you're Prince Andrew, she mentioned that Prince Andrew had once invited her to dinner.</p>",
  "<p>'It's all over,\" says TC Boyle. \"This planet is doomed. In a very short time, we're probably not even going to have culture or art. We're going to be living like we're in Cormac McCarthy's <em>The Road</em>.\" In 2000, Boyle published <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780747553465\" title=\"\"><em>A Friend of the Earth</em></a>, a novel set in 2025 in a California recently devastated by ecological collapse, where numerous animals have become extinct and rain falls heavily for the majority of the year. \"Looking back,\" he says, \"I should have probably moved the date forward to 2015. We live in a very different world to the one that 19th-century novelists lived in. It's a godless world, without hope.\"</p> <p>Going right back to his astonishingly assured 1982 debut novel, <em>Water Music</em>, in which explorer Mungo Park travels to a pungent west Africa to find the Niger river, Boyle's work has shown a fear and respect for the power of nature. Recently, however, he has seemed more concerned with environmental issues than ever. Again and again in his fiction, man butts up against animal and environment and comes off second best. This was true of <em>Drop City</em>, his 2003 novel about 1970s hippies attempting to live the communal life in Alaska; of the weatherbeaten tales contained in his recent collections <em>After the Plague</em>, <em>Tooth and Claw</em> and <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408809495\" title=\"\"><em>Wild Child</em></a>; and of last year's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408821701\" title=\"\"><em>When the Killing's Done</em></a>, about conflict between biologists and animal rights protesters. And it's certainly the case in his new book, <em>San Miguel</em>, set on one of the Pacific Channel Islands between the 1880s and 1940s.</p> <p>Boyle grew up reading Kafka and Flannery O'Connor, and was taught in the 70s at the Iowa Writers' Workshop by John Irving and the \"absolute master\" John Cheever, but these days he is just as likely to be reading scientific non-fiction with such ominous titles as <em>The Coming Plague</em> or <em>Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic</em>.</p> <p>\"I worry about everything \u2013 every sick baby, every vanishing species \u2013 all the time,\" says Boyle. He says that the lack of control he feels in the rest of his life has led to him becoming a \"complete control freak\" as a writer. \"I've been lucky in my career in that nobody has ever said 'no' to me. I don't require much editing. The book you see on the shelves is pretty much the book I hand in. I'm not a member of any organisation or team. I was in a band once, but I was the singer. I'm enslaved to writing to the point where I sacrifice almost everything else.\" Since 1979, when his first short story collection, <em>Descent of Man</em>, was published, this obsessive work rate has resulted in six further story collections and 14 novels, all of them written with a breakneck energy that comes across on the page.</p> <p>Boyle says he was \"essentially a good kid\" but \"a hyperactive one\" who got up to a fair bit of mischief in his home town of Peekskill, 30 miles outside New York City. In his teens, he took drugs and raced cars around the town with friends: \"The normal stuff when there's nothing going on in your life and you need something to prove you're unique and show you're a man.\" Does he still think there's a touch of that hyperactivity in him now? \"Well, look at me,\" he says. \"What do you&#xa0;think?\"</p> <p>Boyle is sinewy, apparently fatless, with frizzy, thinning hair the colour of beach sand that's just been slightly dug into, a piercing stare and a goatee beard that looks at home in its environment in a way very few goatee beards do. At well over 6ft, his tallness is not that of a 63-year-old man, but that of a teenager who comes back from a school holiday unexpectedly&#xa0;elongated.</p> <p>In his early 20s, he took heroin, lived the hippie life in a communal house in Peekskill (he'd later reinvent the town as Peterskill in 1987's three-century-spanning settler-Native-American-hippie opus <em>World's End</em>), until a friend overdosed and he realised \"there was more to life than sitting about on bar stools with a bunch of down and outs\". Perhaps as a result of those years, there's something just a bit more of the rebel about Boyle's work than there is in the work of most literary novelists writing about America and its history on an epic canvas.</p> <p>I started reading Boyle when I was 20, around the time his brilliant <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780747525721\" title=\"\"><em>The Tortilla Curtain</em></a> \u2013 which is to affluent LA and Mexican immigrants what <em>The Bonfire of the Vanities</em> is to Park Avenue and the New York projects \u2013 was published. Cred-conscious, music-loving friends had recommended Jack Kerouac's <em>On the Road </em>to me, which seemed just as fantastic and magical as they said it was until I actually tried to read it. Boyle's work, though, was everything that I'd been promised <em>On the Road</em> would be: it was rock'n'roll, full of exciting, vivid American landscapes, utopian, manic, but it felt like there was something chunkier to bite into, something that would stay with me.</p> <p>Boyle actually has fond memories of reading <em>On the Road</em> in his youth, but he did write a story, \"Beat\", for his 1994 collection <em>Without a Hero</em>, in which he painted Kerouac as a somewhat laughable mummy's boy. Then again, taking a much romanticised utopian concept and tearing it down is one of his favourite pastimes. It's perhaps not surprising that he served time as a hippie <em>and</em> a punk. Whether he's severing a foot in a motorbike accident in <em>World's End</em> or making a gentle, dying woman live in a glorified shed in an almost constantly howling gale on an island known as \"the graveyard of the Pacific\" in <em>San Miguel</em>, he seems to delight in putting his characters through misery, but his books are never without hope, never quite doomy, always propelled by a frenzied desire to push on towards a brighter future.</p> <p>By his standards, <em>San Miguel</em> is quite sedate. By the standards of most other historical fiction, it's a bareback ride into the abyss. He calls it his \"first non-ironic, non-comic historical book\", although some might say there is a black comedy in the repeatedly dashed hopes of the three women, Marantha, Edith and Elise, all of whom have to put up with extremely isolated life on their island with bull-headed, delusional men. \"In the end, it's exploring the same idea as my other books,\" he said. \"As humans, we all want our own island.\" He pauses, takes a sip of water. \"Of course, the truth is, we're never going to get it.\"</p> <p><em>San Miguel is published by Bloomsbury </em></p>",
  "<p>Andrew Watts, 52, is looking nervously at the darkening sky. We are standing at the edge of a field, where his new red-and-yellow seed drill is sowing wheat at an impressive clip. The vast machine can cover six hectares (15 acres) an hour but it may not be fast enough to get the whole field done before the rain starts.</p> <p>Watts runs 2,500 hectares of farmland in Hertfordshire from a cluttered office, its walls adorned with pictures of tractors. It has been a difficult year, he says. Having just come through the second-wettest summer on record, he is already two weeks behind schedule, and is anxious about pushing next year's harvest out too far.</p> <p>\"What farmers mustn't do is let one bad year become another bad year. You have to believe next year is going to be good, otherwise ...\" he tails off.</p> <p>He admits the weather in his area was better than in some parts of the country, particularly around harvest time: \"We didn't fare too bad in pockets. At one point we were lagging behind 2008, which was my latest harvest in recent memory, but then we just had a couple of little windows and we cracked into it.\"</p> <p>Other farms were not as lucky, and last week the National Farmers' Union said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">wheat yields were at their lowest point since the late 1980s</a>.</p> <p>It is not just British farmers who are worried. While we have been drowning in rain, the US has suffered one of the worst droughts in more than half a century, which has ravaged its corn crop. The resultant shortage has driven animal feed prices so high that there have been reports of farmers feeding their cows with chocolate bars and ice-cream sprinkles. A heatwave in Russia, meanwhile, has stoked fears that Moscow may impose an export ban, further exacerbating global shortages and fuelling fears of food riots.</p> <p>This combination of freak weather has led to one of the worst global harvests in years. With demand still rising, policymakers have entered crisis mode, reigniting a furious debate about whether we should be using agricultural land to grow crops for biofuels.</p> <p>This week, the European commission will fan the flames with a proposal that will tear through the biofuels industry, effectively ensuring the decline of a European sector estimated to be worth \u20ac17bn (\u00a314bn) a year. Industry associations say millions of pounds of investment could be wasted in the UK alone.</p> <p>The proposal was leaked in September and came as a huge shock to the industry and to campaigners. It proposed to limit the use of crop-based biofuels to meet the EU's 10% target for renewable transport energy by 2020. The leaked document suggested that only half of that target be met with biofuels from food crops \u2013 such as wheat, sugar cane and oilseed rape. Clare Coffey, policy advisor at ActionAid, which has been campaigning against biofuels for the past two years, said: \"Nobody was expecting the 5% cap, that was totally new.\"</p> <p>The most controversial part of the proposal, however, was the inclusion of new ways of calculating how green biofuels actually are. For the first time, the EC will take into account the extra carbon emitted when farmers switch from growing crops for food to growing crops for fuel. The theory is that demand for food remains more or less constant, so production will move elsewhere.</p> <p>Indirect land-use change (ILUC) theory attempts to measure the carbon emissions associated with clearing new land \u2013 by cutting down rainforests, for example \u2013 to grow food. The theory has split scientists, farmers, policymakers and industry, causing lengthy delays in legislation. The NFU maintains that there are huge flaws in the science, while the UK Renewable Energy Association (REA) says objections are not based on science at all but are purely political.</p> <p>The arguments hinge on the fact that, when you take ILUC emissions into account, biodiesel appears to be as harmful to the environment as fossil fuels, if not more so. And if biodiesel does nothing to help fuel suppliers meet emissions targets, demand for it will disappear overnight.</p> <p>On top of that, the draft law introduces a new requirement that all biofuel plants achieve at least 60% greenhouse gas emission savings. Robert Vierhout, secretary-general of the European renewable ethanol association, ePURE, says: \"It is like being shot, not once, but three times.\"</p> <p>Perhaps in an attempt to soften the blow, the commission said it would double- or quadruple-count certain advanced biofuels in the race to reach the 10% renewable transport fuel target. As such, it hopes to drive investment in so-called second-generation biofuels: those produced from waste, algae or residue from other processes. But the industry remains wary. Many of these processes have not yet been proven, and investors who lost money on first-generation biofuels will be unwilling to provide more funding to push the technology forwards.</p> <p>The proposal will be published on 17 October and may have changed slightly since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/21/biodiesel-industry-eu-policy-changes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">it was leaked last month</a>, but the basics are expected to remain the same. It will go before the European parliament and member states, and talks will probably drag on throughout 2013. No law could realistically come into force until the beginning of 2015. But the industry will feel the effect of investors running scared given the apparent shift in policy.</p> <p>Coffey at ActionAid says, with just a hint of schadenfreude: \"It will be a black day for the biofuel industry. The basic message is that there is no future in crop-based biofuels.\"</p> <p>Back on Mentley Farm, Watts says a collapse in the biodiesel industry would be a disaster for Britain's farmers. He was one of many to cash in on the rising price of oilseed rape as demand from biodiesel producers increased. Production has increased by 50% over the past decade, and anyone who has travelled through Britain in early summer will have noticed the prevalence of the crop, which has bright yellow flowers. Though oilseed rape is also turned into vegetable oil, Britain's farmers export almost 70% of their crop, and most of that goes into the biodiesel market.</p> <p>It is no surprise the farmers are fighting any change to current targets. Consistent demand for their crops from biodiesel producers protects them against the volatility of global food prices. And the productivity of their land is also increased, because a byproduct of making wheat into ethanol can be used as a high-protein animal feed, so farmers get two products for the price of one. This factor became even more crucial, this year, as the price of soya shot up by more than 30%.</p> <p>\"What's killing the pig and poultry industry at the moment is high feed costs,\" says Watts. \"One of the major reasons for that is because they are reliant on imported soya, and that's really causing them grief.\"</p> <p>Then there is the argument that farmers simply respond to demand. Watts says he switched to growing oilseed rape when the biofuels market wanted it. Before that, there was simply not enough demand for it as a vegetable oil.</p> <p>At this, Coffey lights up: \"That is why we are absolutely not against biofuels per se, but we are against a target that creates massive demand, and that demand is met with the cheapest and easiest feed stocks.</p> <p>\"We would much rather see a system that encourages genuinely sustainable biofuels, and does not encourage turning food into fuel.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hold on to your hats \u2013 the green deal has launched! However, there is still some finessing to do, and only two major energy providers have signed up. But I can give you the gist: instead of paying for costly energy-efficiency measures for your home up front, from 2013 you can apply for a loan of up to&#xa0;\u00a310,000. Then the cost of expensive stuff from cavity-wall insulation to boilers and possibly solar panels (it's still to be confirmed as to whether microgeneration will be included) will be added to your energy bill. You then pay off this loan (and the compound interest) through savings to your energy bill. Should you decide to move, the green deal loan attaches itself to your house. But eligibility rests on the golden rule: the estimated savings on your bill must be equal to or more than the savings you'll make from the loan.</p> <p>When it comes to old houses this gets complex. By old houses we mean pre-1919, with solid walls. They were built to \"breathe\", with moisture evaporating through lime plasters. After 1919 houses were built with cavity walls, and under the green deal these should be easy to insulate.</p> <p>Given that they make up a quarter of UK housing stock, we need to brush up on how old properties work. Our current thinking (and the calculations that make up the green deal) is biased towards newer homes \u2013 the ones we have the data for. If you live in an old tenement building where big windows form most of the exterior wall, to qualify for the green deal you'd have to install wall insulation first even though it would make better use of your money to install secondary glazing to those large windows.</p> <p>The things that stop old houses from leaking energy \u2013 draught proofing, internal shutters, secondary glazing \u2013 would not meet the golden rule using green deal's calculations. So homeowners would need additional funding from the energy company obligation scheme. We don't know how this would work.</p> <p>We're preoccupied with preserving the aesthetic of old buildings (if you live in a listed property you must fight to install solar panels). But building conservation doesn't equal energy conservation. Make the Sustainable Traditional Buildings Alliance (<a href=\"http://sdfoundation.org.uk\" title=\"\">sdfoundation.org.uk</a>) your friend. It formed, appropriately, at London's historic Somerset House last year and is now advising the Department of Energy and Climate Change on how to make the green deal less ageist.</p> <h2>Green crush of the week<br></h2> <p>Will the electric car be overtaken by the e-bike? \"On the continent they have been,\" says James FitzGerald. \"In Germany last year consumers bought more than 1,000 electric cars with state subsidies, but 320,000 e-bikes without subsidy.\" Globally 31m bicycles with a labour-saving electric motor were sold in 2011 (worldwide sales of all cars was 60m). These figures inspired FitzGerald to open <a href=\"http://justebikes.co.uk\" title=\"\">justebikes.co.uk</a>. \"Only about 3% of the UK population cycles regularly,\" he explains. \"E-bikes are for the other 97%\u2026\"</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne was increasingly isolated over energy policy last night, after the head of the CBI said that too much reliance on gas as a future source of energy would leave consumers and businesses dangerously exposed to further sharp price rises on global markets.</p> <p>After a week in which two of Britain's biggest energy suppliers shocked customers by announcing increases of up to 9% on gas and electricity bills from next month, business leaders are warning that the chancellor's enthusiasm for a \"dash for gas\" looks like a recipe for economic and environmental disaster.</p> <p>In the latest blow to Osborne \u2013 before a crucial ministerial meeting to determine government energy policy this week \u2013 the director general of the CBI, John Cridland, said it was \"crucial\" to avoid too much reliance on one energy source, particularly if, as in the case of gas, much would have to be imported.</p> <p>Many business leaders, together with the environmental lobby, argue that investment in green energy will not only be good for the UK economy in terms of investment and job creation, but will also mean the UK has more control over its own future energy provision, rather than being reliant on imports.</p> <p>In a clear warning to the chancellor, who has made no secret of his support for greater use of gas and less government support for renewable energy, Cridland said: \"Gas has a big part to play in the UK's energy mix in the years to come, but we cannot become dependent on any one source of energy.</p> <p>Over-reliance on new gas would leave us exposed to global price and supply fluctuations and jeopardise our carbon targets, so we need to build more of everything, including renewables, nuclear and CCS [carbon capture and storage].\"</p> <p>Last Monday, seven global electricity and nuclear technology companies, including Siemens and Mitsubishi Power Systems, threatened to withdraw hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in new energy projects in Britain because of uncertainties of about the government's commitment to green, low-carbon policies. The withdrawal of so much investment would mean the loss of thousands of jobs. The firms said the lack of certainty and absence of decisions \"have caused us to reassess the level of political risk in the UK\".</p> <p>This Thursday, the so-called Quad of senior ministers, which includes David Cameron, Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander, Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, will meet to decide on the content of the energy bill, which aims to set the framework for a future of affordable, clean energy in the UK.</p> <p>Sources say Osborne may push for cuts to offshore wind subsidies from government and for reductions in support for carbon capture and storage projects from four to two or even one, in return for agreeing a flexible decarbonisation target for the industry.</p> <p>Joss Garman, the political director of Greenpeace, called on Clegg to stand up for the green agenda at the meeting: \"When rocketing gas prices have already driven up bills for millions of families, and when both business and consumer groups are warning that gas is likely to get even more expensive, it would be idiotic for ministers to give the green light to a big increase in our reliance on pricey imports of this polluting fuel. The Liberal Democrats should insist on stabilising consumer bills with clean, home-grown renewables instead.\"</p> <p>Writing in today's <em>Observer</em>, Lord Stern, author of the 2006 Stern review on the economics of climate change, said that, while subsidies for green energy would eventually have to end, it was \"crucial\" that any reductions in subsidies for low-carbon energy were not imposed so suddenly that they would \"undermine the confidence of the private sector and hold back badly needed investment in the power sector\".Osborne's support for a new dash for gas was revealed in a letter he wrote to Ed Davey, the Libl Dem energy and climate change secretary, in July.</p> <p>\"We need a statement which gives a clear, strong signal that we regard unabated gas as able to play a core part of our electricity generation to at least 2030 \u2013 not just providing back-up for wind plant or peaking capacity,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"This will provide context for the gas strategy and will help reassure investors, enabling investment in new gas power stations and the infrastructure that supports them such as pipelines between Norway and the UK which could enable us to become a gas hub.</p> <p>\"We should commit publicly to ensuring that British consumers will be able to get the benefits if the price of gas falls.\"</p> <p>However, speaking at an IMF/World Bank conference in Japan last Friday he admitted he was unhappy that energy prices were rising so fast: \"Of course I'm concerned when I see electricity bills going up, partly that is because of things beyond our control \u2013 what's happening in the world with oil prices and gas prices.\"</p> <p>Today an investigation by consumer magazine <em>Which? </em>finds that only one in 10 people can identify the cheapest energy deal when presented with a range of standard energy tariffs. When shown the tariffs in a simpler form, in the style of petrol forecourt displays, the number shot up to nine out of 10.</p> <p>Only 8% of the people could identify the cheapest deal out of the six leading suppliers' standard electricity tariffs, 60% got the answer wrong and 32% said they simply didn't know.</p>",
  "<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/osborne-encircled-green-targets\" title=\"\">coalition prepares to introduce its energy bill</a> into Parliament in the next few weeks, it must demonstrate political leadership and ensure that its policy is based on robust economic analysis, recognising and addressing failures of the market.</p> <p>The most obvious market failure is created by the fact that, without policy, the price of products and services that involve emissions of greenhouse gases does not reflect the costs of damage caused by climate change.</p> <p>A strong and stable carbon price corrects this market failure and helps to produce a level playing field on which new low-carbon technologies, such as wind, solar and carbon capture and storage, can compete against fossil fuels. However, it is not the only market failure that holds back these new technologies.</p> <p>A failure arises as well from the inability of capital markets to manage the risks associated with investments in new technologies properly.</p> <p>And other failures are associated with the limitations of networks, particularly concerning public transport and grids. Most consumers and many firms do not yet fully understand the technological opportunities that are available.</p> <p>At a time when the public finances are under strain, it would be better to deal with these market failures through the tax system to disincentivise high-carbon activities or even regulate against them.</p> <p>But it takes time to design and implement such policies and delaying action is dangerous because it can lock in high-carbon infrastructure, such as fossil fuel power stations with unabated greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>So, in the meantime, while these market failures are inadequately tackled and there is not yet a strong and stable carbon price, low-carbon technologies need government assistance through direct subsidies.</p> <p>These subsidies should be reduced and eliminated as the costs of development and deployment fall over time, as carbon markets become stronger and as other market failures are tackled.</p> <p>But it is crucial that the reductions in subsidies for low-carbon energy are carried out according to a predictable rule-based system. Sudden and unexpected cuts undermine the confidence of the private sector and hold back badly needed investment in the UK power sector.</p> <p>Those who argue against subsidies for low-carbon technologies are implicitly adopting an anti-market approach. Those who want markets to be harnessed to deliver greater prosperity and wellbeing, on the other hand, recognise a role for public policy in ensuring that markets can do their job in providing incentives and promoting entrepreneurship.</p> <p>Removing subsidies for low-carbon technologies too quickly and erratically would undermine efforts to reduce the UK's emissions of greenhouse gases in an efficient and effective way and delay progress towards our ultimate target of a cut of at least 80% by 2050 compared with 1990.</p> <p>Such delay would risk relegating the UK to also-rans in the global low-carbon race and could mean that we are shut out of the developing markets for cleaner goods and services.</p> <p>But most dangerous of all, delay would mean higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and huge risks across the world from climate change.</p> <p>The coalition must demonstrate leadership through its energy and climate policies, supporting creativity and innovation in the power sector, and boosting the UK's prospects for sustainable economic growth.</p> <p>Anything less would damage the prospects of future prosperity and wellbeing, for us, our children and future generations.</p>",
  "<p>Even though it's six years, three Grammy nominations and more than 20m global album sales since Lewis won <em>The X Factor</em>, she's yet to shake \"the personality problem\" \u2013 in other words, she remains the sweet if slightly gormless north London girl eclipsed by her own enormous voice. You'd think her team would heed Adele's success and stick with big-lunged, full-hearted ballads such as Fireflies and Lovebird, on which she's as technically irreproachable as Whitney or Mariah.

  "<p>If the <em>Observer</em> had sent me to a Conservative party conference 20 years ago, I'd have written that seeing Tories herded together made me realise how much I hated them. A little late in life for my own comfort, I have since learned that every man and woman must cross-examine their prejudices before they can truly grow up. After scrutinising mine, I realised that my taboos against Tories had to go.</p> <p>If you had been in Birmingham, you would have seen that Conservative activists are no different from activists in other parties: admirable and, alas, rare people, prepared to give up private pleasures to try to change their country. As for the politicians, we met a health minister and former obstetrician called Daniel Poulter, who was so obviously committed to the NHS, so clearly concerned about the sick, that only my promise to the <em>Observer</em>'s political editor not to embarrass him in front of his contacts stopped me reaching for his lapels and bellowing: \"What the bloody hell are you doing in the Tory party?\"</p> <p>According to leftist orthodoxy, Tories are sexist and racist. On the sex question, it is true that our upper-class leaders condescend to women as if the second wave of feminism had never reached the shore. Nothing they have done, however, matches the spectacle of the \"socialist\" government of Ecuador and assorted celebrities and conspiracy theorists helping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/julian-assange\" title=\"\">Julian Assange</a> evade charges of sexual molestation and rape. It was hard to be too harsh on Tory sexism last week when others of a leftish perspective have denounced women who allege that they are victims of abuse and the due process of laws against sexual exploitation as a CIA plot.</p> <p>As for racism, you will find figures on the Tory right who go along with prejudices about blacks and Asians. But then there are Labour leftists who go along with radical Islamists and their prejudices against Jews (and women and gays). You choose your politics and you picks your prejudice. Although it is better to resolve when you make your choice to take on the bigotries on your own side with as much determination as you lacerate the failings of your opponents. For as a rule you will find that the great questions of an age create divisions within the left and within the right rather than between the left and the right In every instance, that is, except one.</p> <p>More significant than any party conference speech was the admission last week by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/08/imf-warns-global-crisis-eurozone\" title=\"\">International Monetary Fund</a> that the assumptions about austerity it shared with the British Treasury, the finance ministries of the eurozone and the Romney campaign were hopelessly wrong. The IMF thought that every \u00a31 of cuts or tax rises took 50p off GDP growth. In those circumstances, getting control of the budget deficit quickly seemed a hard but practical task.</p> <p>Only now, after all these years, has the IMF noticed that the great crash of 2007/8 paralysed the banking system. Only now has it grasped that if, say, every country in Europe is cutting spending and raising taxes no country in Europe will be able to expand by increasing its exports to its depressed neighbours. Its long struggle to see the blindingly obvious completed, the IMF decided that, in fact, every \u00a31 in tax rises and spending cuts takes between 90p and \u00a31.70 of GDP. Far from setting us on the road to recovery, austerity has pushed us into stagnation without end.</p> <p>The consequences for Britain have not been as grave as for the eurozone. We do not have the 50% youth unemployment of southern Europe. There is no fascist movement that apes Greece's Golden Dawn by attacking immigrants and proudly displaying a party flag that does not even bother to pretend that it isn't a swastika.</p> <p>For all that, Britain has not escaped the suffering brought by a monumental economic blunder. As our business editor, Heather Stewart, reports, the TUC says that if the coalition had merely taken a modest estimate from the middle of the IMF's range, and assumed that every \u00a31 in tax rises and cuts would take \u00a31.30 from GDP, it would have realised its austerity programme would suck an extra \u00a376bn from the British economy. It did not and delivered recession, an assault on public services and the fastest collapse in living standards since the 1920s.</p> <p>The coalition and the Bank of England never admit their failure. But you could sense the fear that failure brings in Birmingham last week. The press said that the Tory leaders were frightened of Ed Miliband because he made a decent speech at the Labour conference. I suspect the knowledge that history was proving Ed Miliband and Ed Balls right frightened them more. George Osborne did not mention the word \"growth\" once. He and his colleagues said they wanted to help the \"strivers\": the broad mass of working- and middle-class families who are finding the cost of the weekly shop or of filling up the car ever more burdensome.</p> <p>I am sure they were sincere. But because they cannot match their words with actions, they retreated to offering cheap and pointless gestures on crime, the last resort of the despairing politician. The Conservatives in Birmingham were happy to talk to householders who want to kill burglars. But they had nothing to say to the young who cannot afford to pay for a home or to the middle aged and elderly who are finding it harder to afford to heat a home.</p> <p>Beyond the strivers lie the poor. The failure of austerity economics has hit them hardest, although Establishment commentators will not admit it. They praised David Cameron's \"moral\" mission to grind down welfare benefits. They applauded his declaration that he was cutting only because he wanted the unemployed to enjoy the independence and self-respect that work brings. Neither they nor Cameron acknowledged that with six unemployed people for every vacancy, it is disgraceful to cloak the slashing of benefits with windy moralising. The state may force a few into finding work by threatening them with penury. But it cannot compel the majority because there is no growth and hence not enough work to find.</p> <p>Cameron did not come to power wanting to deepen poverty, but that's not the point. His economic failures leave him with no choice. You do not need to believe that Tories are necessarily wicked people to see that their refusal to rectify their mistakes has wicked consequences.</p>",
  "<p>The day after she was appointed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/joanna-coles-editor-us-cosmopolitan\" title=\"\">editor-in-chief of US <em>Cosmopolitan</em> </a>last month, the British-born journalist Joanna Coles found herself chairing a town hall event at the Democratic National Convention. The panel discussion on female leadership was attended by some of the most senior women in the party, including Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Senate, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services.</p> <p>Coles was anxious to explore what might happen if the Republican nominee Mitt Romney managed to close the gap on President Barack Obama and whether this might have harmful consequences for the nation at large. But the politicians had other, more pressing, issues at the forefront of their minds.</p> <p>\"They said, 'Never mind the election, what's going to happen to <em>Cosmo</em>?'\" Coles recalls drily.</p> <p>The first three weeks of her new job have passed in \"an extraordinary blur. I can't remember a single moment\". She has been inundated with congratulations, including a letter from her fellow Yorkshirewoman, the author Barbara Taylor Bradford, who also lives in New York. The two of them are due to have lunch soon.</p> <p>\"It's absolutely astonishing,\" says Coles. \"<em>Cosmopolitan</em> is just this huge, iconic brand in America.\"</p> <p>She is talking over the phone from her office on the 42nd floor of the Hearst Magazines headquarters and overlooking a swath of midtown Manhattan. I imagine her on the other end of the line, a bit like Melanie Griffiths in the final scene of <em>Working Girl</em>: the gutsy blonde who has finally made it big.</p> <p>If she is nervous about taking on a publishing industry behemoth, she shows no sign of it. Born and raised in West Yorkshire, the 50-year-old Coles has been a New York resident since 1997, working first as US correspondent for the <em>Guardian</em> and then the <em>Times</em>, before making the switch to magazines just after the birth of her second child with her husband, the author and screenwriter Peter Godwin.</p> <p>\"It became clear to me at that point that it was difficult to do a job where I couldn't predict my schedule,\" she says of her decision to leave newspapers. \"I remember missing my older son's first birthday party because two professors at Dartmouth had been brutally murdered and I was sent to cover the story. My husband had been away in Africa and he came back the morning I was leaving and we literally passed in the lobby\u2026 I remember thinking, 'This isn't good.'\"</p> <p>It was a canny move. Coles went on to work for <em>New York Magazine</em>, then became executive editor of <em>More</em> in 2004 and editor-in-chief of <em>Marie Claire</em> in 2006, staying there for six years. Legend has it that Coles was so determined to get the top job at <em>Marie Claire</em> that she ambushed the chief executive of the publishing house by clambering into his taxi and pitching for the editorship en route to the airport. The gamble paid off: in 2011, under her tenure, advertising revenues at <em>Marie Claire</em> leapt by 31%.</p> <p><em>Cosmopolitan</em> is in similarly rude health: its US circulation has risen steadily over the last four years and peaked in the first half of 2012 at more than 3 million. There are 64 international editions, including Slovenia, Ecuador and China, and it attracts 8.5 million unique visitors to its website each&#xa0;month.</p> <p>But is a magazine that carries features on \"How to please your man in bed\" and promotes a daily \"sex position\" through an online app still relevant? In 1965, when the pioneering Helen Gurley Brown was appointed editor, her insistence on including frank discussions on sex within the pages of the magazine was considered a move towards greater female liberation. In 2012, however, when a generation of young women are latching on to a new feminist consciousness typified by the anarchic spirit of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/08/lena-dunham-girls-book-deal-new-yorker-festival-talk?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Fmedia%2Frss+(Media)\" title=\"\">Lena Dunham's acclaimed HBO comedy series <em>Girls</em></a>, does <em>Cosmo</em>'s approach seem wilfully&#xa0;outdated?</p> <p>\"No,\" says Coles. \"I think the size of it is testament to its relevance. It's the biggest women's magazine in the world.</p> <p>\"What magazines do is curate: we give accurate and trustworthy information. If you have a problem, it's very difficult to go to the web and get accurate information\u2026 magazines at their best should be an incredible voyage of discovery.\"</p> <p>Does she feel at ease talking about sex?</p> <p>\"Yes, I do actually. I think it's an important part of our lives. I feel some regret at the pornification of culture. I think that does us a disfavour because people forget that, actually, sex is this great connecting tool between men and women.\"</p> <p>She does, however, intend to broaden <em>Cosmo</em>'s focus and incorporate more stories about women in the workplace, political issues and religious discussion.</p> <p>\"It's important that women voters understand there's something at stake in this election and that the Republican party has very different views on access to abortion and contraception,\" she says. \"If they repeal Obamacare, these women will lose their first chance to have free contraception. Over here, you have to get your prescription for contraception renewed every month\u2026 it's such a hassle. It's a real anxiety for women: have they run out? Can they get to Duane Reade [a US pharmacy chain] in time? Are they going to let it slip? It's physically harder to get contraception, which is something that, as a European coming to America, I found astonishing.\"</p> <p>Coles is part of a phalanx of British women now at the helm of some of America's most influential glossies: Glenda Bailey, the editor-in-chief of <em>Harper's Bazaar</em>, comes from Derbyshire and <em>Vogue</em>'s Anna Wintour was born in London and is the daughter of a former editor of the <em>Evening Standard</em>. What is it about British female editors that makes them so successful across the Atlantic?</p> <p>\"I think people seize on it because it's something we have in common,\" says Coles.</p> <p>The comparisons end there. Whereas Wintour has earned a reputation for terrifying aloofness (and was rumoured to be the inspiration for Meryl Streep's hard-bitten magazine editor in <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>), Coles is known for her down-to-earth approachability and sense of humour. While at <em>Marie Claire</em>, she produced <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/running-in-heels-2009\" title=\"\"><em>Running in Heels</em></a>, a reality TV show about interns at the magazine. It was syndicated to 16 countries and portrayed Coles as an astute and encouraging mentor.</p> <p>\"I like being a boss. It's fun working with smart, young women. They're so much more together than I was at that age. Thank God!\"</p> <p>She is being disingenuous. Coles was together enough to have had her first article published at the age of 10 in the children's section of the Y<em>orkshire Post</em> for the princely fee of \u00a32. She says she always knew she wanted to be a journalist and graduated from the University of East Anglia with a degree in English and American literature before starting her career with a job at the <em>Spectator</em>.</p> <p>What do her parents \u2013 her mother was a medical social worker and her father a teacher \u2013 make of her job? \"I think they're relieved that I'm not calling them for money,\" she says, half-joking. She makes a point of going back to Yorkshire regularly and recently went there on a family holiday, incorporating a trip to the National Coal Mining Museum in Wakefield: \"So my children went down the mines.\" A pause. Then, deadpan: \"Which was good.\"</p> <p>Is there anything she misses about Yorkshire? \"I miss the sort of grit of the people. They have this fantastic 'Keep Calm and Carry on' attitude.\"</p> <p>Indeed, in an industry that, to the untrained eye, can appear synonymous with superficiality and bitchiness, Coles values the art of saying what you mean. \"I'd much rather know if you have to go to a pre-school meeting or an open day or get your kids vaccinated than for someone to feel they have to make something up,\" she says. \"I remember once when I was working on a magazine and one of the male editors was going on a field trip with one of his sons. The office was full of 'He's such a good dad' whereas I came in late from a doctor's appointment for one of my children and was asked, 'Where were you? You'll need to make up the time.' There's still a double standard.\"</p> <p>She disagrees with the premise of Hanna Rosin's recently published polemic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/hanna-rosin-end-men-extract\" title=\"\"><em>The End of Men</em></a>, that women are adapting better to the significant shifts in economy and culture and outstripping their male counterparts at home and at work. \"What's interesting about her thesis is that it's not backed up financially and not backed up by the number of women in government or senior women in business. There's a feeling that offices are becoming more feminised, the culture is becoming more feminised and there's a 62% female intake in college in the US, but it's not actually backed up in terms of money or power yet. Right now, there's a lot of noise in the culture about women on the rise but it hasn't actually been borne out financially [in terms of equal pay] or real leadership.\"</p> <p>Coles describes herself as a feminist and genuinely seems to like other women and to want them to do well. But at the same time she expects the best from them (a couple of times she asks me to clarify what I mean by a certain question in the laser-sharp manner of an intimidating university professor).</p> <p>\"What is important for women is they can want it all but they don't have to have it all at the same time,\" she says, describing the ideal <em>Cosmo</em> reader as \"a young female striver, probably coming out of college, saddled with debts and loans but who has high ambitions for herself and is thinking, 'How am I going to do this?'\"</p> <p>Her conversation is peppered with enthusiastic references to female teenage celebrities. A mild inquiry about her ideal cover star prompts a gushing monologue on the myriad virtues of the Olsen twins (\"old souls\"), Miley Cyrus (\"phenomenally smart and fun\") and Taylor Swift (\"who, at 14, made her parents move to Nashville!\").</p> <p>\"I'm fascinated by these young women who are so smart, business-wise and who have an understanding of their brand and the need to protect it and who have control over it. You talk to women now and they say their absolute idol is Natalie Massenet [the founder of Net-A-Porter], who sold her business and made a lot of money, or Sheryl Sandberg [the chief operating officer of Facebook], who is managing to infiltrate the culture of young working women. There weren't really any women like that when I was coming in. I had Margaret Thatcher, who might have been iconic for all sorts of reasons, but now there are lots of different role models.\"</p> <p>This is all very well, but I'm aware there is one pressing question I haven't yet asked. As the editor of a magazine that prides itself on its sexual adventurousness, I wonder whether Coles has a favourite \"sex position of the day\"? She laughs.</p> <p>\"Well I've only been here three weeks,\" she replies. \"I'm starting right at the beginning.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>New York novelist Walter Mosley, 60, created the fictional detective Easy Rawlins and has published more than 30 novels in a range of genres </strong></p> <p>For me, the Obama presidency encompassed the excruciating final moments of the pain of birth when America was finally pushed out of its womb of isolationism into the bright, loud and profoundly challenging dawn of the third millennium. Most American presidents inherit a nation but Mr Obama received an entire world of growing pains and contradictions. He was faced with a 20th-century economic system that had foundered and failed but had not given up the helm. China had transformed itself from a dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship over the proles. Europe's fine blend of socialistic capitalism had begun to unravel because of a kind of dementia in its economic infrastructure. And the so-called third world was reeling under the constant barrage brought about by the inescapable competition between the aforementioned gang of superpowers.</p> <p>The millennia-old conflict between the major religions was growing and the gulf between rich and poor was spreading like some kind of economic desertification. People could sit on their porches and watch as the wealth of their lifetimes and of the nation evaporated.</p> <p>The sky was falling while the oceans rose and the atmosphere heated up. Under this miasma of global warming, people were propagating at a hitherto unheralded rate.</p> <p>To misquote Dickens: It was the worst of times. It was the worst of times.</p> <p>This newborn America was both blind and unequipped to deal with the challenges that faced it. We still believed that democracy was a ballot dropped in a box and forgotten until the next election. Mr Obama was thrown into office and the people who worked so hard to get him there went back to their daily lives thinking that they'd done their job and now it was time for him to do his.</p> <p>Obama was a surgeon in a crowded operating theatre who asked for a bone saw and was given a rusty scalpel. To his credit he applied himself to the impossible job with unflagging energy and inexplicable poise. His wife, her sleeves always rolled up, stood at his side, trying with him to resuscitate the patient that is our nation.</p> <p>Our wounds are critical but the real problem is that there are extenuating complications in our immune systems. The economic, environmental, ecclesiastical and educational systems are all failing. Even if we could perform the double-quadruple bypass there are no backup systems in our culture, bank accounts or even on the air to sustain us. The only thing that we have going for us is will and leadership. For four years, President Obama has represented both.</p> <p>My politics are not on the same page as the official stance of the White House but that hardly matters. The conflicts that riddle our world seem to have called this extraordinary American president into existence; and for that I am grateful.</p> <p>But having said that, I'm afraid I believe that the only way a black man could have made it into office was when the problems facing us had already transcended the conflict between races and arrived at the place where the only question was the survival of the species.</p>",
  "<p>He shakes as he speaks and at moments his eyes fill. \"It's certain that the people who killed my colleague were criminals,\" he says. \"The killing had the modus operandi of organised crime. But who sent them and why? That's the question, that's the smokescreen.\"</p> <p>This is a colleague of V\u00edctor Manuel B\u00e1ez Chino, whose mutilated body was found in June in the main square of Xalapa, capital of the Mexican coastal state of Veracruz. B\u00e1ez was the state's crime editor for an online edition of the national newspaper <em>Milenio</em> and editor of the Police Report website (currently down) which covered crime.</p> <p>In August, state prosecutors declared the case closed. Witnesses, they said, had identified the bodies of two men killed in a shootout as the same people who had kidnapped the reporter. B\u00e1ez's circles were \"entirely unconvinced\", says his colleague.</p> <p>B\u00e1ez is one of 56 journalists killed during Mexico's drug war since 2006 (a figure calculated by the New York-based <a href=\"http://cpj.org/\" title=\"\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>). The war reached a climax last week with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/zetas-leader-heriberto-lazcano-killed\" title=\"\">killing by Mexican marines</a> of the leader of the wildest \u2013 albeit not the biggest \u2013 narco cartel: the paramilitary Zetas, which counts Veracruz, with its strategically crucial gulf port, among its strongholds.</p> <p>After a spate of further killings this year, Veracruz became the focus for this war against the press: six reporters were killed in Mexico within a month leading to mid-May, three of them in Veracruz.</p> <p>This is no sideshow in a wider war involving the drugs cartels, argues the committee's representative in Mexico,&#xa0;Mike O'Connor. He insists that&#xa0;\"the silencing of the press and killing of journalists is integral to the reality, the big story, of what is happening here: that the cartels are taking territory\".</p> <p>Furthermore, he says: \"The inability of the government to really solve hardly any of the crimes against journalists during the four years I've been here is a metaphor for its inability to solve crimes against common citizens. They simply cannot do it. And you wonder: if they can't solve these crimes, why not? Is it because they don't want to?\"</p> <p>Of course, the threats and killings proliferate beyond Veracruz, across Mexico. In the border town of Nuevo Laredo, Ram\u00f3n Cant\u00fa, publisher of the local <em>El Ma\u00f1ana</em>, said, after his paper's offices were attacked by the Zetas: \"We are censoring the paper because we have to get our children to school.\" In Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, my friend Sandra Rodr\u00edguez is among the reporters who work on bravely, despite the killing of two colleagues, \"because we have to carry on with this task, to expose what is going on\".</p> <p>Among those brutally killed in Veracruz was Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz, whose decapitated, tortured body was found in July last year, dumped near the offices of her newspaper, <em>Imagen</em>, two days after she was seized by armed men as she left home.</p> <p>State prosecutor Reynaldo Escobar P\u00e9rez insisted the killing was not linked to her work and state governor Javier Duarte de Ochea said authorities were pursuing \"multiple lines of investigation\". Another was Miguel Angel L\u00f3pez Velasco, columnist for the daily <em>Notiver</em>, who was killed along with his wife and son the previous month.</p> <p>Apart from the barbarism of his killing, V\u00edctor B\u00e1ez's death bore another hallmark of a narco execution: a note pinned to his torso, this one reading: \"Here's what happens to traitors and people who act clever. Sincerely, the Zetas.\" But B\u00e1ez's colleague says that he learned from the marines \"that the note was not there when the body was discovered by a neighbour who found V\u00edctor's door open \u2013 it was put there later\u2026 by someone, for some reason\". All of which compounds the strangeness of B\u00e1ez's death, the explanation for which anguishes his colleague, as we sit in a cafe, shielded by the sound of the grinding of fresh coffee grown in the hills beyond the city.</p> <p>\"He had no connection to the cartels. V\u00edctor knew how to stay independent. I was one of the last people to see him \u2013 he seemed tranquil, he had nothing to do with the government or the narcos.\" But B\u00e1ez did know some background to the most infamous murder of a reporter in Veracruz: that on 28 April this year of Regina Mart\u00ednez, a friend of his.</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez was Veracruz state correspondent for <em>Proceso</em> magazine, by repute one of Mexico's most prestigious. She was found dead in her lavatory, beaten and strangled to death.</p> <p>\"Others have died in worse ways than Regina,\" said a friend and one-time source of Mart\u00ednez in Xalapa last week. \"In some ways, I'm amazed she wasn't killed before. She was working for some time on dirty police\" \u2013 and her voice trails off. \"Regina was a good friend of mine and one of the few who dared to write about what is happening here.\"</p> <p>There has been public outrage in Veracruz over Mart\u00ednez's murder, as there has been across Mexico at the others. Mart\u00ednez's killing provoked street demonstrations demanding that the perpetrators and those who gave them orders be brought to justice. On Saturday in Xalapa, an assembly was hosted by a new student movement in Mexico, I Am 132, with local reporters, to discuss common cause and strategies for mutual protection.</p> <p>I Am 132 is so called after 131 students appeared on YouTube to give their names and ID numbers and deny allegations that they had been paid to disrupt a meeting addressed by the incoming Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The skirmish had been over development of land for an airport, but the movement expanded into narco war, free speech and assaults on the press.</p> <p>\"At first, we thought the reporters were part of the problem,\" says the movement's humblingly brave young spokesman in Veracruz. \"Then we saw the big picture, and how it must be for them, and the idea this weekend is for an assembly that can work towards a safety network of some kind.\"</p> <p>Into all this, last week, the Mexican branch of the Hay-on-Wye literary festival arrived \u2013 Hay Xalapa \u2013 guest of the state government. Hay had been criticised from some quarters for accepting the hospitality, but rode it to stage an event of intellectual effervescence and allow the opening of an international window to Xalapa's journalists. Representatives of the freedom of expression group PEN arrived to make preparations for a campaign over the murder of reporters in Mexico, to be launched on the next Day of the Dead, on 2&#xa0;November.</p> <p>The president of PEN America, Peter Godwin, found himself present at an unexpected photo opportunity between state governor Duarte and Nigerian poet and playwright Wole Soyinka. Godwin petitioned the governor \"to express\", he said afterwards, \"PEN's grave concerns about the killings of journalists in Veracruz in particular and the climate of impunity in Mexico generally. I concluded my questioning of the governor by saying that I hoped that there would be no more journalists killed in Veracruz province between this Hay and the next.\"</p> <p>(To complete the surreality of the occasion, <em>Proceso</em> magazine posted on its website a detailed account of a supposed meeting in the Crowne Plaza hotel in Xalapa, at which Duarte supposedly \"exploded\" with recrimination at Godwin, esteemed American writer John Lee Anderson and me for speaking badly of Veracruz. The story was a fabrication \u2013 denied by the governor's office and all three of us. )</p> <p>It happens that the Committee to Protect Journalists is represented in Mexico by one of America's most experienced and renowned reporters. Mike O'Connor is a veteran of the \"dirty wars\" in Central America during the 1980s for CBS television and of other conflicts thereafter for the <em>New York Times</em>. For nearly four years now, he has documented and investigated the intimidation and murder of Mexican reporters and toured the country consulting those under threat. He is uniquely qualified to explain how the war against the press speaks to Mexico's carnage.</p> <p>\"The government and authorities are ceding territory to the cartels and, for the cartels to take territory, three things have to happen,\" says O'Connor. \"One is to control the institutions with guns \u2013 basically, the police. The second is to control political power. And, for the first two to be effective, you have to control the press.</p> <p>\"Every journalist I've spoken to says that the corruption of forces is such that the cartels control the politicians.&#xa0;That does not say that the cartels get money from this \u2013 there are rewards for the politicians and there's a very strong disincentive not to&#xa0;co-operate. I'm not quite sure what&#xa0;the word is to describe the relationship, but ultimately the capo is in charge.\"</p> <p>However: \"When I\u2026 say to a roomful of journalists, 'Ask the question, <em>Quien manda aqu\u00ed?</em> (Who's in charge?'), they take a virtual step backwards, wide-eyed. That's the question you ask yourself at night when you're drunk and your wife is asleep and you hope no one hears you.\"</p> <p>O'Connor argues: \"You can't have a democracy without an informed public\u2026 Mexico has all the structures of a democracy, but it does not have an informed public. It has a public which knows the starting lineup of the Green Bay Packers, but doesn't know who runs the city or the state they live in. It does not know who is in charge. People know it's corrupt, but they don't know what's going on, because the reporters cannot ask: 'Who's in charge?' You cannot find in your newspaper, in most parts of the country, information about the big story \u2013 and the big story is that organised crime has taken over, or is working very successfully at taking over, your city, town or village.</p> <p>\"And if you report that, you get killed. Mostly, you don't think about reporting that.\"</p> <p>O'Connor summarises government officials as insisting that all Mexican journalists are corrupt and the victims are working for the cartels \u2013 \"as if they could possibly know\". Working on the ground, he says: \"Look, I don't have the FBI crime lab behind me \u2013 I do the investigations I can within the&#xa0;environment I have. And I know that at some times and in some places, a reporter might get approached by someone with a pistol, and told to write&#xa0;this but not that, and there may be some money in it. And if you don't, we know where you and your family&#xa0;live.</p> <p>\"Is that working for the cartel? Federal officials use that context to make out that the dead are working for the cartels. I know reporters who get asked by the police chief, 'Why are you so curious?' That's a threat.\"</p> <p>However, he says, \"the people I know in Xalapa say that Regina Mart\u00ednez was looking into the political and economic elite. That is what she wrote about\". Then O'Connor qualifies the judgment, only slightly, with a favourite dictum of his, that \"Mexico is a country where you do not need facts to arrive at a conclusion. People will hold on to a belief without being able to give it a factual basis. But that does not mean it is not true.\"</p> <p>The atrocious news arrived just as the Hay festival left Xalapa: that while it was in town, another reporter from a journalistic family, and his daughter, had been killed \u2013 both decapitated. Roberto Rizzo Murrieta who worked for the <em>Mundo de C\u00f3rdoba</em> paper, was murdered at home with his child, Mar\u00eda Antonia. The state prosecutor said again that \"multiple lines of investigation\" had been opened and a domestic employee was under suspicion.</p>",
  "<p>My cat is a genius.

Each team selected five companies from the FTSE All-Share index at the start of the year. After every three months the teams can exchange any of the stocks, replacing them with others from the index.</p> <p>While the cat selected stocks by throwing his favourite toy mouse on a grid of numbers allocated to the different companies, the students and professionals used more traditional methods.</p> <p>The Professionals \u2013 Justin Urquhart Stewart of wealth managers Seven Investment Management, Paul Kavanagh of stockbrokers Killick &amp; Co, and Andy Brough, a fund manager at investment firm Schroders \u2013 are way ahead with a profit of \u00a3497. So how do they go about identifying stocks for their portfolio?</p> <p>\"You've got to have a view of the world,\" says Brough. \"The world population \u2013 particularly China \u2013 is growing, they are going to be eating, consuming more oil and natural resources.\"</p> <p>This, you might think, would naturally lead to an investment in oil and gas companies, and, indeed, the professionals' portfolio does include Premier Oil and British Gas. But Brough adds that the cost of getting resources out of the ground is increasing faster than the value of the asset.</p> <p>Hence his interest in Elementis, a global chemicals company that provides products enabling, among other things, the extraction of shale oil and gas in South and North America, which expect to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/18/shale-oil-gas-us-energy-self-sufficient\" title=\"\">self-sufficient in energy by 2030</a>. Likewise, Weir Group, which provides products and services to oil and gas customers in exploration, production, transportation and refining.</p> <p>These companies can increase their prices regardless of what is happening to the underlying price of oil and gas. As a result, shares in Elementis have increased by 16.9% and Weir Group 15.5% in the last three months \u2013 a far better performance than the actual oil and gas producers. Premier Oil has increased by 4.1% while the British Gas share price has fallen by 3.8%.</p> <p>Brough and Kavanagh joke about seeing themselves as \"JR and Bobby\": the only diversification to the professionals' portfolio is Imagination Technologies, which develops and licences technology for use in mobile devices, in-car information and entertainment systems, games consoles and digital set top boxes.</p> <p>Ironic, given the professionals were initially quite nervous about competing against Orlando in case his techniques resulted in his choices all coming from one strongly performing sector.</p> <p>Kavanagh says: \"We have diversified as Premier and British Gas are in different parts of the world, while Weir and Elementis do other things as well as supply the oil and gas industry.</p> <p>\"Imagination survives for its clear growth path, despite economic uncertainty \u2013 supporting most major consumer technology groups, including Apple. It has re-stated its 2016 target of 1bn royalty units, but we see its ultimate target market many times that number.\"</p> <p>The professionals do not want to change any of their stocks for the final three months. Orlando has selected a specialist plastics and foam company called Filtrona to replace Scottish American Investment Trust, which has turned in a pretty flat performance so far.</p> <p>The students, aware that their selections in the past have been slightly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/jul/07/portfolio-challenge-barclays-teaches-school?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">risky or adventurous</a>, have decided to opt for some defensive stocks in the final three months.</p> <p>They want to replace Mulberry \u2013 which, like other luxury brands, has struggled in the past few months \u2013 with Aviva, and the online gambling group Betfair with Tesco.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397771133\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350044172311/ObsTable-001.jpg\" alt=\"ObsTable\" width=\"460\" height=\"567\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ObsTable Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><em>\u25a1 Learn how to invest with the professionals.

It is a place for botanical research at a high level, designed to lure the best scientists by creating a delightful environment. So cutting corners was not wanted.</p> <p>It is also designed to encourage researchers to interact and swap ideas, which is the way really good work gets done, rather than hide away and hoard their discoveries. So it has generous stairs and common spaces next to its immaculate laboratories. An L in plan, it wraps like half a cloister round a quiet court, with a cafe on the other side. Its straight-lined architecture frames views of the lush mature trees of the Botanical Garden in Cambridge.</p> <p>Its architects are Stanton Williams, who don't quite have the global reputations of Rem Koolhaas's OMA, or David Chipperfield, who were also on the shortlist. But they are well respected by those who know their persistent pursuit of serious, considered architecture.</p> <p>The Sainsbury Laboratory is not the instant national treasure that is the Olympic Stadium, which would have been the publicity-winning choice. Nor does it have the impact of David Chipperfield's Hepworth in Wakefield. It is, however, good architecture, which is what the Stirling is about.

  "<p>George Osborne's drastic deficit-cutting programme will have sucked \u00a376bn more out of the economy than he expected by 2015, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund of the price of austerity.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, last week caused consternation among governments that have embarked on controversial spending cuts by arguing that the impact on economic growth may be greater than previously thought.</p> <p>The independent Office for Budget Responsibility implicitly used a \"fiscal multiplier\" of 0.5 to estimate the impact of the coalition's tax rises and spending cuts on the economy. That meant each pound of cuts was expected to reduce economic output by 50p. However, after examining the records of many countries that have embraced austerity since the financial crisis, the IMF reckons the true multiplier is 0.9-1.7.</p> <p>Calculations made for the <em>Observer</em> by the TUC reveal that if the real multiplier is 1.3 \u2013 the middle of the IMF's range \u2013 the OBR has underestimated the impact of the cuts by a cumulative \u00a376bn, more than 8% of GDP, over five years. Instead of shaving less than 1% off economic growth during this financial year, austerity has depressed it by more than 2%, helping to explain why the economy has plunged into a double-dip recession.</p> <p>Labour seized on the IMF's intervention as a vindication of shadow chancellor Ed Balls's argument that the cuts programme is self-defeating. \"The IMF's analysis should be a wake-up call for David Cameron and George Osborne,\" said the shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Rachel Reeves. \"It's time the prime minister and the chancellor listened to the evidence, accepted their plan isn't working and changed course.\"</p> <p>TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"The chancellor has repeatedly used the IMF as cover for his austerity strategy, despite warnings that deep spending cuts in the midst of a global turndown would make a bad situation worse. Now that the IMF has admitted spending cuts could hit the economy at least twice as hard as it previously thought, the government has all the evidence it needs to change course.\"</p> <p>Neal Lawson, director of left-wing pressure group Compass, said, \"the cuts were never going to work, but these calculations show the effect is bigger than anyone judged. The economy isn't suffering from government borrowing but a severe lack of demand that only the government can fix.\"</p> <p>Osborne told reporters in Tokyo that the IMF does not allow for the boost provided to growth by the Bank of England's \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. \"The point I would make about their study of the fiscal multipliers is that they explicitly say they were not taking into account offsetting monetary policy action. In the UK, I would argue we have a tough and credible fiscal policy to allow for loose and accommodative monetary policy and I think that is the right combination.\"</p> <p>But many economists believe the dent in growth caused by austerity policies may be larger than first thought, because the financial crisis has left banks starving firms and households of credit; and with many countries cutting back simultaneously, it is harder to fill the gap created by cuts with demand for exports.</p> <p>Former monetary policy committee member Danny Blanchflower said: \"In a way, the surprise is that it's taken everybody so long to work it out: Keynes knew it in the 1930s. This is the 'long, dragging conditions of semi-slump', and the multipliers are likely to be larger when you've got banks that aren't lending and you're coming out of the longest recession in 100 years.\"</p> <p>Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said that the Treasury should have pumped even more into Britain's banks during the credit crisis to leave them in a stronger state. \"The recovery from recession has been far slower than most commentators and all official forecasts anticipated in 2009,\" he said. \"That reflects our failure to understand just how powerful are the deflationary effects created by deleveraging in the aftermath of financial crises.\"</p> <p>The OBR, set by Osborne to give an independent assessment of the economy, will publish a report on Tuesday explaining why it has consistently overestimated economic growth, and is expected to touch on the issue of whether the cuts are taking a greater-than-predicted toll. At its last forecast, in March, it predicted 0.8% growth this year; the IMF now expects the final figure to be -0.4%.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 14 October to add the word \"implicitly\" to clarify how the Office for Budget Responsibility used a \"fiscal multiplier\" to estimate the impact of the coalition's tax rises and spending cuts.</p>",
  "<p>This time last year, New Zealand was under the spell of the Rugby World Cup, with host nation enthusiasm going a long way to realising the organisers' vision of a \"stadium of four million\". In 2012, the big event features hairy feet of a different sort, with the New Zealand-made film <em>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey </em>opening with a world premiere in Wellington, the home town of director Sir Peter Jackson, in six weeks.</p> <p>A decade after Jackson's three-film adaptation of JRR Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>emerged to critical and popular acclaim, the countdown to <em>The Hobbit </em>\u2013 in its film form, also a trilogy \u2013 began last week in earnest. In earnest and in fact: Wellington mayor Celia Wade-Brown unveiled a giant clock, complete with an image of Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, counting down the minutes to the 28 November premiere.</p> <p>The clock sits atop the Embassy Theatre, the handsome 1920s cinema that will host the screening. A bevy of international stars, led, it's safe to predict, by Freeman, will return to Wellington to walk the red carpet down Courtenay Place. The last time the 500m carpet was unrolled, for the world premiere of <em>The Return of the King </em>in 2003, about 120,000 people came to watch the procession. Organisers expect a similar turnout this time. \"It will be a real carnival atmosphere,\" promises Wade-Brown.</p> <p>There is nothing subtle about efforts to piggyback. The national tourism slogan \"100% Pure New Zealand\" has become \"100% Middle-earth\", while in the days leading up to the premiere Wellington will be \"renamed\", Wade-Brown announced last week, as \"Middle of Middle-earth\".</p> <p>It would all no doubt bewilder Tolkien, who conjured up his Middle-earth from Oxfordshire in the 1930s, and never travelled as far as New Zealand.</p> <p>The cinematic Middle-earth, however, is becoming hard to avoid. Last week saw the launch of commemorative stamps and coins sporting the images of Freeman's Bilbo and Ian McKellen's Gandalf. A dollar coin will sell for NZ$30 (\u00a315). A set of three $10 coins retails at $11,000 (\u00a36,000).</p> <p>Elsewhere, hints of the approaching publicity deluge keep appearing. At the top of the website for TVNZ, the country's biggest broadcaster, lining up alongside generic categories such as \"news\", \"sport\" and lifestyle is \"The Hobbit\". Passengers on Air New Zealand will soon find themselves lectured on the location of their lifejackets by crew dressed as characters from <em>The Hobbit </em>in a new inflight safety video.</p> <p>A shire of four million, then? Not quite. Broadly, New Zealanders are behind Jackson's project, and appreciative of what the films have done for the film and tourism industries (the combined value of the <em>Lord of the Rings </em>trilogy to the New Zealand economy is estimated at more than NZ$700m, or \u00a3350m). But reports of \"Middle-earth fever\" are misplaced. The novelty of the scale and ambition of the <em>Lord of the Rings </em>project has dissipated, and for the most part enthusiasm is muted.</p> <p>If there is feverishness, it is in the efforts of the tourism industry to \"leverage <em>The Hobbit</em>\", as the Tourism New Zealand chief executive has put it. The \"100% Middle-earth\" campaign, it is hoped, will be a shot in the arm for an industry that has seen growth in visitor numbers stall in recent years.</p> <p>It is all a huge contrast from the <em>Lord of the Rings </em>experience. Back then, tourist operators felt \"ambushed\" by fans of the films, says Melissa Heath, owner of Southern Lakes Sightseeing, which specialises in <em>Lord of the Rings </em>location tours. \"I don't think anyone in New Zealand was ready for it.\"</p> <p>Her company, based in the South Island tourist hub Queenstown, fielded numerous calls after the first release in 2001 from visitors eager to see the film locations \u2013 those that weren't created digitally, at least. By 2004, the company had become exclusively focused on <em>Lord of the Rings </em>tourism. \"It was initially full-on Ringons,\" says Heath. \"People would be speaking elvish in the van, dressed as Sam or Frodo. Now it's settled back to everyday people. But most of our clients are absolutely committed, dedicated fans.\" They are also almost invariably from overseas. \"New Zealanders are completely bemused by the interest here,\" she says.</p> <p>Heath is expecting business, which has remained steady since hitting a peak in about 2005, to grow again with the <em>Hobbit </em>films. Her company, along with similar operators around New Zealand, is eagerly awaiting the likely release of location details. \"We have an idea about them, but like everybody we don't know exactly where.\"</p> <p>The attraction most certain to enjoy a boost is Hobbiton Movie Set and Farm Tours. Nestled in undulating hills near the quiet rural town of Matamata, in the North Island Waikato region, and half-owned by Jackson, this is where the hobbits really lived. Or near enough: large parts of the <em>Rings </em>and <em>Hobbit </em>films were shot here \u2013 and the current visitor numbers, about 20,000 a year, are expected to rapidly swell.</p> <p>Tourism aside, the great economic legacy of <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>is in production expertise \u2013 highly skilled crews and digital animators \u2013 backed by a \"phenomenal investment in computer technology\", says John Yeabsley, a senior fellow at the NZ Institute for Economic Research, and co-author of a 2002 report on \"the lasting effects of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>\". \"Once all the mania was over, what it really left was&#xa0;an amazing increase in human capital, in skills and reputation, in proven capability on the ground,\" Yeabsley says.</p> <p>That is echoed by the Wellington mayor. \"The Tolkien transformation has been absolutely extraordinary for our capital,\" says Wade-Brown, a British expatriate. \"There will be short-term gains for the city, in tourism especially, but the big Wellington story is really one of technology and talent.\"</p> <p>The threat today for that skilled workforce, as for tourism, says Yeabsley, comes both from the the global economic slump and the strengthening New Zealand dollar. When Jackson began on the first trilogy, the American dollar bought almost exactly twice the amount of the New Zealand currency that it does today.</p> <p>It is against that backdrop that John Key, the New Zealand prime minister, embarked earlier this month on a tour of Hollywood, to \"sell New Zealand\" to studio bosses. He had an able chaperone in James Cameron, who spent more than NZ$350m making <em>Avatar </em>in New Zealand, and is in the process of moving his family to live there.</p> <p>With the screen industry contributing close to NZ$3bn a year to New Zealand's economy, said Key, \"in simple terms, this visit is about jobs for New Zealanders\". Part of his message was that \"we have made sure our law is flexible\".</p> <p>For some, however, such flexibility was taken too far in 2010, when New Zealand labour legislation was changed in the face of Warner Brothers' threats to move production of <em>The Hobbit </em>elsewhere. The \"<em>Hobbit </em>law\", together with fresh tax breaks to offset the shifts in exchange rate, saw the films stay in New Zealand. But with the Tolkien catalogue just about run dry, the next challenge is to sustain life after Middle-earth.</p>",
  "<p>Given the crises facing the planet, with the population set to reach the 9 billion mark by 2050 and increasing strains being placed on water, energy and food supplies, it would be wrong to hope there could be a single solution to the storms that lie ahead. As the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, once put it in an <em>Observer</em> interview: \"There will be no silver bullet.\"</p> <p>However, the population biologist added a crucial caveat. It would also be foolish not to make the maximum use of the new technologies that we are developing in order to alleviate some of the worst dangers we will face in the decades that lie ahead.</p> <p>And among those scientific wonders, the use of genetically modified crops has a particularly rich potential, Beddington added. \"Just look at the problems that the world faces: water shortages and salination of existing water supplies, for example. GM crops should be able to deal with that.\"</p> <p>It is a good point. Consider the simple issue of food that is lost before it can be harvested because it has been eaten by pests that humans have never learned to control. That loss comes to around 30%, agriculture experts calculate, a rate that cannot be allowed to continue. And GM crops are perfectly placed to solve that sort of problem.</p> <p>The work of scientists at the Rothamsted research station in England provides a good example of the sort of benefits that can be achieved through genetic modification. They have engineered a strain of wheat so that it emits a chemical called E-beta-farnesene which is also emitted by aphids when they are threatened. In effect, it tells other aphids to fly away. For good measure, E-beta-farnesene also attracts aphid predators such as ladybirds and wasps. In short, it delivers a double whammy \u2013 and one with rich potential. Aphids cause an estimated \u00a3100m of damage to crops every year in the UK alone.</p> <p>At present, the effectiveness of Rothamsted's anti-aphid GM wheat has only been demonstrated in the laboratory. Earlier this year field trials were prepared but were threatened by anti-GM campaigners. However, their protest fizzled out, a development that suggests the green movement is growing up over its opposition to genetically modified crops.</p> <p>In the end, however, science can only delay the inevitable, as Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington has made clear. We need to act now to start to cope with crises over water supply, world population numbers and rising carbon emissions in the hope that advances in agriculture and genetics can give us time for such measures to be introduced and take effect.</p> <p>Or, as Beddington has made clear, there are almost a billion people today who are suffering from serious food shortages and who face starvation. \"It is unimaginable that in the next 10 to 20 years there will not be a worsening of that problem unless we take action now, and we have to include the widest possible range of solutions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's top animal disease scientists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/oct/14/letters-observer\">have launched a devastating attack</a> on the government's \"mindless\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/badgers\" title=\"\">badger cull</a>, accusing ministers of failing to tell the truth and demanding the immediate abandonment of the killings.</p> <p>The intervention by dozens of the nation's most senior experts, in a letter in the <em>Observer</em>, comes as farmers prepare to begin the cull in Gloucestershire and Somerset, possibly as early as tomorrow. The government's own chief scientist has refused to back the killings.</p> <p>More than 30 eminent animal disease experts describe the cull as a \"costly distraction\" that risks making the problem of tuberculosis in cattle worse and that will cost far more than it saves.</p> <p>TB in English cattle is an increasing problem, with the 26,000 infected animals slaughtered in 2011 costing \u00a390m in compensation. Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, argues that more than a decade of research shows that culling badgers, which can carry bovine TB, could reduce infections by 12%-16% if undertaken intensively for many years and over large areas.</p> <p>However, the scientists reject the idea of scientific support for the cull, which could wipe out 100,000 badgers, a third of the national population. The cull policy is \"mindless\", according to Lord John Krebs, one of the UK's most eminent scientists and the architect of the landmark 10-year culling trials that ended in 2007. \"The scientific case is as clear as it can be: this cull is not the answer to TB in cattle. The government is cherry-picking bits of data to support its case.\"</p> <p>Another signatory, Lord Robert May, a former government chief scientist and president of the Royal Society, said: \"It is very clear to me that the government's policy does not make sense.\" He added: \"I have no sympathy with the decision. They are transmuting evidence-based policy into policy-based evidence.\"</p> <p>The current government chief scientist, Professor Sir John Beddington, refused to back the cull. Asked if it could make a meaningful contribution to tackling TB in cattle, he said: \"I continue to engage with Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] on the evidence base concerning the development of bovine TB policy. I am content that the evidence base, including uncertainties and evidence gaps, has been communicated effectively to ministers.\"</p> <p>A Defra spokesman said: \"The leading experts Defra brought together in April 2011 agreed that the evidence shows that culling done in the right way can reduce the spread of the disease to cattle, with benefits remaining for many years. The culling policy has been developed to maximise the benefits shown in previous trials, and to minimise the impact of badgers spreading disease beyond the cull area by including hard boundaries such as motorways and rivers.\"</p> <p>But scientists say the <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\" title=\"\">two-page document</a> produced by the April meeting does not support the cull. Professor Rosie Woodroffe, of the Zoological Society of London, said: \"The document simply does not endorse the policy.\"</p> <p>The cull has provoked the largest animal rights campaign since fox hunting in the 1990s, with some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/01/badger-activists-prepare-for-cull\" title=\"\">activists pledging to disrupt the nocturnal shootings by</a> marksmen. More than 150,000 people have signed a <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">government e-petition to stop the cull</a>, entitling it to be considered for a debate in parliament. MPs say they are confident this will be granted when the decision is made on Tuesday.</p> <p>The scientists, whose letter is also being sent to Paterson, claim scientific opinion in the UK is overwhelmingly against the cull. \"I just don't know anyone who is really informed who thinks this is a good idea,\" said Professor John Bourne, who led the decade-long trial.</p> <p>The scientists reject other statements from ministers and even David Cameron, who said last week: \"I believe this is the right policy for healthy badgers as well as healthy cattle.\"</p> <p>Woodroffe pointed to research showing that just 14% of badgers in previous culls had TB and just one in a hundred had severe symptoms. \"Furthermore, all the evidence shows that culling badgers increases the proportion of badgers that have TB,\" she said.</p> <p>In a separate development, nine leading vets have written an open letter, co-ordinated by <a href=\"www.hsiuk.org\">Humane Society International/UK</a>, to Defra and Natural England. They warn that the shooting permitted by the cull licences \"will inevitably result in the targeting of many pregnant sows and, if culling extends towards the end of the open season, could result in the shooting of lactating sows, leading to the starvation of dependent cubs\".</p> <p>Naturalist and broadcaster Bill Oddie said: \"I cannot believe they are going to be able to go out in pitch darkness \u2013 badgers are nocturnal \u2013 and shoot them. It is truly a horrific situation.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2012 to correctly identify Humane Society International/UK.</p>",
  "<p>Brandon Hunnicutt has had a year to remember. The young Nebraskan from Hamilton County farms 2,600 acres of the High Plains with his father and brother. What looked certain in an almost perfect May to be a \"phenomenal\" harvest of maize and soy beans has turned into a near disaster.</p> <p>A three-month heatwave and drought with temperatures often well over 38C burned up his crops. He lost a third and was saved only by pumping irrigation water from the aquifer below his farm.</p> <p>\"From 1 July to 1 October we had 4ins of rain and long stretches when we didn't have any. Folk in the east had nothing at all. They've been significantly hurt. We are left wondering whether the same will happen again,\" he says.</p> <p>On the other side of the world, Mary Banda, who lives in Mphaka village near Nambuma in Malawi, has had a year during which she has barely been able to feed her children, one of whom has just gone to hospital with malnutrition.</p> <p>Government health worker Patrick Kamzitu says: \"We are seeing more hunger among children. The price of maize has doubled in the last year. Families used to have one or two meals a day; now they are finding it hard to have one.\"</p> <p>Hunnicutt and Banda are linked by food. What she must pay for her maize is determined largely by how much farmers such as Brandon grow and export. This year the US maize harvest is down 15% and nearly 40% of what is left has gone to make vehicle fuel. The result is less food than usual on to the international market, high prices and people around the world suffering.</p> <p>\"This situation is not going to go away,\" says Lester Brown, an environmental analyst and president of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington. In a new book, <em>Full Planet, Empty Plates, </em>he predicts ever increasing food prices, leading to political instability, spreading hunger and, unless governments act, a catastrophic breakdown in food. \"Food is the new oil and land is the new gold,\" he says. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/17/food-prices-rise-commodities\" title=\"\">We saw early signs of the food system unravelling in 2008 </a>following an abrupt doubling of world grain prices. As they climbed, exporting countries [such as Russia] began restricting exports to keep their domestic prices down. In response, importing countries panicked and turned to buying or leasing land in other countries to produce food for themselves.\"</p> <p>\"The result is that a new geopolitics of food has emerged, where the competition for land and water is intensifying and each country is fending for itself.\"</p> <p>Brown has been backed by an <a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/our-land-our-lives-time-out-on-the-global-land-rush-246731\" title=\"\">Oxfam report released last week.</a> It calculated that the land sold or leased to richer countries and speculators in the last decade could have grown enough food to feed a billion people \u2013 almost exactly the number of malnourished people in the world today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/04/land-deals-preventing-food-production\" title=\"\">Nearly 60% of global land deals in the last decade have been to grow crops that can be used for biofuels, says Oxfam</a>.</p> <p>The next danger signal, says Brown, is in rising food prices. In the last 10 years prices have doubled as demand for food has increased with a rapidly growing world population and millions have switched to animal-based diets, which require more grain and land.</p> <p>Most grain prices have risen between 10% and 25% this year after droughts and heatwaves in Ukraine and Australia as well as the US and other food growing centres. The UN says prices are now close to the crisis levels of 2008. Meat and dairy prices are likely to surge in the new year as farmers find it expensive to feed cattle and poultry. Brown says: \"Those who live in the United States, where 9% of income goes for food, are insulated from these price shifts.</p> <p>\"But how do those who live on the lower rungs of the global economic ladder cope? They were already spending 50% to 70% of their income on food. Many were down to one meal a day already before the recent price rises. What happens with the next price surge?\"</p> <p>Oxfam said last week it expected the price of key food staples, including wheat and rice, to double again in the next 20 years, threatening disastrous consequences for the poor.</p> <p>But the surest sign, says Brown, that food supplies are precarious is seen in the amount of surplus food that countries hold in reserve, or \"carry over\" from one year to the next.</p> <p>\"Ever since agriculture began, carry-over stocks of grain have been the most basic indicator of food security. From 1986 to 2001 the annual world carry-over stocks of grain averaged 107 days of consumption. After that, world consumption exceeded production and from 2002 to 2011 they averaged just 74 days of consumption,\" says Brown. Last<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/un-rising-food-costs-weather\" title=\"\"> week the UN</a> estimated US maize reserves to be at a historic low, only 6.3% below estimated consumption and the equivalent of a three-week supply. Global carry-over reserves last week stood at 20%, compared to long term averages of well above 30%.</p> <p>Although there is still \u2013 theoretically \u2013 enough food for everyone to eat, global supplies have fallen this year by 2.6% with grains such as wheat declining 5.2% and only rice holding level, says the UN.</p> <p>There is no guarantee, says Brown, that the world can continue to increase production as it has done for many years. \"Yields are plateauing in many countries and new better seeds have failed to increase yields very much for some years,\" he said.</p> <p>Evan Fraser, author of <em>Empires of Food</em> and a geography lecturer at Guelph University in Ontario, Canada, says: \"For six of the last 11 years the world has consumed more food than it has grown. We do not have any buffer and are running down reserves. Our stocks are very low and if we have a dry winter and a poor rice harvest we could see a major food crisis across the board.\"</p> <p>\"Even if things do not boil over this year, by next summer we'll have used up this buffer and consumers in the poorer parts of the world will once again be exposed to the effects of anything that hurts production.\"</p> <p>Brown says: \"An unprecedented period of world food security has come to an end. The world has lost its safety cushions and is living from year to year. This is the new politics of food scarcity. We are moving into a new food era, one in which it is every country for itself.\"</p> <p>\"What in the past would have been a relatively simple question of developing better seeds, or opening up new land to grow more food, cannot work now because the challenge of growing food without destroying the environment is deepening.\"</p> <p>Brown adds: \"New trends such as falling water tables, plateauing grain yields and rising temperatures join soil erosion and climate change to make it difficult, if not impossible, to expand production fast enough.\"</p> <p>Four pressing needs must be addressed together, he says. Instead of better seeds, tractors or pumps to raise water, he claims, feeding the world now depends on new population, energy, and water policies. Water scarcity, especially, concerns him.</p> <p>\"We live in a world where more than half the people live in countries with food bubbles based on farmers' over-pumping and draining aquifers. The question is not whether these bubbles will burst, but when. The bursting of several national food bubbles as aquifers are depleted could create unmanageable food shortages.</p> <p>\"If world population growth does not slow dramatically, the number of people trapped in hydrological poverty and hunger will only grow.\"</p> <p>The madness of the food system since 1950 astonishes him. Last year, the US harvested nearly 400 million tons of grain, of which one third went to ethanol distilleries to fuel vehicles. Meanwhile, more than 130 million people in China alone, he estimates, live in areas where the underground water resources are being depleted at record rates.</p> <p>Why can't politicians understand that every 1C above the optimum in the growing season equates to roughly a 10% decline in grain yields? he asks.</p> <p>\"Yet if the world fails to address the climate issue, the earth's temperature this century could easily rise by 6C, devastating food supplies.\"</p> <p>The ever greater number of weather-related crises suggests strongly that climate change is beginning to bite and that the heatwaves, droughts and excessive rainfall around the world in the last few years have not been a blip, but a new reality</p> <p>\"We have ignored the earth's environmental stop signs. Faced with falling water tables, not a single country has mobilised to reduce water use. Unless we can wake up to the risks we are taking, we will join earlier civilisations that failed to reverse the environmental trends that undermined their food economies.\"</p> <p>He says we know the answers. They include saving water, eating less meat, stopping soil erosion, controlling populations and changing the energy economy.</p> <p>\"But they must be addressed together We have to mobilise quickly. Time is the scarcest resource. Success depends on moving at wartime speed. It means transforming the world industrial economy, stabilising populations and rebuilding grain stocks.</p> <p>\"We must redefine security. We have inherited a definition from the last century that is almost exclusively military in focus. Armed aggression is no longer the principal threat to our future. The overriding threats are now climate change, population growth, water shortages and rising food prices. The challenge is to save civilisation itself.\"</p>",
  "<p>World grain reserves are so dangerously low that severe weather in the United States or other food-exporting countries could trigger a major hunger crisis next year, the United Nations has warned.</p> <p>Failing harvests in the US, Ukraine and other countries this year have eroded reserves to their lowest level since 1974. The US, which has experienced record heatwaves and droughts in 2012, now holds in reserve a historically low 6.5% of the maize that it expects to consume in the next year, says the UN.</p> <p>\"We've not been producing as much as we are consuming. That is why stocks are being run down. Supplies are now very tight across the world and reserves are at a very low level, leaving no room for unexpected events next year,\" said Abdolreza Abbassian, a senior economist with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). With food consumption exceeding the amount grown for six of the past 11 years, countries have run down reserves from an average of 107 days of consumption 10 years ago to under 74 days recently.</p> <p>Prices of main food crops such as wheat and maize are now close to those that sparked riots in 25 countries in 2008. FAO figures released this week suggest that 870 million people are malnourished and the food crisis is growing in the Middle East and Africa. Wheat production this year is expected to be 5.2% below 2011, with yields of most other crops, except rice, also falling, says the UN.</p> <p>The figures come as one of the world's leading environmentalists issued a warning that the global food supply system could collapse at any point, leaving hundreds of millions more people hungry, sparking widespread riots and bringing down governments. In a shocking new assessment of the prospects of meeting food needs, Lester Brown, president of the Earth policy research centre in Washington, says that the climate is no longer reliable and the demands for food are growing so fast that a breakdown is inevitable, unless urgent action is taken.</p> <p>\"Food shortages undermined earlier civilisations. We are on the same path. Each country is now fending for itself. The world is living one year to the next,\" he writes in a new book.</p> <p>According to Brown, we are seeing the start of a food supply breakdown with a dash by speculators to \"grab\" millions of square miles of cheap farmland, the doubling of international food prices in a decade, and the dramatic rundown of countries' food reserves.</p> <p>This year, for the sixth time in 11 years, the world will consume more food than it produces, largely because of extreme weather in the US and other major food-exporting countries. Oxfam last week said that the price of key staples, including wheat and rice, may double in the next 20 years, threatening disastrous consequences for poor people who spend a large proportion of their income on food.</p> <p>In 2012, according to the FAO, food prices are already at close to record levels, having risen 1.4% in September following an increase of 6% in July.</p> <p>\"We are entering a new era of rising food prices and spreading hunger. Food supplies are tightening everywhere and land is becoming the most sought-after commodity as the world shifts from an age of food abundance to one of scarcity,\" says Brown. \"The geopolitics of food is fast overshadowing the geopolitics of oil.\"</p> <p>His warnings come as the UN and world governments reported that extreme heat and drought in the US and other major food-exporting countries had hit harvests badly and sent prices spiralling.</p> <p>\"The situation we are in is not temporary. These things will happen all the time. Climate is in a state of flux and there is no normal any more.</p> <p>\"We are beginning a new chapter. We will see food unrest in many more places.</p> <p>\"Armed aggression is no longer the principal threat to our future. The overriding threats to this century are climate change, population growth, spreading water shortages and rising food prices,\" Brown says.</p>",
  "<p>Authorities in Massachusetts have been accused of failing to properly enforce regulations aimed at protecting patients from contaminated drugs, after the death toll from an outbreak of meningitis linked to a medicine made in the state rose to 14.</p> <p>The specialised compounding pharmacy at the centre of the escalating health scandal is being investigated for breaches of state and federal laws.</p> <p>A patient from Minnesota, one of almost 14,000 patients at risk of contracting the disease after being injected with the potentially tainted steroid produced by New England Compounding Center, has filed what is expected to be the first of many lawsuits against the company.</p> <p>Now state agencies are facing questions over their enforcement of existing regulations. On Friday, a congressional committee called on the state's pharmacy regulator to provide information about its oversight of the company.</p> <p>Massachusetts is one of just 17 states with regulations designed to protect patients from the sort of health scare which has now spread to 11 states. Two former compounding pharmacists who now work in the quality control industry told the Guardian that the risk to patients would have been minimal had the regulations, known as USP 797, been enforced.</p> <p>\"It's abysmal that the local authorities are calling for greater oversight\" said Eric Kastango, a voluntary committee member of US Pharmacopeia (USP), the industry body behind regulations governing compounding sterile drugs. \"If someone just enforced Massachusetts law, these cases could have been avoided. They failed in their responsibility for enforcing what they already had.\"</p> <p>The scale of the outbreak makes it by far the worst of a series of fatal infections and overdoses connected to specialised \"compounding\" pharmacies.</p> <p>Each case has prompted calls for federal oversight of the drug-producers, which are not subject to the same controls as mass manufacturers but whose regulation falls between the state board of pharmacy, the state department of health and the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p>Kastango questioned how closely the state board of pharmacy had inspected NECC's books and said that the regulations adopted by the state to protect patients, if properly applied, should have avoided contamination.</p> <p>\"If they had complied with USP 797 they would have avoided contamination. They would have found the source of it and remediated it. In my heart of hearts, I believe that.\"</p> <p>He said a company complying with the regulations would have more effectively \"tested and they would have been monitoring their environment. They would have been cleaning the facilities. They would have been able to detect deviation in the process and they would have picked this up.\"</p> <p>The process to make the steroid was \"extremely complex\", requiring two major compounding procedures, one of which involves taking the solution and pumping it into vials without contamination. It would have been considered \"high risk\", he said.</p> <p>Kastango, a consultant in quality control who has 30 years experience in compounding, said that he had carried out as-yet unpublished analysis which found that in almost all of the recent cases where there have been health scares linked to compounding pharmacies, a breach of regulation USP 797 had been involved.</p> <p>The analysis included the infections from Avastin, which affected 16 people in Tennessee and Florida, leaving some of them blind, that was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/health/31drug.html?_r=1\">linked to a compounding company in Hollywood last year</a>.</p> <p>\"There is a need for states to enforce the USP and to hold people to account to existing regulation and to ensure that people who are doing this know what they are doing\" Kastango said.</p> <p>There have been 200 adverse events involving 71 compounded products since 1990, some of them with \"devastating repercussions\", according to the FDA. Three patients died of infections from drugs used in open-heart surgery in 2006 and two patients were blinded at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington due to a compound product that was used in cataract surgery in 2005. Last year, <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/healthcare/Lots-to-learn-from-recent-IV-compounding-deaths-in-Alabama-La.html\">contaminated nutritional supplements from an Alabama company killed nine patients and injured 10 others</a>.</p> <p>Kate Douglas, a former director of a compounding pharmacy who is now president of Performance Strategies LLC, which consults sterile compounding pharmacies on safety issues, said not enough was being done by state boards to enforce regulations and called for more funding for states to ensure compliance.</p> <p>\"I can walk into a pharmacy and tell you within an hour whether they are following USP 797,\" she said. \"But they need to find a way to get them inspected and hold them accountable. It's a challenge for state board of pharmacies. They need to make sure they are knowledgeable about 797 and maybe more funds are needed for states to do that.\"</p> <p>She added: \"If you are a nurse or physician, you are held accountable to state regulations and you have to do the right thing and sometimes doing the right thing takes time. We can only reduce the risk of contamination, it can never drop to zero but if you follow the standards of practice you won't be killing people.\"</p> <p>The Massachusetts office of health and human services said it had taken \"swift action\" against the NECC, but pointed to loopholes in regulatory requirements which left them powerless. The state department of public health called on Congress to act to address the need for new laws.</p> <p>On Thursday, it accused the company of violating one state law which requires compounding pharmacies to only produce drugs to specified patients with a prescription.</p> <p>In a joint press briefing with the FDA and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Madeleine Biondolillo, the department's director of heathcare and safety, said: \"So, you know, NECC under Massachusetts board of pharmacy licensing regulations was licensed to deliver compounded products in response to individual patient specific prescriptions.</p> <p>\"And it looks through the investigation as though they have violated that aspect of the state licensing regulation despite their assertion that they were operating under the regulations.\"</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the department said: \"The FDA and the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy have conducted joint reviews of NECC for more than a decade. These collaborative investigations are essential to maximizing regulatory oversight, and ensuring public safety.</p> <p>\"We've taken swift action to date, including securing the surrender of the company's license, obtaining a recall of all of its products and promptly notifying all providers and patients. We are jointly examining all root causes of these events with the FDA, and we are committed to ensuring that all responsible parties are held accountable.</p> <p>\"We urge Congress to act quickly to address the need for new laws on the federal level to fill in the regulatory gaps, so that there is clear authority over regulating these practices.\"</p> <p>Federal and state regulators have also come under scrutiny for allowing a previously unknown pharmaceuticals sector known as compounding to grow at such a pace without much federal oversight. The industry has grown so large that some of the companies operate more like drug manufacturers than pharmacies, critics say.</p> <p>In 1997, the FDA got Congress to pass a law giving it more power to regulate compounding pharmacies. But in 2002, the US Supreme Court struck down its no-advertising provisions on First Amendment grounds, leaving the rest of the law in limbo.</p>",
  "<p>Orange, a word that has no rhyme, has become the literary prize that defies gravity. Strictly speaking, it should no longer exist. Orange switched off its sponsorship in May.</p> <p>With no Plan B in sight, the board running the prize, including Martha Lane Fox, the UK digital champion, made predictably defiant noises about keeping calm and carrying on, but this is a tough commercial climate. Was the game up for the English-speaking world's premier prize for women's writing? Last week we got the answer.</p> <p>After a four-month hiatus, and a media blackout during the long, wet summer, the literary award formerly known, from 1996 to 2012, as the Orange prize announced the restoration of its original title, the Women's Prize for Fiction (WPF). It would be funded by a group of private benefactors led by Cherie Blair and bestselling writers Joanna Trollope and Elizabeth Buchan.</p> <p>The mood of this relaunch has been upbeat. \"I wasn't approached by anyone. I offered,\" Trollope told the <em>Observer</em>. \"I suddenly realised this was necessary. Women writers need all the help they can get,\" she adds. \"This is simply the best administered, most positive global prize that's also generous in spirit and ambition. Of course I was supportive.\"</p> <p>British booksellers and publishers joined the chorus of approval for the women who had saved Orange. Tim Hely Hutchinson, CEO of Hachette UK, said: \"It inspires, encourages and rewards writers all over the world. The prize is a key event in global publishing.\"</p> <p>This international dimension, meshing perfectly with the digital revolution, is central to the success of this prize. It attracts coverage in China, South Korea, Russia and the emirates. Women for whom English is not their mother tongue have become inspired to write fiction in English, simply to be eligible for the prize, which attracts about 150 submissions of published fiction each year. In 2010 the <em>Bookseller </em>calculated that, of the five top-selling prize novels, four were Orange titles. Industry estimates suggest that Orange has promoted the sale of several million copies, as well as transforming the lives of its shortlisted writers.</p> <p>Kamila Shamsie, shortlisted for her fifth novel, <em>Burnt Shadows</em>, says: \"The shortlisting played a monumental role. A few months after, I was at the Canadian embassy applying for a visa. I'd taken a copy of the novel \u2013 I thought I might need to prove my credentials. The visa official took the novel, read the cover and said: 'You've been shortlisted for the Orange prize?' Yes, I said. 'You must be really good, then. I'll buy your book.' I've never had a more friendly and painless experience in a visa office \u2013 and when I went back to collect my passport there was the visa official with a copy of <em>Burnt Shadows</em>, asking me to sign it.\"</p> <p>Last week's launch of the WPF was just the latest twist in the tale of a prize accustomed to challenging conventional wisdom, winning unlikely supporters and overcoming the monster of apathy. Starting in 1992, it began as a revolt against macho male fiction, represented by a boys' own Booker prize shortlist the previous autumn. After Ben Okri was awarded the Booker, several senior publishers, including former Virago editor Liz Calder, addressed the problem of a literary prize that appeared to exclude women. Booker was not merely out of touch, it was at odds with the British reading public's tastes. It was generally accepted in the trade that women readers were the main market for most fiction. Why was Booker so obtuse about this ?</p> <p>In 1992 some 40 editors and literary agents met in the flat of the agent Anne McDermid to debate what to do. Among the contributors to the unanimous decision to launch a women's prize was a young, would-be writer about to quit her Random House job to write her first novel. \"Basically,\" says Kate Mosse, now chairwoman of the WPF, \"no one has ever owned up to the idea of the prize. It was a collective decision. I got landed with organising it because I had the time.\"</p> <p>Once Orange had signed on as sponsor, the prize went from strength to strength. Mosse is pragmatic about their decision to pull the plug in May. \"It's been a 17-year partnership. That's unprecedented.\" Why quit? \"Orange was reviewing its strategy,\" she says, \"and wanted to focus on film. Orange Wednesdays had been a huge success. The split was amicable. We wanted to expand the prize globally on digital platforms.\"</p> <p>In May, there was a crisis. Orange had pulled out in such a way that it was impossible to have a Plan B in place. Mosse took to the airwaves. The <em>Today</em> programme was, she says, \"the quickest and easiest way to reach all the people who might be interested to get involved\". By the time she left the studio, she and her colleagues were being bombarded with offers. \"But then,\" she says, \"we ran into the summer. No one is around in August.\"</p> <p>Faced with the realisation that no new patron could be put in place before 2014, Mosse and her board made the decision to go it alone. \"This will be a transitional year,\" she says. Lane Fox agrees: \"Proper sponsorship needs a long lead time.\"</p> <p>The women set about raising money for the 2013 prize from private donors. Industry sources say the prize had cost about \u00a3300,000. \"But we were confident we would succeed,\" says Lane Fox. \"The prize offers such a fabulous combination of accessibility, aesthetic rigour and talent.\" The donors gave what Mosse tactfully describes as \"different amounts\", but the basic proposition worked: 2013 can go ahead, on the old model, while the search for a sponsor continues.</p> <p>The making of the WPF is an impressive example of female empowerment mixed with chutzpah, charm, good luck and occasional guile. There remains the announcement of the heir to the Orange sponsorship. Four or five corporate suitors are in conversation with Mosse and her friends, who are coy about the state of play. \"It's unlikely to be an arms manufacturer or a cigarette company,\" says Mosse. \"The orange label of Veuve Clicquot would suit our brand.\" A champagne sponsor for women's writing? \"I wouldn't say no,\" laughs Mosse.</p>",
  "<p>An abstract painting by the German artist Gerhard Richter has sold for \u00a321.3m, setting a new record for the price paid at auction for the work of a living artist.</p> <p>Abstraktes Bild (809-4), which was owned by the rock guitarist Eric Clapton, sold at Sotheby's auction house in London to an anonymous buyer after five minutes of bidding. Pre-sale estimates valued the painting at between \u00a39m and \u00a312m.</p> <p>The sale broke the previous auction record for a living artist of \u00a317.8m paid for Jasper Johns' Flag at Christie's auction house in New York in 2010.</p> <p>The price for the 1994 oil on canvas also beat Richter's previous record, set in May when Abstraktes Bild (7938-3) sold for \u00a313.5m.</p> <p>Sotheby's described the painting as a \"masterpiece of calculated chaos\" and a \"paradigm of Gerhard Richter's mature artistic and philosophical achievement\".</p> <p>\"The combination of outstanding provenance and gold-standard quality in this sublime work by this blue-chip artist made for an historic auction moment,\" said Alex Branczik, the senior director at the auction house and head of the sale. \"Gerhard Richter's international appeal as one of the hottest contemporary artists was once again confirmed this evening.\"</p> <p>The total value of Richter's works sold at auction in 2011 topped \u00a3124.5m ($200m), according to the auction tracker Artnet \u2013 more than those of any other living artist and more than auction totals in the same year for Claude Monet, Alberto Giacometti and Mark Rothko combined.</p> <p>Richter, 80, who lives in Cologne, was born in Dresden and grew up in communist East Germany. His work includes both abstract and figurative paintings as well as photographs.</p> <p>A retrospective, Gerhard Richter: Panorama, was exhibited at the Tate Modern in London last year and at the Popmidou Centre in Paris and the Staatlichen Museum in Berlin this year.</p> <p>The top end of the art market has performed strongly in recent years despite the downturn in the global economy. The sale comes as the art world flocked to London for Frieze Art Week, the most important contemporary art fair in Britain, with exhibits by hundreds of galleries from around the world.</p> <p>Clapton, 67, known for his work with Cream and the Yardbirds as well as a solo artist, has an extensive art collection.</p>",
  "<p>Millions of householders face record high heating bills this winter as two of Britain's biggest energy suppliers announced price increases of up to 9% on the same day.</p> <p>British Gas has announced a price rise of 6% for gas and electricity customers that will add \u00a380 to the typical household's annual bill, while npower has announced an 8.8% price increase for gas and 9.1% for electricity, adding \u00a3112 to bills.</p> <p>The rises, which come into effect on 16 November for British Gas and 10 days later for npower customers, will make the latter the most expensive supplier in the country. Customers on its most expensive tariff face a typical annual bill of \u00a31,356.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/22/sse-announces-energy-price-rise\" title=\"\">SSE has already announced price rises of 9%</a>, which take effect on Monday, making it the second most expensive supplier, at \u00a31,354 a year. British Gas is a close third with average bills rising to \u00a31,336.</p> <p>The move is a bitter blow for householders who suffered gas and electricity price rises in 2011 of 18% and 16% respectively from British Gas and 17% from npower. This was followed by a 5% drop in electricity tariffs by British Gas in January 2012 and a 3% cut in the same month from npower.</p> <p>George Osborne told ITV: \"We are doing everything we can to help people insulate their homes better. We've got government programmes which we urge people to take up to make sure that they can get their electricity bills cheaper but of course I'm concerned when I see electricity bills going up and partly that is because of things beyond our control \u2013 what's happening in the world with oil prices and gas prices.\"</p> <p>Asked whether energy companies are profiting too much, the chancellor said: \"Of course these companies need to generate money that they can invest in new power stations and new grids and the like but I'm also very clear that at a time like this we've got to help families.\"</p> <p>Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: \"Rises in fuel costs are eating away at people's earnings, forcing them to make really difficult choices about whether to have a warm home, put food on the table, or fill up the car in order to get to work.\"</p> <p>A total of 8.5m households will be hit by the British Gas increase, though a further 1 million of its customers on fixed-price contracts will be unaffected. The 4,000 British Gas customers on its renewable energy tariff will face even bigger rises when their electricity bills rise by 11%. The company blamed the bigger rise on the higher cost of generating electricity from renewable sources. Three million npower customers will see their prices go up, while a further 500,000 on fixed tariffs will see no change.</p> <p>British Gas blamed the price increase on rising wholesale prices as well as increasing costs related to social and environmental issues. \"We simply cannot ignore the rising costs that are largely outside our control, but which make up most of the bill,\" said the company's managing director, Phil Bentley.</p> <p>\"Britain's North Sea gas supplies are running out, and British Gas has to pay the going rate for gas in a competitive global marketplace. Furthermore, the investment needed to maintain and upgrade the national grid to deliver energy to our customers' homes, and the costs of the government's policies for a clean, energy efficient Britain, are all going up.\"</p> <p>Paul Massara, chief commercial officer at npower, blamed \"external factors\". \"We support moves to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but new government schemes will mean energy bills will rise,\" he said.</p> <p>Consumer groups were quick to express their concerns, not only at the size of the rises but at the similarity between the resulting prices. Joe Malinowski, energy analyst at <a href=\"https://www.theenergyshop.com/HomeEnergy/\" title=\"\">TheEnergyShop.com</a>, said he did not agree wholesale gas prices could be to blame. \"Year on year these are down,\" he said. \"The price rise also makes British Gas's prices almost identical to that of SSE, once SSE's prices go up on Monday. So where is the competition in the market?\"</p> <p>Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: \"Price hikes on the same day will just reinforce the views and prejudices of consumers \u2013 whether justified or not \u2013 about a lack of transparency and competitiveness in the market.</p> <p>\"People are not convinced they are getting a fair deal. Unless they can be reassured about the relationship between costs, prices and profits, consumer distrust will continue, companies won't get their message across, and the success of the regulator will be questioned.\"</p> <p>It is widely anticipated the remaining \"big six\" suppliers will soon follow suit with similar price rises. E.ON has a price freeze in place until the end of the yearbut has refused to rule out an increase after that, but ScottishPower and EDF are expected to announce rises imminently.</p> <p>Some householders could still save close to \u00a3300 by switching supplier and tariff, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/29/fuel-bills-price-rises-best-deals-winter\" title=\"\">but many of the cheapest deals have recently been pulled</a>. Three of the cheapest five tariffs now come from two of the country's smallest suppliers, First Utility and Ovo Energy.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/12/british-gas-raises-electricity-tariffs\" title=\"\">See if you can save money with the Guardian Money Deals switching service</a></p>"
