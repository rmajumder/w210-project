  "<p>Napoleon could have done with one, and so, too, could the Zulu king <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetshwayo_kaMpande\" title=\"\">Cetewayo</a> and more than 6,000 Boers. But at last the island on which these souls were held captive is to have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19267222\" title=\"\">an airport</a>. Saint Helena's airport will inevitably change life on, and the unique environment of, one of the world's remotest islands. At 1,200 miles from Africa \u2013 the nearest port is in southern Angola \u2013 and 1,800 miles from South America, the UK overseas territory is literally in the middle of nowhere. The prospect of a two-day rather than a two-week trip to the UK must surely appeal to most \"Saints\", as well as arrest population decline. It must at least be possible to have modern communications without concreting over the flora and fauna whose diversity astonished Darwin. The first passengers are not due to arrive until 2016, which means that Napoleon misses out both ways. The 200th anniversary of his arrival will have<a href=\"http://sthelenaonline.org/2012/08/07/napoleon-misses-the-plane-as-runway-boost-delays-opening/\" title=\"\"> come and gone</a> by then.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Two ways to deal with political turbulence. One is to take immediate action: sack someone; set up an inquiry. The other is to opine, as James Callaghan never quite did: \"Crisis? What crisis?\" Amid mounting concerns about the elections to find the new cadre of elected police commissioners, policing minster Nick Herbert has opted for the latter. \"Forget the carping about police and crime commissioner elections,\" <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2012/08/fromnickherbertmp.html\" title=\"\">writes the man with the plan on the website ConservativeHome</a>. \"It's the summer silly season and the media are landing on anything they can to whip up a story. So \u2013 shock, horror \u2013 candidates will be disqualified if they have convictions for an imprisonable offence. Just imagine the BBC's sanctimonious reaction if they'd discovered someone standing with a conviction.\" Which would be a reasonable line of defence if the only malcontents were to be found within the media. But, in truth, there is disquiet expressed by Labour types, independents and Conservatives, all of it documented in detail, not least by the admirable website <a href=\"http://topofthecops.com/\" title=\"\">topofthecops</a>. Isn't shooting the messenger a firearms offence?</p> <p>\u2022 Yes, crisis, what crisis? We should all jolly well be ashamed of ourselves, implying that all is wrong when all is right. But before donning that hair shirt, let us compare and contrast. On one hand, we have Labour's candidate in Avon and Somerset <a href=\"http://bobashford.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bob Ashford</a>. He has had to withdraw because, nearly 50 years ago \u2013 aged 13 \u2013 he trespassed on a railway embankment and was fined \u00a35. Ashford later became head of strategy for the Youth Justice Board and enjoyed Home Office security clearance. No place for Bob. Whereas Kevin Carroll \u2013 he of the English Defence League, who was convicted of a public order offence in 2010 and given a conditional discharge after hurling abuse at Muslims the previous year in Luton, ordered by a judge to pay \u00a3175 costs and then another \u00a3330 costs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-10731035\" title=\"\">when his appeal was thrown out</a> \u2013 can stand with the government's blessing. His was not an imprisonable offence. So as you see, it's all going very well.</p> <p>\u2022 And the jobless figure released this week \u2013 down 46,000 to 2.56 million \u2013 would seem to give further reason for optimism. The total is the lowest this year. \"Benefits Britain is learning how to work again,\" according to the Sun. And there is brand new opportunity courtesy of Tesco. The supermarket behemoth is looking for buyers. Not just anybody. Required, according to the ad, <a href=\"http://www.tesco-careers.com/job.cfm/reference/2317/source/BOND/\" title=\"\">are people who \"achieve their targets\" by \"getting someone else to pay\"</a>, \"buying for less\" and \"re-engineering\", which many translate as screwing farmers. Perhaps they're getting in quick before the introduction of the new code of practice which will ensure that they do the right thing by suppliers. It won't be a perfect arrangement, but then, every little helps.</p> <p>\u2022 We instinctively feel it's going well; and here we are guided by Nadia Cenci, a Tory councillor in Ipswich, and also a \"qualified confidence and performance coach and licensed neuro linguistic programming practitioner\". She has an approach commendable to any politician. \"Why I don't listen to experts (or facts and figures),\" was the subject of <a href=\"http://ipswichpolitics.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/why-i-dont-listen-to-experts-or-facts.html\" title=\"\">Nadia's blog posting last week</a>. \"I have not needed anyone to tell me that global warming is a sham. I knew that years ago. The same as my gut instinct told me that the so-called ice age in the 70s was a load of old rubbish.\" Nadia foresaw the financial crash before Vince Cable, \"I just sensed it\". She also dreamed her roof would blow off in a hurricane the night before it did. \"My then boyfriend called me a witch,\" writes Nadia. Ipswich turned municipally to Labour at the last election. Can't think why.</p> <p>\u2022 And to end, a prayer. This from our scary friends in the fundamentalist group <a href=\"http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/?p=3832\" title=\"\">Christian Voice UK</a>. \"Thank God for the Russians and the Chinese,\" they say. Let us pray \"that&#xa0;Britain will pull back from its unqualified support of the Syrian rebels and realise that the Assad regime, with all its faults, remains the last protector of the Christian and Alawite minorities in Syria.

It is important to understand that this is a necessary market response to a worldwide reduction in grain production. The cure for high prices is high prices.</p> <p>Government restrictions and bans on grain exports to keep domestic food prices down have a far greater impact on global food prices than biofuels. This short-sighted approach fails to support the much-needed financial investment in farming in those countries and allow for the necessary production response. Simply, national market intervention creates an international mismatch in grain price and availability. Biofuels provide a further market for grains at around 1.5% of global demand, but they have been singled out as a scapegoat for price spikes. &#xa0;</p> <p>We need to keep these things under review, but simplistic calls for the removal of existing biofuels targets threaten to remove any stability and certainty within the market, and would risk increased volatility and reduced global production. Using crops for biofuels supports efficient and sustainable development, and produces high-quality animal feeds and a substitute for the fossil fuels on which we have become so reliant.

That rise has been exacerbated by the drought conditions in the corn belt of the US. The food industry now includes a substantial component of imported corn syrup in its food to \"improve\" flavour. Yet, as a recent series of BBC programmes has made clear, corn syrup is a substantial contributor to the current plague of obesity in the UK and a major cost to the nation in terms of poor health. Yet the government, so keen we are told to reduce our cost base, takes no action.

  "<p>Camelot brought sparkle to the frequently prosaic nature of the racecourse gallop when warming up for the St Leger next month before racing at Leopardstown on Thursday.</p> <p>The racecourse workout has frequently been used by the trainer Aidan O'Brien with previous champions as a means of bringing forward a horse who has enjoyed a break from the action.</p> <p>But rather than the customary dawdle at which such affairs are often staged, Camelot enjoyed a genuine blow-out ahead of his historic bid to become the first horse since Nijinksy in 1970 to win British racing's Triple Crown by adding the St Leger to his previous victories in the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby.</p> <p>With the regular jockey Joseph O'Brien in the saddle, Camelot was held up behind his stablemates Chamonix and Fame And Glory in the early stages of the gallop over about a mile and three furlongs. The pair had spent some time circling the paddock beforehand, Camelot's presence having attracted understandable interest among early arrivals at the course.</p> <p>Fellow St Leger possible Chamonix, ridden by the former jumps jockey Dean Gallagher, led the trio at a decent pace until headed over two furlongs out, at which point Fame And Glory and Seamie Heffernan momentarily took over before Camelot cruised clear to ultimately finish half a dozen lengths in front. O'Brien declared himself \"delighted, absolutely\".</p> <p>\"They went a nice solid bit of work, it was an even pace, and you'd have to be happy with him [Camelot],\" he added. \"He's done very well physically, he's made like a miler and you can see that he has a bit of a tummy on him.</p> <p>\"It's a long time from The Curragh [and his most recent victory in the Irish Derby] to Doncaster so he needed to go somewhere and it was easier to come here than to go to somewhere like York. It's been a good while since he ran, he has had a break, so we're delighted.\"</p> <p>However, the prospect of stepping Camelot up to the one mile, six furlongs and 132 yards of the Leger trip appeared to be weighing on his mind. \"Obviously you're going to be running a good bit beyond his trip,\" he said. \"He's had a nice day out, now he can come home and be trained for it. But it will obviously be a big test for him going over the trip.\"</p> <p>It would undoubtedly be beyond most three-year-olds to possess sufficient speed to win a Classic over a mile and yet also have the stamina for the St Leger. The Triple Crown is not just a feat rarely achieved, but also something rarely attempted.</p> <p>Camelot's owners clearly believe that the colt's class will see him through, but with O'Brien publicising his apparent doubts so far before the race, we must expect the issue to become a familiar theme in the buildup to the race.</p> <p>We can at least hope that in the absence of Frankel and with other top-class performers set to retire to Coolmore at the end of this season, his owners may be persuaded to keep Camelot in training next year, whether his Doncaster venture on 15 September ends in success or not.</p> <p>Fame And Glory's next start will be in the Irish St Leger, a contest that is open to older horses as well as three-year-olds.</p> <p>He will be on a retrieval mission after proving bitterly disappointing when favourite to land back-to-back victories in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in June, a performance his trainer put down to the horse \"getting older and wiser\".</p> <p>\"He went to sleep and didn't wake up,\" said O'Brien. \"Seamus is adamant that the way to ride him will be to go handy.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, speculation continues over the make-up of the presenting team for Channel 4's racing coverage when the programme is relaunched under IMG Sports Media in the new year.</p> <p>One presenter widely tipped to be involved alongside Clare Balding is her colleague Rishi Persad, who also had a key role in the BBC's acclaimed coverage of the Olympics. Channel 4's sports editor Jamie Aitchison is believed to be interested in continuing the partnership.</p> <p>Persad, who has been confirmed as a reporter for the BBC's Ryder Cup golf coverage next month, worked with Balding and newly appointed Channel 4 Racing executive producer Carl Hicks on the BBC's racing output and has also been involved with IMG at the World Snooker Championship for the BBC. \"I sent Carl a text to congratulate him when I heard news of his appointment, but I haven't heard anything more,\" said Persad. \"I would obviously be delighted to be considered.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is ironic indeed that China is in talks about a $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) purchase of a gold producer, African Barrick, whose value has been hammered down at least in part by the lack of confidence surrounding the Chinese economy.</p> <p>Cash-rich companies from the People's Republic are in a perfect position to snap up mining assets around the world that are being driven into retrenchment by a slowdown in Chinese demand for all kinds of coal, ore and minerals.</p> <p>Some of this slowdown results from deliberate policies by the government in Beijing, but it would take a heroic conspiracy theorist to believe these were being pursued so that more commodity firms can be hoovered up by China on the cheap.</p> <p>Certainly in the case of African Barrick Gold, the share price is down well below its 2010 float on the London stock market. But demand for gold in China is still growing \u2013 partly as a hedge against falls in other investments.</p> <p>There is no doubt that China's first-half GDP growth of 7.8% \u2013 its lowest level in three years \u2013 is causing a huge slump in the price of most commodities, and severe pain for the miners who benefited so much from China's previously soaring demand.</p> <p>Some coal prices recently hit a two-year low and BHP Billiton said on Thursday that increasing costs and falling prices meant \"clearly there may be some impact on jobs in some areas\" of its Australian coal operations.</p> <p>The company, which is expected to unveil its first profit fall in three years next week, has abandoned an $80bn five-year spending plan that it unveiled less than a year ago when commodity prices were still flying high.</p> <p>Last week Rio Tinto said it would be closing the Blair Athol coal mine in Queensland before the end of the year with the loss of 140 jobs, and reported a 22% slump in first half-profits to $5bn compared with the same period last year. And this week Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) \u2013 a FTSE 100 company \u2013 said it would be cutting its spending this year by $300m and reviewing its long-term investments of $8.8bn as earnings plunged 40%.</p> <p>ENRC's chief executive, Felix Vulis, talked about a \"volatile market environment and pricing uncertainty\" that has come just after the Kazakh-focused iron ore miner has spent $5bn on acquisitions.</p> <p>ANZ Bank has recently cut its overall commodity price forecasts by 4% for this year and 3.4% for next. Now is a good time to buy \u2013 that is, if you have $3.2&#xa0;trillion of foreign exchange reserves like China.</p>",
  "<p>British car production is still revving ahead of the rest of the economy after official figures showed an increase in output for the 13th month in a row.</p> <p>Almost 120,000 cars were built in the UK in July, which is up 22% on the same period last year, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The figures came in the same week that one of the industry's great export successes, Jaguar Land Rover, moved to a 24-hour operation in order to keep up with soaring demand from Asia. The latest SMMT total means that year-to-date production is running at 875,998, an increase of 15%.</p> <p>Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, said investment commitments from producers with a major UK presence, from JLR to BMW and Toyota, had underpinned the growth. \"While uncertainty in Europe remains a challenge, the \u00a36bn investment committed to the UK in the last two years delivers long-term growth opportunities, and the latest figures show that our products have enormous global appeal.\"</p> <p>The car industry is at the forefront of the government's \"march of the makers\" because it is such a strong export sector, with around eight out of 10 vehicles built in the UK sold abroad. Domestic demand for vehicles has slumped, with car sales falling 4.4% last year, in a stark example of rebalancing the UK economy away from domestic consumption to export-driven sectors.</p> <p>The Unite union's assistant general secretary, Tony Burke, said: \"Britain's car industry is continuing to buck the trend being set by an unsupported manufacturing industry. The month-on-month increase in output is proof that investment works and that, when skilled UK manufacturing workers get the opportunity, they deliver world-class products.\"</p>",
  "<p>We all want our children to succeed, don't we? What many of us overlook, however, is that allowing them to fail is an important part of any future success. London 2012 saw Team GB achieving remarkable success but among the medal winners were those who failed to live up to expectations (both theirs and ours).</p> <p>Athletes, however, are more able to handle failure than the schoolchildren studying for exams in the high-pressure environment of compulsory education. This is perhaps in part due to the massive commitment world class athletes need in order to stay at the top of their game, but is also down to the work carried out by sports psychologists, who played an important role in the success of British athletes. The difference is that top athletes are often as familiar with their mental states as they are with their physical capabilities.</p> <p>Note that I have no issue with the use of the oft-derided term fail, for without failure there would be no success, would there? Fail is not a popular word in education, even if you have failed your A levels you will still be awarded an unclassified \u2013 it's as if the word itself would make failure inevitable. Of course athletes know how to deal with failure because they have a greater understanding of their own personal psychology, which in turn leads to greater mental strength (to add to their obvious physical strength) and a higher level of psychological resilience.</p> <p>Many of us (both pupils and those involved in education) remain relatively ignorant of the link between psychology and success, assuming that, for example, our intelligence is of fixed, innate and unchangeable quantity. In fact, adolescent intelligence (as measured by IQ scores) fluctuates considerably, leading Angela Duckworth (an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania) to conclude that academic success is more to do with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaeFnxSfSC4\">motivation and grit rather than to being born bright</a>.</p> <p>Abilities are therefore flexible rather than fixed. Stanford University psychologist <a href=\" http://mindsetonline.com/\">Carol Dweck</a> believes that success and failure are determined by what the individual understands about himself or herself, dividing the world into those who have fixed mindsets and those with growth mindsets.</p> <p>Fixed 'mindsetters' are of the opinion that success and failure are somehow genetically programmed into us so that the child who believes themselves to be unintelligent will never be able to succeed academically; more worrying is that those teachers with a fixed mindset employ their own preconceptions and prejudices and transfer them onto those who fulfil the requirements of the successful student or the failure.</p> <p>Contrast this with the growth 'mindsetter'. Dweck found that teaching young children about the way in which the brain learns actually made them more likely to succeed in academic tests. A growth mindset allows us to believe that our intelligence is a fluid entity and we have great control over how intelligent we are and how successful we can be. Those with a growth mindset view failure as a temporary stop on the way to success, in the same way that an Olympic cyclist views missing out on a medal as an opportunity to assess, improve and get that gold medal next time around.</p> <p>If success is within our personal control then the way in which we praise pupils should reflect this view. Praising innate abilities (\"You're very clever\") leads to a fixed mindset (as does telling a child that they provided a very good answer even if the answer was completely wrong), praising the effort, on the other hand, makes success about hard work rather than something that is given. Pointing out how and why failure has occurred should be seen as part of the learning process, rather than an end in itself. Failure should be seen as an opportunity to grow and should never be brushed under the carpet in order to conceal our embarrassment or shame.</p> <p>So, let's hear it for failure. You're just one more step on the road to success.</p> <p>Marc Smith teaches A level psychology at a secondary school in North Yorkshire and is a member of the GTN teacher panel.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> We need to talk about cricket. At a few seconds past 11am (they're never on time these days), a gentleman will shout 'play'. Another gentleman will bowl a lump of leather as fast as possible, and a third gentleman will attempt to repel it with his trusty willow. Briefly, all will be well with the world. Cricket regularly provides respite or sanctuary \u2013 whether it's from work, life, your inability to stop whistling Pocket Full of Sunshine by Natasha Bedingfield, or the nagging fear that the spot on your face is much more visible to your chosen sex than you would like (yes, it is). Today we need cricket to provide respite from <em>cricket</em>, or at least the increasingly dispiriting events of the last fortnight. For the next five days, we can concentrate on the good stuff: bat 'n' ball rather than tweets 'n' texts. And woe betide the first person who mentions Piers Morgan.</p> <p>It's almost been lost in the shadow of what must never, ever, ever be called textgate or KPgate or Badgergate or anything with a gate, but this is a rather important Test match. In fact it's huge, so huge that, were Blackadder a cricket fan, he'd be off on one about Hugh McHuge, who's just been appointed professor of hugeness at Oxford University. </p> <p>England have no option but to win. If they do, they stay No1 in the world and their decision to drop Kevin Pietersen will be seen to be vindicated (even though, in reality, the result of this match has nothing to do with whether it was the right decision or not). If they don't, South Africa become officially the best side in the world.</p> <p>It's England's biggest match at home since the final Ashes Test of 2009, when a team without Pietersen \u2013 and, as now, given approximately no chance by many pundits \u2013 famously beat Australia to regain the Ashes. It's crazy to write off their chances here, although a good start is essential and they will have a helluva job taking 20 wickets on a pitch that usually saps bowlers' souls for kicks.</p> <p>Perversely, taking precisely no wickets on the first day \u2013 by winning the toss, batting first and batting long \u2013 would be the best place to start. After all the nonsense of the last 10 days, watching every last forward defensive of a Jonathan Trott marathon would feel positively orgiastic.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>A special guest will ring the bell for the start of play at Lord's today</strong>. It's not Piers Morgan. It's not, as was suggested, Usain Bolt. It's not Jessica Ennis. It's not even Natasha Bedingfield. But it is Yohan Blake, and that's pretty cool.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>A quick message to Andrew Strauss ahead of his 100th Test</strong></p> <p>1. Congratulations. You're one of the classier human beings to have played the game, and were a seriously good player before the captaincy started to have its inevitable impact on your batting and your hairline. We all love you dearly.</p> <p>2. Winthetossandbatwinthetossandbatpleasewinthetossandbat.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss</strong> and will bat first. That's not good news for England on what looks a cracking wicket. Mind you Andrew Strauss, who knows almost as much about cricket as me, says it's \"not a bad toss to lose\" because of a green tinge to the pitch.</p> <p>England make two changes, with Jonny Bairstow replacing Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann coming in for Tim Bresnan. I'd have gone for five bowlers, but it was never likely to happen. South Africa \u2013 horror, shock \u2013 are unchanged. </p> <p><strong>England</strong> Strauss (c), Cook, Trott, Bell, Taylor, Bairstow, Prior (wk), Broad, Swann, Anderson, Finn.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Petersen, Smith (c), Amla, Kallis, de Villiers (wk), Rudolph, Duminy, Philander, Steyn, M Morkel, Tahir.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>The Tom Maynard Trust</strong> A couple of months on, the death of Tom Maynard still makes no sense at all. His family have launched the Tom Maynard Trust, as Jon Surtees at Surrey CCC explains.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://bit.ly/MYao3s\">The Tom Maynard Trust</a>, a charity organised by Tom's family in his memory, is being launched next week at the Kia Oval. As part of the launch, his father Matthew is leading a sponsored peloton of cyclists from Cardiff to London \u2013 also including Andrew Flintoff, Steve James and Surrey Chairman Richard Thompson \u2013 arriving at the Kia Oval shortly before the match between Surrey and Glamorgan on Tuesday (August 21) that will act as the launch of the charity.</p> <p>To raise awareness and boost the launch, we are hoping to bring together members of the cricketing community from around the world to tweet the same message simultaneously at 11am (GB Time) on Monday August 20th. We are looking to get as many fans, players, coaches, organisations etc.. as possible to back this so it really takes over the feeds of cricket fans and raises awareness on a massive level.</p> <p>The message is as follows: Tom Maynard was a great man and a great cricketer.

Just how long was I out? Did I miss a leadership coup at the ECB?\"</p> <p>Yeah, the England captain Piers Morgan is playing his 100th Test in the match between Europe and Australasia at the Kentucky Fried MCG today. How long have you been asleep?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>The good news for England</strong> is that there's a bit of cloud cover in north London. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;ground=10;orderby=batting_average;template=results;type=batting\">The bad news is that Graeme Smith averages 84 million on this ground</a>.

England have had more theories for Graeme Smith in this series than George Costanza had for meeting women. His were <strike> more successful </strike> less unsuccessful. There's some encouraging early inswing for Anderson, and Smith gets off the mark with a single into the covers.</p> <p>\"What do you think about Jonny Bairstow coming in, Rob?\" says Jonathan Wood. \"Surely his (limited) Test chances so far suggest he's too green for this match. I'm not sure where else you'd go, though \u2013 I presume Bopara's 'personal reasons' mean he's still not available? Collingwood would have fitted the bill nicely right now.\" I'd have picked five bowlers but, as I said, that was never going to happen. Bob Willis advocated Rob Key on Sky the other night. Bob Willis is a wise man.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 4-0 (Smith 2, Petersen 2)</strong> Stuart Broad needs to bowl as he did on the final day at Headingley, with fire, brimstone and a full length. Petersen drives a couple through the covers before being beaten by a fine outswinger.</p> <p>\"I'm probably alone, but I don't think not winning this match and the consequent losing of #1 status is necessarily a bad thing,\" says Andy Smith. \"Seems we're a bit too keen to say we're No1 than get on the pitch and prove it, what is it? Four wins in the last 11 Tests? Maybe having to go out and regain top dog status might be a good thing.\" I know what you mean. Three wins in ten this year. You do wonder if there's something in the English sporting psyche that struggles to cope with the expectation of success. I mean look at the Olympics! I hope England win here, though, because if they fail to win, and then lose in India, an era could end pretty quickly. Look what happened to the 2005 side that was supposed to take over the cricket world, cure baldness and ensure we all live happily ever after.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 5-0 (Smith 3, Petersen 2)</strong> There is encouraging swing for both bowlers, and Petersen's attempted on-drive ends with a leading edge towards mid off. Early wickets are so important, psychologically as much as anything. If South Africa are 80 for none at lunch, England will find it pretty hard not to feel sorry for themselves.</p> <p>\"Look can we just not mention him?\" says Rory Taylor. \"I could fill a library with how much I despise him but he is such a sick, psychotically dependent, attention junkie that he would actually shrivel up &amp; die if we all ignored him. So it goes without saying what we should all do.\" Look, that's no way to talk about Rob Key. Honk! Honk with me now. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 10-0 (Smith 4, Petersen 6)</strong> Smith takes a really dodgy single down the ground, slowly revving up his big unit as Finn runs round from mid on to collect and throw underarm at the stumps. Had he hit, Smith would have been gone. England have to take those half chances. Okay it's probably more a three-eighths chance but that doesn't exactly roll of the tongue does it. Petersen drives a Broad outswinger through mid off for the first boundary. England won't mind that; they have to take the risk of inviting the drive early on.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 11-0 (Smith 5, Petersen 6)</strong> Petersen inside edges a big inswinger from Anderson onto his pads. This is a big hour for England because the ball is doing a fair bit. Another inside edge plops safely on the leg side. There's no short leg although it wouldn't have gone to him anyway. Anderson completes an outstanding over by beating Petersen with a sensational outswinger.</p> <p>\"So, will the England performance be able to step out from the shadow of the selection controversy that is plaguing the side before play has started?\" says Josh Robinson. \"I'm talking, of course, of the indirect dropping of Tim Bresnan for Steven Finn. Was Swann only 'rested' at Headingley so that this decision could be made in the guise of two tactical changes? I think we should be told.\" I'll text some of the lads in the dressing room to find out, although I'll be sure to couch the question in some banter just in case.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 14-0 (Smith 7, Petersen 7)</strong> Broad swings a shortish delivery back in to Smith, who wears it in the breadbasket. He doesn't rub it, although I think I saw the ball wince.</p> <p>\"I respect Graeme Smith greatly (he'll be delighted to know this),\" says Steven Pye. \"He is a tough cricketer, an impressive captain, but must he make my life a total misery? Can't he just get out quietly one day whilst scoring a scratchy 3? Every time he walks out to bat against us I automatically assume he is going to make an unbeaten double hundred. I've had enough.\" The odd thing is that his record v England in South Africa isn't that great \u2013 he averages a <em>pathetic</em> 43.50&#xa0;\u2013 but over here he is as grimly inevitable as banter on a chat show.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 20-0 (Smith 13, Petersen 7)</strong> Anderson is bowling beautifully, but it would seem Dame Fortune has a cob on with him for some rason. Smith is beaten by a monstrous outswinger, edges another along the ground for four, and is beaten again off the last ball of the over.</p> <p>\"With all the brouhaha about Pietersen in the build-up to this test match there hasn't been much coverage of how SA feel about potentially becoming the No 1 side,\" says Max Tant. \"Has there been any mention of their perceived, or otherwise, tendency to choke when on the cusp of glory? Will it affect them in a Test match environment? What will happen if they need one run to win with only one wicket left (not likely now they're batting first, but who knows)?\" </p> <p>It feels a bit different this time. They look calm and ready, although they have had some daft collapses in the last year. They have actually been No1 before, but only for four months in 2009. They lost the No1 ranking without playing a game. <em>Bottlers</em>.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 22-0 (Smith 14, Petersen 8)</strong> England have got to get rid of Smith. He's such a distraction, and so intimidating, that psychologically it would be worth a lot more than one wicket.</p> <p>\"Thought Patrick Eagar the photographer once rang the bell at Lord's?\" says Dom O'Reilly. \"He's not a cricketer.\" Ah, you might be right. As with 99.94 per cent of the OBO, I nicked that off Sky.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 22-1 (Smith c Prior b Anderson 14)</strong> The beast has been slain! Graeme Smith is out! He chased a wide, very full delivery from Anderson \u2013 the first bowled from around the wicket \u2013 and England were certain he snicked it to Matt Prior. The umpire Kumar Dharmasena said not out and, although England reviewed straight away, it seemed the relevant noise was bat on ground rather than ball. Smith's bat <em>did</em> hit the ground \u2013 it bashed it, in fact \u2013 but he outside edged the ball almost simultaneously. Some wickets are bigger than others. That is a very big wicket.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 22-1 (Petersen 8, Amla 0)</strong> \"When was the last time we had two unproven (say having played collectively less than 10 Tests) batsmen in our top six?\" says Matt Biss. \"In a funny way it might help Taylor and Bairstow that the other's there; neither will have to shoulder the burden of being the new kid on what is circumstantially a pretty pressurised block, feeling like the solitary rabbit in the headlight.\" Good question. Bopara and Shah in the Caribbean in 2009? The last time at home \u2013 and in a really big Test \u2013 might have been the 2005 Ashes, with Bell and Pietersen.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Petersen is content to drive despite the swinging ball, and puts Broad away for another boundary through mid off. Broad has a huge shout for LBW later in the over. Simon Taufel says not out and, although Broad is desperate to review \u2013 he's almost like Renton in Trainspotting; I JUST NEED ONE MORE REVIEW, YOU \u00a3*&amp;! \u2013 Strauss and Prior think otherwise. Hawkeye shows they were right, as it was missing. An eventful over concludes with a jaffa that swerves past Petersen's defensive push.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/.a/6a00d83451c45669e20120a5ddcabc970c-500wi\">England fielders celebrate the wicket of Graeme Smith</a>,\" honks Daniel Harris. Honk with him now. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Finn replaces Anderson. This is a big match for him because he hasn't been at his best in his two Test appearances this summer. He starts with a sharp maiden, including a fine delivery that jags back sharply to slam into Amla's stomach.</p> <p>\"Vic Marks' piece in the Guardian yesterday had several hundred comments below it in support of KP,\" says Brett. \"Many reckon there is one rule for him, another for the likes of Swann and Broad. Would love to hear your thoughts on this.\" I don't really have many thoughts, about anything. It's such a difficult thing to judge without knowing all the facts, so I can't quite understand why so many people have been so strident. Things I do think: it's very sad and pretty unseemly, Twitter is evil, KP has been a fool but is surely not the only one at fault, and Strauss and Flower have behaved publicly with a class and dignity I'd quite like to call my own. That's about it. Ultimately, I'm sitting on the fence and citing ignorance.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Petersen has a disgusting windy woof at an inviting wide outswinger from Broad. Fresh air flies for four; the ball goes through to Matt Prior. A maiden.</p> <p>\"Morning Rob, morning sportsfans,\" says Nick Barrett. \"All this talk about getting Smith out is right. South Africa are essentially a one-man team and he has certainly carried them through this series. Amla is essentially an No8 batting up the order at No3 and after him we are into their tail of Kallis, de Villiers et al who are infamously easy to skittle...\" The West Indies team of the 80s had Greenidge, Haynes, Richardson, Hooper and Logie but the wicket of Viv was still worth two or three psychologically.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 27-1 (Petersen not out 12)</strong> Finn has started really well and has a big shout for LBW against Petersen, crabbing around a nipbacker. It looked high and Andrew Strauss decides not to review. Hawkeye supports Strauss's judgement again. There's a much better shout next ball from a similar but slightly fuller delivery. Kumar Dharmasena thought about it for ages before saying not out \u2013 and England have reviewed it. Here comes the replay ... and it was going over the top. Bah. That's always the danger with a giant like Finn.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 27-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 1)</strong> A fine start from Finn: 2-1-1-0. \"Strauss needs to grow up,\" is the subject of Tim Cadman's email. \"Anyone else think Strauss and England are being hugely over-sensitive about Pietersen and his texts? Sure he said a few bad words about 'Straussy', but is that enough to refuse to pick by far the best batsman in the country? They're not paid to like each other, they're paid to win and they have a much better chance of doing that with Pietersen in the team.\" Nup, because I don't know the full facts. I'm pretty sure it's about a lot more than a couple of text messages though.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 31-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 5)</strong> Anderson switches ends to replace Broad. His second is driven masterfully through the covers for four by Amla. The response is a peach that swings past the edge. This is terrific cricket.</p> <p>\"A slight correction to Brett's description of the comments on the online version Vic Marks's piece in the comic yesterday,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Glancing at those comments reveals a frenzy of the tinfoil hat brigade, seeing in everything a conspiracy on the part of Strauss and Flower to force Pietersen out of the team, the nadir arguably being the claim that someone in the ECB or England hierarchy wanted to make sure that it was Cook rather than Pietersen who beat Gooch's record. A longer look (for it made oddly compelling reading) revealed that regularly someone would come in and express a relatively considered view that expressed some criticism of Pietersen, often also of other parties, only to be set upon by the horde of conspiracy theorists, and then leave the discussion. Meanwhile, the nutjobs would congratulate themselves on the fact that everyone was in agreement, and that they'd reached the definitive conclusion. It's a good job this sort of behaviour is confined to the comments threads on blogs, and that human beings don't ever act like that in other walks of life.\" With the obvious exception of the bits where people say how great I am, comment sections on the internet have largely been a disaster.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 39-1 (Petersen 20, Amla 5)</strong> Petersen gets consecutive boundaries off Finn, flicking full-length deliveries from backward square leg and midwicket. </p> <p>\"It's nice to read a journalist admitting that we don't know know all the facts behind the KP stuff to form an opinion one way or the other,\" says Richard Gardham. \"However, we do know that an England captain (Stuart Broad) was following a Twitter account of one of his friends (which he joined some 90 minutes after it was started) that mocked in a quite personal way one of his team-mates. If England are going to be consistent over this 'dressing room harmony' line that we keep hearing, quite how has Stuart Broad got off scot free on that one by simply issuing a 'not me guv' statement? This tone of this message has nothing to do with the fact that my wife fancies Stuart Broad more than she fancies me, by the way.\"</p> <p>What would Fred Trueman make of all this? One thing about that parody account is that apparently KP retweeted some of the stuff as well. I don't know: are we really saying a player should be punished for having a joke at the expense one of his team-mates? You could argue it was spiteful (again, we don't know the facts so I wouldn't say that), but even then, this is a sport dressing room, not a shelter home for delicate souls. Whatever happened to Gary Cooper? The whole thing is a horrid mess.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 43-1 (Petersen 20, Amla 9)</strong> That's another lovely cover drive from Amla, skimmed for four when Anderson overpitches a fraction. Anderson gets his length just right two balls later and again goes past the outside edge. England could easily have had three wickets this morning.</p> <p>Here's Gary Naylor. Honk with him now. \"Yes KP this and yes KP that, but don't England need to keep bowling jaffas? Especially against batsmen who are particularly susceptible, having grown up in an Orange Free State.\" Honk!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 44-1 (Petersen 21, Amla 9)</strong> \"Okay, so we don't know all the facts re: KPGate, and we're never really likely too \u2013 which is okay, we can and will all make our own judgements,\" says David Horn. \"But I think that there is one thing we can all agree on here: Piers Morgan is a twonk. True, such a statement could stand on it's own any time before or after KPGate, but in these uncertain times it's handy to hold on to any absolute truths.\" He didn't write twonk, obviously. 'Ne'er-do-well' was the word he used I think.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 49-1 (Petersen 22, Amla 13)</strong> Anderson is too straight to Amla, and you know what that means: death by whirring wrists, with the ball pinged deliciously through square leg for four. Shaun Pollock reckons England are straining a touch too much for a wicket, with the result that we've had five boundaries in as many overs.</p> <p>\"Come on Rob,\" says Ryan Dunne, \"internet comments sections aren't that bad! Before they were invented, what would gentlemen who enjoy spending all day discussing supposed plot holes in Batman movies have done to fill the time? Talk to girls?!\" I'm going out on a limb here, but you've watched a lot of Seinfeld, haven't you?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 49-2 (Petersen c Prior b Finn 22)</strong> England get rid of Petersen. Honk. That joke doesn't really work does it, what with his name being spelt differently and all. Anyway, Alviro gloved a short one from Finn down the leg side, with Matt Prior taking a good diving catch. It looked routine, except replays suggested Petersen's hand might have been off the bat when he gloved it, just like Michael Kasprowicz at Edgbaston in 2005.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-3 (Amla b Finn 13)</strong> What a jaffa from Steven Finn! He has cleaned Amla up with a stunning delivery. It came back off the seam down the slope, roared through the gate and into the top of off stump. What a beauty or, as Bill Lawry would say, <em>BAAAAAAAHD 'IM</em>! Finn has two wickets in four balls and England have something in their nostrils.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 50-3 (Kallis 1, de Villiers 0)</strong> I suspect Petersen's hand was off the bat when he was dismissed, although it was desperately close. He stopped on his way off having seen the replay, although by then it was too late to review. I don't think the decision would have been overturned anyway as it was really tight.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 52-3 (Kallis 3, de Villiers 0)</strong> A few umbrellas are going up, which is more than a little frustrating because England are one wicket away from a very happy place. </p> <p>\"As the kind of England fan who roars with uncontained glee at every opposition wicket (including Smith's just now) and stays up listening to TMS on headphones all through the night when we are playing a dead rubber in New Zealand, it saddens me to find that I actually hope England are just pipped in this match with Jonny Bairstow making a golden pair,\" says David Sherwin. \"Like KP, I grew up in SA and when I started playing village cricket in England was astonished at the 'let's all just get along, including with the charming oppo' attitude. In time, I came to accept that maybe this had a place in the village leagues but cannot comprehend how this attitude appears to have inveigled itself into the England establishment. The job, surely, is to win at all costs, even if you are hating every last moment of it due to the company you are forced to keep. One of my colleagues is an horrendously unpleasant Scot, but by God is he good at his job so I admire rather castigate him; time for England to do the same re KP.\"</p> <p>The key distinction that has been made in the last few days is that you don't have to like your team-mates, but you do have to trust them. Whether that's what England feel, I don't know. What I would say is that there will always ve a line which, once crossed, means two people (or ten people and one person) cannot play together, so in that sense I don't see how anybody can criticise the England selectors. You might criticise them for their judgement of where that line is \u2013 except we can't do that because we don't know all the facts.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 54-4 (Kallis c Prior b Finn 3)</strong> Well well. England are risking their last review. Did Kallis glove Finn down the leg side? This is close. I think he'll get away with it. He appears to glove it, but his hand was almost certainly off the bat when he did so. The third umpire Rod Tucker is having a long look but he surely can't give this out. <strong>He's given him out</strong>! What the hell has happened there? South Africa have the face on. \"That is a poor decision,\" thunders Mikey Holding on Sky. The only thing I can think is that Rod Tucker thought it hit the left glove, which was on the bat handle, rather than the right. It didn't, and Kallis has every right to be royally radged off. <em>On</em> the plus side, England have taken four wickets before lunch. I told you they should have won the toss and batted.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 58-4 (de Villiers 1, Rudolph 5)</strong> That looks an appalling decision. If the on-field decision had been 'out' I'd still have reversed it, but to reverse a 'not-out' decision beggars belief. Some would say it's delayed payback for the Daryl Harper/Graeme Smith business in the fourth Test of 2009-10 I suppose, but it does look a stinker. It hit the glove \u2013 Hotspot now confirms that \u2013 but the glove was definitely off the bat handle when it did so. Snickometer confirms that was the case. There's a very small chance that both gloves were touching, with the left hand touching the bat as the ball hit the right hand. Would that count as a chain, like in, er, Shooting Fish, and thus be out? I'm not sure it would, and even so there's only a small chance that the gloves were touching. Kallis will feel like he's been strangled <em>and</em> sawn off.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 59-4 (de Villiers 1, Rudolph 5)</strong> Broad swings a full-length delivery onto the pads of Rudolph, bringing another big LBW shout. It was swinging down leg. Simon Taufel knew it. Andrew Strauss knew it. Stuart Broad probably didn't. A maiden. \"Saffers, meet Karma; Karma, meet Saffers,\" says Daniel Harris. \"This is what you get...\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 63-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 5)</strong> Ah, well. Nasser Hussain tells us that the gloves do count as a chain, so you <em>can</em> be given out that away. However, it seems the gloves almost certainly weren't touching. Either Rod Tucker is a genius from the future, who sees things we can't see, or he's had a shocker.</p> <p>\"Speaking of Kasprowicz in 2005, can you imagine the situation if reviews had been in place then,\" says Jamie Jermain. \"Australia would have reviewed the decision on the off chance he didn't glove it, the third umpire would have picked up that his hand was off the bat and Australia would have clipped the winning runs to mid wicket. Cue no wild celebrations, no Freddie and Lee and a horrible anti-climax.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 65-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 7)</strong> The final ball of the session is a snorter from Stuart Broad that swings through Rudolph's gate and bounces just over the stumps. The rain is getting heavier as the players wander off. What a morning it's been for England. Andrew Strauss said it wasn't a bad toss to lose, and Steven Finn backed him up with three wickets in seven balls on his home ground. The third was a gift \u2013 Jacques Kallis was never out \u2013 but England won't have too much sympathy. They are in a fantastic position and, better still, everyone is talking about events on the field.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>1.07pm</strong> It's pouring down.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>1.08pm</strong> \"Rob,\" says Oliver Smiddy. \"You said: 'Are we really saying a player should be punished for having a joke at the expense one of his team-mates?' Isn't that exactly what the ECB have done with KP? Wasn't he having a joke at the expense of a team-mate with his friends? And more to the point, doing so entirely privately, whereas Broad and co were doing so IN PUBLIC. I don't mind the ECB asking for an apology etc but there needs to be consistency.\"</p> <p>Surely it's impossible to have a notion of consistency when there are degrees of abuse/humour/banter/whatever. I thought KP was supposed to have used a derogatory word. More to the point, this is about a lot more than those text messages. England clearly decided that enough was enough ahead of such an important Test match. Without knowing all the facts, I don't see how we can criticise them for that.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>1.26pm</strong> \"And with that Rod Tucker 'dismissal' this Test has become a sham,\" says Luke Smith. \"Kallis is our '50/3 in a stitch and need a gutsy 100' go to man. At 50/3 with him in, we were always still in with a fight. Now? Well, if we make 200 I'll be surprised. Disgusting umpiring that will undoubtedly affect the match and series. Also defending it as karma is probably the sorest excuse yet. Graeme Smith's 'dismissal' at Headingley wasn't enough was it?\"</p> <p>It was a shocker, and can't be defended, but I'm not sure it makes the Test a sham or will overshadow the result if England do win. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/15/graeme-smith-sabc-third-umpire\">Remember this</a>?

I think Vic Marks' piece went in a similar direction, which is perhaps why it became a haven for the people who think KP has been getting the rough end of all this. My question to you though is, do you think the press coverage has been fair? An awful lot of those comments were criticising the cricket media for uncritically towing the ECB line, and often not asking sufficiently searching questions. I tend to agree with this point of view, and I wonder if more people would be perched atop your fence were they reading more balanced reporting...\"</p> <p>Hmm, I think the reporting has been excellent. The proper journalists know the background to the story, and a lot more about what has happened over the past week, even if they can't necessarily publish all of that, so their judgement comes from a position of greater authority than ours. Except that ne'er-do-well Booth, obviously, who is no better than Stanford.</p> <p>Anyway, shall we call it a draw and ban KP talk for the rest of the day? Let's do that. It's getting a bit boring, and more to the point it's overshadowing what is shaping up to be a wonderful Test match.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 65-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 7)</strong> The justified fuss over Kallis's dismissal has diverted attention from the fact that England are in a sensational position, only two wickets away from a longish tail. Steven Finn starts after lunch and beats AB de Villiers second ball with a very full delivery that zips past the edge. I think de Villiers lost sight of it, and if it had been straight he'd have been in big trouble. He's really struggling and loses sight of a short ball later in the over that hits the face of a horizontal bat and lands safely on the off side. That could have gone anywhere. They don't like it up 'em!</p> <p>\"It's all a bit quiet at Lord's isn't it? I'd forgotten sport could be like this. don't we need a blast of muse to get the juices flowing? Boom! Boom!

At the moment Broad is almost filler while we wait for another Finn over. </p> <p>\"I'm pleased that South Africa are in this situation,\" says Mark Hughes. \"They would certainly make a worthy No1, but the accolade demands that they should demonstrate steel and determination when under pressure. The three-match series threatened to let them leave these shores without ever having been under the cosh. Let's see what they're made of.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 71-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 9)</strong> The sun has gone back in at Lord's, although the chaps on Sky reckon the forecast is decent. Finn has Rudolph on strike when he would probably prefer another crack at de Villiers. A single off the fifth ball allows him a solitary delivery at de Villiers: shortish, wide and slapped crisply to the cover boundary.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 72-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 10)</strong> Rudolph can't decide what to do with a short ball from Broad, eventually wearing it on the arm. That prompts England to bring in Taylor at short leg. I'd be tempted to get Swann on ahead of schedule against Rudolph, who was dismissed twice in three balls by Him at Headingley.</p> <p>\"This morning, I caught a little of England's match in the Under-19s World Cup,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Ben Duckett looked a lot like Eoin Morgan at the crease with invention to spare and an eye like a dead fish. Nepal's fielding was excellent, but some naive bowling left their batsmen with an er... mountain to climb and England ran out easy winners. Quarter-Final on Sunday vs The Saffers \u2013 should be fun!\" It'll be lovely to see the future England Test players on both sides.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 79-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 13)</strong> Finn swings one down the leg side for four byes before Rudolph welts him through the covers for three.

Alice Cooper at the cricket! That's magnificent. \"He looks a bit lived-in...\" says Bumble on Sky. He must be one of the more unlikely figures to appear at a Test match. Who would be top of the list? <a href=\"http://www.espn.co.uk/onthisday/sport/story/358.html\">Eisenhower would be up there</a>.</p> <p>\"'Two wickets away from a longish tail'?\" sniffs SB Tang. \"I dunno about that one \u2014 you might be tempting fate! Philander's got two first-class tons and a first-class batting average of 24.87. And Steyn, with his solid technique and temperament, can be a real Gillespie-like, crease-occupying pest down the order.\" Hence longish rather than long. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63844.html\">This is a long tail</a>. I wouldn't underestimate either of them, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/content/story/384431.html\">and we all remember Steyn's 76</a>, but I still think Philander is a Test No9 and Steyn a Test No10.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 87-4 (de Villiers 17, Rudolph 13)</strong> A glorious shot from de Villiers, who times a half-volley from Finn through midwicket for four. Two balls later he flaps a short ball through square leg for another boundary. I don't think he saw that properly either. Thanks, incidentally, for all the emails explaining what 'doos' (box) actually means. I've amended the earlier reference.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 87-4 (de Villiers 17, Rudolph 13)</strong> This is a good move, with Graeme Swann replacing Stuart Broad. He's armed with a haircut, a history of getting wickets in his first over and the knowledge that Rudolph fell twice in three balls to off spin at Headingley. He survives the a full over here, if not entirely comfortably. A maiden.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 97-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 13)</strong> A low full toss from Finn is eased through the covers for four more by de Villiers. That's the seventh boundary he has conceded today and the third in five balls. Make that four in nine balls, a whirling pull round the corner off a very poor delivery. It's been a mixed bag from Finn (12-2-48-3) and it's probably Jimmytime at that end.</p> <p>\"Most unlikely figure to appear at a Test?\" says Ben Powell. \"KP! Honk!\" I'm going to allow it.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 99-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 15)</strong> Swann loves having a tentative left-hander to work with, and he is mixing up his pace and flight. Rudolph works a couple to leg and defends the rest.</p> <p>\"For fans of the old glam rocker, I've just heard that Alice Cooper is going to be on TMS at tea,\" says Clare Davies. \"I always thought golf was his thing, but obviously cricket ranks too.\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 99-4 (De Villiers not out 27)</strong> De Villiers survives a huge shout from LBW by Anderson and England again decide to review the decision. This is extremely close. Did he get outside the line? That's the only thing that can save him I reckon. There's a mark on Hotspot but I suspect that's bat on pad. He played defensively down the wrong line at a good delivery that ducked back in. They are still looking at Hotspot over a possible inside edge, but I'd wager all my nostril hair on that being bat on pad rather than ball. This is even before we see whether it was hitting the stumps. It's all irrelevant because de Villiers has survived. The ball was hitting the stumps but the point of impact was 'umpire's call' and Rod Tucker, controversially, presses the correct button. That was ridiculously close. Approximately 49 per cent of the ball hit the pad in line with the stumps and 51 per cent outside the line. So the on-field decision stands \u2013 as it would have done had Kumar Dharmasena given it out \u2013 and England are out of reviews.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 99-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 15)</strong> <br>\"I was fairly surprised,\" begins Paul Stephens, \"to see Billy Corgan at a Test match in Wellington, New Zealand.\" You've been eating some very special cheese. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHtq7rP4se0\">Hang on, it really, really, really did happen</a>.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> Excellent stuff from Rudolph, who chips Swann confidently over midwicket for four.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> A maiden from Anderson to de Villiers. South Africa could have sulked after that Kallis decision and given this away \u2013 and a few good South African teams of the past 20 years might have done so \u2013&#xa0;but these two have played with impressive calmness and determination since lunch. The conclusion you would draw from this series is that nothing comes easily against this lot, which makes some of their collapses in the past year or two particularly hard to fathom.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> Rudolph has faced every delivery from Swann so far and defends another maiden.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 105-5 (de Villiers c Cook b Anderson 27)</strong> Gone! De Villiers, having survived that Spandex-tight review on 27, falls without adding to his score. That's a huge breakthrough for England. Anderson lured him into an expansive drive with a very full delivery that nipped away just enough to take the edge, and Cook at third slip moved smartly to his left to take a sharp two-handed catch.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 105-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 0)</strong> Crikey, what a position are England are in now. Duminy survives a biggish LBW shout third ball. There have no reviews left but it was going over anyway. Anderson, the pick of the attack by a distance, has figures of 12-4-24-2.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 105-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 0)</strong> Now Swann has two left-handers to work with, and from memory he has given Duminy problems in the past. For now it's Rudolph, and it's another maiden, the fourth in a row.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 107-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 2)</strong> There's a bit of excitement when Duminy appears to inside edge Anderson onto the pad and just short of gully, but in fact the ball hit both pads. \"Alice Cooper's management got in touch and asked if we wanted to do anything with him,\" writes Paul King of Sky. \"But they admitted he didn't know much about cricket so I declined. Baseball and golf are his thing I gather, but he likes sport generally.\" Insert your own 'you need a knowledge of cricket to appear?' joke here.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 113-5 (Rudolph 27, Duminy 2)</strong> From here, England will hope to dismiss South Africa for under 200. South Africa? They will try to sneak up to around 300 and then tell Dale Steyn that the entire England team called him a doos. This partnership is vital. Obviously. Rudolph cuts Swann confidently for four. He has faced every one of Swann's 36 deliveries today, and he's played him almost as well as Livia Soprano played Uncle June at the end of season one.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 118-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 3)</strong> Duminy drives Anderson wide of mid off, where Broad saves three runs with an excellent diving stop. England have been sharp in the field. It's almost as if they want to make a point. No fielder can do anything later in the over when Rudolph clouts a very wide, very full delivery over cover for four. The next ball swings past Rudolph's loose drive. \"That's rubbish from the batsman,\" says David Gower on Sky.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 119-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 4)</strong> Swann gets his first bowl at Duminy, who comes down the track to drive the fourth ball pleasantly for a single. \"What's a good score on this wicket?\" says Jonathan Sexton. \"I'm always a bit reluctant to get too giddy before both sides have had a bat.\" No idea. Around 350-400 maybe, although as always a lot depends on the overhead conditions. It could easily turn into a 230 plays 260 dogfight.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 123-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 8)</strong> Duminy pushes Anderson classily down the ground for four. Although he is yet to fulfil <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/44932.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">his early promise in Tests</a>, he is a helluva talent to have coming in at No7. And Graham Onions is a helluva talent to have on the bench. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542534.html\">Look what he's up to today</a>.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 123-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 8)</strong> The first jaffa of Swann's spell spits sharply past Rudolph's defensive push. Another maiden. This is such a crucial little spell before tea. If England get one more that ice-cool Gatorade will taste real good.</p> <p>\"Am I the only one who feels like this series is just starting to warm up?\" says Mike Jakeman. \"Ignoring the growing tedium around KP, England seem to be at the races for the first time this summer. The next two matches are going to be huge. There's nothing like the slowly unfolding narrative of a five-Test icon series. I can't wait.\" Yep. We've said it before, but whoever did this should be mirror-averse for a long time.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 127-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 12)</strong> Duminy again drives Anderson through mid off for four. \"Re: the 45th over,\" says Ian Stubbins. \"C Mustard B Onions. Is there any more delicious way to lose your wicket?\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 131-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 12)</strong> <br>Rudolph continues to take Swann. It might be coincidence or he might be protecting Duminy. Either way, he blazes an emphatic drive over mid off for four. Fetch that! Rudolph has face 43 of Swann's 48 deliveries thus far.</p> <p>\"Makes me chuckle to think of each English cricket fan turning to their Saffer friend to call him a 'doos',\" says Richard Spry, \"when the correct pronunciation is, of course, 'doos' ...\" No wonder Graeme Swann isn't developing a doosra. In this age of faux outrage he'd probably be hounded out of the team.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 136-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 17)</strong> Broad comes on for Anderson (16-4-39-2). His third ball is a miserable piece of filth \u2013 short, wide, 80mph and belaboured through the off side for four by Duminy. His pace is a long way down today, in the low 80s. Either that or the speedgun is knacked. An early speedgun, for the 1996 Lord's Test, reckoned Mark Ealham was faster than Wasim Akram. And a bloody good speedgun it was.</p> <p>\"Cook c Mustard b Onions,\" says Alex Marsh. \"Nothing particularly witty, I'm a lazy man. Just some more cricketing combos that <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/577060.html\">Cricinfo came up with but three days ago</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>50th over: South Africa 141-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 22)</strong> These two are almost in block/thwack mode against Swann, and Duminy pumps him down the ground for four more during an otherwise quiet over. This is turning into a useful partnership. \"Looking at that link you posted of the scorecard where Graham Onions is running rampant, it looks like Durham are playing with 12 men?!\" says Kat Rowles. \"They are all out, but with Onions down as 'did not bat'. How does that work then...? Or am I having a blonde afternoon and have missing something \u2013 entirely possible, I'm running on only one coffee today...\" Yeah tey changed the rules a few years ago so that a 12th man from a Test could replace a player during a county match. I think James Kirtley was the first, but I can't find the relevant link. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/131515.html\">Ah, here we go</a>.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>51st over: South Africa 141-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 22)</strong> Broad bowls a maiden to Duminy. Is that tea? Apparently not; presumably they've put it back to 3.55pm or 4.10pm.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>52nd over: South Africa 148-5 (Rudolph 40, Duminy 24)</strong> Trott replaces Swann, a pretty surprising move but one that almost produces a wicket. Rudolph and Duminy got in a mix up over a possible leg bye, and Rudolph was three-fifths of the way down the track by the time he was sent back. The throw to the bowler's end was poor, however, and Rudolph was able to get back.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>53rd over: South Africa 150-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 25)</strong> Duminy takes his eye off a short ball from Broad that hits him on the back of the arm. Given his perceived weakness against the short ball it's slightly surprising that Finn hasn't had a spell at him, although I'm sure he will after tea.</p> <p>\"I think that Ian Austin was the first player to be substituted during a county match in 1998,\" says Graeme Thorn. \"<a href=\" http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/66/66337.html\">The scorecard here</a> says that RJ Green substituted for Austin when he was called up to play in the ODIs.\"</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>54th over: South Africa 151-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 26)</strong> Trott. Duminy. One run.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>55th over: South Africa 151-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 26)</strong> Swann switches ends to bowl the last over before tea. Nothing happens. It's been South Africa's session, with 86 runs scored for the loss of AB de Villiers, although England are still in an excellent position. James Riach has just been presented with a keyboard by Lawrence Booth and will make his OBO debut after tea. You can email him at <a href=\"mailto:james.riach.casual@theguardian.com\">james.riach.casual@theguardian.com</a>. See you tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p>4.06pm: Afternoon folks. Been a good day for England so far, although Duminy and Rudolph were beginning to look pretty settled out there before tea. Let's see how the evening unfolds...</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p>4.11pm: Yohan Blake has been chewing the fat with Michael Holding and Ian Ward. \"I'm a better cricketer than a runner,\" he claims. Don't know about that, but I certainly wouldn't want to be at the other end with the Beast steaming in, that's for sure.</p> <p>He also thinks Twenty20 cricket should be part of the Olympics. Thoughts everyone?</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p>4.15pm: Players are out for the evening session...</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>56th over: South Africa 153-5 (Rudolph 42, Duminy 27)</strong> Trott continues after tea, don't know if he'll stick there or England want to swap Finn to the Nursery End. Either way it's a pretty tight over from him, just the two off it. Blake in the Sky commentary box, says he can bowl around 89-90mph. I reckon this young maverick is pulling our leg a wee bit.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>57th over: South Africa 163-5 (Rudolph 42, Duminy 33)</strong> It is Finn who takes the reins now and he beats Duminy's outside edge with a beaut. Next delivery is too full though and is driven through the covers for four. Lovely shot from Duminy, who picks up another couple on the off side. Four leg byes from the last ball, an expensive over.</p> <p>Guy Hornsby says: \"Listening to Alice Cooper on TMS is wonderfully surreal. I could listen to him chat all day, he's such a softly-spoken gent for his stage reputation. And having him at Lord's, chatting to Aggers about snakes, having brought a cake in to TMS, I never thought I'd see the day. I can imagine some of the MCC chaps choking into their pink gins. Sir Geoffrey made himself scarce, possibly so someone couldn't take a photo and tweet it. I'd have paid good money to see that. \"</p> <p>Think Geoffrey was probably perturbed by the whole thing.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>WICKET! (Rudolph, b Swann 42)</strong></p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p>Rudolph won't be happy with that, straight through the gate from Swann, who replaces Trott and has an immediate impact. Bit of a half-tracker that came off the inside edge, onto the pad before clattering the stumps. Vernon Philander next up...</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>58th over: South Africa 164-6 (Duminy 33, Philander 1)</strong> Great over from Swann, England nearing the tail now.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>59th over: South Africa 172-6 (Duminy 33, Philander 9)</strong> Finn with a bit of late movement and catches Philander's outside edge, but that runs for four with no third man. Dead ball next up as Finn accidentally knocks off the bails with his leg when releasing. Lovely cover drive from Philander takes him quickly to nine, again Finn going too long. To compensate he bangs in a short one.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>60th over: South Africa 177-6 (Duminy 34, Philander 13)</strong></p> <p>Swann gets punished with the last ball of the over as Philander smashes one to the leg-side boundary. Something for the South Africans to cheer about. </p> <p>On the Olympics debate...</p> <p>Alex Walker: \"There's enough micky mouse sports already there and it wouldn't be the pinnacle of the game. Football, tennis and golf in Brazil, should all be taken out. The Olympics is for sports that don't have a bigger stage. There's a reason Murray won the semis and final in straight sets.\"</p> <p>John Starbuck: \"They began talking about T20 as an Olympic sport a couple of years ago, when it became clear it really worked as a short-form competition, but it will have to wait awhile as all the new sports are already sorted for Rio and anyway you have to replace another sport, like kitesurfing for windsurfing. Mind you, one of the new ones is golf, so obviously the bar is set pretty low.\"</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>61st over: South Africa 178-6 (Duminy 34, Philander 13)</strong></p> <p>Finn with a better over, just the one off it as Duminy pats a short one down on the leg side.</p> <p>Phil Sawyer says: \"Afternoon James, welcome to the seat of power. Use it, don't abuse it. Mind you, the last time someone said that to Smyth \u2026, well, questions were asked in Parliament and Gary Naylor was left with a permanent twitch. Anyway, I digress. What time can today's play go on until, bearing in mind the short rain delay? Just trying to work out whether it's worth legging it home from work to catch an hour or so's play.\"</p> <p>Think close will be between 6.30pm and 7pm tonight. I do feel incredibly powerful right now, it has to be said. This is the pinnacle.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>62nd over: South Africa 180-6 (Duminy 37, Philander 13)</strong> A couple off the over from Swann. Far more interesting, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cricketanalyst/status/236123567639633920/photo/1\">this picture on Twitter courtesy of Simon Hughes</a>.</p> <p>I challenge you not to laugh at that. <strong>Caption competition... what is Geoffrey thinking?<br></strong></p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>63rd over: South Africa 183-6 (Duminy 38, Philander 15)</strong> Chance for a catch at deep square leg as Philander doesn't catch his pull quite right...but it falls short of Bell. Finn looks on with disappointment, but there was no way that was ever going to reach. He's getting some really fierce bounce out there and it's causing problems. Wonder if Bairstow is looking on with concern.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>64th over: South Africa 188-6 (Duminy 39, Philander 18)</strong> Change of bowling and it's Anderson who takes over from Swann, a good move in my opinion. A few loose ones to begin with that are dispatched for singles, but there's still plenty of swing for Jimmy to play with, moving it away well from the right-hander Philander. That rolled off the tongue very nicely. Ooh. Hard hands from Philander and he edges one to second slip...but it falls short of Swann.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>65th over: South Africa 191-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 21)</strong> Tight over from Swann but England will be keen to not let these two settle down...</p> <p>Tom Bonsel says: \"James, see if you can't use your new found power to depose the Rob Smyth. Perhaps send a few scurrilous rumours bouncing round the press-box that Rob has been sending derogatory text messages to other Gruanaid staffers......\"</p> <p>I know for a fact that he called John Ashdown a box behind his back this morning.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>66th over: South Africa 192-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 22)</strong> That's an absolute jaffa from Anderson to Philander, cutting away off the seam and beating the bat by a country mile. Although he's walking a bit gingerly at the moment, stretching and rolling his ankle. Looks like he'll be OK to soldier on and his next delivery shows no signs that he is suffering from too much pain.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>67th over: South Africa 193-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 23)</strong> Great fielding at mid-wicket from the captain, diving to his left well. A single next up from Philander though who pads one past Ian Bell at short leg. Oh that's a snorter from Swann! He drifts one in to Duminy but it turns viciously off the pitch, beating the bat and finding Prior's gloves. Duminy tries to then cut one away but doesn't get it off the middle.</p> <p>Caption competition, for this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cricketanalyst/status/236123567639633920/photo/1\">wonderful photo</a>.</p> <p>Gary Naylor: \"Bah gum!

Alice? Who the f* is Alice?\"</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>68th over: South Africa 195-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 24)</strong> Half a chance of a run-out as Philander tickles one to mid-wicket, but it's Trott in position who isn't the quickest in the field. \"He won't be challenging the Jamaican sprint team,\" opines Beefy.</p> <p>A shout for lbw next against Duminy but that pitched just outside the line and was rising over the stumps. Not a serious appeal.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>69th over: South Africa 198-6 (Duminy 42, Philander 25)</strong> Three from the over, with Swann keeping it relatively tight. 11 overs until the new ball so Anderson is going to have a little rest and Broad will be up next.</p> <p>\"Eeeee, there's nowt s' queer as folk\" is Jonathan Sexton's caption attempt...</p> <p>\"Sir Geoffrey's cheeky grin is leading me to try and think up some kind of pun involving \"corridor of uncertainty\" but at present I'm drawing a blank.\"</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>70th over: South Africa 201-6 (Duminy 44, Philander 26)</strong> Broad charges in and his first ball is slightly over-pitched, Duminy drives and thinks he's beaten Trott in the field, a mistake, and he has to quicken his running to make ground, making it relatively comfortably in the end though. Broad then counters with a shorter effort which Philander edges and balloons up in the air, but it falls safe. That was a let off but the 200 comes up for South Africa and there is a ripple of applause around Lord's.</p> <p><strong>DRINKS ARE SERVED</strong></p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>71st over: South Africa 205-6 (Duminy 47, Philander 27)</strong> Nicely played from Duminy off Swann, tickled through the off side for two. This is a good battle between the right-arm spinner and the left-hand batsman, who flicks one off his legs to give Philander the strike. He drops onto the back foot and plays the ball to the covers for a single. Swann ends the over with a full toss but Duminy can't score.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>72nd over: South Africa 217-6 (Duminy 50, Philander 36)</strong> Philander slices one off Broad and that beats the man at point and runs away to the boundary for four. That wasn't textbook by any stretch of the imagination but effective nonetheless. Broad then sends a short one down but Duminy plays it beautifully, guiding it down to third man to bring up his 50 and the 50 partnership. Philander smacks one down the ground to the long-off boundary for four. Oh dear Stuart.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>73rd over: South Africa 218-6 (Duminy 51, Philander 36)</strong> This partnership is beginning to get a bit worrying for England but the new ball is available in seven overs \u2013 that will be the key. One off that over from Swann.</p> <p>James Dale: \"Graham Onions has all 8 Notts wickets up at Trent Bridge and is on for the first 10fer in first class cricket since....?\"</p> <p>Great performance from Onions it has to be said, driving back up to Nottingham this morning after not being selected for this game. <strong>He has in fact taken nine wickets and the other one was a run-out! Staggering!</strong></p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>74th over: South Africa 220-6 (Duminy 53, Philander 36)</strong> Swashbuckling stroke from Duminy through the covers off Broad but there is a man on the rope to stop the four.</p> <p>More captions...</p> <p>David Keech: \"Hey Lad, get thee a haircut before thee talks to me!\"</p> <p>Adam Czarnowski: \"David Lynch finally announces his controversial choice of stars to play Leland Palmer, and his evil alter-ego Bob, in the upcoming 2012 3-D remake of Twin Peaks.\"</p> <p>Phil Sawyer: \"That'll be 100 quid, lad. 200 if you want it signed.\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>75th over: South Africa 223-6 (Duminy 54, Philander 38)</strong> The new ball can't come soon enough for England now. Duminy and Philander are moving their feet well and striding down the pitch to Swann at every opportunity. 60 off 105 balls for these two but here comes Mr Trott for another short burst. He had three overs earlier \u2013 can the part-timer catch South Africa off guard?</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>76th over: South Africa 225-6 (Duminy 54, Philander 38)</strong> Goodness me Trott beats Philander all ends up, but he also beats Prior as well! His first delivery nips back through the gate but England's wicketkeeper completely misses it and that's two byes. That was precisely 1.3cm away from the off stump according to Hawkeye, mightily close. No runs scored by either batsman.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>77th over: South Africa 225-6 (Duminy 54, Philander 38)</strong> It's a first maiden in a while for England, Swann not giving away anything there and Duminy can't score. </p> <p>Alex Wright: \"In response to James Dale, was the last 10fer Otis Gibson, of Durham at the time, against Hampshire a few years back? I recall it because whilst he was ripping through th opposition batting order his sometime former team mates in the West Indies side were toiling badly against a rampant england batting line up.\"</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>78th over: South Africa 227-6 (Duminy 55, Philander 39)</strong> Trott with another over of his dibbler-dobblers that are making the South African's think just a tad. There's certainly a little bit of gentle swing in the middle there and he's keeping a good line to Duminy. More confusion between the wickets between the batsmen, though, and there's a shy at the stumps ... but Philander had comfortably made his ground.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>79th over: South Africa 233-6 (Duminy 60, Philander 40)</strong> Lovely, delicate shot from Duminy that adds four onto his score, tickling Swann down to fine leg with a deft touch. He seems to have won the little tussle that the two were having. Philander, meanwhile, is batting sensibly, picking up ones and twos without doing anything extravagant.</p> <p>Caption from Philip Keegan: \"My mother could bite the head off a chicken with a stick of rhubarb.\"</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>80th over: South Africa 235-6 (Duminy 61, Philander 41)</strong> Trott beats Philander's outside edge with a corker. Still England can't break this partnership, though. Jimmy Anderson is warming up and set to start a new spell.</p> <p><strong>THE NEW BALL IS TAKEN</strong></p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>WICKET! (Duminy, b Anderson c Prior, 61)</strong></p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>81st over: South Africa 235-7 (Philander 41, Steyn 0)</strong> Duminy will be furious with himself for that. Anderson strikes from the Pavilion End and the new ball does its job. A really poor shot which he top edges to Prior, and to be honest, it wasn't a great delivery - indeed, it was the widest Anderson has balled to Duminy all innings. Who cares about line and length ey? </p> <p>Dale Steyn next up for South Africa, and England have been given a lift with that. I don't think many people expected Philander to stick around for so long when he walked to the crease, but fair play to the lad, he's looked composed and accomplished throughout his innings. Broad has the next over...</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>82nd over: South Africa 236-7 (Philander 42, Steyn 0)</strong> Broad with a vicious away swinger to Philander that is met with an air shot and gasps from the Lord's cognoscenti. The next ball is clipped away for a single so Steyn has the honour of facing with one remaining from the over. Here comes Broad... but Steyn just blocks away.</p> <p>John Tumbridge on Twenty20 in the Olympics: \"I would be worried about some of the more insignificant islands; Australia for example, being able to find a decent team of eleven.\"</p> <p>Meow John</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>83rd over: South Africa 243-7 (Philander 43, Steyn 6)</strong> Fine bowling from Anderson and he beat's Philander's outside edge with a darting away swinger. Next up is a single but Philander's right boot comes off as he sets off! Don't think I have ever seen that before.</p> <p>Steyn now facing and he gets a leading edge...which runs down to third man for four, but he had no idea about it. Anderson looking frustrated and his next delivery is shorter, chipped into the air ... but safe. Seven from the over but not what it deserved.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>84th over: South Africa 250-7 (Philander 44, Steyn 12)</strong> Broad clatters Steyn on the pad but he had planted his front foot forward and that looked like it was high, no real appeal from England. Steyn gets a thick edge through the off side for a couple, but is completely bamboozled immediately afterwards, driving and missing. Broad then changes the line but in attempt to go right at the stumps he pushes it just outside leg and Steyn runs it down to fine leg for four. Oh blow.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>85th over: South Africa 251-7 (Philander 45, Steyn 12)</strong> Short one from Anderson that climbs up on Steyn, but he defends it well on his toes. It is surely only a matter of time before he nicks one behind at this rate, though Anderson is persisting with pitching it short. \"Ragged,\" according to Michael Holding. To be fair to Anderson, this is his 22nd over over the day. Last ball now and Steyn gets a thick edge, but it bounces well short of gully.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>86th over: South Africa 255-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 15)</strong> Average speed from Broad today has been 80.3mph, a bit slower than earlier in the summer. \"Certainly not as quick as Yohan Blake,\" jokes Atherton. HA HA HA.</p> <p>Steyn clips him off his legs with consummate ease but only single as there is a man out in the deep. The sting seems to have gone out of England's attack despite that wicket not long ago.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>87th over: South Africa 259-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 19)</strong> It's looking a bit overcast and dark at Lord's and one of the floodlights has decided to pack up, hopefully that can be fixed sharpish and we'll get some prolonged play this evening. Twice in two overs Steyn sticks his arm up as some plonker in the members area gets up to put his jacket on just as Anderson reaches the crease. He's sent back and starts his run-up once again but Steyn knocks a four through the leg side. That will have infuriated Anderson and, sure enough, next up is a beauty that beats the bat. Another jaffa follows and that's too good for Steyn \u2013 so much so that he's nowhere near the ball. Last of the over and it's edged ... but short of Cook at third slip.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>88th over: South Africa 262-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 21)</strong> Finn is back in the saddle and steaming in with renewed vigour. Steyn is struggling to see out there and he gets one in the ribs, this could be the end of action for the day as he is having a conflab with the umpires. He doesn't look happy with the light ... and sure enough the umpires lead the players off for stumps with 87.4 overs having been bowled.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p>6.29pm: So that's close of play at Lord's after a first day that England will certainly be happy with. They haven't bowled brilliantly but Anderson was the pick of the bunch, he ends with figures of 3-58 off 23.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p>6.33pm: Phil Sawyer says: \"Apparently there's been a massive power cut. TMS are now doing an emergency broadcast from what sounds like an engineering cupboard, without any access to a scoreboard to tell them what's going on. It's strangely compelling.\"</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p>6.35pm: Credit to Duminy for a well-played 61 and somehow Dale Steyn managed a quick 21 off 32 balls as the light faded. Vernon Philander is still there on 46 \u2013 he's the man England will target early tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p>6.39pm: That's it from me then folks, messrs Smyth and Bagchi will cast their expert eyes over proceedings tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Unilever has ended its sponsorship of Tate Modern's Turbine Hall annual commission that has produced some of the London gallery's most memorable exhibitions.</p> <p>Tino Sehgal's These Associations, the first live performance piece in the former Bankside power station, will be the final work in the Unilever-sponsored series, which has attracted almost 30 million visitors over the past dozen years.</p> <p>The \u00a34.4m sponsorship deal with Unilever, has led to 13 commissions, including Bruce Nauman's soundscapes, Olafur Eliasson's huge, yellow, artificial indoor sun The Weather Project in 2003-04, which saw visitors stretch out on the floor of the vast space to bask in its glow, and Doris Salcedo's Shibboleth in 2007, which featured a crack running the length of the hall. Some commissions have been acquired for the gallery's permanent collection, including the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds, although it bought only a tenth of the 100m porcelain seeds, all individually sculpted and painted by Chinese craft workers, shown in the 2010 exhibition.</p> <p>The current show, in which participants stop and engage visitors with intimate, personal stories, closes on 28 October.</p> <p>The Turbine Hall is due to temporarily close next year to enable construction of the gallery's Herzog &amp; de Meuron-designed extension. The project, which is planned to cost \u00a3215m in total, is due for completion by 2016 \u2013 delayed from its previously projected opening of this year.</p> <p>The first phase of the extension, the \u00a390m performance art and video installation space called the Tanks, opened in July.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Tate said: \"Due to the building works at Tate Modern, there will not be a Turbine Hall commission in 2013. We will start discussions with other companies about the sponsorship of the Turbine Hall commission from 2014 onwards.\"</p> <p>Unilever, whose brands include Pot Noodle and PG Tips, will continue as a corporate member of Tate. But the company said it is planning a change of direction in its sponsorship programme, which is more focused on sustainability and the environment.</p> <p>\"While we will continue our relationship with Tate as a corporate member, we are now planning a change of direction which will fit closely with our company's mission to double the size of our business while reducing our environmental impact and increasing our positive social impact.</p> <p>Other prominent Tate sponsors include Bloomberg, the business and financial news organisation, and, more controversially, the oil company BP. The Tate received \u00a345.1m in public funding last year, and raised an additional \u00a367.9m. Its 100,000 members contribute about \u00a33m per year.</p>",
  "<h2>Stephen Godfroy, co-owner, <a href=\"http://www.roughtrade.com/\" title=\"\">Rough Trade</a></h2> <p><strong>Investing in youth, emotionally and physically:</strong> The dominating characteristic of our most successful young athletes is their fearlessness, harnessing a level of confidence that only comes from selfless older generations putting faith in them \u2013 it's also the coaches who apply the latest techniques and technological insights to better the prospects of young talent.</p> <p>The creative industries are sadly overpopulated by older generations who fear younger generations \u2013 who will only adopt the latest 'techniques and technological insights' if it directly benefits them and ideally only them. As a result, our creative industries are in danger of falling asleep at the wheel.</p> <p><strong>Celebrating independents:</strong> Despite all the corporate sponsorship, I would argue the Games celebrates the wonder of independent sports, in comparison to an omnipresent corporate sport like Premier League football. To have a cultural equivalent, you'd see the wonder of independent film, theatre, music and games, all put under a global spotlight \u2013 it would give the wider global public a taste of the independent art that makes our country so great but is so often covered in corporate sheen.</p> <h2>Gregg Hutchings, director of policy, <a href=\"http://www.legacytrustuk.org/\" title=\"\">Legacy Trust UK</a></h2> <p><strong>Focusing on local talent: </strong>This summer's sport has demonstrated that the journey from amateur to medallist is one that needs encouragement and support all the way. Take cycling \u2013 just watching the sport you can see how it connects the local cycling club and enthusiasts to what happens in the velodrome, and inspires more of it! Something for our high profile festivals to consider is how they work with other local festivals or bring in local talent. I'm not here to defend ACE but I think that many people there get this agenda and we should keep this pressure up and get the debate ongoing.</p> <h2>Lorenzo Belenguer, London 2012 art project leader,<br><a href=\"http://www.londonerstestimonies.com/\" title=\"\">Testimonies London</a></h2> <p><strong>Media-friendly role models:</strong> I think perhaps the arts could learn from London 2012 in facilitating more media-friendly role models. When you hear the athletes, especially the winners, they've all been trained on how to communicate to the media and the camera. Making art and curating it can be a more introspective job, but I think we, the arts professionals, need to find ways to communicate better to the general public through the mass media.</p> <p>The sports commentators have done a great job with the use of a plainer language and an excellent sense of humour \u2013 things the arts sometimes lack on TV programmes. It's about media coverage as well though; the Olympics and Paralympic Games are the greatest events on earth, but if you compare media coverage with artistic events such as the Edinburgh Festivals or Liverpool Biennial, it's worrying.</p> <p><strong>Embracing medals culture: </strong>The medals system is very media friendly. A photograph of a young and good-looking athlete biting the gold medal gets to the front page, but a consecrated artist on their 70s behind a rusty metal art installation (that no one understands) might be lucky to get to the bottom of page forty. Sport is about youth and the arts are about taking the time to mature \u2013 it means that it makes it difficult to get prime media coverage in this digital era.</p> <h2>Mark Robinson, director, <a href=\"http://www.thinkingpractice.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Thinking Practice</a></h2> <p><strong>Developing media savvy:</strong> The difficulty for the arts is the paucity of media coverage, and the kinds of questions people too often are asked, which can put them on the defensive or in a box when in front of the mic. For example, often on Radio 4 Today there's a tone or an explicit \"how much did this cost then?\"</p> <p><strong>Keeping things simple: </strong>The arts need to simplify its message to attract new audiences and make people excited about getting involved; we seem to be very good at over complicating issues.</p> <p><strong>Coaching and training:</strong> One thing that was really noticeable during the Games was the thanks people gave to their coaches. As someone who works with people in the arts as a coach, I'd like to see this spread. One-to-one coaching can give artists and managers alike improved trust and confidence, quality feedback and reality checks \u2013 it can help both give more focus to what they want to achieve and how well they're doing it, even the effect they have on others.</p> <p>It can be a really creative process too, with practical results. I think lots of people feel it's a luxury, but my experience of being coached as well as coaching suggests it's actually really good value for money, given the difference it can make. How might we get more of a coaching culture in the arts?</p> <p><strong>A single united event:</strong> One of the things the Cultural Olympiad has done is put a frame around a group of projects at a moment in time \u2013 equivalent to what the Games does for sporting events that could, in theory, all happen independently. This generates a different kind of attention to the ongoing flow of cultural events we could go to \u2013 one with a festival feel and focus.</p> <p>I would hope the evaluation and learning from the Cultural Olympiad will look at the effects of this: positive, negative and in-between. If we did something similar every four years it would certainly make it easier to invest lottery funds (which has to be spent on 'projects' and not core revenue costs) into artists and companies over a longer timeframe. It's something both sport and the Cultural Olympiad has done well.</p> <h2>Commenter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3501902\" title=\"\">RedClaire</a></h2> <p><strong>Encouraging national pride: </strong>I think that London 2012 has been excellent in celebrating the achievements of athletes from all nations. However, it's still very much the case that British athletes are celebrated as representatives of the UK \u2013 how might we encourage that kind of national pride in the amazing art the UK creates?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/poll/2012/jul/30/london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony-arts-culture?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">The opening ceremony</a> was excellent in this respect, though it did have a creative industries focus rather than a broad encompassing of the 'funded' sector.

  "<p>Barbara Adams, who has died aged 89, helped to put social science on the map of government departments. She trained and championed a generation of social researchers and provided evidence-based research long before this became fashionable. From 1960, she was head of the Sociological Research Branch at the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, part of a new research and development group set up to design and build demonstration housing projects with local authorities. The then novel idea of customer consultation saw results of residents' surveys and post-hoc evaluation shaping official policy. The results were fed into a series of Design Bulletins published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office which influenced the course of housing design.</p> <p>Social scientists, architects, surveyors and administrators worked closely together on the projects and Barbara pioneered the idea of their being present at the interviews with residents. In these idealistic years, she provided support to the Parker Morris committee investigating space allotted in public housing; its highly influential 1961 report Homes for Today and Tomorrow set standards which became mandatory for many years.</p> <p>Objectivity was paramount and Barbara never second-guessed residents' views about their homes. She famously asked one old man, as the snow swirled into his living room through a large hole in the roof: \"And what do you like about living here?\" No challenge was too much for her. She masterminded the first census of Gypsies in the early 1960s, commissioned by the minister for housing, Richard Crossman, who, on being told there were no figures on the numbers of Gypsies in Britain, said: \"Find out.\" The results were published in Gypsies and Other Travellers (1967), a work followed up some years later when Barbara was on a sabbatical year to the now defunct thinktank the Centre for Environmental Studies.</p> <p>Barbara set the very highest standards. Her staff went on to lead the way in the social sciences in government, academia and social and market research. One of her researchers, the film producer Tony Garnett, said that his time working for Barbara directly inspired his work on the 1966 TV play about homelessness <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/index.html\">Cathy Come Home</a>.</p> <p>In 1970, when the Ministry of Housing became the Department of the Environment, the branch became the independent and expanded Social Research Division, with a wider remit and influence, as the results of its research fed into policy formulation, reviews and standards. The private rented sector, families, single and elderly people, children's play, homelessness and rough sleeping, and housing management were some of the subjects studied and published, often in the face of opposition.</p> <p>It was not always easy to get agreement to research unpopular topics but Barbara was proactive, scanning the horizon for emerging issues, such as difficult-to-let housing, and ensuring that they were not forgotten in favour of quick-fix projects. During much of this time, social science was not popular with the government and funding was under threat. Barbara championed beleaguered social scientists across Whitehall, serving on many review teams set up to \"rationalise\" research. Beneath her modest, unassuming manner was resilience and determination. Sir Terry Heiser, one of the permanent secretaries she served, recalls that \"in times of crisis Barbara could be relied on to lower the temperature\". When she retired in 1985 Barbara was appointed OBE.</p> <p>Her strong commitment to social justice and help for the underprivileged was forged in prewar Oldham, where Barbara was born. Although her family was reasonably off, her childhood was not happy. Her mother died when she was young and after her father, William Hague, a one-time mayor of Oldham, remarried, Barbara was sent to live with her grandmother. She went to the local grammar school and, after graduating from Manchester University in social administration, joined the wartime <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/19/mass-observation-75-years\" title=\"\">Mass Observation</a> project, from where she went as a planning officer to the Ministry of Housing.</p> <p>In 1945 Barbara married Tony Adams, a publisher and friend of LS Lowry. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 Barbara married Harold Turner, a government research chemist she met through trade-union work for the Institution of Professional Civil Servants. They devoted their spare time to restoring Whitehall Cottage on the North Downs in Kent and later Bardingley, an isolated, part-moated, 16th-century farmhouse, also in Kent. Harold died in 1984 but not before they had created an award-winning vineyard.</p> <p>In later years Barbara lived in Hampstead, north London, and enjoyed the theatre, art history courses and reading. She kept her interest in politics to the end. She had left the Communist party in 1956 and joined the Labour party, from which she resigned over the Iraq war. She generously supported many charities, including Shelter and Liberty, but particularly Freedom from Torture. Befriending torture victims was part of her tradition of giving unswerving help and friendship.</p> <p>She is survived by her half-sister Pat and stepchildren Richard Adams and Helen and Diana Turner.</p> <p>\u2022 Barbara Adams, social scientist, born 16 October 1922; died 20 July 2012</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United's signing of Robin van Persie has delivered a blast of the ambition which the glory, glory football club is supposed to stand for, after a summer dominated by the shabby details of its owners' float on the New York Stock Exchange. To make sense of United since the US-based Glazer family bought the club and loaded it with \u00a3525m borrowings in 2005, it has always been instructive to wonder where the Reds would be had the US corporate raid never happened.</p> <p>The signing of Van Persie is the boldest of statements for the forthcoming Premier League season, and a reminder of what might have been, if the Glazers had not inflicted their leveraged takeover on United, which has since cost the club over \u00a3550m in interest, fees and charges. Van Persie is United's first truly major signing of an outfield player \u2013 with due respect to Ashley Young and Phil Jones \u2013 since the club paid \u00a330.75m for Dimitar Berbatov on 31 August 2008. That was the day Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan bought Manchester City, and from then, with Mansour intent on pouring almost \u00a31bn in, the opposite of the Glazers' financial drain, United's signings have been eclipsed by City's.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's justifications have never quite convinced; his assertion that the owners, whom he pronounced \"great\" this summer, have made enough money available to him but he declined to spend it because there was \"no value in the market.\" The transfer market can be considered obscenely inflated, but it works both ways and United never spent the \u00a380m received from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo on replacement players of similar class. Instead, the enduring Portuguese puzzle of B\u00e9b\u00e9 aside, Ferguson signed good players of promise including Jones, Young, Chris Smalling and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. The manager repeatedly insisted he was not inhibited by the Glazers' draining the finances, but asserted he was only interested in footballers of youth, who would develop.</p> <p>The hauling of the 37-year-old Paul Scholes out of retirement last season, while City were powered to the title by his world class opponent in midfield, Yaya Tour\u00e9, 28, bought for \u00a324m, exposed United's vulnerability from successive seasons of declining to land established stars. The Van Persie signing, bitter for Arsenal, swipes that away; he is 29, and is being bought for what he can do now.</p> <p>So this is a taste of the buying power and the A grade ambition United could be expected to have wielded had the Glazers not swooped in 2005 to buy what they describe, in their heart-sinking flotation prospectus, as \"one of the world's most recognisable brands.\" The acquisition of Van Persie came a week after the flotation was finally achieved, at a reduced price of $14 per share, the jarring re-registering of the famous Manchester United in the Cayman Islands tax haven, and the choice of New York to trade its shares.</p> <p>United's Old Trafford-based chief executive, David Gill, and London-office sited vice-chairman Edward Woodward, have pointed in support of the Glazer ownership to United's much-envied sponsorship deals and doubling of income, from \u00a3159m in the eleven months to 30 June 2005, to \u00a3331m for the year to 30 June 2011. However critics, most prominently the Manchester United Supporters Trust, who campaign for a genuine fans' stake in the club, have always argued bitterly that the Glazers' running of United is designed to serve the family itself.</p> <p>Malcolm Glazer and his six children, \"lineal descendants\" as the flotation document bloodlessly described them, have conducted a text-book example of a leveraged buyout, loading the money they borrowed to buy the club on to United itself to repay. Amid all the detail, and widespread criticism, of the New York float, for offering to traders a club still \u00a3423m in debt despite the \u00a3550m drained out since 2005, two points are most central to understanding it.</p> <p>Following the worldwide attention focused on the financial manoeuvrings, which came after an abandoned plan last year to float in Singapore, the Glazers ultimately only floated 10% of Manchester United in New York. When they announced on 3 July their plan to float, the Glazers stated that all the money raised would be from selling new shares, and would be used to pay down the debts they loaded on the club. \"We intend to use all of our net proceeds from this offering to reduce our indebtedness,\" the original prospectus, said.</p> <p>When the flotation actually happened last week, it turned out that the Glazers had changed their intention, and in fact were helping themselves to half the proceeds. They sold some of their shares, and only issued five per cent new shares. Of the $220m (\u00a3140m) earned from selling the Manchester United (Cayman Islands) shares to investors, only $110m (\u00a370m) has ultimately been banked by United. The Glazer family themselves have been paid the other \u00a370m.</p> <p>Reducing the debt by only \u00a370m after all this fuss and effort, at 8.75% annual interest, will save United \u00a36m in interest a year. As the investment analyst and critic of the Glazer leveraged buyout Andy Green has pointed out, the saving in interest is exceeded by the $12m (\u00a37.7m) it has cost United in lawyers and other fees to float, following the \u00a37m costs incurred for the aborted flotation in Singapore. The costs of hocking United around the world are coming out of the club's share of the proceeds, not the Glazer family's.</p> <p>The US-based venture capitalist Michael Moritz, who has financially backed companies with huge growth prospects including Google, has repeatedly been scathing about United's float. He has insisted that the Glazers' financial draining of United for their own interests should be considered by the old-fashioned description: asset-stripping. Although the Glazers never explain themselves publicly, Ferguson, Gill and Woodward have always defended their running of United. Now, with Van Persie, United have found the money to sign a genuinely top class, fully-formed footballing asset, for the first time in years.</p>",
  "<p>If you had the good fortune of obtaining tickets to the Olympics, you might have inadvertently contributed to a potential breakthrough in renewable power.</p> <p>Around one million or so visitors alighted at West Ham underground station to get to the Games. Access to the Olympic Park came via a tiled walkway. Nothing extraordinary there, you say. Look up and you'd have seen a row of a dozen streetlights lit around the clock. Again, nothing that surprising. A tad wasteful, even.</p> <p>Yet the reality is quite the opposite. Using a hybrid technology that converts kinetic energy into electricity, the lights were powered by a uniquely original source: footsteps.</p> <p>\"This is the first time that there's ever been a commercial installation of this type in a real environment \u2026 using a power source that's never been tapped before\", says Laurence Kemball-Cook, the brains behind the technology.</p> <p>The 26 year old industrial design engineer, dreamt up the idea of turning footsteps into power while at Loughborough University. He developed the first prototype of his <a href=\"http://www.pavegen.com/\" title=\"\">Pavegen system</a> from a flat in Brixton \"with only \u00a350 in my back pocket\".</p> <p><strong>Footfall harvesting </strong></p> <p>The young inventor calls his creation \"footfall harvesting\". Essentially, the tile surface flexes about five millimetres when stepped on, which creates kinetic energy that is then converted to produce an average of six watts per footstep. For competition reasons, he's reluctant to expand on the precise technicalities.</p> <p>The end result is clear enough though. During the two weeks of the Games, the Pavegen tiles generated 20 kilowatt-hours or 72 million joules of energy. That proved sufficient to keep the walkway streetlamps illuminated at full power through the night, and at half power during the day, with plenty of back-up energy left over to spare.</p> <p>The tiles featured alongside a 3 megawatt biomass boiler and a roof of solar panels as one of the renewable technologies on show at the Olympics.</p> <p>\"We sought a mix of innovative, cost-effective solutions that would endure beyond the Games\", says Simon Wright, director of venues and infrastructure at the Olympic Delivery Authority. While the 2012 Olympics gave Kemball-Cook the opportunity to prove the large-scale viability of his invention, it's not the first time his clean tech solution has been put to the test.</p> <p>Beverage company Diageo, for example, used the tiles in a <a href=\"http://www.diageo.com/en-sc/newsmedia/pages/resource.aspx?resourceid=1075\" title=\"\">series of demonstration events in Spain</a>, Greece and Bulgaria. The Pavegen tiles were just one of a number of clean tech solutions that Diageo asked internet users to vote for. The solution won hands down, with more than 40m votes.</p> <p>The power-generating tiles can also be found in Melbourne's emblematic Federation Square, where they are generating electricity for part of the indoor lighting on a shopping centre.</p> <p><strong>Markets and margins </strong></p> <p>Looking ahead, Kemball-Cook is nothing if not ambitious. He sees renewable technology as a potential alternative to solar, which is difficult to use indoors or in built-up urban areas that are prone to shade.</p> <p>In addition to street lighting, the technology is suited to <a href=\"http://www.pavegen.com/energy-harvesting-applications.php\" title=\"\">low-energy applications</a> such as advertising displays and signage.</p> <p>\"We're looking to use it in transport hubs and busy high streets to power shops\", he says, in reference to his product's possible markets. \"Basically, anywhere that there are a lot of people walking.\"</p> <p>His list includes off-grid urban communities in the developing world. Pavegen is already running some pilots in the favelas of Brazil's Rio de Janeiro, host of the next Olympic Games.</p> <p>Kemball-Cook's ambitions aren't without support. Westfield Stratford City shopping centre in West London is set to install Pavegen tiles later this year. His company, <a href=\"http://www.pavegen.com/\" title=\"\">Pavegen Systems</a>, is also in conversation with a number of large corporations and developers of large offices and housing projects.</p> <p>Aside from the low-carbon benefits, retailers are interested in software built into the tiles that registers every footstep. The system allows shop owners to measure precise footfall numbers in real time. The same software can be used to convey to users how much energy they are helping to create.</p> <p>\"If a company is putting huge effort into being more sustainable in their approach, Pavegen offers a way that can power part of their building. It's a really visual way of doing this. And everyone needs to walk together \u2026 it's almost like crowdsourcing energy\", Kemball-Cook states.</p> <p>The solution is attracting interest from the clean tech community too. Pavegen Systems has clocked up <a href=\"http://www.pavegen.com/awards.php\" title=\"\">more than a dozen awards</a> over the last couple of years. Its trophy cabinet includes last year's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2011/jun/09/winner-big-idea-2011\" title=\"\">Big Idea prize</a> in The Observer's annual Ethical Awards.</p> <p>Challenges remain, of course. The most significant is price. Again, Kemball-Cook is coy about specifics, but concedes that his power-generating tiles are considerably more expensive than solar panels. However, he's confident that unit costs will come down as production increases.</p> <p>But how to boost production? Bluntly put, that comes down to financing. The company is currently engaged in a funding round. Kemball-Cook is hoping to raise a seven-figure sum. If successful, he'll have the clout to start manufacturing around 20,000 tiles per quarter.</p> <p>It's not the first time he's approached funders. In July 2011, he presented to the London Business Angels (LBA), a group of early-stage investors. The investors saw the technology as a \"compelling proposition\", says Anthony Clarke, LBA's managing director. Within a month, Pavegen's founder had signed a deal with a small syndicate of backers for crucial seed funding.</p> <p>\"He's going on to bigger and better things now\", says Clarke. \"Let's hope the investors make a good return on it.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The remains of an 18th century ship have been identified through detective work on her timbers as the Namur, whose crews included Jane Austen's seafaring brother Charles, and<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/equiano_olaudah.shtml\" title=\"\"> Olaudah Equiano, the most famous black writer and anti-slavery activist of Georgian England</a>.</p> <p>Austen's brother captained the ship from 1811-14, and she used his stories of naval life in her writing, including Mansfield Park.</p> <p>Equiano wrote a vivid account of the terror of working below decks as a powder monkey in the heat of battle; specifically in one of her most famous victories over the French fleet at the Battle of Lagos on 17 August 1759, a key incident in the Seven Years' War.</p> <p>After decades of research, experts have confirmed that the timbers found under six layers of floorboards in 1995, at <a href=\"http://www.thedockyard.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chatham Historic Dockyard</a> in Kent, came from the ship built at the yard in the 1750s, and broken there in the 1830s.</p> <p>\"The Namur was one of the ships that played a vital role in the Seven Years' War \u2013 a crucial episode, as important for this country as the two 20th century world wars, but which has now passed almost entirely from sight,\" said naval historian Richard Holdsworth, the leader of the project at the dockyard.</p> <p>He described the war, which began in 1756 and eventually involved Britain and most of Europe, the west African coast, and North and Central America, as the world's first global conflict.</p> <p>\"The Namur helped win the British navy mastery of the oceans, which gave the country the world power status that endures to this day.\"</p> <p>The timbers were revealed by chance in 1995 when repair work began on a near derelict Georgian wheelwright's workshop, one of scores of historic buildings and structures within the yard. The find was described as the best in warship archaeology since the discovery of the Tudor Mary Rose, flagship of Henry VIII, at Portsmouth almost 30 years earlier. But the identity of the ship was completely unknown.</p> <p>Years of research have not only conclusively identified the Namur but revealed carpenters' marks proving that the same shipwrights worked on Nelson's flagship, Victory, also built at Chatham.</p> <p>The Namur was an exceptional ship. At a time when the working life of most timber ships was about 20 years, she saw more than 47 years of active service, taking part in nine fleet actions \u2013 often as the flagship \u2013 in three campaigns.</p> <p>Holdsworth only learned of the Equiano connection a few months ago: \"I was drinking coffee at the Maritime Museum, and I was so astonished I almost dropped my cup.\"</p> <p>According to his 1789 autobiography \u2013 The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa, the African, which is one of the earliest books published in England by a black author \u2013 Equiano came on board as the 14-year-old slave of an officer. He recalled carrying gunpowder to one of the cannons with another boy as powder fell around them from rotten cartridges. \"We were also from our employment very much exposed to the enemy's shots: for we had to go through nearly the whole length of the ship to bring the powder. I expected therefore every minute to be my last, especially when I saw our men fall so thick about me.\"</p> <p>The yard, which at its height employed more than 10,000 people, has been a visitor attraction since its closure. But a new gallery will display the timbers where they were laid almost 200 years ago as part of an \u00a38.4m project to tell the history of ship building on the site.</p> <p>\"I suspect it was no coincidence that so much of the ship was kept here,\" Holdsworth said. \"This was a critical time in the history of the navy and the yard, when the age of the great wooden ships was just giving way to iron. <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/joseph-mallord-william-turner-the-fighting-temeraire\" title=\"\">Turner's famous painting of the Fighting Temeraire</a> being towed here to be broken was painted just a few years later.</p> <p>\"Chatham forgot it had the timbers, but never forgot the Namur: when the last ship was launched there, the Ocelot submarine in 1962, the programme included line drawings of famous ships built at the yard \u2013 and there was the Namur among them.\"</p>",

  "<p>Branding and re-branding, launching and re-launching are all some businesses seem to do these days. Built on history, tradition and comforting familiarity, football clubs have been resistant to such perpetual re-invention but the suspicion is that, earlier this summer in Wales, a Rubicon was crossed. Cardiff City's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan has changed the team's home shirts from blue to red while also introducing a club badge dominated by a dragon.</p> <p>The logic is that, like dragons, red signifies good luck and should consequently shift more replica kits across east Asia. After an initial outcry, shirts are reported to be selling well in the Welsh capital and Malky Mackay's side \u2013 at home to promoted Huddersfield Town on Friday in the opening game of the Championship \u2013 certainly looked good when they wore them for the first time last Saturday and thrashed Newcastle United 4-1 during a friendly.</p> <p>With Craig Bellamy back in attack at his hometown club and great things expected of another new signing, Kim Bo-kyung, a star of South Korea's bronze medal winning Olympic team, in midfield, Mackay's team are among the promotion favourites.</p> <p>Cardiff's manager was formerly in charge at Watford where his successor, Sean Dyche, found himself replaced by Gianfranco Zola after Watford were taken over by the Italian Pozzo family in June. The Pozzos also own Italy's Udinese and Spain's Granada so it is perhaps not surprising that Zola has signed six players on season-long loans from those clubs. He is particularly excited by the potential of Matej Vydra, a striker borrowed from Udinese.</p> <p>Zola and Sean O'Driscoll, Nottingham Forest's new manager, may boast very different footballing pedigrees but they share a common devotion to the passing game. Not for nothing was O'Driscoll dubbed \"the Ars\u00e8ne Wenger of the Championship\" during some over-achieving seasons at Doncaster Rovers. Like Zola he is working for a club under new ownership, the super-rich Kuwaiti Al-Hasawi family having purchased Forest from the estate of the late Nigel Doughty and promptly vowed to set about recreating the Brian Clough glory days.</p> <p>If Forest fans harbour a sense of renewed optimism their counterparts at relegated Blackburn Rovers feel less enthused by the bizarre regime operated by their Indian owners, Venky's. For the moment, at least, Steve Kean remains the manager but he can hardly have been reassured by a declaration from Shebby Singh, Venky's global adviser, that three straight defeats would spell the sack. Singh has apologised for that announcement \u2013 along with his description of the team's 30-year-old winger Morten Gamst Pedersen as \"a pensioner\".</p> <p>Attitudes towards Assem and Ehab Allam, the Egyptians who bought Hull City two years ago, are rather warmer on Humberside where it has not gone unnoticed that the father and son have poured almost \u00a360m into the club. They have also been unafraid to make controversial decisions, most recently replacing the local hero Nick Barmby as manager with Steve Bruce.</p> <p>At Middlesbrough ownership still rests with the locally born businessman Steve Gibson and although the big spending days enjoyed under Bryan Robson and Steve McClaren are, like the 2006 Uefa Cup final, fast fading memories, the talented Tony Mowbray has made several exciting signings. Promotion hopes are high on Teesside.</p> <p>Boro's opening game is at Barnsley where a hamstring injury suffered by the home side's marquee summer arrival, Mido, denies the debutant Jonathan Woodgate the opportunity to mark surely the most disastrous buy of Gareth Southgate's managerial tenure on Teesside. The Egypt international appears certain to keep Keith Hill on his toes but perhaps Barnsley's manager is a glutton for punishment. Not content with acquiring Mido he has signed Tomasz Cywka from Derby County. The Polish midfielder was described by his former manager, Nigel Clough, as \"not very bright\".</p> <p>Those harsh words earned Clough \u2013 whose Derby players could do with giving some of the Championship's best crowds something to shout about \u2013 a reprimand from the PFA and Gus Poyet similarly found himself at the eye of a storm last season after defending his fellow Uruguayan Luis Su\u00e1rez in the Patrice Evra racism affair.</p> <p>Fortunately for Brighton fans, Poyet cuts a rather more sure-footed presence in the technical area. After steering the team to 10th last season \u2013 Brighton's highest finish in more than two decades \u2013 the play-offs seem a realistic target. It reflects well on this smartly, spaciously, re-housed club's new-found \"pulling power\" that their first three signings of the summer \u2013 Tomasz Kuszczak, Bruno Saltor and Wayne Bridge \u2013 came from Manchester United, Valencia and Manchester City respectively.</p> <p>Poyet's stock remains high in Leeds, where once he excelled as the more volatile Dennis Wise's assistant. With Wise long gone, Neil Warnock is the latest man charged with attempting to restore Premier League football to Elland Road and he has assembled almost an entire new team this summer. One recently arrived component is the forward Warnock once dubbed \"a sewer rat\", El Hadji Diouf.</p> <p>If managers rarely polarise opinion like Warnock, few chairmen come more controversial than Leeds's Ken Bates. They are likely to prove key figures in an eclectic division replete with eccentric characters and edge of your seat competitiveness. As Boro's Mowbray says: \"Bring it on.\"</p>",
  "<p>News that the Serious Fraud Office is investigating<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/9476251/MoD-drawn-into-Saudi-deal-inquiry.html\" title=\"\"> allegations of corruption</a> in a deal between the UK government, GPT Special Project Management (a subsidiary of the arms company EADS), and Saudi Arabia is to be welcomed.</p> <p>Three whistleblowers allege that, as part of the \u00a32bn government to government deal for communication and surveillance equipment for the Saudi national guard, at least \u00a314.5m in suspicious payments were made from 2007 and 2010 to two companies based in the Cayman Islands. The whistleblowers claim the companies received 14% of the equipment budget on the contract yet provided no goods or services.</p> <p>Ministry of Defence officials learned of the payments in 2008 and, despite warning GPT that such payments would not be allowed in the future, took no action, as the disbursements continued for the next 19 months. No guilt has yet been established, and EADS says it is co-operating with the SFO.</p> <p>This deal took place within the context of a global trade in weapons and defence equipment in which many laws seem not to apply. Defence companies and individual arms dealers operate largely with impunity in spite of the fact that the sector accounts for about 40% of corruption in all world trade.</p> <p>The size of weapons transactions \u2013 often worth tens of billions of pounds \u2013 and the reality that these deals take place behind a veil of national security-imposed secrecy, create fertile ground for corruption.</p> <p>The companies and the illicit dealers, whose operations are often closely intertwined, have strong links to ministries of defence, the military and intelligence services, as well as to political parties. There is a continuously revolving door of people moving between these entities.</p> <p>The funding of the electoral campaigns of those representatives who support defence contractors in the US can seem like a system of legal bribery, while in Europe and the UK contributions to political parties by the sector have taken place for decades.</p> <p>The relative immunity of the trade is illustrated by the fact that, of 502 violations of UN arms embargoes by governments, companies and individuals, only two have resulted in legal action, with just one leading to a conviction.</p> <p>After being investigated for years over extensive allegations of corruption in half a dozen deals from the mid-1980s, in 2010 BAE admitted to false accounting and making misleading statements, and agreed to pay out almost \u00a3300m in penalties in the US and the UK. The company ran a global money-laundering system: a network of secret cash payments amounting to billions of pounds that went on for years with the connivance of the British government. Authorities repeatedly let the company off the hook.</p> <p>First, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/16/bae.immigrationpolicy?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Tony Blair forced the SFO</a> to close down a long-term investigation into the most corrupt arms deal in history \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/07/bae15\" title=\"\">al-Yamamah deal </a>between the UK and Saudi Arabia. The government claimed that national security necessitated this closure after the Saudis&#xa0;threatened the likely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/15/bae.armstrade\" title=\"\">loss of \"British lives on British streets\"</a> if the investigation continued.</p> <p>Senior members of the intelligence services disagreed with the government's judgment. A high court judge suggested that it was incumbent upon the executive and the SFO to ensure that no one interfered with our justice system. Even elements in the business community worried that the decision had damaged the UK's reputation as a leading financial centre.</p> <p>In early 2011, the SFO followed up this capitulation with a derisory settlement with BAE in relation to five other allegedly corrupt deals. The company was fined \u00a3500,000 for \"accounting irregularities\" after promising to pay damages of \u00a330m. The US departments of justice and state fined the company almost $550m for the same transactions. The difference in settlements may be seen in the context of the views of the late foreign secretary Robin Cook, who described BAE as \"having the key to the garden door of No&#xa0;10\".</p> <p>There is a history of defence transactions with Saudi Arabia being tarnished by corruption. An arms dealer of more than 50 years' experience described to me how business with his Saudi clients is done, using a glass on his desk: \"You always have to pay bribes. If they want to buy this glass you tell them it's $5. They will beat you down to $1, then they will say, 'OK, I will give you $3, but you give me $2 back!'\" He claims that on his Saudi deals he gives more than half of the contract price back in bribes.</p> <p>From the documentation presented to the SFO and the government concerning the allegations in the GPT contract, there appears to be prima facie evidence of bribery. Will the SFO break the trend of decades by fully investigating the allegations and, if appropriate, charge the corporate entity and the individuals responsible? Or will this be another whitewash to protect the British defence industry, the government and its munificent Saudi client?</p>",
  "<p>Facebook's shares fell to new lows Thursday as insiders were freed to sell another 270m shares.</p> <p>The expiration of a lock-up period for insiders increased the pool of available shares by 60% and had worried analysts that it might lead to more falls in Facebook's already battered share price.</p> <p>Their fears proved well founded in early trading as Facebook's share price 7% to $19.83, their lowest level since the $38 IPO price set in May. They ended the day at $19.88, just over 47% below the IPO price.</p> <p>The expiration of the lockup means early investors including Goldman Sachs, Elevation Partners, which counts U2's Bono as a partner, and DST Global are now allowed to sell more shares. Goldman and DST were among the investors who increased the number of shares they sold at $38 shortly before the IPO.</p> <p>Facebook's shares have got off to a poor start after one of the most hyped sales in recent history. They fell below $38 within days and had dropped below $20 at the start of August. The price has been hit hard as analysts have worried that the firm has yet to figure out a way to make money from mobile users, the fastest growing part of their business, and fears that growth is slowing.</p> <p>After such a precipitous fall in share price, analysts are split on whether investors will take advantage of the end of the lockup to sell more shares. One analyst, who wished to remain anonymous, pointed to Angie's List, a referral service, whose share price plummeted on Tuesday after its IPO lockup expired. \"I wouldn't even think of buying this until the price comes down,\" he said.</p> <p>Facebook sold some 421m shares at its May 17 IPO, a further two billion shares will be released for potential sale between now and next May, when the final lockup expires.</p> <p>Tom Forte, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said he expected more volatility in Facebook's share price in the short term. Another 243m shares are set to be released from lockup between mid-October and mid-November. On November 14, co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will be able to sell shares and more than 1.2bn shares will be available for trading.</p> <p>\"I'm a glass half-full man on Facebook. In the near term I expect increasing pressure on the share price as more shares come unlocked. Holders may be unwilling ti part with their shares at nearly half their IPO price but in the near term there are going to be more shares out there and not enough demand to pick them up,\" he said.</p> <p>But Forte is more confident on Facebook's future once its gets through the lock-up period. He has a 12-month price target of $40-$42 for the shares. \"I think Facebook will figure out a way to monetize mobile advertising,\" he said.<br>The company and its bankers are facing legal action from shareholders who have accused them of selectively handing out negative information about Facebook's mobile issues to some shareholders ahead of the sale.</p> <p>The fall comes as Facebook's peers have experienced similar setbacks on the US stock markets. Shares in Groupon, the online daily deals site, hit a new low this week after announcing that revenue growth had slowed and profit margins were shrinking. Groupon's IPO launched at $20 a share last December and its shares now trade for just over $5. Zynga, the social gaming company behind hits including Words With Friends and Draw Something, has lost 68% of it value since its IPO last year.</p>",
  "<h2>VAN UTD? MAN PERSIE? <a href=\"http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/buitenlands/12767029/__Fatman_en_Robin__van_Persie___.html\" title=\"\">FATMAN AND ROBIN</a>?</h2> <p>On the one hand, Arsenal fans are in mourning over the sale of Robin van Persie to Manchester United (subject to a medical for a player about as knack-prone as a blindfolded toddler riding a skateboard down the stairs while juggling several pairs of scissors). On the other hand, Arsenal fans are in a celebratory mood because Van Persie's sale has led to a comical public meltdown from creepy celebrity stalker Piers Morgan, who took to Twitter last night to wail in the style of said blindfolded toddler at the end of his journey down the stairs on a skateboard while juggling several pairs of scissors. \"Waaaahhh!\" wailed Arsenal's top boy, stamping his feet and spitting his dummy out, to the amusement of even Arsene Wenger. \"It's not fair! Waaaaahhhhh!\" Given this reaction, it is more or less Arsenal's public duty to rename the club The Tottenham Hotspur Tribute Act and replace the statue of Thierry Henry outside the Emirates with one of Bill Nicholson.</p> <p>Van Persie's departure has been labelled by some as a betrayal, although the Fiver assumes the same people weren't complaining when Sol Campbell joined Arsenal from Spurs. Well, the first time anyway. But in reality, it's not. United and Arsenal might have been rivals in the past, Roy Keane once threatening to destroy the Highbury tunnel with his own bare hands, but no more, not since Wenger decided that winning trophies is for losers. The consequence of that approach has led to the likes of Henry, Patrick Vieira, Ashley Cole, Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri leaving, with Van Persie merely the latest to reject the Wenger Way.</p> <p>Last summer, Wenger had this to say about Fabregas and Nasri leaving: \"Imagine the worst situation \u2013 we lose Fabregas and Nasri \u2013 you cannot convince people you are ambitious after that.\" Both left, and Wenger's time at Arsenal reached an all-time low with the 8-2 thumping at Old Trafford. But this is not necessarily a disaster for the Gunners. After all, United could find that spending \u00a323m for a 29-year-old with one year left on his contract with a terrible knack record proves to be the worst piece of business since the Fiver opened a pork restaurant in Golders Green.</p> <p>With Santi Cazorla, Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski already having arrived at Arsenal, maybe the future is bright after all. And \u00a323m is a lot of money as well \u2013 a real chance for Wenger to push on, improve the squad even more and \u2026 hang on a minute. What's this? \"We have already recruited since we bought [Olivier] Giroud and [Lukas] Podolski, who originally were intended to offset the departure of Van Persie,\" deadpanned Wenger, preparing a deal to bring Teddy Sheringham out of retirement.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I am disappointed, bordering on a little bit of anger almost \u2026 It is difficult for someone like me who has an Arsenal gun sealed to his chest\" \u2013 Arsenal great and Very Placid Man Bob Wilson reveals he's nearly a tiny bit miffed at the Van Persie move. Possibly more worrying is his claim to seemingly have a Gooner-branded firearm attached to his person like some sort of Emirates-season-ticket-holding ED-209. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jts0xxg7P8I\" title=\"\">Or like this</a>.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\"Re: Ashley Gilbert's comment that 'if the universe were actually infinite it would contain, somewhere in it, everything that could possibly be' (yesterday's Fiver letters).

  "<p>From the moment you woke up this morning to the time you reached your desk, it's estimated that you'll have been exposed to over 100,000 forms of technology and over 200 interactions with brands, business and offers. That's baffling \u2013 try to list them.</p> <p>A focus group was recently asked to do just that and the result was two distinct lists. The first was technology based \u2013 Oyster cards, alarm clocks, iPads, digital displays on the tube and so on. The other was a list of brand names \u2013 Kellogg's, TFL, Colgate, Cannondale etc. Not a single participant connected the dots and created a list that included both technologies and brands.</p> <p>The challenge for brand owners is in uniting these two elements in consumers' minds, converting standalone encounters into meaningful experiences of the brands they represent. There needs to be a move away from the passive, isolated interactions that we see all around us, towards immersive experiences that resonate throughout our everyday lives. Very few brands have embraced this shift; they have failed to recognise that brands today are not built by directing singular messages 'at' consumers. Brands exist as experiences, and consumers themselves decide how and when to engage with the brands that appeal to them.</p> <p>Multiple obstacles create a set of false blinkers that prevent brand owners reaching this realisation. It's easy to say that marketers are failing to embrace the diversity of contemporary media and technology, but we should also recognise complacency, laziness and legacy. Even major brands and their owners can sometimes be guilty of the \"but that's the way we've always done it\" mindset.</p> <p>When Bart Becht, the previous CEO of <a href=\"http://www.rb.com/home\" title=\"\">Reckitt Benckiser</a> and one of the great business leaders of the last decade, collected the UK Marketing Society's Leader of the Year award at the end of 2011, he told the audience \u2013 senior marketers from some of the world's biggest advertisers \u2013 that it had been easy. Most of them, he said, \"are still spending half your marketing budget on TV, and your consumers aren't watching\".</p> <p>Businesses like ours need to help clients rather than perpetuate legacy thinking about the ways in which brands today and tomorrow can succeed. Media fragmentation and progress in technology means that no global brand consultancy has established the real cross-channel competency that would enable a helpful extension to the advisory and creative skillsets that historically defined our work. Many simply have not been able to escape the research-strategy-identity-guidelines-maintenance treadmill for long enough to keep pace with technology and innovation.</p> <p>Equally, 'digital' agencies \u2013 another lazy descriptor \u2013 have only been able to grow globally by becoming communications or productions businesses. This has meant the gap between brands and consumers' everyday interactions has been impossible to plug \u2013 until now.</p> <p>A new agency construct is emerging that brings together, with integrity and consistency, the worlds of strategic brand development and design with technology at the core. <a href=\"http://www.thebrandunion.com/\" title=\"\">The Brand Union</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digitlondon.com/\" title=\"\">Digit</a> are examples of this (disclaimer: I'm the CEO of The Brand Union), where agencies are combining strategic and global brand expertise with world\u2013class capabilities in technology and innovation. This marriage of disciplines helps to define and create experiences for brands that align with consumer lifestyles and enhance, rather than interrupt or, worse, fail to engage with their everyday lives.</p> <p>This new construct is particularly attractive in the current economic environment. Clients are increasingly looking to their agencies to keep them competitive, especially when brands that embrace the channels their consumers engage with steal the march \u2013 and the profile \u2013 on those who are returning to John Wanamaker's famous quote: \"half the money I spend on advertising is wasted\u2026 trouble is I don't know which half.\" Back to Mr Becht, who absolutely knew the difference.</p> <p><em>Toby Southgate is CEO, UK &amp; Ireland of </em><a href=\"http://www.thebrandunion.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Brand Union</em></a><em> \u2013 follow it on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thebrandunion\" title=\"\"><em>@thebrandunion</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A growing number of trade unions are considering pouring cash into a thinktank to shift the debate within the Labour party to the left before the next general election in 2015.</p> <p><a href=\"http://classonline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Class, the Centre for Labour and Social Studies</a>, was launched earlier this summer. It was conceived by the leader of Unite,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/len-mccluskey\" title=\"\"> Len McCluskey</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/17/union-rebellion-ed-miliband-grows\" title=\"\">Paul Kenny</a>, GMB general secretary, whose respective affiliated unions are both large funders of Labour. The centre's media adviser is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owen-jones\" title=\"\">Owen Jones</a>, author of the popular polemic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\" title=\"\">Chavs: the Demonisation of the Working Class</a>.</p> <p>The non-affiliated<a href=\"http://www.pcs.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Public and Commercial Services Union</a> is also financing the body, with talks with other unions under way as the thinktank gears up to host fringe debates at the TUC and Labour conferences in September.</p> <p>The new body generating ideas and research in already crowded terrain is a result of frustration on the political left at what they see as a failure to present a \"coherent alternative\" to the economic crisis to disaffected Labour voters and concern at the influence they believe the New Labour pressure group Progress wields over the party.</p> <p>Jones said Class would be a thinktank rooted in the experiences of working people.</p> <p>\"The policy process within the Labour party shouldn't be top-down. This project is a bridge between the intellectual expertise of the academics and economists we are working with, and the trade unions, which are uniquely rooted in the experiences of working people in this country. So we can bring together both in terms of articulating an alternative that will resonate with working people, which Unite exists to represent.\"</p> <p>Jones added that Class was not designed to be a \"trade union puppet\", but had been set up as a strictly independent body in a serious attempt to inform Labour's policy debate and contribute to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/15/jon-cruddas-labour-policy-review\" title=\"\">the policy review led by Jon Cruddas</a>.</p> <p>The thinktank is overseen by a small management committee, with a large national advisory panel of academics, economists and journalists to assist in guiding policy direction and providing expertise.</p> <p>The panel includes the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/seumasmilne\" title=\"\">Seumas Milne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\" title=\"\">Polly Toynbee</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/video/2012/jun/11/jack-dromey-labour-shadow-housing-minister-video\" title=\"\">Jack Dromey</a>, the former T&amp;G deputy general secretary who is now MP for Birmingham Erdington and shadow minister for communities and local government.</p> <p>The thinktank says its core agenda is developing economic and industrial policies, and tackling the housing crisis and inequality.</p> <p>Tensions over the future direction of Labour recently burst into the open during the union conference season when Kenny called for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18445895\" title=\"\">Progress to be \"outlawed\"</a> from the party. The GMB leader's outburst gave voice to those on the left who claim Progress is pushing a \"neo-liberal\" agenda on to Labour through its supporters in the shadow cabinet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Progress</a> did not return fire. But <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/staggers/2012/06/union-campaign-against-progress-spells-pure-danger-labour\" title=\"\">amid fears that Labour could resume infighting after a period of relative unity</a>, Ed Miliband intervened to make it clear that he wanted the party to be \"open to ideas, open to organisations and open to people who want to be part of it\".</p> <p>One of the main criticisms levelled at Progress by the left was that the pressure group has largely been funded since 1996 by the former Labour minister Lord Sainsbury of Turville, one of Tony Blair's biggest champions and a big Labour donor until Miliband took over the leadership.</p> <p>Though Unite is among unions engaged in community organising and ensuring more working-class candidates get into parliament, and is now partly funding a thinktank, supporters resist the suggestion that such moves mirror the accusations levelled at Progress. They say that unions are democratic bodies that make up the bedrock of the Labour movement, in contrast to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/20/unison-mandelson-labour-thinktank-progress\" title=\"\">what Unison leader Dave Prentis recently called</a> \"a party within a party, funded by external interests\".</p> <p>Progress describes itself as an independent organisation of Labour party members and trade unionists, with more members than ever before, and points to the diversity of speakers invited to its events.</p> <p>But it responded to some accusations levelled by unions by announcing a number of changes earlier this month, including greater disclosure of donors and sponsors, a move welcomed by its critics.</p> <p>Jones said the launch of the union-backed thinktank was not a co-ordinated response to concerns about Progress, which is chaired by the former Labour minister Lord Adonis, and whose honorary president is the shadow education secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/jul/19/stephen-twigg-interview-waste-school-buildings?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Stephen Twigg</a>. He said: \"Progress is trying to win a debate basically by organisational muscle. This is about engaging in a battle of ideas and winning the battle of ideas.\"</p> <p>He added that the democratic legitimacy of trade unions, which between them represent more than six million workers, can help fashion policies to help woo back five million voters who turned their back on Labour during its 13 years in power.</p> <p>He is frustrated at the way many EU countries have seized on the financial crisis to push through a rightwing agenda. \"In Britain now you are seeing a huge, gathering backlash against austerity.\"</p> <p>But he added: \"Unless people feel there is a coherent alternative, all you get is mass resignation, a sense of 'I don't like what is happening but I can't see what alternative there is'. So this will help transform the debate within the Labour party in particular.\"</p> <p>Steve Hart, chair of Class and Unite's political director, says unions want a stake in thinktanks as they are increasingly influential in shaping party policy.</p> <p>\"Labour in the recent past has relied more on ideas that come from the <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/\" title=\"\">Institute for Public Policy Research</a>, <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Demos</a> and more recently some work from <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Compass</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation</a> \u2013 a whole number of them. Now we're trying to shift the terms of the debate somewhat to the left. We are assisting in the development of a thinktank that is around more progressive ideas that will have an impact as well.\"</p> <p>He said the thinktank would publish its funding and sponsors online and be \"completely open and transparent\".</p> <p>Hart added: \"When there are ideas that come out of the thinktank that seem really important to the union, we will attempt to popularise them. We've got 1.5 million members in Unite.</p> <p>\"If we get ideas out and we start talking about them \u2026 we can actually generate quite a momentum behind the understanding around those areas.\"</p> <p>As Labour's biggest donor, how will Unite respond if the party doesn't take ideas on board? Hart said unions continued giving to the party though Labour failed to repeal anti-trade union laws during 13 years in power. \"We think the best ideas we come up with will become the new common sense and we will win,\" said Hart.</p> <p>Robert Philpot, Progress director, welcomed the arrival of Class: \"I hope we will be able to build a similar kind of co-operative relationship as we have with IPPR and the Fabians. We are all in the Labour party together and we all want to see Ed Miliband elected in 2015.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>After years of heatwaves, bush fires and heavy rain, Australia's wine industry is about to benefit from the best growing conditions for grapes in two decades, experts say.</p> <p>James Halliday, one of the country's top wine writers, says the weather has been \"nigh-on perfect\" in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia and will produce wines with exceptional colour and quality.</p> <p>\"This year you haven't had to do much to the grapes because of the amount of natural flavour in them,\" he said. \"The moment they started fermenting, the colours were there. They will undoubtedly have an expression which will be almost luminous in the way it communicates itself.\"</p> <p>Consistent weather, with fewer periods of extreme heat, has made a difference. \"You'd really have to go back to 1992 or 1988 where I am in the Yarra Valley [in Victoria] to match such perfect growing conditions,\" said Halliday, author of the Australian Wine Companion.</p> <p>In the Adelaide Hills region of South Australia, Michael Hill Smith of Shaw And Smith wines says offerings are of consistently very good quality across the board. \"Winemakers across South Australia, even in the warmer areas like McLaren Vale and the Barossa Valley, are saying the quality they've got out of 2012 is exceptional,\" said Hill Smith, whose vineyard produces cool-climate shiraz and pinot noir as well as sauvignon blanc and chardonnay.</p> <p>\"Good wines will not be limited to one or two varieties and people will see wines with great balance and harmony that are not dominated by elevated alcohol or almost over ripeness,\" he said.</p> <p>It is welcome news for Australian winemakers, who have been hit by the strong Australian dollar (which has doubled in strength against both the US dollar and sterling during the past decade) and the global financial crisis. Cheaper, entry-level Australian wines, which dominated the market for so long, had been hardest hit.</p> <p>\"In some of our more established markets like the UK and US, it was almost the perfect storm with a really steep growth in exchange rates, the financial crisis and our [low price] categories losing favour with some of the commentators around the world,\" said James Gosper, general manager of market development for industry body Wine Australia. \"The downturn made winemakers realise that in the long term we need to be trading at higher price points.\"</p> <p>The strategy of Wine Australia to support higher-priced wines seems to be paying dividends. While sales by volume in UK supermarkets have fallen by 10% over the past year (reflecting a decline at the low end of the market) the average price of Australian wine consumed increased by 6%. Sales of wine over \u00a37 a bottle grew by 26%.</p> <p>Australia remains the largest exporter of wine to the UK. The shift to promote more expensive wines should also work well in the lucrative Chinese market, where there has been strong growth in higher-priced wines. Australia ranks second to France as the biggest wine exporter to China.</p> <p>Halliday said that while cheaper priced wines such as Yellow Tail will would continue to sell in big numbers, they would \"increasingly become the exception\".</p>",
  "<p>As we learn more about shared value and its implications for different sectors, a frequently asked question is around what it means for investors. Writing in the <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2011/01/the-big-idea-creating-shared-value/\" title=\"\">Harvard Business Review</a>, Michael Porter and Mark Kramer argue that shared value will \"drive the next wave of innovation and productivity growth in the global economy.\" Put this way, it is clear that an understanding of one of the key drivers of growth is of utmost importance to investors. </p> <p>The idea that a company's relationship to society should matter to investors is not new. The field of socially responsible investing (SRI) has been around for more than two decades and has progressively gained attention and assets under management (AUM). Recently released by the Calvert Trust, <a href=\"http://gatewaystoimpact.org/images/gatewaystoimpact.pdf\" title=\"\">The Gateways to Impact</a> report finds that US financial advisors would be willing to place $650bn, or 2.5% of total AUM, in SRI funds. Recent studies such as PWC's <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/us/en/corporate-sustainability-climate-change/publications/investors-and-sustainability.jhtml\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Do investors care about sustainability?</a> have gone beyond this to highlight an explicit link between business results and concepts like corporate responsibility, sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics.</p> <p>However, this effort has not broken through from the world of SRI to the mainstream investment environment. This is because the typical indicators used, while relevant for investors applying social and environmental screens to their investments, are not that helpful for picking financial winners.</p> <p>As PWC's report points out, \"most businesses have struggled with how to measure and track the impact of their sustainability activities on core business metrics\u2026 corporate efforts are not communicated in terms that can be built into investor valuation models and ultimately rewarded by the market.\"</p> <p>Mainstream investors don't have time for analytical contortions that try to demonstrate a correlation between profitability and social and environmental metrics. Instead, asset managers need to take decisions on hard facts: value creation opportunities linked to top line growth, profitability, cash flow generation and long-term competitive advantage.</p> <p>The good news is that factoring shared value into valuations is a straightforward process. Investors simply need to ask companies the <a href=\"http://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/about_us/research/ubs_ib/qseriesoverview.html\" title=\"\">right questions</a>. While these might vary by company or industry, the four below offer a good starting point:</p> <p>1. Where will future revenue growth come from? Namely geographies, demographic groups, etc.</p> <p>2. How will (new) products and services reach these (new) markets?</p> <p>3. How will access to and efficiency of resources (raw materials, employee talent, etc.) be guaranteed?</p> <p>4. How stable are supply chain operations across different geographies?</p> <p>In the pharmaceutical industry, <a href=\"http://www.gsk.com/research/developing-world/index.htm\" title=\"\">for a company such as GlaxoSmithKline</a>, the answer to the first question on revenue growth lies in a tailored shared value strategy around treating diseases in developing and emerging markets. The corresponding hard data for investors would quantify top-line growth potential and market share increases.</p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/careers/insideunilever/oursuccessandchallenges/shaktiprogrammeindia/\" title=\"\">Unilever</a> as a consumer goods company, the answer to the market access question is a shared value strategy around building demand awareness and distribution channels in markets that are difficult to reach, and the corresponding hard data for investors would again quantify top-line growth potential and the value of new market creation.</p> <p>For a manufacturing company like <a href=\"http://www.alcoa.com/recycling/en/info_page/home.asp\" title=\"\">Alcoa</a>, the answer to the resource question is a shared value strategy around ensuring the quality and efficient use of natural resources, and the corresponding hard data for investors would quantify cost savings potential, as well as the value of long-term access to resources that drive competitive advantage.</p> <p>Finally, for a food company like <a href=\"http://www.nestle.com/csv/ruraldevelopment/Pages/Ruraldevelopment.aspx\" title=\"\">Nestl\u00e9</a>, the answer to the question concerning the operating context is a shared value strategy based on increasing the productivity of smallholder farmers, while the corresponding hard data for investors would quantify risk reduction and the value of developing the supply base required to meet top-line and margin growth ambitions.</p> <p>Of course, shared value creation will never be front-of-mind for all types of investors. High velocity traders who look for arbitrage opportunities or news flow-driven market moves will continue to be less uninterested in shared value than other business fundamentals. But, by asking targeted questions about shared value, the mainstream investor community will be able to put the relationship between business and society where it belongs at the heart of their valuation models and investment strategies.</p> <p><em>Valerie Bockstette is a director at </em><a href=\"http://www.fsg.org/\" title=\"\"><em>FSG</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Robin van Persie is a \"fantastic player\" and suggested he may now have the best strikeforce in Europe. He compared his options to those of Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who spearheaded the 1999 treble-winning team.</p> <p>The Manchester United manager is confident that Van Persie will be available to make his club debut against Everton on Monday night, with the player having been driven from London to a local hospital to complete his medical on Thursday.</p> <p>After being informed that Bwin, the club's new gambling partner, was offering 3-1 against Van Persie and Wayne Rooney emulating Yorke and Cole's 53-goal count from that season, Ferguson said: \"Of course they are two fantastic players, and it's great to have the both of them. But also I think what gives us more strength is the combinations I have up front now. If you go back to the '99 season when I had Andy and Dwight and Teddy and Ole Gunnar \u2013 the four best strikers in Europe. So I think I'm going towards that now.</p> <p>\"I've got Chicarito [Javier Hern\u00e1ndez], Wayne, Robin, Danny Welbeck and I've got [Shinji] Kagawa. That's a fantastic combination of players there. Hopefully I pick the right combinations. It's great to have a player of Van Persie's quality to come into the squad as it is. I'm really pleased.\"</p> <p>United announced on Wednesday night that they had agreed a fee with Arsenal for the Holland striker, subject to him settling personal terms and passing a medical.</p> <p>Ferguson said: \"He is on his way up from London for a medical later this afternoon. We hope that goes according to plan. His agent is in discussions with [United chief executive] David Gill right about now.</p> <p>\"We hope all the things will be tied up, although sometimes medicals do take a bit longer. I am sure he will be available for Monday's game.\"</p> <p>Ferguson was at Old Trafford for the launch of the new deal with Bwin, alongside Rio Ferdinand, who said of Van Persie: \"There's been many a player that's come to Manchester United and not met expectations. Expectations here are higher than anywhere else in the world \u2013 some do brilliantly and some don't fare quite so well.</p> <p>\"I've got no worries about Robin, though. He's a very good professional and that will only work in his favour at this club. I know his main aim won't be a selfish one \u2013 it will be all about winning trophies. And if he can score goals like he did last year then we'll all be smiling come the end of the season.</p> <p>\"The manager has always said to me that the transfer window isn't always about who you bring in but it's as much about shaking up the changing room. And I think that's definitely something that's going to happen this time. We're bringing a big name into an environment that already has a lot of big names, especially in the forward department, so it's definitely going to shake things up. But it's going to be great for the squad.\"</p> <p>Danny Welbeck, whose place in the United starting XI is directly under threat following Van Persie's arrival, believes the Dutchman can help win the title back. United lost the championship to Manchester City on the season's final day and Welbeck believes there will now be \"goals galore\" for the club.</p> <p>He said: \"Once you're at United you just have to try to impress and do the best you can. It's going to be shared out and hopefully it's goals galore for Manchester United. He's a player with great ability and a world-class striker. He can score goals and create as well. They're the type of players who do win you titles. It's given the club a massive boost, everyone is delighted to having him. I'm really looking forward to playing with him.\"</p> <p>City were also interested in signing Van Persie, though Welbeck would not be drawn on how serious a statement his arrival is to their crosstown rivals.</p> <p>He said: \"United are always going to be serious about winning Premier Leagues. I'm sure there were plenty of other teams after him as well as City, that maybe couldn't have got him. But hopefully United will sign him and that's the main thing.\"</p> <p>Regarding the competition Van Persie brings Welbeck said: \"Yeah definitely, it's always good to have competition \u2013 you never sit back. It's going to be a good challenge to have. Once the season gets under way the manager will be good with squad rotation. But it's a good problem for the manager to have. He's got a good variety of strikers to use in different games, with there being European games as well. With the strikers we've got at the club it's a good problem for the manager to have.</p> <p>\"Being at United you learn to play with different types of strikers and players. Once we get training together I think everyone will be gelling perfectly. Hopefully the manager picks the right team for each game and we can win as many titles as possible.\"</p> <p>As the club look to recover from the shock of losing their title to Manchester City last season, Ferdinand is conscious there is work to do. \"Last season was disappointing for us because we didn't win the league,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Now it is about how we come back. We have shown in the past the mentality of the club and its history is that we always come back stronger.</p> <p>\"We want to give the fans what they expect and be battling at the top of the league. The gauntlet has been thrown down time and time again. It is up to us to pull in the right direction. We have to step up to the plate and produce. I am sure we will.\"</p>",

I phoned three universities, and while I knew I had missed the grade requirements for both my firm and insurance choices, my insurance choice hadn't released me. Initially, I didn't know that this meant other universities couldn't view my application, so I was met with further rejection when I called universities, which was really disheartening. When I eventually got through to the School of Languages and Social Sciences at Aston, the lady guided me through how to get released and then go through Clearing properly. The whole process took a lot longer than I had expected. It was definitely a test of my determination and self-belief.</p> <p>\"But university so far has been one of the best experiences of my life. My course has been exciting and challenging, and looking back, as terrifying as Clearing was, it was worth every second for all that I've learned over the past three years.</p> <p>My tip is to do your research as early as possible. Look at what courses are available, and the entry requirements, and look at university websites to find out more about them.

My two first-choice universities could not offer me a place, but I contacted others to see if there was any chance of starting that September, rather than re-sitting my exams. The engineering admissions tutor at Hull sent me a maths paper for me to sit under controlled conditions at school. I did, and was accepted.</p> <p>\"I'd never been to Hull prior to freshers' week and so did not know what to expect. But that meant I had no preconceptions. The engineering department staff were very approachable, and I got involved in lots of extra-curricular activities including Formula Student, an international competition where teams of uni students compete to design, test and build a racing car.

  "<p>There have been many writers who have claimed that history can be, or should be, scientific. Different things are meant by this, of course, and such statements are provoked by different motivations, although generally they trade on the perceived successes, rewards, professionalism and certainty of the sciences.</p> <p>There have, historically, been two opposing trends in \"scientific history\". In one case the claim is that patterns and laws can be found if the historic record is studied in the right way. The ideal model has variously been Newtonian physics, statistics or mathematics. In the other, the \"scientific\" element is careful observation and recording, in the manner of natural history. These approaches produce radically different histories, and can underlie very different attitudes to, for example, the importance of individual agency.</p> <p>Looking for broad patterns, or for the detailed \"facts\" among the archival or tangible remains of history, are natural impulses, found throughout humanity's attempts to understand or make use of the past. The claim of being \"scientific\" is a more recent phenomenon, dating from the cultural success of science in the 19th century.</p> <p>I have written a couple of posts on my former blog relating to these 19th century debates, <a href=\"http://teleskopos.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/scientific-histories/\">including in a review</a> of Ian Hesketh's book <a href=\"http://www.pickeringchatto.com/monographs/science_of_history_in_victorian_britain_the\">The Science of History in Victorian Britain</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Buckle\">Henry Buckle</a> is, here, the example of broad-sweep pattern-finding, while <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robert_Seeley\">JR Seeley</a> and the new breed of professional academic historians looked for legitimacy by focusing on detailed examination of primary sources.</p> <p>I do not believe that history can predict the future (although I certainly think that important lessons can be learned) but, as Hesketh suggested to me on Twitter, some sort of proof of patterns would seem to be suggested by the regular revival of such approaches.</p> <p>The latest comes from Peter Turchin of the University of Connecticut, who coined the term \"cliodynamics\" in 2003 and was <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/human-cycles-history-as-science-1.11078\">recently interviewed for Nature</a>. The approach, which uses mathematical modelling to analyse interactions between and long-term trends in social and demographic systems, has a number of advocates and there has even been <a href=\"http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics\">a journal since the end of 2010</a>.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliodynamics\">Wikipedia article on cliodynamics</a> suggests, its practitioners attempt \"to explain 'big history' \u2013 things like the rise of empires, social discontent, civil wars, and state collapse\". Things, therefore, that capture the popular imagination, that might just convince those in power that this is useful knowledge and \u2013 significantly \u2013 things that academic historians, focused on primary sources and \"micro-histories\", have perhaps tended to neglect.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.historytoday.com/blog/2012/08/can-science-explain-history \">post on the History Today blog</a> by Paul Lay suggests it is a kind of pseudoscience, adding, \"Given the way in which mathematical modelling, using past data to predict future trends, has brought the global economy to its knees, this may not be the best time to introduce such methods to the more pragmatic discipline of history.\" </p> <p>Further doubts are voiced at Scientific American blogs, with Maria Konnikova's post, <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2012/08/10/humanities-arent-a-science-stop-treating-them-like-one/\">\"The humanities aren't a science: stop treating them like one\"</a>.</p> <p>I will admit that I have not read Turchin's detailed work, or the other papers in the journal, and so my comments are based on the Nature interview and <a href=\"http://www.sott.net/articles/show/161508-Transforming-history-into-science-Arise-cliodynamics\">a 2008 article</a> he wrote, again in Nature. His opening gambit here would do little to endear him to historians:</p> <blockquote> <p>What caused the collapse of the Roman Empire? More than 200 explanations have been proposed, but there is no consensus about which explanations are plausible and which should be rejected. This situation is as risible as if, in physics, phlogiston theory and thermodynamics coexisted on equal terms.</p> </blockquote> <p>The recent interview notes that academic historians are deeply sceptical about cliodynamics. This is not (just) a knee-jerk defence against interlopers from the sciences claiming that they know better than those who have trained long and hard in the ways of more standard approaches to history. There are many historians today who understand that other disciplines can offer us a number of useful tools. But their experience and training also helps them to understand that historical data is a complex business.</p> <p>Turchin writes that his analysis is based on his collections of \"quantitative data on demographic, social and political variables for several historical societies\", but, strikingly, gives no indication here of what his sources might be. The interview states that he and colleagues drew \"on all the sources they can find \u2013 historical databases, newspaper archives, ethnographic studies\", and, from these, somehow locate factors such as \"indicators of corruption \u2026 and political cooperation\".</p> <p>Just how, I wonder, do they do that, across several cultures and vast stretches of time, with any degree of confidence? The detailed studies of historians have amply demonstrated that information contained in their sources cannot be taken on trust or treated equally. We need to have detailed understanding of the terminology of the period, their methods of collecting information, their political interests in sharing (or hiding) it and a sense of who was writing, who reading and why.</p> <p>Turchin's interpretation of his results is also pretty strange. He claims that his work has revealed regular 50-year cycles of political violence in the United States: that it was \"almost absent in the early 19th century, increased from the 1830s and reached a peak in around 1900. The American Civil War occurred during this period of growing unrest. The instability then subsided during the 1930s, and the following two decades were remarkably calm. Finally, in the 1960s, political violence increased again.\" </p> <p>One has to wonder just what \"political\" and \"violence\" mean here, let alone \"50-year cycle\". And, just because the Civil War was within the country, why is it counted and the 1812 and Second World Wars ignored?</p> <p>Treating data like this and pulling out results like these seems to do neither science nor history any favours.</p>",
  "<p>My husband Gerry Vaughan, who has died of prostate cancer aged 77, was an 11-plus failure who went on to work as painter, teacher, lecturer and education adviser for Derbyshire county council.</p> <p>Born in Gravesend, Kent, he went to the town's Gordon school for boys, where his artistic talent was nurtured initially, and then from the age of 14 to Gravesend School of Art. After national service, he was accepted into the painting school at the Royal College of Art. He left in 1959, having been awarded the RCA life-painting prize.</p> <p>His idealism and belief in education initially inspired him to teach, and he joined the staff at Gordano school in Portishead, Somerset. Two years later, in 1961, he went to Chesterfield College of Art as lecturer in fine art. He was appointed as teacher adviser for art by Derbyshire county council in 1969 and remained in the post until 1985. During those years he was responsible for much of the art education in Derbyshire. He was an early member of the Art Advisers Association and worked closely with colleagues from other counties and areas.</p> <p>We moved to Wirksworth, Derbyshire, in 1963, where local concern for a very run-down, neglected small town caused Gerry to become a founder-member of Wirksworth Civic Society in 1969. When the Wirksworth Project to regenerate the town was established in the late 70s, Gerry's interest in the built environment came into its own. He was charged with liaison with the local schools and encouraged them to be fully involved with the project. He ran courses for teachers and children, organised a study of art in the built environment and staged major exhibitions of the young people's work. The project was widely reported in the national press and had a worldwide influence on regeneration.</p> <p>His early retirement, as a result of illness, enabled Gerry to take up his own painting once more. His sense of colour, able draughtsmanship and love of water \u2013 especially the Thames estuary and the Greek islands \u2013 resulted in a body of work that earned considerable respect. He exhibited in various venues in the UK and Greece. He supported the <a href=\"http://www.wirksworthfestival.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wirksworth festival </a>from its inception, both exhibiting and participating in the selection panel from time to time.</p> <p>Gerry was painting until the end, through sleepless nights and long days, his work still full of vibrancy and colour.</p> <p>He is survived by me, our children Simon, Jane and David, and seven grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>It felt like the perfect send-off for man and boat. On a bright, breezy day (10 knots of wind to be precise), the world's most decorated Olympic sailor, Ben Ainslie, and his faithful dinghy, Rita, made a final appearance together.</p> <p>Crowds gathered on Westminster Bridge in central London, some wearing souvenir Ainslie knee-high socks \u2013 one red, one green \u2013 as the four-time gold medallist sailed along the Thames in front of the Houses of Parliament.</p> <p>Ainslie is off to California where this weekend he will take charge of a very different kind of sailing boat, a super-fast catamaran with a five-person crew, as he begins the long and arduous task of trying to win the <a href=\"http://www.americascup.com/\" title=\"\">America's Cup</a> for Britain.</p> <p>Rita, meanwhile, will be put on a trailer and carted down to the <a href=\"http://www.nmmc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Maritime Museum</a> in Cornwall, where Ainslie learned to sail, to be exhibited alongside other mementoes of the UK's seafaring glories.</p> <p>Back on shore, Ainslie declared the conditions were perfect. \"Normally on the river you don't get that much wind. We were really lucky. It was a good breeze and it blew in the right direction.\"</p> <p>He was pleased that people had turned out to watch, wave flags and shout out their good wishes. \"It was cool, it was a lot of fun to get out there,\" he said. \"It was really nice to see some people up there cheering away. It's been a good feeling through the whole Games. I guess people are still on a high.\"</p> <p>It has been a spectacular summer for Ainslie. He was chosen as the first bearer of the Olympic torch when it touched down in Cornwall and carried the flag for Team GB during the closing ceremony. In between he made history by winning that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/london-2012-ben-ainslie-fourth-gold\" title=\"\">fourth gold medal</a>.</p> <p>\"It couldn't have gone any better, it's been an amazing experience for me,\" he said.</p> <p>Ainslie has not given up the idea of competing at the 2016 Olympics in Rio but it will almost certainly not be in the Finn dinghy class. Rita and her ilk are heavy boats and 35-year-old Ainslie has a bad back. \"It's really unlikely I'd go for the Finn physically. I don't think my body can go through that again.\"</p> <p>Ainslie, who was looking a little tired, admitted he was \"pretty knackered\" and his back was \"not great\". Still, on Friday he will board a plane to San Francisco and be in a boat as early as Saturday to prepare for the America's Cup World Series.</p> <p>The series is a sort of testing ground for sailors with ambitions of competing for the America's Cup proper, seen by Ainslie as the pinnacle of big-boat sailing, and one of the most competitive \u2013 and expensive \u2013 of all sporting contests. As such, Thursday's appearance of \"Big Ben\" sailing past the landmark Big Ben was also aimed at drawing attention to a sponsorship deal between the Ben Ainslie Racing team and JP Morgan for the series.</p> <p>Admitting he cannot sit back and enjoy his success but must always seek a fresh challenge, Ainslie said he was looking forward to being part of a crew. \"It's much more rewarding being successful in a team. You've got someone to share it with.\"</p> <p>This is not to say he is not sad to wave goodbye to the boat in which he has sailed for the past three Olympic Games. \"That could be the last time,\" he said, \"but I can't think of a better venue for that last sail.\"</p>",

  "<p>If the crowd's ecstatic reaction to the Queen's cameo alongside James Bond at the Olympics opening ceremony is anything to go by, the latest blockbuster featuring the fictitious spy will be a smash hit. Or, at least Cineworld hopes so.</p> <p>The UK's biggest cinema chain, with 79 across the country, is pinning its hopes on the latest 007 instalment due out later this year as the company reported a 21.5% jump in half-year operating profits to \u00a315.8m from \u00a313m.</p> <p>Box office admissions were down 0.8% in the six months to end of June, but revenues were up slightly to \u00a3165.4m from \u00a3163.6m thanks to an increase in ticket prices by 5% to an average of \u00a35.15.</p> <p>However, sales in popcorn and other snacks were down, with the average spend per customer dropping 2% to \u00a31.65.</p> <p>The profit boost has come courtesy of a strong roster of films including the Amazing Spiderman, Ice Age 4 and the final Batman instalment The Dark Knight Rises, while upcoming movies including The Hobbit, the third Twilight film and James Bond's Skyfall, are expected to maintain strong revenues, the company said.</p> <p>Cineworld chief executive Stephen Wiener said: \"The timing of these releases means that trade is expected to be strongest in the last two months of the year.\"</p> <p>Box office revenues were spread across a number of films in the first-half, with the top 10 highest grossing films accounting for roughly 40% of Cineworld's total box office, while 3D films accounted for 15% of admissions, down from 17% in 2011 due to fewer 3D releases.</p> <p>Wayne Brown, analyst at Cannacord Genuity, said:</p> <blockquote> These results are encouraging, as the first half of the year was up against tough comparatives and set against a period containing global sporting events and a weaker film slate when compared to last year. </blockquote> <p>Shares are up 7.3p, 3.2%, at 230.5p.</p>",

For people like Omar, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/aug/16/somali-refugee-sweden-video\" title=\"\">the Somali refugee featured in Rain is Beautiful</a>, a new government in Mogadishu is unlikely to mean much as most of the country will continue to be plagued by insecurity long after the government has assumed power.</p> <p>Many of the estimated 5,000 people living in Tunisia's Choucha refugee camp and Egypt's Saloum camp are, like Omar, refugees two times over. Having fled persecution in their country of origin \u2013 be it Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia or Sudan, to name a few \u2013 they travelled to Libya to find a safe haven and means to support themselves and the families they left behind.</p> <p>As the government of Muammar Gaddafi fell, many migrants became victims of xenophobic attacks, and again sought refuge in these makeshift camps. Despite new authorities in Libya, their problems have not ended; the Choucha camp remains insecure, and violence involving local residents, refugees, and security forces has occurred. In May 2011, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/25/libya-refugees-gaddafi-regime-attacked\" title=\"\">a large part of the camp burned to the ground</a>.</p> <p>With no possibility of making a life in Libya, returning safely to their home country, or settling in Tunisia or Egypt, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/16/campaign-refugee-resettlement-europe\" title=\"\">the refugees look to Europe for safe haven</a>. But most European countries are not interested in taking them in. After <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/02/refugees-feared-drowned-tunisian-coast\" title=\"\">risking their lives</a> by boarding small boats to sail towards Europe, many end up in Malta, where they are held in detention; a Human Rights Watch report last month called on Malta to review its \"<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/malta0712ForUpload.pdf\" title=\"\">arbitrary detention policy</a>\". Similarly, Greece last week rounded up more than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/07/greece-crackdown-illegal-immigrants-arrest\" title=\"\">7,000 foreigners presumed to be illegal migrants</a>.</p> <p>These countries are among the most common entry points for refugees and economic migrants (many people are both), and justify their actions by pointing to the disproportionate burden they bear compared with countries in northern Europe that \u2013 because of their geography and the sophistication of their border control bureaucracies \u2013 are harder for asylum seekers and migrants to reach.</p> <p>EU legislation known as the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33153_en.htm\" title=\"\">Dublin II regulation</a> stipulates that asylum applications must be processed in the first country where an individual arrives. This provides a justification for other European countries to refuse to engage in burden sharing. There is little political will within the EU to revisit this regulation, despite evidence that it encourages unfair treatment of asylum seekers and other migrants in these entry-point countries.</p> <p>UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has called on European countries to resettle 2,000 of the total caseload of 5,000 refugees in Tunisia and Egypt (the US has agreed to accept 3,000). Fewer than 900 places have been offered by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. The UK has not offered to accept any of the refugees, despite the active role it played in supporting regime change in Libya.</p> <p>There is little public support for opening doors to those who have been further displaced as a result of the Arab spring. The dismal state of the EU economy has helped to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment, based on the widespread belief that social services will be unduly stretched and jobs taken from unemployed nationals. In addition, many feel that human rights obligations, which EU countries are legally required to uphold, are overgenerous.</p> <p>\"Double-refugees\" and migrants-turned-refugees in Tunisia are among those who have suffered most from the Arab spring. What has emerged in Tunisia and Egypt is a protection vacuum, with the large numbers of refugees trapped in camps likely to remain there indefinitely.</p> <p>Without options for <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/refugees-and-migrants/resettlement\" title=\"\">safe resettlement</a>, more people will defy the grim odds and try to enter Europe illegally by sea. Many will perish on the journey; at least 1,500 died this way last year. Those who succeed in reaching a safe shore may find themselves locked up for months or years before being accepted somewhere or deported. European governments and the EU can and should do more to help the inadvertent victims of the Arab spring, expanding resettlement for Somalis and other double refugees, and offering them the security that many have lacked for years.</p>",
  "<p>The runaway success of Avengers Assemble helped Cineworld almost double pre-tax profits to \u00a313.4m in the first half of 2012, despite an almost 12% year-on-year fall in cinema advertising.</p> <p>Cineworld, the UK's second largest cinema chain behind Guy Hands's Odeon/UCI, said that total revenues grew slightly, up 1.1% year-on-year to \u00a3165.4m.</p> <p>Box office revenues grew 3.5% to \u00a3118.6m \u2013 slightly below the total cinema market increase of 4.3% \u2013 led by the Avengers film, which grossed more than \u00a351m nationally.</p> <p>Other films that performed well included Men in Black 3, The Hunger Games and Ridley Scott's Prometheus.</p> <p>Admission numbers dropped by 0.8% year-on-year to 23 million, probably due in part to Euro 2012, however box office revenues rose thanks to an increase of 4.9% on average ticket prices.</p> <p>The black spot in otherwise solid results was the performance of cinema advertising, which fell 11.7% year-on-year in the first six months.</p> <p>\"In addition to the inevitable pull of advertising towards the European football championships and the London Olympics, companies continue to defer their advertising spends and divert expenditure more towards ad hoc sales promotions and the internet, both of which are considered short term means to grow sales in a consumer environment where demand remains fragile,\" said Stephen Wiener, chief executive of Cineworld Group.</p> <p>Screen advertising is classified as part of \"other revenue\" by Cineworld \u2013 a category that includes sponsorships, screen hire, games machine income and sales of 3D glasses \u2013 which fell by 19.3% year-on-year to \u00a38.8m.</p> <p>Retail revenue, from selling drinks and snacks to cinema-goers, fell 2.1% to \u00a338m as belt-tightening consumers cut back on spending.</p> <p>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, a key metric of underlying profitability keenly watched by investors, grew 2.3% to \u00a326.3m.</p> <p>\"Our results show that cinema is a resilient investment in challenging economic times,\" said Wiener. \"The current trading performance, together with a reduction in net debt, means that the Cineworld Group remains in a sound financial position to fund continued growth\".</p> <p>The interim dividend per share of 3.8p was up 5.6% year-on-year. Net debt fell slightly to \u00a399.2m at the end of June.</p> <p>The company said the shaky performance of 3D films looks to be stabilising, with 15 releases in the first half of this year.</p> <p>\"Film studios are becoming increasingly adept in discerning the genre and target audience of 3D films,\" said Wiener. \"The quality of 3D film product remains absolutely critical.\"</p> <p>The company said that it has seen a 48% year-on-year increase in registrations to its MyCineworld portal to almost 1.5 million in the three month period from March when it scrapped online booking fees.</p> <p>Cineworld said that films premiering in the run up to the London Olympic Games, including The Amazing Spiderman and The Dark Knight Rises, have performed as expected.</p> <p>The final three months of 2012 is expected to be strong for ticket sales, with major titles including James Bond's Skyfall, the final part of the Twighlight franchise and the first instalment of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit due for release.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>US presidential election campaigns are usually noteworthy for the dirt that candidates throw at each other, and <a href=\"http://www.scottishreview.net/AlanFisher8.shtml\">the latest one is running true to form.</a></p> <p>But how do reporters who are doing their level best to tell their readers the truth cope when candidates move from spouting (just about acceptable) spin to telling (unacceptable) lies?</p> <p>These problems are raised in a short piece in the New Republic by Alec MacGillis, <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106197/the-welfare-card-and-the-post-truth-campaign\">The welfare card and the post-truth campaign</a>.</p> <p>He tells of witnessing a campaign appearance in Ohio by Mitt Romney in which the Republican candidate told his audience:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I want you to know I heard something the other day that really surprised me... What I heard is that the president is taking the work requirement out of welfare. (Boos.) Yeah. We value work, our society which celebrates hard work, we look to a government to make it easier for jobs to be created and people to go to work. </p> <p>We do not look for a government that tries to find ways to provide for people who are not willing to work. And so I'm gonna put work back into welfare and make sure able-bodied people can get jobs.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Canvassing the crowd afterwards, MacGillis learned that Romney's anti-Obama welfare jibe was the favourite part of his address. He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"One of the more depressing parts of the job of being a political reporter is watching an audience fully absorb a blatant and knowing lie. Which is, of course, what this is. Countless fact-checkers... have unequivocally rejected the assertion that Obama has ended the work requirement. </p> <p>His administration has instead granted more leeway to states, including several with Republican governors, to explore new ways to get people on to welfare into jobs.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As MacGillis notes, the welfare debate has been subject to rigorous fact-checking, and he cites <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/spin-and-counterspin-in-the-welfare-debate/2012/08/07/61bf03b6-e0e3-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_blog.html\">a Washington Post example</a> to prove his point. Yet Romney, his running mate Paul Ryan and Republican TV ads go on repeating the \"utterly unfounded\" attack on Obama's policy.</p> <p>Worse. Despite the fact-checking process that is supposed to inform its journalism, America's press is not confronting Romney about his falsehood. He is being allowed to get away with it.</p> <p>MacGillis's point is taken up <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/what-to-do-with-political-lies/261189/\">by Garance Franke-Ruta at The Atlantic</a>. She writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Fact-checking was a great development in accountability journalism - but perhaps it's time for a new approach. It's no longer enough to outsource the fact-checking to the fact-checkers in a news environment where every story lives an independent life on the social web, and there's no guarantee the reader of any given report will ever see a bundled version of the news or the relevant fact-checking column, which could have been published months earlier. One-off fact-checking is no match for the repeated lie.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>She puts her finger on the real problem. Repeated lies. This is a familiar device employed by politicians (and British popular newspaper editors), and it is always difficult to counter.</p> <p>And there have been plenty of examples in the States. Franke-Ruta mentions one: Obama is a Muslim. And don't let's forget the crucial one about Saddam Husein being behind the 9/11 massacre.</p> <p>She advocates the insertion of key sentences, or even paragraphs, in every story in which the lie is retailed. On the other hand, she appears to concede that this may not change the minds of the majority.</p> <p>The problem is more acute in Britain because our newspapers do not have the kind of fact-checking common in the US press. Our papers are also unashamedly partisan, even advocating that \"freedom\" as a virtue.</p> <p>Then again, we do have plurality and diversity - for the moment at least - in our mainstream media. We check up on each other. There are also many credible online and social media critics. </p> <p>But lies still beat us. After all, we made war on Iraq because too many newspapers happily accepted the political lie that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was able to launch them within 45 minutes. </p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"http://www.scottishreview.net/AlanFisher8.shtml\">Scottish Review</a>/<a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106197/the-welfare-card-and-the-post-truth-campaign\">The New Republic</a>/<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/spin-and-counterspin-in-the-welfare-debate/2012/08/07/61bf03b6-e0e3-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_blog.html\">Washington Post</a>/<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/what-to-do-with-political-lies/261189/\">The Atlantic</a></p>",
  "<p>The Guardian's hugely popular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/ipad/eyewitness\">Eyewitness photography app for iPad</a> has re-launched with more visual content than ever before.</p> <p>For over two years the app has showcased one of the world's most distinctive and provocative photographs per day, to provide a visual reflection of global events. The printed Guardian Eyewitness series was revolutionary when it was introduced in full colour across the centre spread of the newspaper in 2005, and has proved just as popular on the iPad.</p> <p>The Guardian Eyewitness app <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/ipad-guardian-eyewitness-photography-app-launched\">launched to great acclaim in April 2010</a> as one of the first apps available on the original iPad, and has since featured in the Design Museum's Designs of the Year exhibition in London in 2011. Now, as downloads of the app approach one million, users will be offered dozens of extra images each month through a new 'Eyewitness Premium' in-app subscription service, which costs \u00a31.49 a month (or local currency equivalent).</p> <p>Eyewitness Premium provides subscribers with Eyewitness Extra - three additional pictures per day selected especially for the app by the Guardian's award-winning picture desk. In addition to this, a subscription includes access to the new 'Eyewitness Series' collections, which present a single standout picture each day during major world events. The app will come pre-loaded with an Olympics collection, and a new collection will begin later this month with the London 2012 Paralympics.</p> <p>Non-subscribers can still view, favourite and share the original Eyewitness image of the day, free of charge, as well as an archive of the most recent 100 Eyewitness images. Each image is also accompanied by a \"pro tip\", to give professional insights into the composition or technical specification of a particular image.</p> <p>Roger Tooth, the Guardian's Head of Photography, said: \"We've been blown away by the global appeal of the Eyewitness app since its inception in 2010, and it's been wonderful to see hundreds of thousands of people around the world engage with the photography we have chosen to feature on the app.</p> <p>\"Today's new features mean that - while users will still be able to enjoy one image per day for free as they always have done - photography fans will now be able to enjoy more great news images from around the world every day.\"</p> <p>The Guardian Eyewitness photography app for iPad is available to download for free from the App Store on iPad or at <a href=\"http://www.itunes.com/apps/theguardianeyewitness\">http://www.itunes.com/apps/theguardianeyewitness</a>.</p> <p>Further information is available at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/ipad/eyewitness\">http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/ipad/eyewitness</a>.</p> <p><strong>-ends-</strong></p> <p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p> <p>Since its launch in April 2010, the Guardian Eyewitness app for iPad has been downloaded 923,941 times.

  "<p>How did nature manage to survive for the past 3bn years, with no landowners and gamekeepers to look after it? That's the question you might ask yourself after reading <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/12/why-claws-are-out-for-royal-society-for-protection-of-birds\" title=\"\">Magnus Linklater's article in the Observer magazine</a>, attacking the RSPB and suggesting that grouse moors, pheasant shoots and \"vermin\" control are necessary to protect the natural world.</p> <p>Linklater maintains that the RSPB \"has incurred the hostility of farmers, landowners and even the rural communities among whom it works\", through the fiendish practice of \"assisting the police in exposing landowners whom it accuses of wildlife crime\". It should spend less time criticising landowners for killing birds of prey and more time \"working with them as partners\". It has needlessly antagonised \"owners of grouse moors and pheasant shoots\". He claimed that the RSPB is obsessed by birds of prey and protects them at the expense of other species.</p> <p>His article contains so many inaccuracies that it's hard to know where to begin. But let me mention just a few.</p> <p>Linklater states that the RSPB's claims about Britain's birds of prey are challenged \"head on\" by \"the latest Breeding Birds survey, compiled by the British Trust for Ornithology, a science-based organisation.\"</p> <p>One slight problem. The <a href=\"http://www.bto.org/volunteer-surveys/bbs\" title=\"\">Breeding Birds survey</a> is jointly funded by the British Trust for Ornithology and, er, the RSPB. Far from challenging the RSPB's assertions, it is in fact their source.</p> <p>He maintains that \"golden eagles are flourishing\". Rubbish again. The official conservation body <a href=\"http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/commissioned_reports/Report%20No193.pdf\" title=\"\">Scottish Natural Heritage reports</a> that the golden eagle population is greatly suppressed. Why?</p> <blockquote> \"A number of lines of evidence indicated that illegal persecution of eagles, principally associated with grouse moor management in the central and eastern Highlands, is the most severe constraint on Scottish golden eagles.\" </blockquote> <p>He claims that on two moors owned by the RSPB \u2013 Lake Vyrnwy in Wales and Geltsdale in Cumberland \u2013 \"curlew, plover and other waders have all been in decline.\" I checked with the RSPB. Not only is his assertion plain wrong, but it turns out that the organisation supplied him, at his request, with the figures for these reserves. These show, for example, that in Geltsdale the number of golden plovers rose by 70% between 2000 and 2010, while curlew numbers doubled.</p> <p>Linklater creates the strong impression that the decline of songbirds in the United Kingdom is caused primarily by birds of prey. How, you might wonder, did they manage to survive and prosper when birds of prey were more abundant? And how could birds of prey consistently exceed their carrying capacity without a collapse in their numbers, leading to an increase in the population of the birds they eat? Has he never encountered the ecological principle that predator numbers are limited by the availability of prey?</p> <p>When I spoke to Linklater, he told me that he has spent a year researching this issue. I can only assume that he has spent a year engaging in confirmation bias: searching for or interpreting new information in a way that confirms one's preconceived opinions.</p> <p>But the biggest problem I have with his article is this: it made no mention of the fact that he has a 4,000-acre estate in Scotland. He is one of three trustees (the other two are his wife and their lawyer) of the Riemore Trust, which owns the Riemore estate near Dunkeld. He tells me that it used to hold grouse, but they have disappeared for reasons unknown. He now runs a pheasant shoot there, and employs a part-time gamekeeper.</p> <p>Should he not have declared this interest when writing a highly contentious article about landowning, farming and gamekeeping, and the alleged persecution by the RSPB of the \"owners of grouse moors and pheasant shoots\"? When I put this to him, he agreed that it might have been a good idea to mention it, but he hadn't thought of doing so.</p> <p>This, to me, touches on a wider problem with journalism. It claims to hold other people to account (it often does so capriciously, concentrating on the sins of the underclass and those who challenge wealth and power, rather than those of the billionaire class for whom most journalists work). But it is itself almost completely unaccountable. Few journalists provide references for their claims, so that readers can judge for themselves whether they are accurately representing the facts. Fewer still show where their own economic interests lie: whether or not, in other words, they are the disinterested commentators they purport to be.</p> <p>A year ago I tried to promote the idea of accountability by <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/registry-of-interests/\" title=\"\">publishing my own registry of interests</a>. Though several journalists have congratulated me on doing so, and one or two have told me it was a \"brave\" thing to do (by which, I assume, they mean stupid), no one \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 has yet copied it. (There are two people who were doing it already, but unfortunately they seldom write for any national papers). The profession to which I belong remains as unaccountable as ever.</p> <p>Magnus Linklater has been in this business for 40 years: he's no naif. But the impression I received when talking to him was that this is the first time anyone has asked. Accountability has no place in the culture of journalism.</p> <p>I would like to see this change. I would like to see editors insisting that journalists publish any relevant interests in or alongside the articles they write. Ideally I would like to see a mandatory register of journalists' interests established, like the mandatory register of MPs' interests. Only then we will know how much weight to give to their opinions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\" title=\"\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/16/petrol-price-war-lifts-uk-retail-sales\" title=\"\">Retail sales in Britain rose 0.3% last month</a> despite poor weather, as petrol price cuts by supermarkets and bargain offers in the high street spurred spending. Here is what economists made of the numbers:</p> <p><strong>Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics</strong></p> <p>Not only did retail sales post a reasonable rise in July, but an upward revision to June's figures added to other evidence suggesting that the preliminary estimate of GDP will be revised up next week.</p> <p>Sales should maintain this positive momentum in the near-term as the boost from the Olympics comes through. Admittedly, the Games had already begun by the end of July and the ONS said feedback from retailers suggested that there had been \"no impact on sales from the Games in this trading period\".</p> <p>But anecdotal evidence suggests that consumers initially steered clear of the high street when the Games began, and then returned to the shops as Team GB's medal count increased.</p> <p>That said, the boost from the Olympics will be short-lived and may be \"paid for\" by lower spending later in the year. Indeed, although some of the more fundamental constraints on consumer spending are now lifting \u2013 most obviously the squeeze on real pay from high inflation \u2013 consumer confidence is still low, debt is still high and the economy is in recession. Accordingly, a sustained, strong pick-up in spending still looks unlikely.</p> <p><strong>Alan Clarke, director of fixed income strategy, global banking and markets at Scotia Bank</strong></p> <p>UK retail sales for July were on the firmer side of expectations. But it was the massive upward revisions to the previous month that was the biggest surprise. The net result is that percentage year-on-year retail sales growth is over a percentage point higher than previously thought \u2013 up around 3% year on year.</p> <p>If you look at the percentage year-on-year trend in retail sales, the trough was last autumn (when inflation peaked at over 5%) and the trend in the growth rate has been sharply upwards since. It's easy to explain why: inflation has slumped, meaning headwinds facing the consumer has abated, and employment has surged. There are 335,000 more people earning money since last January, and with lower inflation they get to keep more of their income to buy discretionary items.</p> <p><strong>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</strong></p> <p>Retail sales made modest but satisfactory progress in July, with the monthly increase higher than expected. The 2.8% annual increase in retail sales volumes supports our belief that some of the pessimism surrounding the recent performance of the UK economy is unwarranted. This figure provides hope that in the third quarter of the year we will see some recovery in economic activity.</p> <p>The further decline in high street inflation is also welcome news. This will support disposable incomes and consumer spending, at a time when austerity and the eurozone crisis continue to put the economy under pressure.</p> <p>Despite the positive job market figures published this week, it is clear economic growth in the UK is still far too weak. The government must do much more to help businesses to grow and create jobs at a time when the public sector continues to shrink.</p> <p>We need to see more measures to boost infrastructure and strengthen the construction sector, alongside forceful deregulation and moves towards the creation of a state-backed business bank. It is also important to ensure that the funding-for-lending scheme is made to work effectively so that credit-worthy businesses are able to grow.</p> <p><strong>Richard Lowe, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays</strong></p> <p>It will be some comfort to retailers that consumers are still spending, albeit more modestly than they would perhaps like. As the sector struggles to find sustained growth at home, more and more businesses are looking to expand overseas. Even smaller retailers are starting to spread their wings internationally with the help of the internet.</p> <p><strong>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit</strong></p> <p>The overall level of retail sales is now the highest ever. Importantly, the strong upward revision to June's figure adds to recent evidence that the economy fared much better at the end of the second quarter than the Office for National Statistics had initially guessed.</p> <p>Both industrial production and construction performed better in June than the ONS had pencilled-in when calculating its first estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product, suggesting GDP fell by 0.5% instead of 0.7%.</p> <p>While the retail sales number is not included in the output measure of GDP, the better than expected sales growth in June adds to the view that the GDP numbers overstate the recent weakness of the economy. With the Queen's jubilee thought to have hit GDP by 0.5%, the UK's underlying health is more like one of flat-lining, and perhaps even very modest growth, rather than recession.</p> <p>Whether the upturn will last remains uncertain. The CBI's monthly distributive trades survey found that retailers had become increasingly pessimistic about August, with the indicator for expected sales dropping steeply from 32% to 3%, its lowest since April.</p> <p>Meanwhile, inflation picked up again in July, which will have continued to squeeze consumer spending power. On the other hand, the labour market has shown a surprisingly strong recovery so far this year, which should help offset some of the income squeeze.</p>",
  "<p>So, the Olympics may be over but Usain Bolt is going to play in the Australian Big Bash League. The world's most charismatic athlete has been sounded out by Shane Warne and will turn out for the Melbourne Stars in the Twenty20 competition.</p> <p>Sure, nothing has been signed and sealed. After all, BBL project manager, Mike McKenna has said he would need assurances the sprinter was being picked on merit and not as a novelty to attract spectators and television viewers.</p> <p>\"We'd be very keen to have someone like Usain Bolt involved in some way in the BBL,\" McKenna said. \"He's very keen on cricket, he's been close to the Australia cricket team and I'd imagine he is pretty quick between the wickets.</p> <p>\"But we would want to make sure that any athletes can play another code to an appropriate level. The competition has gone beyond the novelty factor.\"</p> <p>Bolt responded, telling Australia's Channel Nine: \"If I get the chance I will definitely try because I know it's going to be a lot of fun. I don't know how good I am. I will probably have to get a lot of practice in.\"</p> <p>Given the global publicity that would result, not to mention the rocketing in value of the broadcasting rights, I think we can take it as read that if Bolt is up for it, he'll get a game.</p> <p>And I have to say I'm all for it. If you're running a circus you want people to come and watch, and headline acts are a must. Bolt being the star attraction will confirm the show to be exactly that, a circus, an entertainment without meaning.</p> <p>There's nothing wrong with that but I suspect that's what people like Kevin Pietersen \u2013 who puts the lack of interest in the Indian Premier League in this country down to jealousy over the tournament's appeal \u2013 don't really understand about these sort of competitions.</p> <p>The viewing figures for IPL in the UK have declined because cricket lovers don't have anything invested in the teams. They may tune in to watch Pietersen, or Chris Gayle, biffing a few sixes but they don't really care about the result and in the end that makes all the difference.</p>",
  "<p>No, this is not a manual \u2013 by which I mean that it's not a book that's meant to be read with one hand. Despite its pink wrapper and the cover photograph of a naked young man with a flap-happy wrist, it's a solemn pedagogical production, derived from an undergraduate course taught by <a href=\"http://www.lsa.umich.edu/english/people/profile.asp?ID=254\" title=\"\">Halperin</a>, who is WH Auden distinguished university professor of the theory and history of sexuality at an address somewhere in the American cornbelt. Out there on the dreary plains, Halperin instructs students who could be his grandsons in irony, archness, melodramatic flouncing, the worship of Judy Garland and all the other queeny foibles and fetishes that most of us thought had been discarded when gay men marched out of the closet and asserted their right to respect and acceptance. Imagine Lily Savage conducting an oral exam, or Gok Wan fabulously modelling a mortar board. Bobs, bangs and military buzzcuts probably feature in the curriculum: Halperin has an earnest interpretative interest in \"what a hairstyle is 'about'\".</p> <p>The course, when first offered, created a local scandal, because a state university was expending public money on what Halperin enticingly called \"an experiment in the very process of initiation\". Affronted legislators wondered what kind of homework was required of the inductees. I'm curious myself, since Halperin on one occasion addresses the reader of this book as \"darling\". He relished the outrage of the puritans: he was used to it, having been <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/activities/safe/cases/mit-wolff/wolff-settles-outcourt\" title=\"\">accused of sexual harassment</a> while teaching at MIT in the early 1990s. That charge was dropped, and MIT sent him off on study leave for a couple of years; his next academic appointment, however, was in faraway Australia, where he can't have made many friends if he imperialistically announced, as he does in his book, that \"being gay is like being American\" and presented himself as the proselytising agent of \"total, global queerness\". Now repatriated to the US, he is assiduously milking the fuss about his course, which has enabled him, as he reports with a hoot of triumph, to increase his lecture fee.</p> <p>Halperin's first efforts to profess \"gay male studies\" were half-cocked. He made the mistake of expecting his midwestern students to read books, which bored them; they spent his classes covering the attendance sheet he circulated with doodles of themselves in drag, preening under the hair-dryer in a beauty salon. Revamping the course as \"How to Be Gay\", Halperin eased the strain on their bubbly brains by dispensing with a bibliography and instead prescribing excerpts from a few campy movies. His book devotes literally hundreds of pages to the obsessive analysis of a catfight between Joan Crawford and her bitchy daughter in the film noir <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(film)\" title=\"\"><em>Mildred Pierce</em></a>, with footnotes on Faye Dunaway's maenadic impersonation of Crawford on the rampage with a coat-hanger in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082766/\" title=\"\"><em>Mommie Dearest</em></a><em> </em>and Sofia Coppola \u2013 the distinguished professor, incidentally, misspells her name \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-jp4hk7VIU\" title=\"\">lewdly mimicking both Crawford and Dunaway</a> in a music video for Sonic&#xa0;Youth.</p> <p>The abusive encounter between Crawford and Ann Blyth in <em>Mildred Pierce</em> is, for Halperin, a Freudian primal scene, an authoritative primer from which gay men can learn how to be ersatz women, suffering with grandiloquent flair while rolling their eyes and spitting epigrammatic put-downs at each other. I'm glad that he mostly stays away from literature (which, as he found, gave his students headaches), since he describes Melville's Christ-like Billy Budd as the apotheosis of rough trade, a pick-up whose naval pants obligingly unbutton in the rear, and his only reference to Auden, in whose honour the professorship he holds was endowed, refers to the old boy's quaint habit of referring to himself not as \"I\" but as \"Your mother\". Halperin is more at ease when enthusing over curiosities like <em>To the Last Man</em>, a porno western in which cowboys wearing very snug jeans gun down their bunkmates and are ineffectually reproved by a preacher who lisps \"I'm tired of getting blood on my dog collar\".</p> <p>If you can tune out Halperin's shrillness and grope though his pseudo-philosophical miasma (\"Every thing is a 'thing',\" he tells us at one point), you may be able to trace an argument I happen to consider reactionary and disreputable. By teaching the young to adore old-time divas like Crawford and Garland, Halperin hopes to persuade them that gayness is about culture not sex, about solitary, subjective taste not shared identity. In his nostalgia for the heyday of giddy effeminacy, he denounces the campaign for marriage rights as a concession to \"heteronormative\" society; political protests about discrimination are waved away by his silly insistence that \"camp is a form of resistance to power\" or his astonishing notion that maleness is a mode of \"terroristic surveillance and enforcement\", a symptom of the \"lethal dose of unironised masculine histrionics that the world has had to absorb since September 11, 2001\". This swishing makes me wonder whether al-Qaida's fanatics may have a point about the decadence of the west.</p> <p>Back in the 1960s, Susan Sontag \u2013 whose <a href=\"http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Sontag-NotesOnCamp-1964.html\" title=\"\">Notes on Camp</a> articulated in a few fleet aphorisms most of what Halperin spends more than 500 pages paraphrasing \u2013 welcomed a new gay formalist style in criticism by declaring: \"In place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.\"</p> <p>Having trudged through Halperin's tract, I have a proviso to add: what we definitely don't need is an academics of Eros.</p>",
  "<p>It was once a tiny room on the first floor of Manchester City's Carrington training complex, not much bigger than a broom cupboard, where successive managers from Kevin Keegan to Stuart Pearce and Sven-Goran Eriksson would field questions at close range from the press. Today, partition walls have been removed to house a team of full-time analysts who study every touch, turn and sprint made from the Premier League champions down to the club's Under-9s. The world of data analysis has developed rapidly within football in recent years but not, City believe, beyond the guarded confines of its clubs. That is about to change.</p> <p>On Friday, City will make available through its website the data on every player in every team from every game in the Premier League last season. That may not enrapture the supporter fixated on Robin van Persie's next career move but to the growing number of researchers, sports scientists and bloggers seeking new ways to measure performance and value a player, it is potentially ground-breaking.</p> <p>Until now, data that costs all Premier League clubs a small fortune each season has not been widely available or at least widely accessible to the public. Baseball may have been revolutionised by Bill James's sabermetric findings from the late 1970s onwards, leading to Michael Lewis's book Moneyball and now a film starring Brad Pitt, basketball coaches make tactical decisions based on live data during a game, but developments in football have largely remained in-house.</p> <p>As Gavin Fleig, the head of performance analysis at City, explains: \"Bill James kick-started the analytics revolution in baseball. That made a real difference and has become integrated in that sport. Somewhere in the world there is football's Bill James, who has all the skills and wants to use them but hasn't got the data. We want to help find that Bill James, not necessarily for Manchester City but for the benefit of analytics in football. I don't want to be at another analytics conference in five years' time talking to people who would love to analyse the data but cannot develop their own concepts because all the data is not publicly available.\"</p> <p>Fleig's full-time department alone consists of four analysts attached to City's first team and six analysts working at every level of the club from Under-21 to Under-9 level. As he conducts a tour of the office, one analyst is dissecting an Under-18s game against Chelsea. Ensuring the next generation is following the football strategy of the first team is paramount, although the data is not simply to educate young players on the way up. Far from it.</p> <p>Two years ago Vincent Kompany instigated a weekly review of City's defensive performances with the analysis team. Every defender in Roberto Mancini's match-day squad now spends 15 minutes before a game assessing the unit's previous display, on topics such as transitions in play when City have lost the ball, their relationship with the midfield, defending crosses and recovering back into shape. \"I would argue that having the best defensive record over the past two years is partly down to the reflection process the defenders have on a weekly basis win, lose or draw,\" says Fleig. \"They have a constant guide as to how they are doing.\"</p> <p>Work stations at Carrington allow every player to analyse a breakdown of their performance 24 hours after a game. Each has a specific development area to study too, if they wish. Gareth Barry, for example, can see how he protected his back four, his goal attempts and movement to receive the ball. A full-back such as Micah Richards can review one-on-one tussles, pass selection, positioning, recovery runs, supporting attacks, stopping crosses and running with the ball. There is also a personal highlights package they can play in the gym, a good way to boost confidence on the way back from injury.</p> <p>Friday's data launch is for a global community, however. Fleig has worked closely with Opta, one of the first sports data organisations to embrace analytics in football and which has given City permission to make the database available, in an attempt to support the analytical community.</p> <p>He explains: \"The responsibility for developing analytics has always tended to fall on the clubs and that hasn't really changed, even as the community of statisticians, bloggers and students who are focusing on performances and analytics has grown dramatically. Bill James didn't work for a club. He was a statistician with a normal job outside of the sport but he was able to get hold of the data because it was made publicly available by the broadcasters and the league itself. There is a data culture in America. There isn't a data culture in the UK, although we are getting there.</p> <p>\"The whole reason for putting this data out there is to open the doors. The data has value, previously it has been kept in-house and behind guarded doors, but there is a recognition now that clubs need to help this space develop. There are a lot of people out there blogging and doing their own research and they can do a lot more with this data. I hope it will have a big impact on those who want to do research. It might just be the armchair enthusiast. If the worst it does is show a few people that there are different ways of looking at a player's performance, then great. If it helps universities and gets the blogging world talking and coming up with fantastic ways of modelling performance, that is what we want. We want to engage with them.\"</p> <p><em>The data will be available from Friday by logging in to </em><a href=\"http://www.mcfc.co.uk/mcfcanalytics\" title=\"\"><em>mcfc.co.uk/mcfcanalytics</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The flight is booked, the capsule wardrobe packed and you've worked out the fastest way to the airport. There's just one more thing to sort out: your holiday cash. Getting the best deal can mean spending less on commission and charges and more on holiday treats, so here's a guide to arranging your foreign currency.</p> <h2><strong>Buying cash</strong></h2> <p>Ordering currency online, which can be picked up at the airport, is cheaper than exchanging it at an airport bureau de change \u2013 the Post Office says more than \u00a321m is wasted annually on buying currency at the last minute at UK airports due to poor exchange rates and commission charges on lower-value transactions.</p> <p>When buying currency, remember that commission-free doesn't necessarily equate to the best deal, as fees are likely to have been loaded into the rate. Also, be wary of flat fees and minimum charges: the latter make it more expensive to change small amounts of money, while the former can offer good value if you are changing larger sums of money. Watch out for handling fees, too, which are normally about \u00a33 but can be higher.</p> <p>Also, your own bank or building society might have preferential rates for account holders.</p> <p>If you do end up buying currency over the counter, check if your debit card provider will charge an exchange fee. If so, you might want to withdraw cash and use that to pay for your travel money.</p> <p>Try MoneySavingExpert's <a href=\"http://www.Travelmoneymax.com\" title=\"\">Travelmoneymax.com</a> website to find the best online rate.</p> <h2><strong>Travellers' cheques</strong></h2> <p>These are a secure way of carrying your money abroad, because as long as you make a note of the cheque numbers you'll get a full refund if they are lost or stolen. However, the exchange rates are often poor and some come with high fees. Travelmoneymax found that for \u00a3100 you would get just \u20ac102 in euro travellers' cheques from Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>When cashing cheques abroad you are likely to face an additional charge (normally an extra couple of pounds), so try and take your cheques in larger amounts as it will cost the same to cash \u00a3100 as it will \u00a310.</p> <p>You can pre-order cheques in the same way you can cash, but travellers' cheques do not always come in denominations that exactly match how much you wish to spend.</p> <h2><strong>Pre-paid cards</strong></h2> <p>These are easy to use because you simply load them with funds before you go on holiday, then use the card to withdraw cash from ATMs or to make purchases. All the foreign exchange specialists now offer them, along with travel agents and banks. Even supermarkets offer pre-pay cards, although they tend to be Travelex cards stamped with the supermarket's logo.</p> <p>If you lose your pre-paid card you can cancel it or report it stolen, making it a reasonably safe way to carry money. But while some providers do not charge exchange fees, others will charge an initial set-up fee as well as fees on cash withdrawals and even top-up charges. Some pre-paid cards charge \"inactivity fees\", such as Ryanair's Cash Passport which slaps a \u00a32.50 monthly charge on users if they do not use the card for six months.</p> <p>You can buy specialist euro or dollar currency cards, which will be cheaper than using a debit card. The FairFX euro currency card special, for example, has <a href=\"http://www.fairfx.com/wizard/start/post#a_id=moneysupermarket-offer&amp;chan=moneysupermarket-cash\" title=\"\">no set-up fees if you apply via Moneysupermarket</a>, and charges \u20ac1.50 on international ATM withdrawals. It currently charges \u00a3104 for \u20ac130, plus a \u00a36 delivery charge. The <a href=\"http://www.mytravelcash.com/travel-money-products/euro-prepaid-credit-card.html?refcode=mytwstd0001&amp;offer=mtcgtd\" title=\"\">my TravelCash euro currency card</a> is free, has free international withdrawals and also offers 1% cashback on all purchases. It is currently charging \u00a3105 for \u20ac130.</p> <p>Some pre-paid cards will only allow you to top up face-to-face, while others give you the chance to top up on the phone or on the internet.</p> <h2><strong>Debit cards</strong></h2> <p>Many debit card providers add a fee of about \u00a31 for each purchase you make while on holiday, as well as fees of about \u00a32 each time you withdraw money from an ATM. The exchange rate you will get from your own bank on overseas purchases is also generally worse than if you shopped around for currency.</p> <p>For example, if you use a Barclays debit card overseas you will be hit with a 2.99% charge. On top of that, if you withdraw cash from an ATM you'll be charged 2% of the transaction (minimum charge \u00a31.50, maximum \u00a34.50), meaning \u00a3100 of euros will cost you about \u00a35. If you're using a cashpoint in a country that's not part of <a href=\"http://www.barclays.co.uk/Helpsupport/Usingcashmachinesabroad/P1242558955276\" title=\"Barclay's Gl;obal Alliance\">Barclays' \"Global Alliance\"</a> you'll also be charged a transaction fee over and above the foreign exchange charge.</p> <p>Nationwide no longer offers free overseas withdrawals for current account customers, but is fairly competitive with a 2% transaction charge on spending or withdrawals and a flat \u00a31 fee for using an overseas ATM.</p> <p>That leaves Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society's debit card, which still costs nothing to use overseas, and Metro Bank, which also allows fee-free purchases and withdrawals, though you have to open an account with the London-based bank in person to get the card.</p> <h2><strong>Credit cards</strong></h2> <p>In general, it's best to avoid using a credit card to withdraw cash abroad as you might at home: many providers will levy an exchange rate fee of up to 3%.</p> <p>Some cards offer 0% on purchases for up to 12 months, but you'll have to double-check you are not hit with a loading fee and make sure there are no restrictions on overseas purchases.</p> <p>The Post Office classic card is commission-free for use abroad and has a reasonable APR of 14.9%. There is an introductory offer for purchases of 0% a year fixed for three months, and an introductory offer for balance transfers of 0% per annum fixed for eight months. The Halifax clarity credit card also doesn't charge for overseas purchases.</p> <h2><strong>Watch out for sneaky overseas retailers</strong></h2> <p>Some merchants will offer to convert your bill into your home currency. This is known as \"dynamic currency conversion\" and will likely result in a higher exchange rate. Always check the bill before paying and make sure you are billed in the local currency.</p>",
  "<p>Want to improve your employability and job prospects with a work-related degree? Then you need to do some careful research.</p> <p>\"Consider similar or different courses; there is usually more than one route into the career you're aiming for,\" says Michelle James-Newton, who is doing teacher training at Birmingham's Newman University College.</p> <p>Johnny Rich, founder of the PUSH university guide, agrees: \"You want to do a vocational course, because if you are going to rack up debts you need to have a job at the end.\"</p> <p>But it's a false premise that courses lead to a specific career, he warns. \"The labour market in five or 10 years' time may look very different. And graduate employers are really after 'graduateness' \u2013 resourcefulness; somebody who can make themselves useful.\"</p> <p>Forensic science \u2013 with 8,500 degree places each year and just 9,000 UK jobs in total, some of which are filled by graduates of other sciences \u2013 is a good example of where a course might be too specialised, he says.</p> <p>Rich recommends doing more research on the qualifications held by professionals in your dream job, using websites such as <a href=\"http://www.bestcourse4me.com\" title=\"\">bestcourse4me.com</a>.</p> <p>Not all vocational degrees are increasing in popularity. This year, applications dropped for journalism, architecture and agriculture degrees and rose for nursing (one profession where the degree is compulsory) and mechanical engineering.</p> <h2><strong>Global trends</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>When Ray Wilkinson graduated in aeronautical engineering in 1980, there were 17 students on his course. Now he is principal lecturer in aerospace design and rocket propulsion at the University of Hertfordshire, and there are 400 students in his department, and career prospects in a global&#xa0;industry.</p> <p>He advises prospective students to look for links with industry. \"The deputy chief engineer on the Airbus A380 superjumbo was a Hertfordshire university graduate, and we have very strong links with companies and their senior people,\" he says, adding that courses are designed to replicate industry practice and many staff have lots of industry&#xa0;experience.</p> <p>\"We encourage students to go out and do a placement year, and they come back with a much clearer idea of how industry&#xa0;operates.\"</p> <p>Another reason for Hertfordshire's popularity, he says, is its success in the international Formula Student competition, where undergraduate teams design and build a single-seater racing car.</p> <p>Howard Ash, senior lecturer in the engineering and technology school at the university, adds: \"Industry wants graduates to be job-ready, and we do try to prepare them for the wider world.\"</p>",

  "<p>Winifred Baguely is in her element when she is washing pots or tidying up. She spends much of her time helping Beryl, a housekeeper at her care home, and as she sweeps the corridors with her own dustpan and brush, she can often be heard humming.</p> <p>It's a far cry from the 92-year-old who arrived at Stockport's Bruce Lodge six months ago. Then Baguely, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's four years ago after displaying dementia symptoms for a decade and a half, was extremely confused, often belligerent and her speech was difficult to follow.</p> <p>\"The difference is astounding,\" says daughter Maureen Roscoe. \"Mum was a housewife, a practical person who spent her life caring for her five children and our father, who died 20 years ago. Her desire to care for people was never blunted but the ability to do so was robbed from her and that left her very frustrated.</p> <p>\"These chores are helping her connect with other things from her past and are opening up new pathways in her mind. The first thing that we noticed had come back was her language \u2013 within a week of working with Beryl she was recalling words much better and introducing me to other people by name, whereas before she didn't know who I was.\"</p> <p>Baguely's new routine is part of a Stockport council pilot scheme which aims to quietly revolutionise the way residential dementia care is delivered. Bruce Lodge is learning to fit in with its residents, rather than the other way around \u2013 an approach which chimes with aspects of the government's recent health and social care white paper.</p> <p>Over recent months, the 43-bed home has worked with consultants Helen Sanderson Associates to find out what makes individuals tick and reflect this in some personal time with a member of staff with common interests.</p> <p>The programme began with six people and has now grown to include about half of those at the home, which is owned by the Borough Care group.</p> <p>One man now goes out for a regular pub lunch and pint with his staff match, while a woman rummages in charity shops before going for coffee and a cake. Someone goes to watch the aeroplanes at Manchester Airport, and another man plays dominoes and tackles large-print crosswords. There is a process of review to ensure activities remain suitable \u2013 a shop may have become too stressful for someone with a certain level of dementia.</p> <p>Care home manager Lisa Martin says: \"We were able to commit to a minimum of two hours a month for each person who lives here. The consultants work with the resident and their family to draw up a one-page personal profile. We have almost 50 staff, who have also been profiled, and these are matched according to interests.</p> <p>\"Winifred likes to feel useful and to carry out domestic tasks so we matched her with Beryl. They spend their two hours a month together but because Beryl is in five or six times a week, Winifred works with her a lot, taking breakfast with her a little later in the morning, and sharing her breaks.</p> <p>\"In a home for 43 people you have to be on alert. Staff are attentive to residents but are always keeping an eye on other people as well. But this time is very enabling \u2013 they are getting a period of attention only for them. That is quite precious.\"</p> <p>The approach does not stop at the resident: Martin is also improving the environment in line with families' suggestions. She recently ordered a jellyfish tank and lava lamps and the home is full of sensory triggers and home comforts such as photographs, books, teddy bears and dolls. In Baguely's room there are empty bottles of cleaning products, which serve the same purpose as toys.</p> <p>Her family is in no doubt about the impact on her quality of life. Roscoe says: \"Beryl is the perfect match for my mum and this routine has done her wonders. Her memory, mood and demeanour have improved, her emotions are less blunted and she is more focused and has more lucid moments. She asks more questions and interacts better. It's like she has been switched back on.\"</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>I was working in the corporate world when we first started <a href=\"http://www.arrivaleducation.com/\" title=\"\">Arrival Education</a> in 2003. The original motivation for setting up the business was to make a difference to young people from challenging communities, after my flatmate's brother was murdered in a street incident. I began on a voluntary basis, delivering youth programmes around work commitments.</p> <p>I wasn't quite ready to give up the financial security of corporate employment, so over a three year period I combined my day job with delivering change programmes for young people. This was until I had the confidence (or perhaps because of frustration) to leave salaried employment in 2006.</p> <p>I spent a year in an inner-city academy, road-testing concepts and obtaining experience. In order to fund this research period, I sourced funds from businesses, including <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/\" title=\"\">The Economist</a> and <a href=\"http://www.artemisonline.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Artemis</a> I was also paid a small fee by the school and I got a tax rebate that year too; enough to survive, just.</p> <h2><strong>Gap in the market</strong></h2> <p>It became apparent that there were opportunities, both in schools and within the businesses that I had worked with.</p> <p>I realised that with the right efforts, we could shift the behaviour of young people, many of whom would be considered difficult by the school while at the same time offering exceptional development services to the corporate community. They in turn would pay a premium to be developed by us, using the young people on our programmes, who themselves were being developed.</p> <p>We were on to something. We were attempting to develop a zero-waste trickle down development programme that guaranteed social mobility. We set about designing our marquee programme \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.arrivaleducation.com/content/section/7/33/\" title=\"\">Success for Life</a>; a four year talent development programme that focuses on influential young people from challenging communities.</p> <p>We got our initial break by being the first organisation on The Young Foundation's Learning Launch Pad, which supplied funding and input. We then signed up pilot schools and businesses, focusing on their corporate social responsibility (CSR) budgets.</p> <h2><strong>Business model</strong></h2> <p>We had two core client groups; schools, who buy based on need, and corporates who want to buy quality services, delivered well and with (managed) access to (the right sort of) young people.</p> <h2><strong>Corporates</strong></h2> <p>Over the last four to five years, we have enhanced our value proposition to businesses, while simultaneously increasing their spend. For instance, we started by requesting \u00a32,200 for an annual subscription, to obtaining nearly \u00a3100,000 from a single client in one year.</p> <p>This has been achieved, not by asking for charitable support (there is little of that sort of money left anyhow) but by offering products and services that they want, which we can deliver on, while also meeting and funding our social objectives.</p> <p>The key to delivering this is the long-term, high-impact nature of the programme. Short-term interventions rarely deliver results. It's all very well doing trips to the Lake District, but so what?</p> <p>As we have matured, businesses began to employ us to develop their talent through their Learning and Development (L&amp;D) budgets, which tend to be bigger but more target-focused than CSR. We also offer the added value of meeting both CSR and L&amp;D needs through our programmes, creating a two for the price of one offering.</p> <p>Corporates buy our products because we deliver the right sort of services, in the right way, which means we understand their constraints and needs. By offering a suite of products, be they workshops, coaching programmes, events and seminars, we can meet their requirements while mapping those experiences against our long-term programmes.</p> <p>Businesses get tremendous value from our services, content, delivery methods and of course engagement with the young people who have amazing back stories who are turning into super-stars.</p> <p>We try to make it easy for businesses to sign up and engage with us and we know if we don't do a good job they stop working with us. We see ourselves as a service based business.</p> <h2><strong>Schools</strong></h2> <p>Schools on the other hand buy our services because we produce results with the right sort of students in a way that works for the school. We keep children in school, we improve their behaviour and we increase their grades. We also develop their capacity to deal with challenge and success, and because of that success with young people, we built a suite of other schools services, including teacher training.</p> <p>Schools find us invaluable, as we create such significant and long lasting change both for individuals, as well as the broader school culture because of the type young people we focus on.</p> <p>In regards to Success for Life, schools pays for about half the true cost, businesses subsidise the rest after the service costs are subtracted.</p> <p>Additionally, over this pilot period, we were invited to design and deliver some very interesting and exciting programmes which helped us fund Success for Life, including <a href=\"http://thrivingtoo.typepad.com/thriving_too/2009/10/the-green-talent-fellowship.html\" title=\"\">The Green Talent Fellowship</a>, which we did in partnership with <a href=\"http://www.edenproject.com/\" title=\"\">The Eden Project</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CE0QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.education.gov.uk%2Fpublications%2Fstandard%2FDownload%3FDownloadPublicationReference%3DDCSF-00871-2009%26DownloadItemReference%3DThe%2520Talent%2520Challenge%2520PDF(DfES%2520Online%2520Store)%26DocumentType%3DPDF%26Url%3D%252Fpublications%252FeOrderingDownload%252F00871-2009BOK-EN.pdf&amp;ei=r6UrUJ_WN-fZ0QWdhIDQBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeOJrR1vDMau_hzb9Qbu8cg6mnqg&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Talent Task Force</a>, which Gordon Brown, the then prime minister, launched.</p> <h2><strong>Next stage</strong></h2> <p>As we have delivered on the social impact, our reputation has grown, which means more confidence in our proposition and which we've converted into pricing. When we began, we were just about getting clients in order to obtain the necessary experience.</p> <p>Now we have a groundbreaking high-impact, zero-waste development model and a talent pipeline, where the older students (paid by us) develop the younger students, who are simultaneously being developed by business professionals, who pay for that process/experience.</p> <p>The young people stay on the programme because of the quality, authenticity and the aspirational nature of the experience. I have always found that young people vote with their feet.</p> <p>That success was reflected in winning a place on <a href=\"http://www.bigventurechallenge.com/\" title=\"\">UnLtd's Big Venture Challenge</a> as we seek investment to scale up our operation, transitioning from a pilot of passion into a high impact growth business.</p> <h2><strong>Five tips</strong></h2> <p>1. Never stop. It will get very hard. You will want to quit.</p> <p>2. Don't expect a lot of salary in the first few years. You may have to put certain things on hold.</p> <p>3. Say goodbye to people in your business if they aren't right. It's less painful in the long run.</p> <p>4. Be careful about who you listen to. Everyone has well meaning advice, and yet you must keep your mind open too.</p> <p>5. Know your business \u2013 ss your social enterprise sustainable? Will someone actually pay for your services (vs you hope they will) and does it have a real impact? There are a lot of businesses that aren't social and there are a lot of socials that aren't business.</p> <p><em>Daniel Snell is the founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.arrivaleducation.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Arrival Education</em></a><em> and blogs at </em><a href=\"http://arrivalworldwide.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>http://arrivalworldwide.blogspot.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Not very flattering, but solid.</p> <p>The map also squeezes Russia, Canada and the Asian sub-continent, those familiar giants on the usual projection, while Greenland, made so large by distortions in Mercator's work, is the size of a pin. It's an interesting artefact in a thought-provoking line; there have several attempts in recent years to show the world in terms of resources, deprivation or just rather more accurately than the problems which arise when you try to unroll a globe on to a flat surface.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394854211\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345095568166/oxfam.jpg\" alt=\"oxfam map\" width=\"460\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Oxfam map, using the Gall-Peters projection which gives greater emphasis to the size of many countries in the Third World.

Hennig has serious points to make in addition to producing his eye-catching map. For all the novel appearance of the 'Olympic world', it tells a familiar story in his view. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From a global perspective, the legacy of the games is often measured in sporting success \u2013 however great the 'spirit' of the Olympics is emphasised. So it comes as little surprise that the medal tables are revisited over and over again.</p> <p>But despite an extraordinary performance of the host nation and some disappointments in other parts of the world, the overall picture of Olympic success stories is of little surprise. Olympic inequalities already started with an imbalance of participating athletes from around the world which hardly reflects the global population distribution.</p> <p>The wealthier parts of the world tend to have the lager teams, with Europe dominating the stage by far. At the other end of the scale are countries such as Bhutan, and others, with only two athletes.</p> <p>That pattern is carried forward to the winner's podium, where in large the wealthier parts of the world are represented, even if some great exceptions have made quite some headlines. The map shows the final medal tables in Worldmapper-style cartograms, with the main map representing the total medal count, and the smaller inset map splitting these numbers into separate maps of gold, silver and bronze medals, each resizing a country according to the number of medals that it has received.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The <em>Guardian Northerner </em>asked if a further map could be made of Team GB's 29 gold, 17 silver and 19 bronze medals, so that our bosoms could swell with northern pride in the way which has been such a feature of the last fortnight (and so agreeably annoying to some from metropolitan Britain). Alas, the message came back that this was not practicable, but Dr Hennig does plan a further world map after the Paralympic Games, which run from Wednesday 29 August to Sunday 9 September.</p>",
  "<p>During the development of the Localism Bill <a href=\"http://www.shropshire.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Shropshire Council </a>identified a need to build on the capacity of the voluntary sector. The authority asked the <a href=\"http://www.shrop.net/shropvcsassembly\" title=\"\">Voluntary Community Sector Assembly (VCSA) </a>to identify several new projects that the authority could fund that would enable the sector to become more sustainable in future years.</p> <p>The VCSA drew up a list of three projects: To create a forum of support for new and existing organisations, to design and develop a consortium for Shropshire voluntary and community organisations and to build and extend partnerships between the voluntary sector and the local private sector.</p> <p>The three projects are designed to highlight ways in which the sector must work if it is to continue helping communities in the current financial climate.As part of the extending partnerships initiative, the VCSA, with help from <a href=\"http://www.trainersandconsultantsdirect.org.uk/find_consultant/a_to_z/sarah_fishbourne\" title=\"\">Impact Consultancy </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.communityfoundation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Community Foundation </a>arranged for five local private business 'dragons' to participate and offer their time and expertise to support the local voluntary sector.</p> <p>Convincing the private sector that their corporate social responsibility was important was a daunting task, however we were able to show them the diversity of the voluntary sector and the thousands of people voluntary organisations support. The business dragons, rather than breathing fire as had been anticipated, simply adopted the phrase from the BBC show: \"I'm in\".</p> <p>The Shropshire Dragons included representatives from Dyke Yaxley, chartered accountants; Muller Dairy; Zen Communications; Triangle HR, andlocal solicitors PCB. We were delighted but then we felt concerned - we have five amazing dragons representing the good and the great of Shropshire but no participants. How do we convince the voluntary sector that creating partnerships with the private sector is a positive thing?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.communityfoundation.org.uk/connect/our-impact\" title=\"\">Impact &amp; Community Foundation </a>designed several workshops focussing on \"engaging business\", \"using social media as a business tool\" and \"developing business opportunities\". These workshops created an environment which led voluntary organisations to start thinking differently towards the private sector.</p> <p>Next up the VCSA had to promote the event to the sector, no small task with a membership of over 300 members. Zen Communications very kindly offered their time to help us with some marketing and PR for the event \u2013 yet another perk of working with the private sector. We had a great response from voluntary organisations wishing to take part in our Dragons' Den-style event, in fact, we were oversubscribed.</p> <p>The VCS participants were<a href=\"http://www.imagematch.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Imagematch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">CAB</a>,<a href=\"http://www.landau.co.uk/\" title=\"\"> Landau</a>, <a href=\"http://www.confide.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Confide</a>, <a href=\"http://www.womensaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Womens Aid</a>, and<a href=\"http://search3.openobjects.com/kb5/shropshire/cd/view.page?record=2OMo7_OPVgo\" title=\"\"> Autonomy</a>. We decided from the outset that this would be Dragons' Den with a difference. We didn't want the sector to ask for money because, as we all know in this climate, that approach doesn't work. Instead we wanted the participants to pitch to the dragons and ask them for pro bono business support and to make use of the vast array of expertise that the dragons bring to the table.</p> <p>Impact Consultancy, with help from local business <a href=\"http://www.theacademyshropshire.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Academy</a>, ran a session for the seven chosen participants on how to pitch to the dragons. This session was a great way for the participants to learn how to make a formal pitch and gave confidence to the organisations involved. It also helped the voluntary organisations crystallise what support they required and which dragons they should try and target. The pre event tweeting and press releases gave us some great publicity and we were all excited and nervous to hear who would get the support from the dragons and who would hear the immortal words \"I'm out\". Despite their nerves, the voluntary sector participants were not deterred. Their professional pitches and astute knowledge of the voluntary sector and their organisations won over the dragons.</p> <p>Once all participants had pitched, the dragons were left alone to deliberate over who to support. One by one the VCS participants re-entered the den to get the results and all seven participants received support from the dragons. They were so impressed with the diversity and professionalism of the participants that they wanted to offer as much help as they could.</p> <p>Our Dragons' Den event has been really positive and paved the way for future events to take place. The positivity and support from Shropshire Council has been tremendous, and the attitude of both the private and voluntary sectors to work together has been truly remarkable. With 'legacy' being the key word surrounding the London Olympics, we are also keen to forge a lasting legacy here in Shropshire of partnership work leading to better services for Shropshire residents. We hope that this is just the beginning.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Opponents of the world's biggest new hydroelectric project - the Belo Monte dam in Brazil - notched up a rare victory this week, when a federal appeals court ordered construction to be suspended until indigenous groups are properly consulted about the project.</p> <p>The judgment on Tuesday may prove only a temporary reprieve but it is seen as a scathing verdict on the government's efforts to rush forward with the Xingu River project in the Amazon, which - despite controversy - is one of the pillars of Brazil's efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. It is also a setback for developers, led by Electrobras, which now face expensive delays or daily fines of up to R$500,000 (\u00a3166,00) if they do not comply with the court order.</p> <p>About 12,000 construction workers are due to work on the dam this year, which is eventually expected to produce 11,000 megawatts of electricity - the third biggest hydro-electric generating capacity in the world after China's Three Gorges and Brazil's Itaipu dams. But the project has faced strong legal challenges and protests by conservationists and local tribes.</p> <p>The project - initially conceived during the years of Brazil's dictatorship - was supposed to have gone through an extensive environmental impact assessment before the start of construction, but judges from Brazil's regional federal tribunal have accepted a lower court ruling that Congress acted illegally in authorising the dam without due consultation with the indigenous groups that might be affected.</p> <p>\"The court's decision highlights the urgent need for the Brazilian government and Congress to respect the federal constitution and international agreements on prior consultations with indigenous peoples regarding projects that put their livelihoods and territories at risk. Human rights and environmental protection cannot be subordinated to narrow business interests\" said the author of the ruling, federal judge Souza Prudente.</p> <p>Belo Monte will flood an area of 500 square kilometres along the Xingu and force the relocation of 16,000 people, according to the government. NGOs says the number of displaced may rise as high as 40,000. Opponents - including representatives of the Juruna, Arara and Xikrin tribes, as well as international conservation groups and celebrities such as Avatar director James Cameron and actress Sigourney Weaver - have welcomed the ruling.</p> <p>\"It's a historic decision for the country and for the native communities,\" Antonia Melo, coordinator of the Xingu Vivo indigenous movement, told reporters. \"It's a great victory which shows that Belo Monte is not a done deal. We are very happy and satisfied.\"</p> <p>But the battle is far from over. The Norte Energia consortium, which is building the dam, will have an opportunity to appeal, which they have done successfully in the past. Environmental and human rights groups are calling on the government to accept the judgement.</p> <p>\"This latest court ruling vindicates what indigenous people, human rights activists and the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office have been demanding all along. We hope that president Dilma's attorney general and the head judge of the federal court will not try to subvert this important decision, as they have done in similar situations in the past,\" said Brent Millikan of International Rivers.</p> <p>Slowing the momentum of a $16bn project is bound to run up against many powerful interests and the Brazilian government - which has made the expansion of hydro-power one of it priorities - is unlikely to back away from this flagship dam.</p> <p>But one of its main justifications - the production of non-fossil fuel energy to reduce the impact of global warming - may be undercut by other trends. In a new report, the National Institute for Space Research has revealed that carbon emissions from deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 57% between 2004 and 2011 as a result of improved measures to tackle illegal land clearances. If such gains could be built upon and more effort put into wind and solar energy, the pressure to harness Brazil's river might ease.</p>"
