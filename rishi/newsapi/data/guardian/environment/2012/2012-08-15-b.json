  "<p>The cash machines in Santiago are running out of money, but it is not a run on the banks; shoppers in Chile are simply spending peso notes faster than the automated tellers can provide them. New skyscrapers are rising up in Bogot\u00e1 to create the office and retail space needed by a growing economy. Mexico \u2013 the new darling of foreign investors \u2013 is outstripping GDP forecasts. Brazil, which overtook the UK as the world's sixth biggest economy last year, has just announced a $66bn (\u00a342bn) stimulus plan in addition to the money it will splash out in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the Olympics in 2016.</p> <p>The economic mood music in Latin America for most of this year could hardly have been more of a contrast from that of the EU, mired in financial crisis, depressed by austerity, and dipping back into recession.</p> <p>Latin America is now being retuned, as most nations expect slower but still solid growth, and some prepare to tap extensive reserves to spend their way out of a global downturn.</p> <p>Their ability to withstand the coming storm will have long-term implications for perceptions of a region that was until recently a byword for financial turbulence, irresponsible spending and whimsical policies. Recently, many of the region's governments have been praised by the UN, IMF and World Bank for building strong reserves and maintaining generally low levels of public debt.</p> <p>This gives them more scope to open the fiscal stimulus taps when the economy starts to flag, as Brazil did on Wednesday with the announcement of a R$133bn (\u00a342bn) stimulus package. If they can avoid the worst impacts of the international crisis without sinking into debt \u2013 as most nations here did in 2008 \u2013 it would reinforce a growing reputation for prudent economic management.</p> <p>Several strong years of growth in the strongest performing economies have created a visible momentum. In Santiago, soaring housing prices, hundreds of new restaurants and thickets of cranes on the skyline suggest the Chilean economy has coasted through the early stages of the latest crisis. Car sales soared so high last year that at one point the government ran out of licence plates and was forced to issue cardboard substitutes while hastily stamping out another round of metal license plates.</p> <p>With an estimated GDP growth this year of 4.5%, plus hefty government reserves, Chile is prepared to weather potential fallout from Europe. \"We have a pretty comfortable position to face challenges in 2012,\" budget director Rosanna Costa told reporters in Santiago this year. The government sits on an estimated $14bn stabilisation fund that can be used to stimulate the economy via public works projects or cash infusions, as needed.</p> <p>Peru is also enjoying steady expansion, while Venezuela, buoyed by oil sales and a pre-election spending binge by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, is expected to grow by more than 5%, though its ability to pay its bills will depend on high oil prices.</p> <p>There are some significant exceptions to these trends. Argentina's economy has ground to a halt in the wake of the nationalisation of local assets owned by Spanish oil company YPF, indicating the still strong influence of global financial markets in Latin America.</p> <p>Even so, the region is expected to grow by 3-4% this year \u2013 a bonanza compared with the depression that afflicts the Latin nations in the old world. Portugal, Spain and Italy were among the worst-performing nations when the EU announced this week that the GDP of the eurozone fell 0.2% in the latest quarter.</p> <p>The contrasts are striking. While Spain has been begging for bailouts, Juan Carlos Echeverry, the finance minister of its former colony Colombia, this year boasted his government \"didn't need more revenue\". Thanks to rising rates of inward investment, falling&#xa0;unemployment and annual growth of 4.5% for more than a decade, his state's finances are thought to be in good shape to withstand the fallout from Europe.</p> <p>Although the mood has darkened in recent months, new symbols of affluence are being built. Colombia is erecting its tallest skyscraper, the 66-storey BD Bacat\u00e1 building, which will house a shopping mall, office space and up-market apartments.</p> <p>The Spanish property tycoon behind the project, Venerando Lamelas, said he was moving with the times. \"The European market is not doing well. Latin America is very important and within Latin America the best market is Colombia,\" he told a local newspaper.</p> <p>Others are following the opportunities across the Atlantic. Gonzalo Rodriguez recently gave up his job in Spain as a bond-market trader and moved to Brazil to work for an energy company designing power transmission lines for wind farms.</p> <p>\"I'm not earning as much here as I did in Spain, but I'm thinking five years ahead,\" the 25-year-old said in Copacabana. \"There is 100% more growth potential in Brazilian energy than in Spanish banks. There are lots of talented people in Spain not finding jobs. Here, it is the opposite. They don't have enough qualified people.\"</p> <p>Such optimism will be tested in the months ahead. Brazil has been hit harder than any other country by the downturn overseas \u2013 particularly weakening Chinese demand for commodities. It is likely to grow more slowly this year \u2013 about 2-3% \u2013 than any of the other big regional economies, prompting President Dilma Rousseff to unveil Wednesday's hefty stimulus package.</p> <p>Unlike in the past, however, it has the money to spend. Brazil's international reserves have swollen from $38bn in 2002 to more than $370bn, which is a substantial war chest to fend off global crisis.</p> <p>\"In years past, when the world sneezed, we caught pneumonia. That's no longer the case,\" Rousseff said this year. \"I can assure you, Brazil is 100%, 200%, 300% ready.\"</p> <p>Many economists question whether Brazil and the region as a whole will prove as resilient this time. Strong demand from China for soy, oil, copper and other commodities helped Latin America coast through the 2008-09 crisis. This time, with China slowing, it will have to dig deeper into its reserves. Although government finances are far stronger than they were in the 80s and 90s, the big question is whether it has invested enough in human capital.</p> <p>\"Important jobs here in Brazil are now being filled by Europeans, especially from Spain and Portugal,\" said Nelson de Sousa, a finance lecturer at management school Ibmec. \"We have not put enough into education and training. That is our great difficulty and one that is very different from the problems faced by Europe.</p> <p>\"The Brazilian government spends a lot, but badly. Dilma is aware of that, but there is a big difference between knowing what to do and being able to do it.\"</p> <p>If she \u2013 and other leaders in the region \u2013 succeed, however, a lot more than the Olympic torch may pass this year from Europe to Latin America.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline was changed on 16 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Moving from Auntie Beeb to the Gray Lady may have a pleasing ring. But that Mark Thompson can swap the director general's chair of the BBC for a Manhattan chief executive's office also marks a significant, generational shift: it is the moment when global and technological convergence has reached the point where it is possible for the leader of Britain's public-service broadcaster to land a $5m-a-year job as boss of the company behind the New York Times, the most famous newspaper in the US.</p> <p>The appointment also represents a substantial personal endorsement of the 55-year-old Briton and his stewardship of the BBC. While enjoying the benefits of guaranteed licence-fee funding to the tune of \u00a33.6bn a year, he has nevertheless proven able to develop the corporation digitally (selling Doctor Who episodes via iTunes overseas), maintain quality on screen despite lapses over phone-ins and taste, and navigate constant political pressure led by the Murdoch press.</p> <p>Not since Sir William Haley left the BBC in 1952 to become editor of the Times has a DG quit for a job in newspapers \u2013 and none has gone to America. The early days of broadcasting might have seen senior executives moving between the two, but as television developed, the fissure between print and broadcast widened \u2013 until the internet turned everything on its head.</p> <p>Today, the lines of competition have blurred. The BBC's generously funded website competes with a press trying to embrace multimedia \u2013 and the cash available at the BBC has helped give its executives a digital background that newspapers can only eye with jealousy.</p> <p>It was once felt that the BBC was closer to publicly funded arts organisations than red-blooded commercial media: a decade ago, Tony Hall left BBC News to run the Royal Opera House. Now, though, life after the BBC looks very different. Last year, another former senior BBC manager, Ashley Highfield, who led the development of the iPlayer, which had transformed the viewing habits of a nation, became the chief executive of Johnston Press, the newspaper group that owns the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post.</p> <p>When Thompson arrived at the top of the BBC eight years ago, it was at a high-profile national organisation in some peril, with both its chairman and his predecessor, Greg Dyke, having resigned. The New York Times occupies a similar position in the US imagination, and faces financial pressures that have forced it to sell regional newspapers and stakes in sport clubs, including Liverpool FC, to concentrate on a handful of brands \u2013 the New York Times itself, the Boston Globe and the International Herald Tribune.</p> <p>Thompson's final interview was in early July, to give him plenty of time to concentrate on the Olympics. At the heart of his pitch for the job was to emphasise the importance of video journalism, and of taking a professional approach to its production. Print, he believes, will still be the New York Times's principal means of transmitting information, but with 509,000 online subscribers to serve, a newspaper now needs to tell stories using cameras and the techniques of a John Simpson or Jeremy Paxman. In time, perhaps, the newspaper may create its own TV channel \u2013 transmitted, perhaps, via YouTube rather than over cable or satellite.</p> <p>It was part of what Arthur Sulzberger, the chairman and controlling shareholder in the New York Times Company, wanted to hear. The New York Times also wants to extend its brand overseas \u2013 the paper has just launched a digital edition in Mandarin, following an online version aimed at India the year before \u2013 and having a non-American in charge is one way to ensure that the paper develops from its roots as a big city newspaper into a news brand with a global reach and audience to match. Although recently overtaken by the celebrity-heavy Daily Mail as the world's leading online newspaper, the New York Times remains, by some distance, the most-read upmarket title.</p> <p>Journalists on the ground say they couldn't care less that Thompson is not from their side of the Atlantic. David Carr, a media columnist at the New York Times, says: \"The days of provincialism around geography, or platform for that matter, are long past. The NYT is in the global information business, this guy has shown an ability to build and manage news enterprises at that scale, so his background seems relevant to the task at hand\" \u2013 even if, he adds, the new leader pronounces the word \"schedule\" differently.</p> <p>Those close to the selection process in New York say that there was no single factor that swung the decision in Thompson's favour. The critics were quick to point out that the BBC man has not had any experience running a profit-making company, apart perhaps from a short stint running state-owned, advertiser-funded Channel 4 in the early part of the last decade. But Thompson's allies point to the rapid growth of BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm that exploits BBC brands for profit, and in particular its digital revenues, which amounted to \u00a3139m last year.</p> <p>Digital, for BBC Worldwide, also sees content being streamed into the US, meaning that BBC content is becoming gradually more visible in that country too. BBC Worldwide also distributed E4's Misfits, which became a surprise hit on Hulu, a US internet television service, last year. For his part, Thompson believes that his most important challenge at the New York Times will be to replace declining print advertising revenues with digital income, at a time when the number of web subscriptions and page views demonstrate the audience for journalism is, if anything, growing.</p> <p>The outgoing BBC boss, meanwhile, believes that the corporation's coverage of the Olympics, through 24 dedicated digital channels and bespoke apps to stream Games video to tablets and mobiles, represents the apotheosis of his achievement at the corporation. Opinion polls even suggest that public approval of the BBC rose as a result of the Games \u2013 by a higher proportion than the Queen, Boris Johnson or even the city of London itself \u2013 and while Thompson acknowledges that he cannot easily take credit for any specific aspect of the Olympics broadcasts, he was a keen enthusiast of ensuring that every moment of sporting action was covered live.</p> <p>That meant the BBC striking a commercial deal with its traditional rival Sky, a deal in which the Murdoch-influenced satellite broadcaster ended up promoting the corporation's Olympic content on and off air.</p> <p>But Thompson was being wooed well before the Olympics. His first contact with Sulzberger was in January, just as it emerged he was planning to leave the BBC later in the year later in the year. His relationship with the 60-year-old chairman will be critical, not least because, as publisher of the New York Times, Sulzberger has a hand in editorial appointments that Thompson himself will be denied. But with the Briton no stranger to navigating complex internal governance, he is hopeful that he can strike up a relationship that will allow him to have an impact. As a start, Thompson has already met with other key members of the Sulzberger family, before his final interview with the company's board took place in the early part of last month.</p> <p>The decision, though, did not come through until the middle of the Games, perhaps as the first British athletics gold medals came through \u2013 although final negotiations over pay ensured that his appointment was kept quiet long enough for the closing ceremony to conclude and the Briton to fly over to New York on Tuesday. The distance between London and New York, just as between television and newspapers, public and private media, has never felt closer.</p> <h2>Media stars who shine brightly across the Atlantic</h2> <p><strong>Lucian Grainge, chief executive, </strong></p> <p><strong>Universal Music Group</strong></p> <p>Once described as the \"killer shark\" because of his competitive instincts, Grainge runs the world's biggest music company from Los Angeles rather than the company's traditional HQ in New York. Chief executive Doug Morris, who now runs rival Sony Music, was eased out by Universal's owner to clear the way for Grainge, an Arsenal fan, in 2011. Grainge, 52, is now embroiled in a battle to complete the \u00a31.2bn takeover of EMI Music and is locked in negotiations with European and US regulators.</p> <p><strong>Anna Wintour, editor in chief, Vogue</strong></p> <p>The eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, a former editor of the London Evening Standard, Wintour has edited Vogue for 24 years and is the most influential \u2013 and best known \u2013 name in fashion journalism.

  "<p>When Sir Richard Branson lost his second attempt to run the National Lottery in 2000, he lambasted the conservative instincts of the British establishment.</p> <p>Decision-makers would always choose the \"more of the same\" option rather than take a risk with something new, he said. \"You've got to have a country where people are willing to take risks. It is far, far tougher to be an entrepreneur here than it is in America.\"</p> <p>Now, 12 years later, the billionaire founder of the Virgin empire is on the attack again after the government followed his advice and tried something different \u2013 with a company run by an American, to boot.</p> <p>As the underbidder for the west coast route, Branson found himself in the unusual position of criticising ministers for displaying an excess of the risk-taking zeal that has driven his success.</p> <p>Whether it is a fault of Britain's hidebound business environment or a reflection of where Branson sees a money-making opportunity, many of the tycoon's UK ventures have involved close interaction with the government of the day, from seeking ministerial backing for Heathrow landing slots to buying Northern Rock from the state for \u00a3747m.</p> <p>It is a relationship that has waxed and waned but has delivered for both sides. Even when Branson leaves the rail business at the end of the year, he will have a strong presence on the British high street after Virgin Money's acquisition of Northern Rock, while his Virgin Care business has signed a contract to provide community health services for the NHS in Surrey and Devon.</p> <p>For all the accusations of government \"insanity\" for not renewing Virgin's west coast mainline franchise, Branson is not going to sever ties with the UK or the establishment soon.</p> <p>However, one branding expert says the west coast loss is one of the worst he has suffered.</p> <p>\"It is one of the first times that Virgin has been told no and that is a moment of truth for them,\" said Graham Hales, the UK boss of the consultancy Interbrand. \"The brand has sailed through life pretty unassailably and has always succeeded in having a lot of public goodwill behind it.\"</p> <p>Even without Virgin Trains, Branson has other strong brands, from Virgin Active gyms and the Virgin Media cable business to the Virgin Atlantic airline.</p> <p>Hales adds that, in many ways, Virgin Trains was an outrider for the group because rail is not a typical vehicle for the Virgin brand.</p> <p>\"It was not really part of the family,\" he said. \"The brand will continue to have its property in other markets. It is always looking to champion the consumer and that's where it is at its best. I don't think it did that convincingly for rail. Virgin is superb when it is reinventing categories, siding with the consumer or poking fun at po-faced competitors. None of that happened in rail.\"</p> <p>Virgin would disagree, pointing to a doubling of passenger numbers during its ownership of the franchise and quirky marketing campaigns that helped make it the most well-known rail brand in Britain.</p> <p>Branson is adamant that he will not return to the rail industry under the current franchising system, a statement that could be questioned given his ongoing fascination with the National Lottery. But one rail industry source said that being runnerup to two lofty franchise bids \u2013 in 2005 and 2007 Virgin lost out on the east coast line to two bids that ultimately collapsed \u2013 represents the end of the journey.</p> <p>\"I think he means it. If you have come second twice in a row on two big franchises and you see the winning bid default, why would you continue to participate in the process?\" The same source adds, however, that Virgin's entrepreneurial flair had bruised relations with the Department for Transport. It is widely accepted within rail industry circles that a renegotiation of the west coast franchise in 2006 left a bitter aftertaste for some at the DfT. Virgin was thought to have got away with too good a deal.</p> <p>\"Virgin Trains has not been liked by the DfT because the department holds the view that it has been outsmarted and outgunned in commercial negotiations in previous years. That resentment is not as strong today as it has been in the past, but it lingered on and you wonder if the [west coast] decision had an element of revenge being served cold.\"</p> <p>The franchising process is so rigorous that even sources close to Virgin doubt that rancour over the 2006 negotiation played any role in the loss of the west coast route.</p> <p>The precise financial cost to the Virgin empire is impossible to fathom, given that Branson presides over a conglomerate of about 400 operations that are ultimately owned by offshore trusts and overseas holding companies. Some of the biggest names, including Virgin Media, are not even wholly owned and Virgin Trains is co-owned with Stagecoach, the Scottish public transport group.</p> <p>But even the most basic contrast with Virgin Atlantic underlines the importance of the trains business to Branson. Last year, the airline carried 5.4 million passengers compared with the train company's 31 million, while the carrier posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a380m last year compared with a pre-tax profit of \u00a341m at Virgin Trains.</p> <p>Whether or not the rail business is a perfect fit in terms of the Virgin brand, it is an important contributor to the empire's coffers.</p> <p>However, the west coast business has seen its pre-tax profits decline every year since they peaked at \u00a3105m in 2009. So, while sales have increased year by year from \u00a3336m in 2001 to \u00a3929m in the year to March 2012, pre-tax profits are virtually unchanged at \u00a341m in 2012 compared with \u00a338m in 2001.</p> <p>Franchise profitability has been extremely erratic, reflecting disruption compensation from Network Rail, the owner of the tracks and stations, and changes in the franchise agreement with the government.</p> <p>Rail is not an industry where entrepreneurs can go about unfettered. As a consequence, over the past 15 years the performance of Virgin Trains has ranged from a \u00a313m pre-tax loss in 2006 to the \u00a3105m pre-tax profit recorded in 2009, although that is a healthy return for any rail franchise.</p> <p>Virgin argues in turn that the profits and subsequent dividend payments are an appropriate return for sticking with, and investing in, a London-to-Glasgow route that was bedevilled by poor performance while it underwent a multibillion-pound upgrade for much of the franchise.</p> <p>Although the wider Virgin Group may incur an asset writedown as a consequence of the west coast decision, the cessation of dividend payments from Virgin Trains will be a much bigger blow.</p> <p>Virgin Rail Group Holdings has paid dividends every year since 2004 apart from 2006. In the past 10 years, Virgin Rail has paid out \u00a3381.7m split between Virgin Group, a 51% shareholder, and Stagecoach, which owns the remaining 49%. A \u00a324m dividend in 2011 was increased to \u00a329m in 2012.</p> <p>And there is some compensation to come, despite FirstGroup's unexpected triumph. Even though the franchise has been lost, Virgin Rail is still paying a dividend of at least \u00a323m in the year to March 2013.</p> <p>Speaking after he failed to secure the National Lottery in 2000, Branson said: \"The dilemma is, do you bow out gracefully or do you fight?\"</p> <p>Whenever a door shuts on Branson, he seems to force another open. It is the end of the line for Virgin Trains but Branson and his myriad interests will remain a commercial force in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>Pressure on George Osborne for a softening of the government's hardline economic strategy intensified on Wednesday after leading economists who backed the chancellor's plans in opposition called for immediate action to lift Britain out of double-dip recession.</p> <p>In a blow to the chancellor, almost half the economists who strongly supported the Conservative party's deficit-reduction proposals in the runup to the 2010 election said it was time for a rethink and urged the Treasury to take advantage of low borrowing costs to boost spending on infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Labour seized on a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/exclusive-osbornes-supporters-turn-him\" title=\"\">report in this week's New Statesman magazine</a> detailing the change of heart of nine of the 20 experts who signed a letter in February 2010 supporting austerity, with only one sticking to an endorsement hailed by Osborne at the time as a \"really significant moment in the economic debate\".</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"With a double dip recession made in Downing Street and the economy shrinking, not growing, since the spending review, it's no surprise that even economists who once backed George Osborne are now calling for action to get the economy moving.</p> <p>\"Unlike George Osborne and David Cameron, they can see that the evidence now points to the need for a change of course. They know that without growth we can't get the deficit down \u2013 George Osborne is already forecast to borrow \u00a3150bn more than planned.\"</p> <p>Although the economists said they had been right two and a half years ago to urge immediate spending cuts as a way of tackling Britain's record peacetime deficit in the course of one parliament, they said the changed economic circumstances justified growth-creating measures.</p> <p>Roger Bootle, managing director of Capital Economics, said: \"If I were chancellor at this point, I would alter the plan, I would stop the cuts to public investment and I might even seek to increase it. Supply-side reform might be welcome but what we're talking about here is a shortage of demand. The key thing is to try and get the private sector to spend its money and that may require a bit of government spending to prime the pump.\"</p> <p>Tim Besley, economics professor at the London School of Economics and a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, said: \"I would prefer to see government resources used in a targeted way and there may be creative ways of using the government balance sheet. I am particularly keen to have more focus on housing in the near term.\"</p> <p>The chancellor's handling of the economy has come under scrutiny as the economy's tentative recovery in 2010 has stalled. Output is now lower than it was when the coalition was formed two years ago while the Bank of England believes it will take until 2014 for gross domestic product to return to the peak reached in early 2008. Threadneedle Street expects the economy to contract by 0.2% this year.</p> <p>Ministers were taking some comfort from news that the economy is managing to create thousands of new jobs despite the weakness of growth. Employment rose by more than 200,000 in the three months to June, the biggest quarterly jump since 1989.</p> <p>Even so, economists are concerned that unemployment may start to rise again against a backdrop of the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone, a slowdown in the global economy and weak domestic demand.</p> <p>Osborne has already been forced to abandon plans to eradicate the structural part of the UK's current budget deficit \u2013 the part that will remain even when the economy returns to full health \u2013 during the course of this parliament. Austerity measures will now continue for the first half of the next parliament as a result of the impact of slower growth on the public finances.</p> <p>The chancellor has always maintained that his deficit-reduction plan is necessary to keep the support of the financial markets and the credit ratings agencies. He has insisted that a U-turn would only lead to higher interest rates and slower growth.</p> <p>Hashem Pesaran, economics professor at Cambridge University, said in the New Statesman: \"My views have not changed \u2013 but this does not mean that I have agreed with this government's obsession with credit ratings and fiscal reductions at the expense of growth-inducing policies.</p> <p>\"I was in favour of taking account of the possible adverse effects of large and unsustainable government deficits on borrowing costs and financial stability.</p> <p>\"I believe this government's policies have not followed the balance I had in mind when I signed the letter.\"</p> <p>The original letter, published in the Sunday Times, said: \"In order to be credible, the government's goal should be to eliminate the structural current budget deficit over the course of a parliament, and there is a compelling case, all else being equal, for the first measures beginning to take effect in the 2010-2011 fiscal year.\"</p> <p>Of the signatories, Albert Marcet of the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics said there was \"no urgency\" to alter the path of deficit reduction.</p> <p>Nine of the 20 were either on holiday or declined to comment.</p>",
  "<p>Londoners are feeling pretty good about their city in the wake of the Olympics. Where better in the world to live right now?</p> <p>Well, according to the latest \"liveability\" <a href=\"https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=Liveability2012\" title=\"\">rankings published</a> by the Economist Intelligence Unit, there are 54 better cities. In fact, despite the Olympics, London is ranked lower than last year \u2013 as is Manchester, the only other UK city included in the 140 \"proxy\"&#xa0;cities.</p> <p>Sitting pretty at the top of the rankings, just as it was last year, is Melbourne. The rest of the top 10, in descending order, are Vienna, Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Adelaide, Sydney, Helsinki, Perth (Australia) and Auckland.</p> <p>So how does EIA rate each city? \"The first thing we assess is 'stability', followed by culture,\" explains Jon Copestake, the survey's editor. \"We also assess infrastructure, healthcare and education.\"</p> <p>By \"stability\", Copestake means crime rates and threat of terrorism. Due to the riots last summer and various street protests such as the tuition fees march, London and Manchester have seen their rankings suffer. And because London already had such a high score for culture and recreation, the Olympics has had little positive impact on its ranking.</p> <p>\"We don't include the cost of living as we do that in a separate survey,\" says Copestake. \"But London falls into the second tier of cities because of a variety of factors. The availability of good housing limits London.The transport infrastructure is slightly overburdened. Healthcare doesn't score as well as it could. London has suffered from terrorism and&#xa0;crime and, as a result, there has been a general sense of unrest.\"</p> <p>So what, if anything, could London do to improve its ranking? \"In a way, London is a victim of its own success,\" says Copestake. \"New York is the same, which has a very similar ranking. Adelaide moved into the top five this year because of its infrastructure improvements. Therefore, improvements such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/crossrail\" title=\"\">Crossrail</a> [an east-west rail tunnel currently under construction in central London] would raise the score. The disappearance of the threat of terrorism would also help. Overall, though, we find that cities that rank highest tend to be mid-sized, in countries with low population densities. That's why Australian and Canadian cities do well.\"</p> <p>But aren't the top-ranked cities \u2013 let's be honest \u2013 a bit dull compared to buzzing metropolises such as London and New York? \"It's a good point,\" says Copestake. \"But we look for the cities that present the fewest challenges.\"</p> <p>Does Boris Johnson have anything to say about this? Responding to EIU's survey, his spokesman says: \"There are many ways to assess a global city's popularity. London regularly tops surveys as the best city in the world to live, work and invest in and respondents frequently cite its safety and low level of crime as a key reason.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's a balmy Tuesday evening in Totnes, the small Devon town that sits just below the south-western tip of the M5. Outside the Methodist church hall, a hand-drawn notice simply says \"Adios Costa\". Inside, around 45 people are having an animated discussion about the imminent arrival of the ever-expanding coffee chain. There is a lot of talk about a failure of democracy, and the emptiness of what politicians call \"Localism\" \u2013 but, more interestingly, an emphasis on what might happen when the town's newest arrival actually opens its doors.</p> <p>\"The idea is to be prepared,\" says one of the people behind tonight's gathering, with some excitement. \"So that when they get here, things are <em>organised</em>.\"</p> <p>One man suggests regularly visiting Costa, ordering tap water, and then drinking it very slowly. A woman offers to paste up anti-Costa posters on the chain's windows, doggedly replacing them whenever they're removed. A couple of people who live across the street from Costa's proposed new outlet say they'll hang protest banners and there is a warmly received proposal of an official day of mourning, \"because we've lost our democracy\". And on it goes: how about a debate in parliament? Or a vote of no confidence in the local council? Or a simple boycott?</p> <p>Welcome, then, to another chapter in the ongoing battle between places that pride themselves on their local character, and the great stomping boot of multinational capitalism. That it is happening in Totnes (population: 7,500) is hardly surprising: long renowned as a byword for sustainable living and imaginative local politics, it also the home of the Transition Towns movement, focused not just on the way that people and places use fossil fuels, but how to make local economies more resilient by encouraging independent business, and fighting the kind of big interests that tend to take out more than they put in. Their most famous innovation is the Totnes Pound, a home-grown currency that is accepted by more than 70 local businesses.</p> <p>Totnes's local economy looks to be in reasonable health, which is surely down to the fact that it is about as far from being what we now call a \"clone town\" as could be imagined. The local record shop, <a href=\"http://www.driftrecordshop.com/\" title=\"\">Drift</a>, is mind-bogglingly great: the kind of place that you'd think was amazing if you found it in New York. The quality and diversity of restaurants <em>is</em> amazing. Most pertinently, the town has 42 independently run outlets that serve coffee, and \u2013 so far \u2013 not a single branch of any of the big caffeine-selling multiples.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789258\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/15/1345052682808/Anti-Costa-campaigner-Fra-008.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Costa campaigner, Frances Northrop\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-Costa campaigner, Frances Northrop Photograph: SWNS.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, though, Costa \u2013 whose most visible slogan remains \"Saving the world from mediocre coffee\" \u2013 is on its way, as part of programme of expansion that will look either worryingly aggressive or admirably ambitious, depending on your point of view. Certainly, it seems to be bucking the prevailing trend of our flatlining economy, opening scores of new outlets while independent coffee shops are truly feeling the pinch.</p> <p>A fully owned subsidiary of the food and hospitality conglomerate Whitbread, it currently operates 1,400 British outlets, and recently announced plans for 350 more. Thanks also to a snowballing presence in petrol stations, pubs and motorway services, its logo is becoming inescapable, which is exactly the point: the chief executive, Andy Harrison, has talked about increasing the number of branches to 2,000, and thus making them ubiquitous. \"People really don't want to walk very far for a coffee,\" he has said. \"We can have them a couple of hundred yards apart on a really busy high street, then another at a retail park and another at the station.\"</p> <p>The fact that Starbucks remains synonymous with the more rapacious aspects of modern business seems to have blinded people to what Costa is doing. But as proved by similar battles in the West Country seaside town of Burnham-on-Sea, Bishops Waltham in Hampshire and the Suffolk resort of Southwold, it is Costa that may soon turn into the biggest signifier \u2013 in the UK, at least \u2013 for the tensions between local communities and big chains.</p> <p>In Southwold, in fact, Tuesday night saw a successful appeal by Costa against a previous planning decision that had stopped them opening there, greeted with such fury that 100 people were ordered to leave that night's planning hearing. Such, say anti-Costa campaigners, are the same basic outlines as you see in battles against the big supermarkets: passionate locals who fear the places where they live being laid waste, a massive corporation that wants to expand \u2013 and local politicians who tend to run scared, because of the prohibitive costs of locking horns with such huge companies.</p> <p>The Totnes story goes something like this. In February 2010, a local wholefood business called Greenlife moved out of the High Street, to new premises on the town's market square. There were initial rumblings about the site being taken by Oxfam, before a new landlord called London and Western Holdings bought the shop, and it was eventually announced that Costa would be moving in, and opening a 70-seat cafe, in a part of town that regularly swarms with visitors.</p> <p>This, presumably is why they want a piece of the action. \"The bottom of the hill is where most of the tourists arrive,\" says Frances Northrop, the manager of Transition Town Totnes (or TTT), and one of the prime movers in the anti-Costa campaign. \"They come in on the river, or by train, or into the car park there. So they'll come straight in, and they'll see a Costa Coffee. And if people are in a new place, a lot of people think: 'I'm not going to try the unknown \u2013 I'm going to go somewhere that I recognise.'\"</p> <p>In response to unconfirmed rumours that Costa would be moving in, Northrop and scores of people with similar convictions got to work, bigging up Totnes's cafe society. In May, there was a coffee festival, which offered prizes for baristas, the places where they work, and the slippery discipline of \"coffee art\" (putting images in the froth). Those opposed to the arrival of a chain pasted up posters modelled on the publicity material for the movie of Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting, recast as \"Clonespotting\". Meanwhile, a petition against the arrival of any big coffee business was in circulation, and quickly amassed 5,749 signatures \u2013 75% of which, say the anti-Costa camp, came from people from Totnes, or its surrounding areas.</p> <p>In time, the town council voted in support of the campaign, along with all of Totnes's district councillors. The local MP is Sarah Wollaston, the non-conformist Tory most renowned for her opposition to Andrew Lansley's changes to the NHS \u2013 and she is in full accord. \"The strength of feeling on this issue has been evident and it is not too late for Costa to look at local opinion and decide to take their business elsewhere,\" she recently said. Plenty of locals say the Costa controversy is proof of one of the serial disappointments associated with the coalition government: there has been no end of Westminster noise about \"localism\" \u2013 but on the ground, the blanding-out of our towns, villages and cities seems to be accelerating, against local opposition.</p> <p>What was soon named the No To Costa campaign zeroed in on the legal obligation to consider planning applications on the basis of what they will do to a town's \"vibrancy and vitality\", and claimed that if Costa got what they wanted, Totnes would suffer. But on 1 August, the planning committee of South Hams district council approved Costa's plans by 17 votes to six. As Costa's local opponents endlessly point out, only four of the councillors who voted actually represent the town.</p> <p>\"It wasn't just about the fact that we didn't want a large chain, or not damaging our pretty market town \u2013 it's actually that they're like Tesco,\" says Northrop. \"They're an aggressive, extractive industry. We've got 42 coffee outlets, all independently owned, a lot of which are struggling, like anywhere else \u2013 and if you bring in a retail unit with the buying power and familiarity of Costa, which is the size of three coffee shops, you're damaging not only those independent businesses, who might go out of business, but their supply chains: growers, producers, drinks suppliers.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789259\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/15/1345052926864/Campaigner-Matteo-Lamaro--008.jpg\" alt=\"Campaigner Matteo Lamaro of the Curator cafe\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigner Matteo Lamaro of the Curator cafe. Photograph: SWNS.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I contact it for its take on the Totnes story, a Costa spokeswoman tells me: \"Totnes is a thriving tourist town and we appreciate that it has a strong reputation for supporting independent retailers.\" She says the company \"would like to reassure the people of Totnes that Costa won't be a threat to the dozens of coffee shops that are already there, but will aim to complement the local offering and support the local community.\"</p> <p>She concedes that \"it's disappointing that there is so much objection\", but says that \"we simply want to add to the vibrancy of the town and support the local community.\" Costa, she claims, will boost the town's character \"by adding vibrancy, complementing what Totnes currently offers.\"</p> <p>When I ask her for a response on the question of local supply chains, her reply runs thus: \"Costa coffee prides itself in using numerous suppliers, large and small, across the UK to produce the products it sells within its stores. For example, we work with a family run bakery to produce our cakes, with dedicated dairy farmers for our milk and use British meat in our savoury lines. At a time when many businesses are closing, we are one of the success stories of British business, creating jobs right across the UK.\"</p> <p>I spend nine hours in Totnes, sped on my way by the borderline anxious buzz that comes from endless cups of coffee, served by people who are, not entirely surprisingly, worried by the prospect of Costa's arrival. Their stories tend to have a great deal in common: a good deal of the town's cafe-owners are people new to the trade, who have said goodbye to regular jobs, or time spent abroad, and staked their livelihoods on Totnes's unique culture.</p> <p>At the freshly opened Curator cafe, I meet 38-year-old Matteo Lamaro, a native of Ancona in eastern Italy, who moved here after a long spell as youth worker in central London. Lamaro's cafe looks posh, but is way cheaper than the multiples: a regular cappuccino is \u00a32, and a slice of his delicious marble cake comes in at \u00a31.50: at Costa, the equivalent prices are \u00a32.45 each.</p> <p>\"Costa will affect the ambience Totnes has,\" he says. \"This is an independent kind of place, offering something different from \u2026 <em>normality</em>.\"</p> <p>And will its arrival affect his trade? \"It depends on the tourists. Costa is a known place, isn't it, isn't it? So if they want a coffee somewhere they know, rather than a place that actually offers good coffee \u2026 that's the main risk.\"</p> <p>At the top of the town, the bustling Green cafe takes its name from 46-year-old Ivan Green, who moved here with his family after living in southern Brittany. They live above the business, and he rises at 5am each day to bake 90% of the bread, cakes and pies that are on sale. He is already preparing for the malign effects of Costa's opening, having done up the flat that sits behind the cafe, and rented it out. \"The problem I have with the multinationals,\" he says, \"is that it's just not fair competition.\" The more he talks, the more outraged he sounds: like a lot of locals, he says that one of his big fears is Costa serving notice that Totnes is ready to be colonised, and sparking the arrival of Caffe Nero, Subway and all the rest.</p> <p>Over the road, Martin Turner, 42, runs the Tangerine Tree caf\u00e9. He's been in Totnes for four and a half years, having run the catering department at the HQ of the Met Office, in Exeter. \"It'll have an effect on footfall coming up through the town,\" he says. \"We've got a lot of loyal customers, but it could stop people coming up here: 70 is a lot of seats. The other thing is, it could put rents up. So we'll definitely notice it.\"</p> <p>I hear the same sentiments at the Fat Lemons cafe \u2013 which is Totnes incarnate, purveying vegetarian and gluten-free food, with artwork from the Who's Quadrophenia hanging on the wall in the gents \u2013 and Olsen, a Scandinavian-themed place run by a half-Danish local called Karl Rasmussen, who offers such treats as home-cured gravlax (\"with pickled beetroot, salad, Swedish crispbread and dill and mustard dressing\"), and octopus, potato and watercress salad.</p> <p>Two of his regulars are sitting just in front of the counter. \"We've got 42 coffee places,\" says Ann Rutherford, 71. \"Why do we need a 43rd?\"</p> <p>\"A coffee shop is where people meet,\" says 64-year-old Diana Cusack. \"We don't need Costa to give us a place to meet. We've got a surfeit of places in Totnes where people meet to talk. We're a talking town.\"</p> <p>They both say they'll go nowhere near Costa, but say they worry about its appeal to the town's youth, who might be drawn in by the prospect of \"two milkshakes and free Wi-Fi\".</p> <p>By way of walking off the effects of so much coffee, I decide to do a few unscientific vox pops \u2013 which is when I meet some of the people I've just been talking about. They're killing time in the market square and their lives, they tell me, are split between education, gap years and low-end jobs. On the face of it, they are the kind of people that Costa and their ilk specialise in attracting.</p> <p>Round here, though, it doesn't seem to be working. \"I think it's pretty bad,\" says Jesse Tighe, 18. \"We don't really need these chains.\"</p> <p>\"If you want to come to Totnes,\" reckons 18-year-old Finnegan Travers, \"you come to the independent places, don't you?\"</p> <p>What words, I wonder, do they associate with Costa Coffee?</p> <p>\"Shit,\" says one voice. \"Corporate,\" offers another. \"McDonald's,\" reckons a third.</p> <p>\"We're speaking for every young person here, I promise you. And older people,\" says Tighe. He glances up the street, towards a pub-cum-music-venue-cum-cafe called the Barrel House, and down towards the premises where Costa will soon pitch up. \"No one in Totnes wants this, do they?\"</p>",
  "<p>Dear colleagues,</p> <p>As you are all aware, our company has been under intense scrutiny in the United Kingdom. I assured parliament and the Leveson inquiry that we would move quickly and aggressively to redress wrongdoing, co-operate with law enforcement officials and strengthen our compliance and ethics programme company-wide. With the support of our board of directors, I am pleased to tell you that we have made progress on each of these important steps.</p> <p>Gerson Zweifach, senior executive vice-president and group general counsel, News Corporation, is now our chief compliance officer and has assumed overall responsibility for our effort to create a more robust global compliance and ethics programme. Lisa Fleischman, vice-president and associate general counsel, News Corporation, is our deputy chief compliance officer and will exercise day-to-day operational responsibility for the global compliance and ethics programme. In these capacities, Gerson and Lisa will report regularly to the board of directors and the audit committee regarding the content and operation of the compliance and ethics programme.</p> <p>For purposes of the compliance and ethics programme, all of our business units will be organised into five compliance groups: the LA Cable and Broadcast Group; the LA Film and TV Production Group; the Europe and Asia Group; the Australia Group; and the New York News and Information Group. Each group will be headed by a group chief compliance officer who will report directly to Gerson and will focus full-time on compliance issues.</p> <p>We have already strengthened and expanded our anti-bribery training programmes. To ensure the effectiveness of our entire compliance and ethics programme, we have recently initiated a review of anti-corruption controls in selected locations around the globe. The purpose of this review is to test our current internal controls and identify ways in which we can enhance them. Let me emphasise that the review is not based on any suspicion of wrongdoing by any particular business unit or its personnel. Rather, it is a forward-looking review based on our commitment to improve anti-corruption controls throughout the company.</p> <p>We recognise that strengthening our compliance programmes will take time and resources, but the costs of non-compliance \u2013 in terms of reputational harm, investigations, lawsuits, and distraction from our mission to deliver on our promise to consumers \u2013 are far more serious.</p> <p>As one of the world's most innovative media companies, News Corporation serves a vital role in the global marketplace of ideas. Every day, hundreds of millions of people rely on us to provide high-quality news, sports programming, and entertainment. To continue to be worthy of the trust of our audiences around the world, we all have an affirmative obligation to adhere to the highest standards of ethical behaviour, consistent with our standards of business conduct. The enhancements to the compliance function that are already underway and that we are planning will help us to maintain those standards.</p> <p>Please join with me in this important effort and give it your full co-operation and support.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch</p>",
  "<p>An uninhabited Pacific island has come top of the first comprehensive ocean health index, which compares all the world's coastal countries and scores them for how well the seas around them benefit both man and nature.</p> <p>Tiny 4.5 sq km Jarvis island, halfway between Hawaii and the Cook Islands, was briefly mined for seabird fertiliser in the 19th century but both the waters around it and the island itself have been left more or less untouched since then, which accounts for its top score of 86 out of 100 compared with a global average of 60.</p> <p>West Africa comes comprehensively bottom of the list with 10 of its 11 ocean areas judged the least healthy in the world. Sierra Leone, which has suffered a decade of civil war, whose seas are ravaged by foreign industrial fishing fleets, and which has little protection of its coastline or waters and barely any tourism, scores the least, with 36 points out of 100 \u2013 just below Liberia, Ivory Coast and DR Congo.</p> <p>Rich countries, which can afford to police their resources, in general score more highly than developing countries on the 10 public goals used by marine ecologist Benjamin Halpern of the US-based National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. Criteria included the amount of food provided from the ocean, jobs created, ecological protection and contribution to climate change.</p> <p>\"Many west African, Middle Eastern and central American countries score poorly compared to rich European countries like Canada (12th) and Australia (16th),\" says the report, published in science journal Nature. Germany scored 73 and is in seventh place, the US scored 63 (29th), and the UK, 62 (40th place). No country scored above 86 and most scored below 70. Only 10 countries scored higher than 70, whereas 50 scored under 50.</p> <p>The study found that about half of the 10 goals set by the scientists were getting worse but there was some good news too.</p> <p>\"Quite a few countries have done a lot to protect species. We are seeing restoration of habitats and a lot of countries are starting to implement more effective fishing management. Some things are definitely going right,\" said Halpern.</p> <p>\"It shows there is great room for improvement. Despite the successes of several developed countries in managing their fisheries, sustainable global food provision is far below what could be delivered if wild stocks were more sustainably harvested and sustainable mariculture production was increased,\" say the authors.</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft has now made the release build of Windows 8 available to developers and IT administrators with subscriptions. The empire strikes back, or the beginning of the end for Windows? </p> <p>It could be either. Windows 8 has had a mixed reception from those who have tried it in preview, with complaints mainly focused on the awkwardness of combining what often feels like two different operating systems into one. Microsoft has consciously made it hard to stay in the familiar Windows desktop environment and ignore the new-style \"Modern\" user interface, formerly known as Metro, which is optimised for touch control.</p> <p>There is only one Start menu, and it uses the Modern UI, while common files types such as images and PDF documents open by default in Modern apps. It makes for a jarring experience, especially if you have a laptop or desktop PC rather than a tablet.</p> <p>The release version of Windows 8 is not radically different from the previews, but there are some new things. The translucent window effects of the Aero theme in Windows 7 have gone, replaced by a blander, squarer look more in keeping with the Modern UI.</p> <p>The Windows 8 Store is coming to life, and a few paid-for apps have appeared, though the number should increase sharply by the time of general retail availability on 6 October. Currently it is still sparsely populated, though there are a few stand-out apps such as Weather and Finance.</p> <p>Note that while the Store only includes Modern UI apps for install and update, it also has links to external sites for selected desktop apps.</p> <h2>A new start</h2> <p>One cosmetic but welcome change is in the way shortcuts for desktop applications appear in the Start screen. In the preview, each one was a tiny icon surrounded by a big block of wasted space. There is still plenty of wasted space, but the icons are now bigger and centralised, improving their appearance (see screenshot at top). </p> <p>Microsoft has also been busy fixing bugs and fine-tuning performance. Windows 8 has demonstrated solid improvements over Windows 7 from the first preview, and the release build feels solid and brisk.</p> <p>Microsoft mentions several specifics: faster disk access yielding 10-20% speed-up in operations such as installing large applications; up to 35% faster resume from hibernation; much faster graphics and text rendering thanks to hardware acceleration, ranging from around 40% faster decoding of JPEG images to 438% faster drawing of rectangles, and much quicker Wi-Fi reconnection.</p> <p>What this means for desktop users is that if you can learn to live with occasional Modern UI inconveniences, it is hard to go back to Windows 7 \u2013 which feels distinctly slower on the same hardware.</p> <h2>In transition?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988334\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345050920077/tutorial.png\" alt=\"Windows 8 tutorial\" width=\"460\" height=\"218\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 8 now has a tutorial for new users</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another key question is whether Microsoft has done enough to get users past their initial disorientation. The main difference compared to the previews is the appearance of new animations at the end of the Windows 8 setup.</p> <p>\"After your PC is ready move the mouse into any corner,\" says the animation aimed at keyboard and mouse users, while there is a similar effort to encourage users to swipe in from the sides if using a tablet. This is minimal though, and many will need a more detailed survival guide. Some issues, notably the existence of two versions of Internet Explorer, are long-term annoyances.</p> <p>There are signs that Windows 8 is a transitional operating system. Even if you like the Modern UI and want to work in it as much as possible, the desktop is unavoidable for some tasks, and operations \u2013 say, safely removing an external USB drive \u2013 are awkward when there is no mouse available.</p> <p>Go to personalise your desktop, and you will find that while the colour selection dialog is touch-friendly, the Sounds control applet is little changed from Windows 7 and awkward without a mouse. Windows has always had its share of design inconsistency, but this is the most extreme in that respect.</p> <h2>Things to like</h2> <p>Along with the niggles, there is plenty to like. Installing and updating apps from the Store is delightfully easy, and safer than running third-party installers for desktop apps. The process of purchasing music or renting a video is similar to what we have already seen from Apple, Amazon and Google, but having this fully integrated with the operating system and with the same Microsoft account you use to sign into Windows does make it more seamless to use. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988335\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345050979263/buy-video.png\" alt=\"Windows 8: buy a video\" width=\"460\" height=\"228\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 8 lets you buy or rent videos as easily as in iTunes or on Android, for multiple devices including PC, Xbox and Windows Phone</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind the Modern UI distractions there is a big and impressive vision. For the consumer, it involves bringing together cloud, PC, tablet, Xbox and Windows Phone so that your content is available across all devices (within reason \u2013 no Office documents on Xbox), and getting settings like social media accounts and internet favourites (aka bookmarks) roam with you.</p> <p>The pitch to businesses is about migrating to a world of personal, touch-controlled mobile devices without losing the security and manageability Microsoft has developed for Windows PCs. Note that the forthcoming Windows Phone 8 is built on the same kernel as Windows 8, and with a similar developer platform.</p> <p>Microsoft's Office suite also has a key role, differentiating Windows 8 tablets from those running Apple iOS or Google Android, and enabling tablet users to do almost all their work without unpacking a laptop. </p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Report after report shows that the Windows ecosystem is hurting, and not only because of global recession. Macs at the high end, and Apple's iPad and iPhone, and Google Android in mobile, are eroding sales of PCs and laptops.</p> <p>Windows 8 is Microsoft's answer, and it is good work. The Modern UI environment is not only enjoyable for touch users, but also fixes many long-standing Windows problems around security, performance, and ease of use. Combine it with cloud services including the Windows Store, Office 2013 and Office 365, SkyDrive and Skype, and you can see that all the pieces are there.</p> <p>On the other hand, Microsoft is late to the tablet game \u2013 very late. App developers busy creating apps for iOS and Android will not rush to port to Windows 8 Modern UI until they see a strong market, and in that context the last thing Microsoft needs is Windows diehards devising ways to stay permanently in the desktop world, or vowing to stick with Windows 7, and there will be plenty of both.</p> <p>All this makes the fate of Windows 8 and its ecosystem a tough one to call. What is certain though is that if Microsoft had merely offered a refined, improved and faster Windows 7, the continuing decline of Windows would have been assured.</p> <p>Windows 8 is bold and different, and underpinned by solid technical improvements. Yes, it is confusing and inconsistent, needs more apps, and is tricky for existing Windows users getting started; but it is also the most capable tablet operating system out there and a useful upgrade for desktop users. Don't dismiss it.</p> <h2>Availability</h2> <p>Windows 8 is available from 15 August for paying members of MSDN and TechNet, Microsoft's developer and IT administrator subscriptions, and from 16 August for enterprises with Software Assurance. It will be available to purchase as part of business volume agreements from 1 September, and from 26 October for consumers and pre-installed.</p> <p>System requirements are 1Ghz processor, 1GB RAM (2GB for 64-bit), and a graphics card that supports DirectX 9.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August to correct the consumer release date for Windows 8</p> <h2>Gallery</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988336\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345051102125/win8-lock.png\" alt=\"Windows 8 lock screen\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Windows 8 lock screen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Windows 8 is now available in its release build to Microsoft subscribers</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988337\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345051223174/win8-desktop.png\" alt=\"Windows 8 desktop\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No Aero transparency on Windows 8</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Windows 8 desktop no longer supports \"Aero\" translucency</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988338\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345051297099/win8-store.png\" alt=\"Windows 8 store, ahead of launch\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Windows 8 store is filling up gradually</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Windows Store is still sparsely populated</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988339\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345051351285/win8-store2.png\" alt=\"Windows 8 store filling\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">... some apps are appearing in the Windows 8 store</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few paid-for apps have appeared in the Store</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394988340\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345051396988/legacy-start.png\" alt=\"Windows 8 legacy start screen\" width=\"317\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Windows 8 legacy Start screen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Desktop apps have better Start tiles than in the preview, but still waste space</p>",
  "<p>It seems to have become a default position in the increasingly tiresome Kevin Pietersen saga that he has been badly advised. But who does represent him? The story turns out to be as colourful and unorthodox as most chapters of Pietersen's tale.</p> <p>He did not have an agent when he arrived at Nottinghamshire from Natal as a 20-year-old in the spring of 2001. It was in the winter of 2002-3, when he was taken to play a season of grade cricket for Sydney University by the former Notts and Australia leg-spinner Stuart MacGill, that Pietersen met up with Adam Wheatley, a former rugby union player and Great Britain bobsleigh international who was already working with Sir Ian Botham and looking for clients.</p> <p>Wheatley and Botham were in Australia filming a Shredded Wheat commercial. Pietersen came to visit them on the set. By the time he returned to Trent Bridge for his third season in county cricket, he had his first agent.</p> <p>Mission Sports Management was incorporated in April 2004, with Wheatley as its managing director, and Botham its chairman. By that stage Pietersen's relationship with several of his Nottinghamshire team-mates had already turned sour, and at the end of that season he joined Hampshire, largely at the instigation of their captain Shane Warne.</p> <p>For the past eight years Mission Sports Management has flourished alongside Pietersen's cricket career and global profile. It now has an list of clients including Steve Cram, the former athlete and BBC commentator, and the a clutch of 2012 Olympians Ed Clancy, Beth Tweddle and Lawrence Okoye.</p> <p>It also represents a second England cricketer, Ian Bell \u2013 who is expected to take Pietersen's place at No4 in the batting order at Lord's this weekon Thursday, and has therefore been in a tricky position in the England dressing room. Botham sold his stake to Pietersen last year \u2013 meaning that Pietersen is now a director of Bell's management company, an unusual situation.</p> <p>There are two other directors of Mission Sports Management \u2013 Paul Harris, a chartered accountant, and Henry Spratt, who is a licensed football agent, although the company does not list any football clients on its website. It remains unclear to what extent they are responsible for the advice which Pietersen has been receiving as his relationship with his employers at the England and Wales Cricket Board and his international team-mates has fluctuated, and now deteriorated so badly, over the last few years.</p> <p>Wheatley has always been the go-to man for journalists looking for the Pietersen position, and he was the unseen interviewer when Pietersen renounced his one-day retirement, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiaZnXayjTQ\" title=\"\">on You Tube last Saturday night</a>, a video posted against the wishes of the ECB.</p> <p>In the past couple of days Pietersen has had a much higher-profile advocate in Piers Morgan, the former Daily Mirror editor and Pop Idol judge who pressed his case on BBC 5 Live's cricket show on Monday night in a spirited debate with Phil Tufnell and Michael Vaughan. Morgan was largely responsible for raising the profile of the spoof KP Genius Twitter account, which had certainly highlighted some of the divisions in the dressing room, and was keen to draw attention to the links between its previously anonymous author and several Nottingham-based England players \u2013 including Stuart Broad, the Twenty20 captain.</p> <p>Morgan's intervention helped to secure a guarantee from Broad that he had no involvement in the account, released through the ECB on Tuesday. Morgan clearly remained unconvinced, continuing to work the same theme on Twitter on Wednesday before drawing a line under the issue and stressing his support for England. But he also tweeted \u2013 in response to suggestions that with friends like him, Pietersen was in no need of enemies \u2013 that he had \"never 'advised' Pietersen in my life (and he wouldn't, rightly, listen if I tried!) \u2013 I just hate the way he's being treated\".</p> <p>It appears that, as he has been throughout his England career, Pietersen is still represented solely by Wheatley, who has been keeping a low profile through the last few days as he has conducted negotiations with the ECB, leading to Tuesday's apology. The question remains whether Pietersen would have been better-advised to offer it sooner \u2013 in which case he might have played at Lord's.</p>",
  "<p>Values have taken centre stage over the last year in the realms of politics, finance, business and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/leveson-inquiry\" title=\"\">the media</a>. But values are also at the heart of campaigns to promote sustainable behaviour and have been core to debates on how to effectively communicate climate change (and what individuals, communities and businesses can do about it).</p> <p>In one camp are those who say that it does not matter which values environmental campaigns target, so long as they are popular with the campaign's audience. In the other camp are those who point to <a href=\"http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/meeting_environmental_challenges___the_role_of_human_identity.pdf\" title=\"\">the evidence</a> from social psychology that shows how certain values tend to be more strongly associated with pro-environmental behaviours.</p> <p>Typically, individuals who are more altruistic, or who rank 'self-transcending' values highly \u2013 for example benevolence or respect for the environment \u2013 are more likely to engage in sustainable behaviours, whereas people who are more materialistic and ambitious (known as 'self-enhancing' values) are more likely to overlook them.</p> <p>But empirical evidence on which to test campaigners' competing claims has been <a href=\"http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?hl=en&amp;q=http://gin.confex.com/gin/2009/webprogram/Manuscript/Paper2233/Simple-and-painles-JACC.pdf&amp;sa=X&amp;scisig=AAGBfm3xZnjdsouo3miGmmBKcI4L-5cGCQ&amp;oi=scholarr&amp;ei=jyAqUO_6M-mn0QXG1oHwAQ&amp;ved=0CEMQgAMoADAA\" title=\"\">scarce</a>. Should climate change be sold using whatever means necessary \u2013 emphasising the convenience of sustainable behaviours, appealing to people's wallets or their social status? Or should environmental campaigns work to strengthen self-transcending values in their audience and the general population, on the basis that this is more important in the long-term?</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate1662.html\" title=\"\">research published this week in Nature Climate Change</a> (led by Laurel Evans), we focused on exactly this question, asking whether the reasons given for one sustainable behaviour impact on people's tendency to engage in another sustainable behaviour \u2013 that is, the chance of spillover between one behaviour and another.</p> <p>Across two experiments with undergraduate students at Cardiff University, we primed groups of participants with different reasons for car-sharing. One group completed a true/false quiz focusing on the money-saving (self-interested) reasons for car-sharing, while another group completed the same quiz with environmental (self-transcendent) reasons as the focus. Two additional groups were included for comparison \u2013 one received both types of reasons, the other simply read generic information about travel choices.</p> <p>As well as the quiz, participants in the experiment completed several other tasks, and finally received instructions to dispose of the study materials before leaving the room. Our question was whether they would choose the recycling or the general waste bin. We found that the group which had been primed with environmental reasons for car-sharing were more likely to recycle.</p> <p>These results are one of the first direct tests of the competing claims about values in environmental campaigning, and would seem to suggest that self-transcending values really are more likely to bring about spillover from one behaviour to another.</p> <p>Clearly, sustainable behaviour is about much more than recycling (and we did not find a spillover effect on several other measures). But if a simple quiz \u2013 priming people with one set of values, rather than another \u2013 can have a measurable impact on behaviour, imagine how important this kind of process could be if it was scaled up by businesses, charities, or government agencies.</p> <p>This does not mean that campaigners should be in the business of trying to change people's values. The vast majority of people identify with both self-transcendent and self-enhancing values, but tend to prioritise one set as a lens for viewing the world. The marketing of physical products like cars and mobile phones, ensures that we receive hundreds of messages based on self-enhancing values every day. But should campaigns for sustainability fall into the same trap?</p> <p>Perhaps inevitably, the values debate has tended to give the impression that climate change communication is an ideological choice between hippy types who would love to see a more self-transcending society, and harder-nosed, pragmatic realists who just want to get the job done.</p> <p>But if organisations are actively trying to make sustainable behaviour more desirable, then the lesson from this new research is clear: there are certain values that must be strengthened and nurtured if meaningful engagement from the public is to be achieved.</p> <p>Ultimately, people can figure out for themselves whether something will save them money \u2013 the challenge for sustainability campaigns is to reveal the bigger picture.</p> <p>Although an appeal to someone's wallet may be the quickest way of getting their attention, the message they receive is that it's good to save money, not that it's good to save the environment. And in the long run, that message is not a useful one for promoting sustainability.</p> <p><em>Adam Corner is a research associate at </em><a href=\"http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Cardiff University</em></a><em> and policy advisor to the </em><a href=\"http://coinet.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Climate Outreach and Information Network</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Internationalisation in higher education is nothing new. For decades - before there were economic gains to be made from international student recruitment and possibly even before the term was coined - the brightest and wealthiest students from developing countries have gone to study abroad. The institutions selected have been as much a reflection of the political ties between countries, as they've been an indication of a student's personal ambitions.</p> <p>But since the development of the higher education market, the rising costs of a university education and the diminishing support of governments through the public purse, universities - old and new - are actively pursuing internationalisation strategies. The other big change of course, is that the new key players in higher education (India, China and Brazil) reflect wider geopolitical shifts.</p> <p>Still, to see internationalisation as simply synonymous with international student recruitment is both a limited approach and one loaded with concerns over neo-colonialism and imperialism. The sector now speaks more of international partnerships \u2013 from research collaborations and consultancy to academic and student exchanges.</p> <p>Engaging globally has becomes both more popular and more complex. In turn, universities are beginning to adopt a variety of approaches \u2013 often led by institution heads. </p> <p>In this brave new world, how do you go about developing a strategy that works and is embedded in your existing institutional culture? How do you pick your partners and as universities start multiple partnerships in multiple countries, how do you determine who the stakeholders are, to whom you should be accountable? And, perhaps most contentious of all, how do you assess internationalisation strategies? Should universities measure their activities or the impact of those activities? Ultimately, what does quality look like in international higher education?</p> <p>Join our panel, Friday 17 August to understand the place internationalisation strategies fill within wider higher education and share your experiences and expertise on how the best internationalisation strategies are developed.</p> <p><em>The live chat will begin at 12 BST and will be in the comment threads beneath this blog.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Fabrice Muamba made it. The odds were stacked against him, even more than they are against most people, since he was forced to flee his homeland as a child and try to find a fulfilling path through an alien environment.</p> <p>Yes, he was armed with a precious talent, but not with as much of it as many people who did not reach such a high level in professional football.</p> <p>He made it because he augmented his talent with such diligence and determination that he set himself apart from countless others who probably fancied they could have gone as high or higher than he did. Extraordinary tenacity and dynamism were the hallmarks of his playing style.</p> <p>Sorrow is inescapable when anyone is robbed by ill-health of something or someone they love; it is thoroughly sad that Muamba will not be able to resume the football career that he worked so hard to build.</p> <p>While he seems to have been pitiless in what he demanded from himself in order to succeed, he appears to have been gentle with others: the content of the cascade of tributes that flowed after he collapsed at White Hart Lane in March attested to a player who was popular not merely because he had a glamorous job but also because he seemed untainted by the attendant glitz and guff. Self-aware and affable, he is exactly the sort of person that commentators overlooked last week when they complained glibly about how much more savoury Olympians are than footballers.</p> <p>While there is a sense of dismay that such misfortune should befall one of the nice guys, there is also cause to be grateful: firstly, of course, because while Muamba has lost his career, he did not lose his life despite suffering a cardiac arrest. And secondly because the 24-year-old Muamba, by overcoming adversity to play for three Premier League clubs and become the second-highest capped England Under-21 international, has indicated that he has the qualities to deal with his anguish and go on to make it in another field, too.</p> <p>He may stay in football, where many people have forged fine careers after their playing days were truncated by injury or ill health; he may go into business, making use of the accountancy qualifications that he obtained while pursuing his football career; he may do both, or he may do something else.</p> <p>Whatever he chooses to do, he is likely to set about it with sedulousness and guts. And the best wishes of millions.</p>",
  "<p>Three activists protesting in support of jailed feminist punk band Pussy Riot were detained on Wednesday as tensions in the Russian capital heat up ahead of a verdict in a trial that is being seen as a key test of Vladimir Putin's crackdown on dissent.</p> <p>Wearing the bright balaclavas made famous by Pussy Riot, 18 men and women gathered on the steps of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour carrying a sign with the biblical quote \"blessed are the merciful\".</p> <p>Guards at the cathedral broke up the peaceful protest, ripping off activists' masks, twisting their arms behind their backs and kicking at least one photographer in the face as he tried to take a picture.</p> <p>Three members of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot</a>, jailed since March after performing an anti-Putin \"punk prayer\" inside the cathedral, are due to hear a verdict in their case on Friday. They have been charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred. Prosecutors have called for a three-year sentence.</p> <p>The trial against the women \u2013 Maria Alyokhina, 24, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30 \u2013 has become the first step in Putin's crackdown on dissent following unprecedented protests against him that began in December, the women's supporters say. Prosecutors have also brought charges against opposition leader Alexey Navalny and more than a dozen people who took part in a 6 May protest that turned violent. Police have shut down businesses belonging to Gennady Gudkov, a leading opposition deputy, amid rumours he may lose his parliamentary mandate.</p> <p>\"The repressions will only strengthen with time and this will lead us to where Egypt, Libya and now Syria are,\" said Nikolai Polozov, a lawyer for the three women.</p> <p>During a nine-day trial marked by procedural violations and absurd lines of questioning, the prosecution argued that the women's performance inside the cathedral was not political, but an attempt to offend all of Russian Orthodoxy. The women, in powerful closing statements delivered last week, argued that they sought to highlight the destructively close ties between church and state as part of the greater anti-Putin message that drives all their performances.</p> <p>The trial has revived passions inside Russia against Putin's return to the presidency, with critics comparing the campaign against Pussy Riot to a Stalinist witch hunt. The Russian opposition has called on supporters to gather in front of the courthouse in balaclavas on Friday at 2pm (11am GMT), one hour before the verdict is due to be delivered.</p> <p>\"No matter what we hope for, we are looking at this situation realistically. Considering how trials happen in Russia, we think it will probably be a guilty verdict with a serious sentence in a penal colony,\" Polozov said.</p> <p>Artists around the world have seized upon the case. Actors at the Royal Court in London will stage readings of the women's closing statements on Friday, and in New York actors, including Chloe Sevigny, will conduct a reading on Thursday.</p> <p>Madonna, Bjork, Franz Ferdinand the Red Hot Chili Peppers are among those who have performed in support of the group.</p> <p>Dozens of cities have joined the call of Pussy Riot's supporters to conduct a Global Pussy Riot Day on Friday, with protests planned from Barcelona to Vienna.</p> <p>Not all protest attempts have been successful. Amnesty International said the Russian embassy in Washington, DC thwarted its attempt on Tuesday to deliver a petition with 70,000 signatures calling for the women's release. An embassy employee \"not only rejected Amnesty International's pleas to take our concerns to Moscow, he unceremoniously dumped the petitions on the pavement,\" the group said in a statement. \"If this and other actions taken by Russian authorities are any indication, Putin's vision for the country is a complete breakdown of a free and just society.\"</p> <p>Amnesty International has declared the three women prisoners of conscience.</p> <p>The Russian opposition has called for a day-long protest on Sunday to commemorate those who lost their lives defending the Russian White House during a 1991 coup attempt. The event will seek to capitalise on the growing anger against the Putin government's handling of Pussy Riot.</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>The other one that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/03/judo-olympics-2012-get-involved\">isn't karate</a> (seriously, why isn't karate in the Olympics?). If all the martial arts were elements of a night out in Warrington, taekwondo constitutes the coked-up pre-club street scuffle to judo's drunken barside reconciliation. Where the latter fusses tearfully, grappling with emotional truths, the former delivers a preposterous bravura kick to the temple and moves on. </p> <p>As a pursuit, it seems mainly to involve getting incredibly hard; I once went to a taster session and they made us do fist pressups for an hour. If you're looking for a gruelling all-round workout, along with the ability to silence dissent with a twitch of your quadriceps, this could be the sport for you.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>Taekwondo, which translates as \"the way of breaking things with the hand or foot\", originated in Korea and consists of a system of punches, kicks and blocks, sometimes with sweeps and throws. A training session often involves doing all of them in formation with other class members, like the world's most belligerent flashmob, or like one Thriller tribute group defending its territory against another. While the punches are fearsome, kicks are favoured in higher-level competition because of their greater range and power. Emphasis is also placed in training on etiquette, respect and mindfulness.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>A truly punishing discipline. Taekwondo builds strength, stamina, flexibility and focus.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>Students wear a <em>dobok</em> \u2013 jacket and trousers \u2013 tied at the waist, in white or black. As with other martial arts, the darker the belt the better. A white beginner's set can be yours for around \u00a330.</p> <p>Taekwondo is one of those sports you'll find difficult to undertake without a club. Luckily, there are loads. This <a href=\"http://www.britishtaekwondo.org.uk/find-taekwondo-club.html\">handy tool on the British Taekwondo site</a> should help you find your nearest.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 9/10</h2> <p>There's a lot to be said for the sheer brutality of a spinning headkick in a world of <em>health and safety gone mad</em>. Though not by you. You'll be too busy looking for your teeth to say anything.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Adrian Tranter, president of British Taekwondo:</strong> \"I would encourage anyone to practise taekwondo. Of course we are an Olympic sport, and if that's the level you want to aspire to, then get involved at one of our clubs by visiting <a href=\"http://www.britishtaekwondo.org\">britishtaekwondo.org</a>.</p> <p>You may wish to practise a martial art for a variety of other reasons \u2013 to become more self-reliant, develop higher self-esteem, be more confident, get healthy, learn how to defend yourself, become more flexible or generally just be involved in an enthusiastic club environment.</p> <p>Anyone can do taekwondo, from five years to 75 years \u2013 there are no barriers whatsoever.

  "<p>The continued influence of the internet over most aspects of our daily lives is the primary reason behind the explosion in the use of online surveys by marketers and market research companies in recent years.</p> <p>The attractions are obvious \u2013 online surveys can be conducted more cost effectively than printed, telephone or face-to-face activity and because of the nature of the medium, feedback can often be delivered within much shorter time frames.</p> <p>The downside is that a failure to construct the survey properly risks not engaging with the respondent, which can have major implications for data quality with a knock-on effect on the quality of the insights received. But by re-thinking the design of surveys and leveraging the interactive and visual potential of the online environment, we have found in our own research that the more respondents enjoy the experience, the better the quantity and quality of feedback. It was this enjoyment factor that led us to look to games for further inspiration.</p> <p>Think for a moment about the role that games play in our lives. Have you ever been so absorbed in a crossword or a quiz that you've missed your train or bus stop? Are you involved in an online duel with a friend in one of the many games hosted on social networking sites? Have you played the slot machine in a casino, or perhaps used one of the 22m games consoles in use in the UK?</p> <p>Our year-long study involved more than 30 research experiments undertaken on behalf of six clients \u2014 Sony Music, Allianz Insurance, AMS, Heinz, Kimberly Clark and Mintel Research \u2013 involving more than 5,000 respondents. We believe the findings could fundamentally change the way online research is conducted.</p> <p>We began by exploring how questions could be redesigned to be more game-like in nature. We experimented with the wording of questions, to humanise them, make them more engaging and link them to potential real-world emotional experiences. For example, instead of asking somebody to tell us the clothing they liked to wear, we asked them what clothing they would wear for a first date. Instead of telling us where they liked to go on holiday, we invited them to imagine that they had to publish a magazine offering holiday recommendations. The results were instructive: there were two or even three times as much feedback to the more engaging questions and consistently more time taken in providing the answers.</p> <p>Rules can transform a boring task into a game. How does a 10-mile hike in the rain carrying a 15kg rucksack sound? But what about a game of golf? We explored how the rules with which many people are accustomed through game-playing could be adapted to turn questions into more mental puzzles. A question such as \"describe yourself\" yielded on average 2.4 descriptors and effectively 85% of respondents answered. When that question was adjusted to deliver the challenge of, \"describe yourself in exactly seven words\" the descriptors increased to 4.5 and the response rate rose to 98%.</p> <p>We also looked at how video and online games are structured to provide the player with tasks that when put together become a series of quests. For example, we asked respondents how much they liked a list of music acts presented to them. Typically, this yielded a list of 83 artists who were evaluated \u2013 not bad. However, when we asked them to imagine they owned their own radio station and asked which of the artists they would put on their station's playlist, respondents seemed willing to spend longer deliberating and the average number of artists evaluated rose to 148.</p> <p>Most game playing, of course, taps into our competitive spirit so we explored ways in which we could add a more competitive framework to questions. When we asked respondents to make a list of their favourite foods, we received an average of six items in response. When we told them they had two minutes to make a list of their favourite foods, not only were respondents conditioned to spend the arbtrary two minutes allocated, but it also produced an average of 35 items in reply. That can make a major difference to the quality and insight a brand would receive from its online research.</p> <p>Rewards also have a major role to play so we explored how we could incorporate rewards into surveys. A typical question like, \"what emotions do you think people associate with this ...\" produced an average response time of 8 seconds and a 50% enjoyment rate. When we told respondents that they would win a point for each one they guessed right, time spent rose to 12 seconds and 90% said they enjoyed the experience.</p> <p>Much of this so far has dealt with language, but design and visuals are also important. We experimented with more fun selection processes where, for example, on the playlist question, respondents could literally post a \"banned\" sticker over the artist's name.</p> <p>When we gave them a packet of crisps and a series of labels to describe the crisps, ranging from positive statements like \"well designed\" and \"good colours\" to more negative statements like \"unoriginal\" and asked them to place the labels against the picture, we found both click count and enjoyment levels improved \u2013 15% more clicks and 50% more fun on the part of the respondent. The game concept became even more popular when we gave instant feedback, for example, by revealing their suggestions as correct on screen; 80% of respondents said they enjoyed this approach.</p> <p>With the theory established, the next challenge for us was to put these techniques into practice and we have worked with a range of clients from different industries to see how we could apply these techniques to the types of research they typically conduct. Experiments included a media diary, brand imagery, usage and attitude, and co-creation style research questions and a range of game approaches.</p> <p>Across the board we saw consistently high completion rates and enjoyment scores; respondents willingly spending significantly more time answering, and a greater quantity and quality of response to our gamified questions. The research showed almost everyone will respond to game mechanics, and, given the right sort of mechanic, tailored to your audience and research needs, these techniques really deliver.</p> <p><em>Deborah Sleep is director of </em><a href=\"http://www.engage-research.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Engage Research</em></a><em> \u2013 follow the organisation on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/engageresearch\" title=\"\"><em>@engageresearch</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), one of the largest and most controversial companies on the London Stock Exchange, has been forced to slash its dividend and capital spending after seeing a 40% plunge to $1.1bn (\u00a3700m) in first half profits.</p> <p>The Kazakh-focused mining group at the centre of a recent storm over corporate governance, has been badly hit by a global economic slowdown that has sent commodity prices spinning downwards.</p> <p>The dividend was cut by 60% to 6.5\u00a2 per share while wider spending plans for 2012 have been cut by $300m to $2.4bn and a longer term investment target of $8.8bn is now under review.</p> <p>\"We have implemented a review of our capex (spending on) projects and are revising the development plan for our copper assets in the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) so as to improve the capital efficiency of our investment programme and returns to shareholders,\" said Felix Vulis, the ENRC chief executive.</p> <p>The company said it expected \"volatile market environment and pricing uncertainty\" to persist, putting further pressure on ENRC to come up quickly with a comprehensive restructuring promised earlier.</p> <p>ENRC shares fell 7% to 385p bringing cumulative losses of nearly 50% over the last 12 months as a result of a worsening business environment for mining but also because of internal disputes and poor corporate governance structures.</p> <p>Last year former GlaxoSmithKline chairman Sir Richard Sykes, and another non-executive director, Ken Olisa, were pushed off the board leading the latter to claim the company's approach to business was \"more Soviet than City\".</p> <p>In June ENRC brought in two new non-execs in British American Tobacco chairman, Richard Burrows, and World Bank executive, Mohsen Khalil. Last week it announced further changes in the chairmanships of internal committees in an attempt to \"refresh\" them.</p> <p>There was no further news on Wednesday on plans to either spin off or bring in new partners for the international business outside of Kazakhstan but more information could come at a City briefing planned for October.</p> <p>The $1.1bn first half profit figure was slightly ahead of City forecasts but underlying earnings per share of 36\u00a2 per share, compared with 91\u00a2 for the same period last year, were below the forecasts of mining analysts at Barclays Capital.</p> <p>In a research note on ENRC the investment bank said \"we retain our long-running concern over the company's balance sheet and think it is a near certainty the company raises capital over the next six months.\"</p> <p>Analysts at Credit Suisse said ENRC had over-extended itself by spending more than $5bn on acquisitions over the last three years \"at the wrong stage in the cycle, resulting in rapidly rising debt levels.\"</p> <p>The company has seen net borrowing levels rise by more than 100% since last year to $3.4bn. It said it would be spending less this year on its iron ore project in Brazil and expected no significant recovery in either iron ore or ferrochrome prices this year.</p>",
  "<p>Tanzania is facing a global protest campaign over claims that it wants to force Maasai pastoralists off their land to make way for game hunting by royals from the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>Nearly 750,000 people have signed the Stop the Serengeti Sell-Off petition on the <a href=\"http://avaaz.org/en/save_the_maasai/?slideshow\" title=\"\">online activism site Avaaz.org</a>, which says government ministers' Twitter and email accounts are also being swamped by messages from its members. But the Tanzanian government vehemently denies the allegations, maintaining that those who sign the petition are being misled by an \"unfounded and nonexistent eviction claim\".</p> <p>Disputes over the land on which the Maasai live and herd their cattle <a href=\"http://www.justconservation.org/the-corridor-loliondo\" title=\"\">have been running for 20 years</a>. Seeking income from tourism, the government has welcomed foreign investors including the Ortelo Business Corporation (OBC), a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/06/masai-tribesman-tanzania-tourism\" title=\"\">safari company set up by a UAE official close to the Dubai royal family</a>.</p> <p>Up to 48,000 Maasai living in the Loliondo area face eviction in a deal that could hand over huge swaths of land for the commercial hunting of prize game such as leopards and lions by UAE royals, claims Avaaz.</p> <p>Mzee Orosikos, a Maasai elder, said: \"For us, our land is everything, but these Arab princes have no respect for the animals or our rights. Many of us would rather die than be forced to move again.\"</p> <p>Another local pastoralist and campaigner, Samwel Nangiria, accused the government of planning to create a corridor of 1,500 sq km for use by UAE hunters. \"This is a shock,\" he said. \"The government is telling us to compromise but people say they have given up enough. Giving up the Serengeti national park was a lifelong compromise then. They will not be pushed again.\"</p> <p>Nangiria, co-ordinator of the Ngonett civil society group, added: \"The government is saying to pastoralists go back where you came from.\"</p> <p>He said the last mass evictions took place in 2009, forcing thousands of Maasai to surrender land where they had grazed cattle for generations. Avaaz added that some 350 homes were burnt to the ground, 25 people beaten by the police and tens of thousands of animals starved.</p> <p>Representatives of the Maasai appealed to Avaaz for help in opposing any deal. The petition is addressed to Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete, but the government insists that there are no plans to force the Maasai out.</p> <p>George Matiko, spokesman for the resources and tourism ministry, said: \"<a href=\"http://www.mnrt.go.tz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=287:the-ministry-of-natural-resources-and-tourism-refutes-claims-on-evictionof-maasai-in-the-serengeti&amp;catid=39:news-and-anouncements\" title=\"\">Such a move cannot be taken by the United Republic of Tanzania</a> in the Serengeti as it is a national parkwhere people do not settle. Moreover, no eviction exercise has been planned for the Serengeti district, which is one of the districts in Mara region. In the Serengeti there is no hunting bloc allocated to Middle Eastern kings and princes to hunt lions and leopards.\"</p> <p>Emma Ruby-Sachs, campaign director at Avaaz, said: \"Rather than address the substance of the Avaaz campaign and the concerns of the Maasai, the Tanzanian government is playing cynical word games \u2013 the Maasai lands in question are commonly understood to be within the Serengeti ecosystem. If the government does not believe there is any threat to the Maasai lands, it should be easy for it to commit to a policy of not forcibly evicting any of its people to make way for foreign interests.\" <strong> </strong></p>",
  "<h2>BERNE BABY BERNE</h2> <p>As is customary when the Fiver has an England friendly to write about, this morning $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver's phone jingle-jangled in the inside pocket of his navy blue pinstripe waistcoat and put new life in to one of his left nipples. It had become flat and chafed after our jaunty cousin had spent several days trapped in the bowels of the Olympic Stadium attempting to escape the rabid attentions of someone who looked very much like Jessie J and alas, since she was still rutting against his hip singing a Queen medley in several different keys all at once, he could not take the call. Still, in this magnificent post-Olympic utopia the Fiver's Scottish cousin, Shortbread McFiver, would surely be more than willing to step in to the breach.</p> <p>Shortbread has had a torrid time of it, though, for even after knocking back the hair and the dog, he could definitely see two Roy Hodgsons! For here was Roy in a home-made FREE JT tabard (the picture was Deirdre Rachid but he had drawn an England badge on her chest) saying that he hoped the FA would forget all of that business with Anton Ferdinand and let the nation's brave removed leader return in time for the World Cup qualifiers next month. Yet here was Roy talking about all the lessons that he and his players have learned from the Olympic athletes, Jessica Whatsername and Mobot, saying earnestly: \"We can learn from the enormous grace and humility the athletes have shown.\"</p> <p>\"Ma heed!\" cried Shortbread.</p> <p>It all got a bit better after Football Against R@cism exec Piara Powar called Roy's plea for EBJT's freedom \"foolish\", mind, and everyone tried really hard to concentrate on tonight's friendly against Italy. Cesar Prandelli's side will be without Andrea Pirlo (none of the Juventus or Napoli players are involved after their Italian Super Cup exploits) but nonetheless confident of repeating the result that put England out of Euro 2012 in the Week 5 BO (all time will now be measured according to hebdomadis Olympia). On that occasion the blossoming partnership between Joe Hart and Andy Carroll was given free licence to grant England a split-second's possession in the Italian half every few minutes, but even that outlet will be closed. Hart is not playing.</p> <p>\"I don't have a magical formula that will suddenly change what we were trying to do in the Euros and revolutionise things overnight,\" said Hodgson, turning out his pockets and sending a shiny farthing spinning on to the table. England were overrun in midfield at the Euros but have the fresh-faced new partnership of Frank Lampard and Michael Carrick to orchestrate things this time around. \"In victory [the Olympic athletes] were humble and in defeat superb \u2026 let's hope football can learn from that and earn a few Brownie points,\" Hodgson added, ensuring that at least something about his Grace &amp; Humility XI would go down as 'superb' this evening.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\"><em>Follow England 1-2 Italy with Paul Doyle from 7.30pm tonight</em></a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Football has been my life since I was a teenage boy and it has given me so many opportunities.

  "<p>Last year, the Pew Research Center released one of its occasional <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2011/05/04/beyond-red-vs-blue-the-political-typology/\">typological surveys of the US political landscape</a> \u2013 the fifth in total, and the first since 2005. The findings of \"Beyond Red v Blue\" were significant in the context of the present presidential election \u2013 and, not least, Mitt Romney's pick of Paul Ryan as his would be vice-president. What it uncovered was a volatile politics in the midst of a period of transition, changing in ways that, perhaps, confounded some of the narratives that the media had assumed.</p> <p>The political landscape, Pew assessed, had become more polarized and \"doctrinaire at both ends of the political spectrum\". That much, at least, is certain. At the same time, the survey observed, the space occupied by independents had expanded sharply since the last similar exercise, by some 7%. These are voters notable for holding strong views on individual issues while often defying old party orthodoxies and loyalties on others.</p> <p>For those who identified themselves as \"mostly Republican\", the survey broke down the voters into two groups: \"staunch conservative\", characterised as \"highly-engaged Tea Party supporters\", and \"Main Street Republicans\", who together accounted for 20% of the general public. It calculated 37% were on the \"mostly Democratic\" side of the equation, which it broke down into three categories. Most interesting and perhaps most diverse, however, was the final group \u2013 \"mostly Independent\" \u2013 at 33% of potential voters (including Libertarians, described as \"free-market, small government seculars\"; \"disaffecteds\", who are defined as \"downscale and cynical\"; and \"postmoderns\", who are \"moderates but liberal on social issues\").</p> <p>I think this survey explains some important things both about the Romney campaign, why he picked Ryan as his running-mate, and how that choice might play out.</p> <p>It is a general truism of more recent democratic politics, as true in Europe as in the US, that successful campaigns do not tend to move sharply away from their own political centre \u2013 the point at which they can ensure both the support of their base while also, crucially, attracting voters from outside of that core group. Indeed, as David McKay has noted in his book American Politics and Society in his chapter on the Changing Role of Political Parties (see <a href=\"http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/mckay/pdfs/chapter5.pdf\">chapter 5, pdf</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A defining characteristic of both the Democrats and the Republicans is that they have constantly sought to appeal to as wide a spectrum of voters as possible. As such, they have been obliged to promise general rather than specific benefits to voters.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>McKay, too, noted the same emerging paradox in US politics as the Pew survey does:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[W]hile the parties are more ideologically divided than they used to be, many voters remain generally apathetic and uninterested in politics.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If the present political environment is complex and toxic, characterised by a growing distrust of the political system, the present incarnation of Republicanism, the Pew survey argued, gifted at least some advantages \u2013 both in terms of its greater ideological homogeneity and in what it called an \"intensity advantage\" that delivered Tea Party gains in the 2010 midterms. Where it did identify an emerging Republican problem, however, was in \"maintaining solid support among the GOP-oriented groups in the centre\", not least among the \"cross-pressured 'disaffecteds'\" among the \"mostly Independents\", one of the groupings Romney needs to convince if he is to win.</p> <p>Which brings us to the choice of Paul Ryan.</p> <p>Faced with the challenges facing both Obama and Romney in persuading an electorate increasingly sceptical of both parties, one might have expected the Republican candidate to use his choice of vice-president to tick some boxes that would appeal outside of the core activist base. Indeed, only a few months ago, polling on Romney's vice-presidential pick \u2013 although hardly conclusive evidence of much \u2013 seemed to suggest that Ryan would not bring many advantages, compared with the likes of Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush or Chris Christie, to the Romney campaign, either in name recognition or in widening the ticket's appeal. So what, precisely, has Ryan brought to the party?</p> <p>The reality, as <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79697.html\">Politico argued on Tuesday</a> after off-the-record interviews with over a dozen anonymous GOP activists, is a whole bundle of new worries. For while Romney has assiduously avoided many specifics that might turn off key voters, Ryan is all about them. A dogwhistle ideologue, his positions on everything from his dogmatic pro-life voting record to his small government stance and his economic prescriptions that would cut taxes for the wealthiest and benefits for the poorest appeal most to \"staunch conservatives\" and Tea Party activists.</p> <p>Confounding, too, is why Romney would have picked a running-mate whose views on an issue \u2013 his desire to reform the Medicare program \u2013 is likely to alarm strongly the group most over-represented even among \"staunch conservatives\": senior voters. As the Pew survey observed, older voters are represented \"disproportionately\" in the \"staunch conservative\" bloc where over 61% are 50 or older; yet, at least two polls have recently suggested that this same group (senior voters) is largely opposed to Medicare reform. This is doubly baffling as political strategy, as <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/106099/ryan-romney-seniors\">Nate Cohn argued in the New Republic earlier this week</a>, because you would think Romney would not want to risk alienating seniors, who are the one significant group among whom Obama has not made gains between 2004-2008 and ought to be a natural Republican-leaning constituency.</p> <p>But it is not just with seniors that Ryan brings risks to the Romney campaign. The Ryan Plan, his challenge to Obama's economic strategy which Romney has remarked flatteringly on and which has won broad backing from House Republicans, also seems out of step with the views of the wider electorate that Romney must win. For while \"Beyond Red v Blue\" noted that \"majorities in most typology groups say the country will need both to cut spending and raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit\", \"staunch conservatives\" alone remained the exception, saying the focus should be on cutting spending. Indeed, Ryan \u2013 most controversially of all \u2013 would actually cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans.</p> <p>With the Republican presidential campaign already facing an escalating offensive over Ryan's views and how much Romney endorses them, it seems rather bizarre that the party's presumptive nominee \u2013 who lags behind the incumbent by most indicators \u2013 would pick as a running-mate a controversial figure with limited appeal, whose views he is now being forced to defend. The reality, as \"Beyond Red v Blue\" has described, and others have noted since Ryan's pick, is that Romney is caught on the horns of a dilemma. A candidate who is not \"conservative enough\" for his own base but needs to attract both wavering Democrats and Independents, he has failed to find an overarching and widely appealing political pitch that would allow him to hedge his bets.</p> <p>Perhaps, in the present climate and configuration of the parties and where they stand, that was always impossible. But his choice \u2013 punting for Ryan to reassure the base \u2013 looks like poor politics and, potentially, an electorally fatal error.</p>",

  "<p>I am writing this in the grips of a profound headache, largely brought on by my stumbling efforts to get a grip on where we are with our economies.</p> <p>If our global economy were a commercial aircraft, and I one of the pilots, the entire instrument panel would be covered in flashing lights. But instead of sounding steady alarms, most would be stuttering on and off in apparently random patterns, making coherent responses very difficult. And that mental image had me racing back to the inquiry report on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447\" title=\"\">Air France 447</a>, which disappeared en route from Rio de Janeiro to Charles de Gaulle on 1 June 2009.</p> <p>Apart from routine fears of flying, those boarding the Airbus A330 would have had no reason to expect anything untoward. But, in the worst accident in French aviation history, the plane fell out of the sky into the Atlantic, killing all 228 people aboard. The causes were a mystery for air crash investigators, though early suspicions focused on the possible icing up of the critical airspeed monitoring devices called pitot tubes. It took Herculean efforts to retrieve the black boxes, but they provided a much clearer idea of what had gone so dramatically wrong.</p> <p>The final inquiry report, published last month, points to many interlinked contributory factors. The first was that the pilot tubes had iced up, robbing the automatic pilot of vital information. So the autopilot disconnected itself, and a pilot took over. At this point, due to lack of relevant training, he did precisely the wrong thing \u2013 pulling the nose up when it should have been pushed down to prevent a stall.</p> <p>The crew then found themselves in a position where their instruments were giving misleading information, where the autopilot was making assumptions based on software rather than reality, and the aircraft had its nose pointing upwards when it was actually in free-fall.</p> <p>It isn't hard to see parallels with those guiding our economies today, both in terms of the imminent danger of financial stalling and of the longer-term risks posed by climate change and the destabilisation of the biosphere. Again, we are feeding all sorts of assumptions into our economic and commercial autopilots \u2013 some accurate, some not.</p> <p>And even when things seem moderately stable, market autopilots can go berserk; think of the recent runaway trading by the Knight Capital Group's algorithms <a href=\"http://articles.marketwatch.com/2012-08-14/industries/33191162_1_knight-shares-preopen-trade-market\" title=\"\">which wiped away three-quarters of the firm's equity value</a> almost overnight.</p> <p>Interesting, then, to see US Securities and Exchange Commission chair, <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-151.htm\" title=\"\">Mary Schapiro</a>, insisting that the use of computers is now a fact of life, that accidents happen, and that previous measures (including so-called market circuit-breakers) adopted in the wake of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash\" title=\"\">so-called Flash Crash</a> helped moderate the scale of the Knight Capital meltdown.</p> <p>A different take comes from John Fullerton of the Capital Institute, in his reflections on the <a href=\"http://www.capitalinstitute.org/blog/good-knight-htf\" title=\"\">wider implications</a> of Knight's \"near-death experience\".</p> <p>One book in my must-read-soon stack is <a href=\"http://www.scottpattersonreports.com/books/dark-pools/\" title=\"\">Dark Pools</a>, by Wall Street Journal reporter Scott Patterson, exploring the implications of the privately owned, lightly regulated exchanges \"where artificially intelligent machines now trade vast sums of money behind closed doors.\"</p> <p>In their attempts to build \"robot versions of Warren Buffett,\" the financial whizzkids at the centre of this story are creating an economic mechanism that will be very hard for humans to understand, let alone control.</p> <p>Now pull back and take a look at some wider defects in our market systems. Another reason for my headache was an opinion piece by long-term investor Jeremy Grantham in <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f2f7fae-e531-11e1-8ac0-00144feab49a.html\" title=\"\">The Financial Times</a>, arguing that the worst US drought in half a century means that we now are \"in the midst of a global food crisis.\" The resolution of this crisis, he argues, should not be left to \"cowboy capitalists\".</p> <p>Certainly, anyone digging into the growing (and often pernicious) links between energy security, food security, water security and climate security will sense, as I outlined last year on this website, that the challenge we now face has many of the characteristics of a global <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/systemic-change-food-security\" title=\"\">Rubik's Cube</a>. In this context, our traditional assumptions and algorithms, whether we play them through direct or artificial forms of intelligence, are profoundly unfit for purpose.</p> <p>Grantham notes that, \"all our food and resource problems could be handled easily if we were the 'homo economicus' of economic theory \u2013 well-informed, rational and incorruptible.\" Most estimates of future market outcomes, he warns, \"are based on that assumption. But it just isn't so. Sadly, we are easily manipulated by vested interests, we passionately prefer good news to bad, we are more short-sighted than we think we are, and we are all too corruptible.\"</p> <p>It was an odd twist in the AF447 saga that the wreckage was tracked down by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI). I visited WHOI on Cape Cod in 2003 to be briefed on various aspects of climate change \u2013 the subject of <a href=\"http://www.johnelkington.com/weblog/2003_09_01_arc.html\" title=\"\">my first-ever blog</a>. I emerged with my knees knocking at the nature and scale of the challenges we face. Yet the same country that has funded WHOI's work, is considering a vice-presidential candidate (or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3aHmcAoIU\" title=\"\">presidential</a>, if you listen to Mitt Romney) who has argued that global warming is an illusion. You don't have to be Al Gore to be worried, though <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-gore/paul-ryan-climate-change_b_1774436.html?utm_hp_ref=tw\" title=\"\">it helps</a>.</p> <p>So where are we? Not on a plane, but on Planet 447 \u2013 headed smack into a zone of extreme turbulence. We are using autopilot systems (among them current forms of economics, valuation and accounting) that are full of assumptions way past their shred-by dates. Some of us are hauling back on the controls, thinking that's the right thing to do, despite the alarms sounding all around.</p> <p>And now the planet's most powerful nation is considering putting someone in the co-pilot's seat who seems wilfully blind to at least one key element of global reality. \"Fasten your safety belts,\" some might advise, but I'm not sure that's going to help much.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chair of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

He said: \"Even though there will be heavy rain and heavy winds, none of them will be exceptional in themselves.</p> <p>\"But it is the combination, particularly this afternoon, with the strong winds onshore along the south coast with big waves and possibly some heavy rain, making for unpleasant and possibly dangerous conditions.\"</p> <p>Ireland Road Safety Authority has issued a warning about driving during the storm.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Irish coastguard has warned people to stay away from coastlines and not to take part in watersports.</p> <p>\"Do not attempt to cross a fast-running river or floodwater fords as they may be stronger and deeper than you think,\" coastguard manager Declan Geoghegan said.</p> <p>Three people were killed, including a seven-year-old girl, when Hurricane Charley hit Ireland in 1986.</p>",

  "<p>More than two out of every three pupils who have finished two years of primary school in east Africa fail to pass basic tests in English, Swahili or numeracy, according to a <a href=\"http://www.uwezo.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RO_2012_UwezoEastAfricaREport.pdf\" title=\"\">new report, Are our children learning?</a>.</p> <p>The survey by <a href=\"http://www.uwezo.net/\" title=\"\">Uwezo</a>, a civil society group that monitors educational achievement, said despite significant gains in enrolment, pupils are not learning core skills expected at their age and grade level. \"While access to education has expanded, the quality of education has stagnated and may in fact have deteriorated further,\" said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/01/citizens-make-development-happen\" title=\"\">Uwezo, which means \"capability\" in Swahili</a>.</p> <p>The report found large differences in average test scores between countries in east Africa. Kenyan pupils perform best in literacy and numeracy. Ugandan children perform worst in the lower school years, but slowly overtake Tanzanian children and outperform them after six years in school.</p> <p>The report found significant differences in average test scores among districts within east African countries, with large disparities in all three countries. There are minimal differences in test scores between boys and girls. Poorer pupils do worse everywhere, with children from disadvantaged households performing worse in all tests at all ages.</p> <p>In a finding likely to fuel the <a href=\"http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/?p=11264\" title=\"\">debate on public versus private schools</a>, the report said students in private schools perform better than pupils in state schools in all three countries \u2013 a difference particularly marked in Tanzania, where the pass rate among 10 to 16-year-olds for numeracy and literacy tests was 47% in state schools, compared with 75% in private schools.</p> <p>\"In part, the difference between Tanzania and the other countries is likely to be driven by the much smaller share of pupils attending private schools, even among the non-poor, suggesting they must be particularly selective,\" said the report. In Kenya, the pass rate in private schools was 83%, compared with 75% in government schools, while in Uganda the gap was 53% to 36%.</p> <p>The 2011 surveys tested literacy and numeracy skills of about 350,000 children aged between six and 16 in more than 150,000 households across Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. In the literacy tests, children were asked to recognise a letter from the alphabet, read a word, read a paragraph, and read and understand a short story.</p> <p>The test was in English, which is taught as a subject and is the language of primary leaving exams in Uganda and Kenya. In Tanzania and Kenya (but not in Uganda) a further literacy test was administered in Swahili.</p> <p>In the numeracy tests, children were asked to recognise numbers and perform basic calculations \u2013 addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Less than one in three children were able to pass the Swahili test (32%) and numeracy tests (29%). Only one in six passed the English test (16%). Less than one in six passed both the literacy and numeracy tests (15%).</p> <p>\"These results imply that the vast majority of pupils are not acquiring basic competencies during the early years of primary school as expected in the national curricula,\" the report concluded.</p> <p>Uwezo urged politicians, NGOs and educators not to throw more resources at education \"when in fact the key problem may be the choice of interventions rather than the lack of resources\". The report called for a move away from \"inputs\", such as classrooms, the number of qualified teachers or enrolled pupils, to outcomes: \"not how many desks are there but can Juma read\".</p> <p>Noting that little has changed in classroom teaching in decades, Uwezo said: \"It may be worthwhile to consciously create a culture and room for 'disruptive' ideas and technologies, and test whether innovations and different approaches, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/mar/18/nancy-birdsall-cash-on-delivery-debate\" title=\"\">cash on delivery</a> and others, work better.\"</p>",

  "<p>My son was born with a harelip, in 1979. Swedish doctors fixed it when he was about six months old. On his return from hospital he spent one whole night screaming in the bedroom with us because we had to tie his hands to the cot to protect the stitches in his lip. To be so close to such pain was a really dreadful experience, but it felt faint, even at the time, compared with some of the other suffering we had glimpsed on the paediatric ward.</p> <p>Even at the time, I thought two things \u2013 that this was wholly incompatible with the character of a benevolent and omnipotent god, and that my little family had been fantastically lucky, and should never complain.</p> <p>Many years later, a Christian friend who had raised a severely disabled child and kept her alive for more than 20 years, said quietly to me, in a completely matter of fact way, that it would have been better if she had died during her first operation, as a baby.</p> <p>I don't think that any of us who have not been there should judge the parents of children born with conditions that would have killed them before modern medicine. Nonetheless, judgments have to be made, by doctors and sometimes by the courts. This week there have been two reports where it appears that religion stands in the way of humane and professional decisions.</p> <p>There was a case where doctors petitioned a court to have treatment withdrawn from a terminally ill child against the wishes of his parents and siblings, who hoped for a miracle. Both sides were clear that only a miracle could save the child. The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/9470501/Judge-rules-boys-life-support-can-be-switched-off-despite-parents-hope-of-miracle.html\" title=\"\">judge ruled treatment must be withdrawn</a>. Then there has been a flurry of responses in the Journal of Medical Ethics to a piece that appeared there in April, where consultants, and the Anglican chaplain, at Great Ormond Street hospital wrote jointly to say that some <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9473093/Parents-who-believe-in-miracles-torturing-dying-children-doctors-warn.html\" title=\"\">religious parents wanted their children kept alive at all costs</a> and that the courts should disregard their wishes.</p> <p>This is one of those stories that appears to be about science and enlightenment versus religion and superstition, but I don't think in fact that it is. It's true that there were no parents who wanted their children kept alive, or at least undead, for non-religious reasons. But the overwhelming majority of religious parents could accept that their children could not be saved. The chaplain to the hospital agreed with the doctors.</p> <p>This isn't entirely surprising. A religion that pretended death was not inevitable would find its adherents died out soon enough. Christianity claims that death has been conquered, but also that it is unavoidable and that in the end even God had to die to make the world right.</p> <p>The parents who wanted their child miraculously cured were really putting their faith in scientific medicine, not Christianity. If they had truly believed in miracles wrought only by faith, they would never have taken their child to hospital but simply prayed at home. They did not.</p> <p>\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,\" as Arthur C Clarke put it; and if you live in an environment saturated with magic, as some pentecostal Christians do, then the hospital with all its astonishing technology will appear a place of pure magic, where everything should be possible.</p> <p>I don't want to mock or sneer at these people. They are wrong, but they are also in anguish. The right decision is hardly easy to make. My friend with the disabled child had great trouble understanding when the consultants first told her that her baby would die. She had lived up till then in a rich, modern world where babies just don't die. Believers in miraculous Christianity don't live in that world. They know babies die all the time. If we try to imagine the feelings of a couple like that who find that their child is miraculously taken into a modern hospital, where no one's meant to die \u2013 and then returned to the world of mortality anyway it is perhaps a little easier to understand, and a little harder to judge them even when they are wrong.</p>",

However, the world is still far from meeting the MDG target for sanitation, and is unlikely to do so by 2015.</p> <p>Only 63% of the world population has access to improved sanitation, a figure projected to increase to only 67% by 2015, well below the 75% target in the MDGs. Currently 2.5 billion people lack access to an \"improved sanitation facility\", which hygienically separates human waste from human contact.</p> <p>As Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has acknowledged, sanitation is a sensitive and unpopular subject. It is not a high-profile issue, although the UN declared access to water and sanitation a fundamental right in 2010 and there is a <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/WaterAndSanitation/SRWater/Pages/SRWaterIndex.aspx\" title=\"\">UN rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation</a>.</p> <p>At the current rate, the world will miss the sanitation MDG target by 13 percentage points, meaning there will be 2.6 billion people without access to improved sanitation, according to the 2010 report by the <a href=\"http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/1278061137-JMP_report_2010_en.pdf\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation</a> (pdf). If things carry on as they are, the MDG target will not be met until 2049.</p> <p>As many as 1.2 billion people practice what the UN describes as \"open defecation\". They go to the toilet behind bushes, in fields, in plastic bags or along railway tracks. The practice poses particular problems for women and girls, who can be subject to physical and verbal abuse or humiliation.</p> <p>According to the WHO, improved sanitation delivers up to $9 in social and economic benefits for every $1 invested because it increases productivity, reduces healthcare costs, and prevents illness, disability, and early death.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/15/us-gatesfoundation-toilets-idUSBRE87E01K20120815\" title=\"\">The Gates Foundation is spending about $80m a year on water, sanitation and hygiene, according to Reuters</a>.

The capital accounted for half the fall and for half the new jobs created between April and June \u2013 99,000 out of a total of 201,000 across the UK.</p> <p>This rise in employment, to 29.476m, was the biggest quarterly increase since the spring of 2010 and the highest level of employment since 2008.</p> <p>Part-time employment reached a record high of 8.07m but the number of people who are working part-time only because they cannot find a full-time job also hit a new high, of 1.42m.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \"We've got to redouble our efforts to get Britain back to work \u2013 90% of the fall in unemployment was in London, long-term youth unemployment is still going through the roof and part-time work has hit an all-time high as people struggle to find a full-time job.\"</p> <p>The headline figures contrast with the gloomy outlook for the economy painted by the Bank of England. It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/bank-england-growth-forecast-gold-standard\" title=\"\">forecast no growth this year</a>, while some City economists expect the economy to shrink. The fact that employment is growing while output is falling has been described as a \"genuine economic puzzle\" by the Bank of England. One explanation it advanced was that productivity had weakened, i.e. you need more employees to get the same out of them.</p> <p>Nomura economist Philip Rush said: \"The Bank is slowly recognising that more of productivity's weakness is permanent. Yet still there is widespread discussion of labour hoarding,\" he said, referring to employers keeping staff on in the hope of an upturn or to preserve skills. \"We do not understand why there is so much head scratching about this so-called 'conundrum'.\"</p> <p>Even so, many analysts expect unemployment to resume its rise in the coming months reflecting the poor state of the economy. ING economist James Knightley said: \"None of this is consistent with data showing the UK has contracted for three consecutive quarters and is [performing] at the same rates as Spain and Italy \u2013 where unemployment is moving sharply higher. Moreover, UK employment is up 656,000 since the beginning of 2010 and is up 407,000 since last summer, when the UK apparently went into recession again.\"</p> <p>Unemployment in Italy is well over 10% and is approaching 25% in Spain.</p> <p>Economists said low wage growth continued to support jobs growth, with inflation of 2.6% in July still outpacing pay rises. The ONS figures showed total pay rose by 1.6% in the three months to June from a year earlier. Regular pay, excluding bonuses, was up 1.8%.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the improvement in unemployment was hard to square with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/25/george-osborne-under-pressure-economy\" title=\"\">Britain's double-dip recession</a>.</p> <p>\"It is evident that ongoing restrained earnings growth as well as significant increases in part-time jobs and self-employment is helping to keep unemployment down.</p> <p>\" The holding of the Olympic Games appeared to provide at least a temporary boost to employment in the latest figures given the stronger performance of the London labour market.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Olympic legacy has promised to create a \"healthier, happier, more active nation\", so it's ironic that I spent more time in the last fortnight sitting on my bum glued to the TV than ever before. But not, perhaps, as ironic as the government's failure thus far to capitalise on the current wave of enthusiasm for sport with a cohesive strategy for promoting physical activity.</p> <p>A report just published by the House of Lords <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/hlscience/\" title=\"\">Science and Technology Committee</a> entitled <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldselect/ldsctech/33/33.pdf\" title=\"\">\"Sport and exercise science and medicine: building on the Olympic legacy to improve the nation's health\"</a> expresses surprise and disappointment in \"the apparent lack of joined-up thinking in government about the Olympic health legacy\".</p> <p>\"While 'sport' belongs to the Department of Culture Media and Sport, 'exercise or physical activity' is seen as being within the remit of the Department of Health,' says David Stalker, CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.fia.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fitness Industry Association</a> (FIA). Hugh Robertson, the minister for sport, openly declared that his interest was in increasing participation rather than improving the nation's health, leading Lord Krebs, the chairman of the committee, to state: \"Government is failing to act in a consistent way to ensure that the Olympics help us tackle one of our greatest health threats \u2013 sedentary lifestyles.\"</p> <p>If you are in any doubt about the magnitude of the problem, consider the findings of a <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61031-9/abstract\" title=\"\">study published last month in the Lancet</a> that concluded physical inactivity was responsible for 6-10% of cases of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancer globally \u2013 and 9% of premature deaths. This, the authors suggest, makes a sedentary lifestyle as serious a threat to health and longevity as smoking. The Lancet also revealed that we in Britain are among the most slothful nations in the developed world, with 63.3% of us failing to meet the recommended physical activity guidelines.</p> <p>So why, given the compelling evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between physical activity and disease, have we failed to recognise and promote the role of physical activity both in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease?</p> <p>One possible reason, believes sports and exercise medicine consultant Dr Richard Weiler, is the lack of emphasis on physical activity and its benefits in British medical schools. Weiler's research, <a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2012/07/20/bjsports-2012-091380.abstract\" title=\"\">published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine this month</a>, found that 44% of medical schools did not teach trainee doctors the national exercise guidelines, and that on average a paltry 4.2 hours was devoted to education on physical activity. In separate research, a survey of 48 London GP practices revealed that none knew the latest physical activity guidelines.</p> <p>\"There is an urgent need for physical activity teaching to have dedicated time at medical schools, to equip tomorrow's doctors with the basic knowledge, confidence and skills to promote physical activity,\" says Weiler.</p> <p>Stalker agrees. \"Two-thirds of the population isn't doing enough exercise and 83% of the population goes to their GP every year,\" he says. \"So it is a case of GPs understanding that although not all of this 83% have a chronic condition, physical inactivity is a major risk factor for disease and they need to have the confidence to make recommendations and referrals to exercise.\"</p> <p>The Lords committee identified lack of awareness and inadequate training among health professionals as a key barrier preventing the treatment of ill health by exercise, as well as a lack of confidence in exercise referral schemes.</p> <p>But Stalker says change is afoot. \"The <a href=\"http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of Physicians</a> called for the development of clear standards outlining the process by which a doctor can refer a patient to an exercise programme,\" he explains. \"This work is underway, led by a joint consultative forum between the medical profession and exercise sector and represents the first time these sectors have worked together.\"</p> <p>Dr Andrew Murray, the recently appointed \"physical activity champion\" for the Scottish government, says steps are already being taken in Scotland. \"They've really grasped the importance of this issue up here,\" he says. Murray is working closely with Scotland's chief medical officer to promote physical activity with the aims of increasing life expectancy and decreasing the incidence of chronic disease. The more immediate goal is to increase the percentage of Scots meeting the guidelines from 39% currently to 50% by 2022.</p> <p>How? A <a href=\"http://www.salsc.org.uk/htdocs/list/MinisterialDebate17052012.php\" title=\"\">ministerial debate on obesity and physical activity</a> held in the Scottish parliament in May led to pledges from Shona Robison, minister for Commonwealth Games and sport, to maintain the physical activity budget of \u00a33.3m for the next three years, to make \u00a36m available to local authorities to help them achieve the \"two hours of PE per week\" target, and to increase funding for sustainable transport initiatives including walking and cycling. Meanwhile, NHS Scotland has just released a series of free online educational tools for its staff to learn how best to broach the subject of physical activity and motivate and support people to get active. \"We need to get the message across that physical activity is not only important by itself, it can also offset the symptoms of many obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes and osteoarthritis,\" says Murray.</p> <p>While Stalker believes that educating healthcare professionals will make a difference, he is keen to see other action. \"There is an argument for placing an exercise professional or someone qualified to delivery physical activity counselling within GP surgeries to offer support in identifying patient pathways for exercise,\" he says. \"Equally important is ensuring that physical activity is represented within the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF), which is the system incentivising GPs to prescribe certain treatments.\"</p> <p>This was one of the recommendations made the by Lords report, along with support for appropriate training both at undergraduate level and in continuing professional development of health professionals, in prescribing exercise as a preventative measure and treatment for chronic diseases.</p> <p>The committee also recommended that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) assesses the research on the use of exercise in the management of chronic diseases and, where the evidence supports it, update their guidelines to reflect these findings. This could lead to a scenario where a GP assesses a patient and decides the most appropriate treatment for their high blood pressure is physical activity rather than drugs.</p> <p>While it is encouraging to see a more committed attitude to physical activity from the government, Dr Weiler stresses the importance of a coordinated approach. \"We need the same type of strategy that was used for smoking cessation,\" he says. That campaign went far beyond telling people smoking was bad for them: it also entailed supporting their efforts to stop on a practical level and using legislation to make not smoking easier than smoking.</p> <p>\"One of the problems is that our environment is not designed to encourage physical activity,\" says Weiler. In offices, shopping centres and other public buildings, lifts and escalators take centre stage, with dingy staircases round the back \u2013 out of sight and out of mind. Yet the Lancet study found that campaigns using motivational signs, such as those directing people to stairs instead of lifts, were among the most successful. Exactly this type of signage has been used in London throughout the Olympics \u2013 presumably as much to ease the strain on the city's public transport system as to boost the nation's health \u2013 but all the same, I'd like to see it remain.</p> <p>Dr Murray agrees. \"It's not just about the NHS. It's about doing things systematically \u2013 looking at transport, urban design, employer responsibility \u2013 and delivering a clear, consistent message,\" he says.</p> <p>Fred Turok, the FIA's chairman, chairs the government's <a href=\"http://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Responsibility Deal</a> physical activity network, which works to encourage businesses to promote physical activity among employees \u2013 emphasising the knock-on effect that a healthier workforce has on productivity and profitability. \"It's not just about gyms at the office,\" he says. \"It's about enabling employees to be more active: providing showers, prioritising stairs over lifts or promoting active commuting \u2013 walking, running or cycling to work.\"&#xa0;That's all for the good, as long as employees embracing the \"move more, more often\" message don't get made to feel like slackers when they spend their allotted lunch hour taking a walk or hitting the gym.</p> <p>Even though the government is finally acknowledging what the fitness industry has been saying for decades \u2013 that physical activity matters \u2013 it's not yet clear whether the sofa-bound British public will buy into it this time around. Stalker is optimistic. \"I think the reaction we have seen to this summer's Olympic Games, coupled with a backdrop of rising levels of obesity and a health service at breaking point, have driven people towards the realisation that they cannot put off getting active any longer,\" he says.</p> <p>Weiler agrees. \"We can't carry on doing nothing about it. The cost of doing so will far outweigh the investment required to increase physical activity levels and prevent this public health crisis.\"</p>",
  "<p>She is \"<a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/06/angela-merkels-mania-austerity-destroying-europe\" title=\"\">Europe's most dangerous leader</a>\", the \"<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-iron-frau-angela-merkel-1941814.html\" title=\"\">Iron Frau</a>\" who is \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2060751/Angela-Merkels-refusal-loosen-purse-strings-makes-hero-Germany.html\" title=\"\">dragging us towards the abyss</a>\". Angela Merkel's handling of the euro crisis, it is safe to say, has not been met with approval on the world stage. Even at home, the German chancellor recently had to dodge <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/euro-crisis-exposing-fault-lines-in-merkel-government-a-842739.html\" title=\"\">criticism by a group of prominent economists</a>; one of her own party members has gone public to complain about her authoritarian style of running the Christian Democrats. Such is the international anger about her apparent failure to save the euro that the Economist, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21560269\" title=\"\">in its current issue</a>, asked for some sympathy for \"Germany's long-suffering chancellor\" \u2013 while still criticising Merkel for her indecisiveness.</p> <p>And yet, in spite of the financial crisis going from bad to worse, the German people are still firmly behind her. According to a recent opinion poll by public broadcaster ARD, <a href=\"http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend1560.html\" title=\"\">70% of all Germans feel Merkel is the best person to save the euro</a>. A similar survey by news magazine Stern confirmed her popularity; if they could vote for their head of government directly, 49% of all Germans would choose Merkel.</p> <p>The fact that the German economy has until now fared rather well through the global downturn alone does not fully explain her widespread popularity. Her own Christian Democratic party, for example, has not benefitted from the country's economic stability in the same way. According to the ARD survey, only 36% of Germans would give Merkel's party their vote if they could go to the polls now. In contrast, Merkel is perceived almost as a non-partisan head of state rather than a career politician. To put this into perspective, imagine Margaret Thatcher, the \"Iron Lady\" Merkel is often compared to, enjoying the Queen's levels of popularity.</p> <p>This enthusiasm, to put it mildly, is puzzling. Even Merkel's most ardent supporters would find it hard to argue that she is a very inspirational or charismatic leader. How can such a reserved, rational and uninspiring politician arouse such widespread approval?</p> <p>It's not just national stereotypes that tell us that Germans have an aversion to flashy leaders. Since they followed Kaiser Wilhelm II and Hitler into two disastrous world wars, Germans have developed a tendency to vote for more tempered and earnest leaders. In 1957, the Christian Democrats headed their election campaign with the fabulously uninspiring slogan \"No Experiments!\" \u2013 and won over 50% of the vote, still the highest result in German postwar history.</p> <p>Helmut Kohl, the first chancellor of a unified Germany, was the embodiment of dependability and stability, and Merkel, the country's first east German leader, fits this mould perfectly. To be sure, Germany also had its share of showy politicians, like the cigar-chomping Gerhard Schr\u00f6der or the Green party's patriarch, Joschka Fischer. But both toned down their personal style once they were in government, Schr\u00f6der losing his Cohibas and Fischer changing his eco-activist get-up for dapper suits. Only last year, defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, whose louche looks and brash rhetorical style had thrown Merkel's rather distant cautiousness into sharp relief, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12608083\" title=\"\">had to step down</a> after he was convicted of plagiarism and lost his PhD title.</p> <p>Such flamboyance is still unthinkable with the current chancellor. There is nothing remotely eccentric or extravagant about Merkel; her biggest personal scandal of the last few months was the fact that she wore <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9427863/Double-take-Angela-Merkel-steps-out-in-same-dress-she-wore-to-same-event-four-years-ago.html\" title=\"\">the same dress</a> to the opening of this year's Bayreuth festival she had worn a few years before.</p> <p>This down-to-earth approach is also reflected in Merkel's cautious political style, which has often led the international press to accuse her of lacking a clear vision for Europe's future. However, this aversion to big ideas is a long-standing part of German postwar political culture. Helmut Schmidt, Kohl's Social Democratic predecessor, once famously quipped that people with visions should go and see a doctor. In a country that has experienced the two major political ideologies of the 20th century \u2013 fascism and communism \u2013 not just in theory but in its most harsh and real form, lofty idealism in politics is often viewed with suspicion.</p> <p>The most important reason for Merkel's popularity at home, however, is neither the euro crisis nor German history, but herself. Somehow, this female, middle-aged, childless physicist from a Protestant background has convinced conservative fathers from Catholic Bavaria, working-class women from west Germany's old industrial areas and Berlin's intellectual bohemians alike that she is the best representative of their interests. Merkel has managed to remain an enigma to most Germans, a blank sheet on to which they can project their personal idea of their leader. Only last week she gave a <a href=\"http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/liste/h/201232\" title=\"\">rare personal interview</a> to the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung's weekend supplement: readers learnt that the biggest folly of the chancellor's youth was ruining a brand-new tracksuit by \"crawling into a resinous tree cave\" and that her dream dinner guest is Spain's national coach Vincente del Bosque. But her sparse, dispassionate answers still gave nothing away about her inner workings and the paper concluded that \"nobody really knows Angela Merkel\".</p> <p>As her approval rating shows, this taciturnity is working in her favour. In our media-centred political culture, full of spin doctors, photo ops and publicity stunts, the most effective public relations strategy seems to be to keep things private.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>12.00pm: Good afternoon. The Guardian's Latin America correspondent <strong>Jonathan Watts will be online from 2pm BST</strong> to take part in a live webchat.</p> <p>Jonathan has been living in Rio for the past month and will be based in Brazil throughout the buildup to the 2016 Games. Jonathan previously covered Japan in the build-up to the 2002 World Cup and China in the run-up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.</p> <p>If you have any questions about the preparations for the 2016 Olympics or about the reaction in Brazil to London 2012, drop them into the comments section below.</p> <p>In the meantime, here is Jonathan writing about \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/rio-de-janeiro-olympic-games-2016\">Brazil's promise to provide an Olympics like no other</a>\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rio de Janeiro's 700m-long Sambadrome promises to be one hell of a party venue. For four nights each southern summer, the city's samba schools parade here in a spectacular contest of music, colour and dancing. Today, however, it is being revamped for a still bigger festival and a very different series of competitions, as Brazil's \"City of Marvels\" gears up for one of the most intense bursts of international sport, partying and \u2013 many locals fear \u2013 chaos in history.</p> <p>Tonight Rio will receive the Olympic torch as the host of the 2016 Games, the first to be held in South America. Two years from now, the city will stage the World Cup. Organisers hope these two mega-events will transform the city, charm the world and highlight Brazil's diversity and achievements.</p> <p>An eight-minute taste of what to expect will be revealed this evening when hundreds of dancers, singers and musicians will try to capture the spirit of the Sambadrome during the Rio segment of London's closing ceremony. The city's mayor, Eduardo Paes, who will take the torch from Boris Johnson, has vowed 2016 will be an Olympics like no other.</p> <p>Brazil is planning to spend \u00a313bn on public transport, construction and urban renewal projects \u2013 half as much again as London spent on its Games, but less than half the amount invested by Beijing.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>2.02pm: Jonathan is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17702184\">in the comments sections answering questions</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hi everyone. Greetings from under the clear blue skies of Rio - where it is still morning and winter, but a comfortable 22 degrees Celsius. As I write, the mayor Eduardo Paes is parading the Olympic flag through the city and there is a great deal of excitement - and also anxiety - about the first Games to be staged in Latin America. With the World Cup here also just two years away, Brazil will be under the international spotlight like never before. Having covered the run-up to the Japan-South Korea World Cup in 2002 and the Beijing Olympics in 2008, I'm looking forward to seeing how the preparations here will compare and what will be the impact on the country's development. Hopefully, there will also be a little time for some good music, football and travel.</p> <p>Thanks for your questions. I'll try to answer as many as I can. Looking forward too to reading your thoughts and expectations for this city in the coming four years.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>2.10pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17700199\">Definatelynotashark</a></strong> kicks us off with a question about the opening ceremony in Rio: <strong>Will Taio Cruz, George Michael or Russell Brand be playing at the opening ceremony?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17702475\">Jonathan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hopefully not! Though the speculation has already started on who will direct the Opening Ceremony. Most think it will be another film-maker. Among the names raised in the local media here are Fernando Meirelles (the director of City of God), Breno Silveira and Carlos Diegues - or perhaps a collective including them and others. Whoever gets the job will have a lot to live up to after Zhang Yimou and Danny Boyle.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2.33pm: A lot of commenters \u2013&#xa0;including <strong>FazendaRodizio</strong>, <strong>bryanschmyan82</strong>, <strong>nanunanu</strong> and <strong>niteroi</strong> \u2013 have been asking about the transport issues facing Rio.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17702994\">Jonathan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having spent a great deal of my first month in Rio stuck in traffic jams, I can confirm that transport is a major concern and will be a focus of the \u00a313bn that Brazil plans to spend on preparing for the two upcoming mega-events. The good news is that the city has started putting in place four RBT (Rapid Bus Transport) lines and has plans to expand public transport use from 18 percent now to 63 percent by the time of the Olympics. The bad news is that the subway is terribly underdeveloped. Cynics here believe that is because the bus companies have too much political influence. The road system is also being upgraded, though it will be a huge challenge to clear the traffic in the mere two years that are left until the World Cup. That may mean more extreme measures are needed. During the recent Rio+20 \"Earth Summit\", the mayor solved the problem by giving the city a holiday for three or four days. It will be difficult to do the same for the entire month of a World Cup or the fortnight of an Olympics.</p> <p>As for the airport, it was quite a shock to land at Galeao, having got used to the stunning airport that Beijing built ahead of the 2008 Olympics. Everyone is talking about renovation, but when I asked a city official about this last week she looked a little embarrassed and said a masterplan would be drawn up before the end of the year. That is leaving things very late.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>2.51pm: <strong>@Johnmaynard</strong> and <strong>@lily07</strong> ask about the crime rates in Rio and the reaction in the favelas to the Games.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17703436\">Jonathan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been a huge effort to reduce crime and most people I have spoken to say it is having results. You can get on a bus now without fearing you will be robbed, but theft and murder are still major problems. The huge para-military operation to \"pacify\" the favelas remains controversial as it is gives the police extensive powers and may only be pushing the drug and gang problems underground. But again, the majority of residents I talk to say they are glad to see less guns on the streets and an environment that is now safe enough for social services to enter on a larger scale. I'll be looking at this in more details in the months and years ahead.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>2.54pm: <strong>NotMatthewNorman</strong> asks about how Jonathan's experiences in Brazil relate to his time in China:<strong>\"Knowing that you were harassed on a regular basis by Chinese state police pre-Beijing, nobody could begrudge you a posting to the most pleasant of BRICs. Do you see any sign that the favela relocations will be handled with more sensitivity than the hutong clearances? Has the IOC learnt anything on this front?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17703436\">Jonathan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The contrasts with China are going to be very interesting \u2013 and not just with regard to Olympic preparations. There are already some similarities. One NGO, Witness, claims that neighbourhoods near the Olympic Park are being forcibly evicted and has <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QocXg5q32m8\">a video of people affected</a>. I also went to an art community who are being threatened with eviction from an old factory in the Port Area that they have made their home, which is reminiscent of Dashanzi in 2004. Very much looking forward to seeing how the situation for journalists and attitude towards development and environment differ here.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>2.57pm: <strong>whenisaygo</strong> and <strong>MagicBenBlair</strong> would like some tickets and Jonathan's job.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17703436\">Jonathan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sorry, but no! If it is any consolation, I might also struggle to get tickets for the big events. Foreign correspondents tend to do all the \"anxiety stories\" ahead of major sporting spectacles (Will the infrastructure be ready on time? Will there be over-spending? Is security good enough?) and then when they actually start, the sports reports jet in with the accreditation to have all the fun! I doubt there is much sympathy out there.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>3.00pm: <strong>kfed99</strong> asks about the Lagoa: <strong>Do you know if any of the events will be at Lagoa? I was hoping that having things there might lead to a clean up of the filthy water, but in the press I've seen this week it isn't mentioned? I've experienced trying to cross Rio in rush hour, or heading in and out of Barra at any time of day and it's just horrific. I really hope the new metro system is on time!</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17703525\">Jonathan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rowing events will take place in the Lagoa.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>3.01pm: <strong>Crassus</strong> jumps in to the discussion to answer a question about the two new sports in the Rio 2016 Games: \"Golf and rugby sevens. In terms of actual events within sports there might be some changes. Kitesurfing replacing windsurfing is one definite (and controversial) change in sailing. There are expected to be an increase in the the number of women's boxing categories (currently at 3) though that might mean a decrease in men's events again. The UCI is known to be considering tinkering with the track cycling programme yet again, as well as trying to get 2 additional events - either the points race or individual pursuit (M and W), that they so shortsightedly dropped after Beijing. They may have to add them back in though at the expense of the omnium, which probably wasn't deemed wholly successful (except by Lasse Hansen and Laura Trott).\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17703525\">Jonathan adds</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thanks for answering the question about new sports at the next games.

There is a general feeling that everything is going to be left until the last minute and it will end up being chaotic, but also probably a lot of fun. That doesn't impress FIFA who have been increasingly vocal in raising their concerns about the slow pace of preparations. There is more time to gear up for the Olympics, but even four years will pass very quickly. If the medal count in London is any indicator of how Brazil is preparing, it has a lot of ground to make up. Australia, China and GB all make strong gains ahead of the Olympics they hosted, but Brazil actually won less gold medals this year than at Athens eight years ago. Much work is still to be done as many local commentators have noted.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>3.09pm: <strong>linhdo</strong> asks about how green the 2016 Games will be: <strong>\"London was the \"greenest\" Olympics the world has seen, do you see Rio further pursuing this avenue given it's history on sustainable development?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17703801\">Jonathan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Good question. Despite Brazil's reputation for sustainability and the astonishing natural beauty here, I have been surprised at the levels of pollution in the Lagoa and on some of the beaches. There seems to be little effort to sort rubbish or reduce the use of plastic bags. Air quality is worse than London or Paris, according to one recent study. But city officials are aware of the problems and say there will be a push to improve over the next four years. Hopefully, a greener city will be a legacy of the Olympics.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>3.14pm: <strong>laingeth</strong> asks about the image Brazil wants to send out to the world: <strong>\"What image do you think Brazilians would like to leave us with as a result of the games?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17703959\">Jonathan replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can get some idea of the image that Brazil wants to project from the brief given to the designers of the 2016 Games logo was \"exuberant nature, captivating energy, multiplicity of culture, and Olympic spirit. The result if a colourful, 3D, vibrating motif with a heartbeat. Pretty cool!</p> <p>I have heard other mention openness, inclusiveness, and a better balance between economic development and environmental sustainability. Perhaps more even than that, they'd like to leave an impression that 2014 and 2016 were a lot of fun.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>3.22pm: Thanks for your questions and comments everyone.

But at a time when the criminal bar is struggling to attract the best talent, it is probably the best recruiting tool the profession has. Few other series have portrayed so faithfully how sets operate and their members hustle for work. <em>RT</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp4MEQYEXrc&amp;feature=player_embedded\">North Square</a></h2> <p>A decade before Peter Moffat struck gold with Silk for the BBC, he wrote North Square for Channel 4. Set in Leeds, it stars some of the same cast (notably a younger Rupert Penry-Jones) and acquired something of a cult following among lawyers. Unfortunately, lawyers alone can't sustain a programme, and North Square was axed after one series.

ITV's Kavanagh QC was first broadcast in 1995 and starred John Thaw in the title role and Anna Chancellor as a barrister. The courtroom exchanges sound heavy-handed now but back then a successful drama series could pull in 13m viewers. Thaw reportedly hated wearing a wig. <em>RT</em></p> <h2>Will Gardner in The Good Wife</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YpXAoTFUkgY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YpXAoTFUkgY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>The Good Wife has been hailed by many critics as a post-feminist legal drama, and it many ways it is: lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-mother Alicia Florrick is wronged by her powerful state's attorney husband, who is caught red-handed in a sexual scandal and sent to jail (parallels with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dominique-strauss-kahn\">DSK</a> are so obvious that viewers may wonder which came first: reality or fiction). Left with two teenagers to provide for, 40-something Florrick has to climb back onto the legal bus to learn from scratch the ropes of the profession she left 15 years ago \u2013 not an easy feat in the world of Chicago law. The show's female characters are fantastic: nuanced, complex, with a dark side seldom shown in action-focused legal dramas. Florrick's internal struggle \u2013 to be a virtuous woman who is very much in public view, or to give in to her true desires \u2013 is a joy to follow. </p> <p>But it is the character of Will Gardner, prodigy-lawyer and partner of the show's legal firm, which really does it for me. Gardner (Josh Charles) is a young and viciously ambitious man who, has shown in the video above, has had to kill a part of himself to be at the top of his game. He can win a case with a nonchalant shrug, a thin smile and a killer line. He has no pity whatsoever for any of his adversaries, but falls for the woman he never forgot: Florrick, whom he dated at university. Gardner is the archetype of the \"ruthless lawyer\" common in too many TV series, but with a twist: his love for her is all-encompassing, and will cost him dearly. I'm a sucker for strong macho types who show signs of weaknesses after wrestling with their emotions, before finally surrendering to them. Clich\u00e9, but what can I say \u2013 it works. <em>JR</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcasb9nAf-g&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Rumpole of the Bailey</a></h2> <p>A certain type of barrister will always model himself on the tenant of 3 Equity Court, who refused to prosecute as a matter of principle.

A sample exchange between John Cage, partner at Ally's firm Cage &amp; Fish, sums it up: \"Because what you do want isn't out there. Secretly I think you know that. That's why you have developed this ability to look at a judge and see Al Green, to look at a cloud and see cotton candy.\" One of the most bizarre TV shows of the 1990s, Ally Mcbeal inspired a generation to think that being a lawyer was all about flirting in <a href=\"http://youtu.be/AYUavFaQwEw\">unisex toilets</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHSuyTrKwdg&amp;feature=fvwrel\">dancing babies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vga4UZs6tpQ\">Barry White cameos</a>. <em>MWR</em></p> <h2>Oliver Babish in The West Wing</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wf8Vl0ORBaE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wf8Vl0ORBaE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The ultimate in-house lawyer, played by Oliver Platt, delivers the ultimate quickfire performance in two minutes of brilliant scripting and pacing. <em>RT</em></p> <h2>Alan Shore in Boston Legal</h2> <p>Alan Shore (James Spader) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=4la8Izrwea8\">delivers a moving courtroom speech</a> on behalf of his client's right to give her sick father a fatal dose of morphine.

  "<p>Right, let's get one thing out of the way. There is nothing you can do about A-level results tomorrow. No amount of Olympic inspiration, communion with the Almighty or flicks of a coin can do a single thing to change what is going to be in students' envelopes on Thursday morning. So let's not worry about that and instead focus on what can be done to help students and staff deal with the aftermath of their results.</p> <p><strong>Get the data first:</strong> A level results are available to schools today (Wednesday 15 August) so it's essential that you cross-reference the A2 results with your most recent <a href=\"http://www.ucas.com/students/apply/\">UCAS Apply</a> information. This way you can immediately highlight the students who are going to need the most support on Thursday morning. This doesn't just mean students who are going to need to go through clearing but also those who have exceeded their offers and wish to take advantage of the five day adjustment opportunity. In fact any student who achieves AAB or better may suddenly find themselves with a slew of options previously thought unavailable to them. Remind them that this includes universities that may have rejected them earlier in the process.</p> <p>However, in my experience it's very often the students who have been accepted by their insurance offers that need the most attention. Last year we had several students in the position where they felt a sense of failure or uncertainty. Clearing, for all the attendant stresses, at least provides students with a somewhat brutal sense of definition, adjustment feels like a bonus but insurance offers can feel like fourth place in an Olympic final \u2013 the worst place to be despite it being a palpable success.</p> <p><strong>Open the doors early:</strong> Even though it's unlikely and excessively demanding to insist on already overworked support staff teams (and taking into consideration the vicissitudes of the postal service) to have envelopes stuffed with certificates by 8am, there's nothing to stop you guiding students through the clearing and adjustment processes as soon as possible on the day. We're going to be open to year 13 students from 8am so that they can start to work on their options for either clearing or adjustment. Most of the university helplines will be up and running by then anyway. Even if you haven't informed students of an early start, trust me, the combination of adolescent angst and ambition will send some early to the school gates and the infernal mobile phone/social networking interface tool will soon send others your way.</p> <p><strong>Use clearly defined spaces:</strong> It's equally essential that, when the students arrive, there are distinct spaces for the different requirements of the day. It's simply impossible to give purposeful advice in an environment where results envelopes are being opened. School halls will be cluttered with celebrating students, jubilant teaching staff and newspaper staff seeking insightful quotations and comments from teenagers who have just had the greatest weight in the world lifted from their shoulders (I have seen the most articulate students reduced to the most stereotypical monosyllabic teenager by questions such as: \"How does it feel to get all As in your results?\").</p> <p>Define the work areas where students can receive advice, support and use computers and phones. Ideally have a handout that sets out where, when and what students need to do now. Give the handout with the results envelopes but under no circumstances have it in the envelope. Anything in that envelope which is not a results certificate will end up as confetti.</p> <p><strong>Use small focused teams:</strong> I think it's a wonderful thing when staff are present on results days. It emphasises community and a real interest in the future well-being of their academic charges. However, leave them alone to get on with discussing how so and so achieved 100% in that unit and how everyone agreed that this was the correct way to answer that question with the students who have achieved what they need.</p> <p>All teachers are fond of giving their opinions and in this case too many points of view will lead to confusion and procrastination where there needs to be clarity and purpose. Make sure those advising students know exactly what they're talking about</p> <p><strong>Support now, celebrate later:</strong> As I find myself gradually morphing into Mr Chips with each passing year, the success of my students seems to speak to my heart more and more. Last year I nearly cried with relief and joy at some students who I know had overcome such formidable difficulties with such aplomb. But this is of no use to anyone.</p> <p>Tying in with the focused teams point\u2013 those advising students who are struggling with clearing need to be crystal clear and totally focused. I won't be able to spend as much time as I would like with those students who have achieved wonders \u2013 but it's their celebration and not mine. Instead we are inviting all year 13 students back for a reception in September and I'll be able to have my \"You are all my children\" moment then.</p> <p>With the exception of the young man who last year confidently informed me that he was going to take up a place at Liverpool so he could look after his nan who resides in Dagenham, students are better informed than ever before about their university options. Despite this tomorrow will still see many young people needing compassion, expertise, guidance and sensitivity \u2013 so be prepared, make your words and actions count and good luck to you and your students.</p> <p><em>Steve Sumner is a vice-principal of the <a href=\"http://www.southernconsortium.org.uk/general-information\">Southern Consortium</a>, a collection of school sixth forms in East London.

  "<h2>Quito</h2> <p>Surrounded by Andean peaks, Quito's setting is enough to make anyone forget their troubles. The Unesco-listed historic, colonial Old Town is a maze of churches, plazas and narrow streets, perfect for getting lost in. Anyone with issues with the corporate multinational machine should make a beeline for the presidential palace \u2013 Carondelet Palace \u2013 which socialist Rafael Correa opened up to the public after becoming president in 2007. Of particular interest are the gifts of indigenous clothing and artwork on display from Correa's pal Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>North of the Old Town is the Palacio Legislativo. When the government is not in session you can take a guided tour (entrance $5) to marvel at the mural depicting the sufferings of indigenous people complete with an evil-looking face wearing a helmet labelled CIA. The fact that the unveiling of the painting in 1988 caused the US ambassador to storm out of the room will be an added attraction for anyone wanting to stick it to The Man. The city tour is completed by visiting the masterwork of the artist Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn (completed following his death in 1999) at <a href=\"http://www.capilladelhombre.com\" title=\"\">La Capilla del Hombre</a>, high above the New Town. The massive dome ceiling is covered in depictions of the indigenous workers who died in the Bolivian mine of Potos\u00ed. Other highlights include the gigantic Bull and Condor, symbolising the struggles between Spain and South America, and La Ternura, a tender embrace of a mother and child.</p> <h2>The Llanganati Mountains</h2> <p>In 1532, the conquistadors held Inca leader Atahualpa for ransom, only to execute him before the largest portion of the treasure could arrive. This vast amount of gold and silver was spirited away by Inca porters into the rain-drenched mire of the Llanganati Mountains in Ecuador's central highlands. Ever since, adventurers have tried to locate it, often with fatal consequences, leading to the legend that the gold and the region that enclosed it were cursed. If you do go in search of treasure, make sure you take a guide, which can be hired in nearby Ba\u00f1os for $80 per day with Geotours (groups of four minimum, <a href=\"http://www.geotoursbanios.com\" title=\"\">geotoursbanios.com</a>). Alternatively, it's the ideal place to disappear without a trace.</p> <h2>Stay with Shuar Indians</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394735844\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/6/29/1340978970961/Shuar-Indian-family-fishi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shuar Indian family fishing, Ecuador\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shuar Indian man fishing. Photograph: Guillermo Granja/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillermo Granja/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Don't mess with the Shuar \u2013 traditional greetings among men include \"I see you're still alive\". This infamously fierce tribe was the bane of Spanish invaders \u2013 they apparently poured molten gold down the throat of a unpopular Spanish governor in 1599 in a gruesome version of poetic justice by satisfying his thirst for gold. Descendants of the Jivaro tribe, split across Ecuador and Peru, the Shuar were performers of the headshrinking ritual, where the lips and eyes of an enemy are sewn shut before the head is shrunk and the soul supposedly destroyed. You can learn about Shuar communities by taking a tour from the southern jungle near the town of Macas. Stays can be arranged in town with <a href=\"http://www.guimun.com/ecuador/negocios/1413/operadora-de-turismo-insondu-mundo-shuar\" title=\"\">Insondu Mundo Shuar</a> from $50 per night. Needless to say, don't lose your head and attempt to venture into Shuar territory alone. <a href=\"http://www.macasturismo.gob.ec\">More information on the tourist board website (in Spanish)</a>.</p> <h2>Canoa beach town</h2> <p>Monta\u00f1ita is Ecuador's version of Goa with stoned rastas and tanned surfers transforming this cramped beach town into a hippy haven. Head further north to Canoa, a smaller, more laidback resort with a long beach for a quieter place to ride the waves, sip cocktails and forget your troubles. While the 1998 El Ni\u00f1o shrank the beach at Monta\u00f1ita, it actually grew in Canoa. Stay at <a href=\"http://hostalcocoloco.weebly.com/home.html\" title=\"\">Coco Loco</a> (from $8pppn) or <a href=\"http://www.hotelbambuecuador.com\" title=\"\">Hotel Bambu</a> (from $12pppn).</p> <p>Ten miles north of Canoa <a href=\"http://www.riomuchacho.com\" title=\"\">Rio Muchacho</a> is an organic farm producing fruit, vegetables, jams, coffee and chocolate. A one-day tour costs $30pp or stay there for three days ($120pp), ride horses into the forest, catch freshwater shrimp and make your own organic dinner.</p> <h2>Andean adventures</h2> <p>Try out zip-lining in Mindo in the cloud forest two hours north-west of Quito with <a href=\"http://www.mindocanopy.com\" title=\"\">Mindo Canopy Adventure</a>. Thirteen zip-lines cost $10. Other adventure options include tubing \u2013 racing down river rapids sitting in an inflatable tube. Alternatively, head five hours south-east of Quito to tackle whitewater rafting in the jungle town of Tena. British-run <a href=\"http://www.gecodeko.com\" title=\"\">River People</a> and <a href=\"http://www.riosecuador.com\" title=\"\">Quito-based Rios Ecuador</a> are good local operators. The river Misahualli is the most tempestuous (Class IV), and certainly not for the faint-hearted.</p> <h2>Floreana, Gal\u00e1pagos Islands</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394735845\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/6/29/1340979252327/Floreana-Island-Galapagos-007.jpg\" alt=\"Floreana Island, Galapagos Islands, Ecuador\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sea lion swimming off Floreana Island. Photograph: Ralph Lee Hopkins/National Geographic Society/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Lee Hopkins/National Geographic Society/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Ecuador beat off half-hearted claims from the US and Britain to claim the Gal\u00e1pagos in 1832, the developed world has still left an indelible mark here. The US navy used Baltra as an air base in the second world war and used the famous Pinnacle Rock for target practice. A lesser known chapter of history is the series of strange disappearances among a small German community on the island of Floreana in the 1930s. A baroness arrived on the island with three lovers and quickly ruffled feathers with her eccentric antics. She and her lover suddenly disappeared one night and both of the chief suspects ended up dead in the next few months. To delve deeper into this cold case, stay at the Pension Wittmer on Floreana, run by the son of an original settler, Margaret Wittmer. The hotel has bungalows overlooking the beach from $30pp. Floreana itself is the oldest inhabited Gal\u00e1pagos island and has a giant tortoise centre in the highlands. Other highlights include flocks of flamingos at Punta Cormorant, snorkelling with sea lions at Champion islet and world's quirkiest postbox at Post Office Bay, originally launched by homesick sailors in 1793. Visit the Gal\u00e1pagos national park at <a href=\"http://www.galapagospark.org\" title=\"\">galapagospark.org</a> for further information.</p> <h2>Dancing</h2> <p>Taking a dance class is a great way to meet people. In Quito try Academia Salsa and Merengue in the district of Mariscal (classes from $6pp). Once you've honed your skills, head to discos Seseribo (on Veintimilla y Avenida 12 de Octubre, Edificio El Gir\u00f3n) or Mayo 68 (on Lizardo Garc\u00eda 662 y Juan Le\u00f3n Mera). In contrast to many other Quito discos, which pump out electronic and international music, these specialise in salsa and merengue.</p> <p>Another great place for a party is the coastal city of Guayaquil where it's as hot and steamy outside as inside the clubs. Tear it up at Cali Salsoteca (on Panam\u00e1 418 y Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez) or the huge dancefloor of Jardin de la Salsa (on Av de las Am\u00e9ricas). If you can't get the hang of salsa's complex rhythm, the new craze in Ecuador is the Caribbean techno-reggae fusion of reggaeton. Bumping and grinding is obligatory and there are countless discos to shake your booty at. Ca\u00f1a Grill in Monta\u00f1ita (on Guido Chiriboga y Costanera a la Playa) is a popular spot or try Bungalow 6 (on cnr Calama &amp; Almagro) in Quito.</p> <h2>Yasuni national park</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394735846\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/7/5/1341487522760/Yasuni-National-Park-Ecua-008.jpg\" alt=\"Yasuni National Park, Ecuador\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Napo Wildlife Center, Yasuni National Park. Photograph: Prisma Bildagentur AG/Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prisma Bildagentur AG/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ecuador is one of the world's most biodiverse countries with more species of plants (25,000) than the entire continent of North America and one-sixth of the world's bird species. Much of this is in the jungle, but the country's slice of the Amazon has a troubled history. Yasuni national park in the north-east of the country, bordering Peru, is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/aug/14/ecuador-oil-yasuni-national-park\" title=\"\">biodiversity hotspot that sits on an estimated one billion barrels of oil</a>. The Ecuadorian government is holding off drilling in return for compensation for preserving the rainforest, but for how long, nobody knows. See it while you can on a four-day jungle tour. Highlights include views of the forest canopy on 40-metre-high observation towers, night walks to tarantula holes and flocks of parakeets descending daily from the canopy to drink at the clay licks near Napo Wildlife Centre. Watch out for hawks circling overhead. Stay at La Selva Jungle Lodge (<a href=\"http://www.laselvajunglelodge.com\" title=\"\">laselvajunglelodge.com</a>, four days from $699pp) or Napo Wildlife Centre (<a href=\"http://www.napowildlifecenter.com\" title=\"\">napowildlifecenter.com</a>, four days $760pp).</p> <h2>Fiestas</h2> <p>Nobody parties like Latinos and Ecuador has raucous festivals every month, so whenever you visit there's an excuse to party. New Year includes the ritual burning of a symbol of the A\u00f1o Viejo (Old Year) \u2013 anything from the President to TV characters such as Homer Simpson. Carnival, marking the beginning of Lent in February or March, is a four-day party. The best indigenous celebrations are in the highland towns of Ambato and Guaranda, while every beach resort in Ecuador is heaving. But for something a little different, head to Latacunga, an indigenous highland town with a colonial centre and friendly locals, for the Mama Negra (black mother) celebrations held in September and November, the latter of which is most raucous and lasts a week. This bizarre mix of Catholic, indigenous and African rituals originated from the town's pleas to be saved from destruction by nearby volcano Cotopaxi. Parades involve poets, musicians, transvestites and witches. The centerpiece is the arrival of a black-faced Mama (a man) who sprays the crowd with water and milk, supposedly symbolising fertility. Stay at backpacker favourite <a href=\"http://www.hostaltiana.com\" title=\"\">Hostal Tiana</a> (from $10pppn).</p> <h2>Panama hats</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394735847\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/7/5/1341487418232/Traditional-Panama-hats-C-008.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional Panama hats, Cuenca, Ecuador\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional Panama hats in Cuenca. Photograph: Danita Delimont/Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danita Delimont/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Panama hats are from Ecuador. The misnomer is a sore point for locals and an American president is largely to blame. During the construction of the Panama canal, thousands of these hats were exported by the Ecuadorian government for the toiling workers. US president Theodore Roosevelt was pictured wearing one and they were dubbed \"Panama Hats\" by the world's media and the name stuck. You'll struggle to find a better handmade hat anywhere else. To see how they're made visit the Museo del Sombrero on Calle Larga in the highland city of Cuenca, where production is biggest. However, the hats actually originated from Montecristi on the central coast. Prices range from US$15-$20 for a standard hat to more than $200 for the famous superfinos, which should last a lifetime if well-treated. Good spots to buy include <a href=\"http://www.homeroortega.com\" title=\"\">Homero Ortega</a>'s store in the centre of Cuenca, but the best deals are directly from the Atma factory in the village of Sigsig, about 40 miles south-east of Cuenca. Here superfinos sell for just $80. Of course, aside from their aesthetic value, hats are the ideal disguise for those wishing to keep a low profile.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Ben Westwood is author of the <a href=\"http://www.moon.com/\">Moon guide</a> to Ecuador and Galapagos</p>",

  "<p>From <a href=\"http://storify.com/pierrenovellie/aidan-burley-a-portrait-in-mockery\" title=\"\">mocking Aidan Burley</a> to working out that Yorkshire won more gold medals than Spain, Twitter was a great place to be during the Olympics. We saw <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/OBOPefmIN4/\" title=\"\">Team Rwanda at a bus stop</a>; passed around videos of <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5930604/this-bbc-interview-with-chad-le-closs-father-is-the-media-moment-of-the-games-so-far\" title=\"\">Chad le Clos chatting</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19134764\" title=\"\">Denise Lewis jumping on a chair</a>.</p> <p>The social networking site calculated that more than 150m tweets about the Games went out during the fortnight, with more than 80,000 a minute prompted by Usain Bolt's win in the 200m sprint. Even the grumpiest sports haters (yes, I'm talking about me) became infected with the Olympic spirit. I became genuinely emotional as the Chinese hurdler who injured his achilles tendon at the starting blocks limped the entire course. Sport has never done that to me before.</p> <p>So, Twitter loved the Olympics. What was perhaps more surprising was how quickly the athletes took to the medium \u2013 and it took to them. Tom Daley has <a href=\"http://twittercounter.com/compare/TomDaley1994/3month/followers\" title=\"\">added more than a million followers since the beginning of July</a> and <a href=\"http://twittercounter.com/compare/J_Ennis/3month/followers\" title=\"\">Jessica Ennis 400,000</a>, while Mo Farah put on 30,000 just on the day of his 10,000m triumph alone. Even those who didn't have a big public profile before the Games \u2013 such as long jumper Greg Rutherford \u2013 saw the benefit. He went from 5,000 followers in early July to more than 70,000 now. The three most popular subjects among athletes seemed to be their medals, their golden postboxes and their messy bedrooms, in roughly that order.</p> <p>The question is: what happens to those numbers now? Will the thousands of people who followed the athletes in their Olympic pomp still find them interesting in their training seasons?</p> <p>Their sponsors will certainly hope so. Celebrities with big Twitter followings are immensely attractive to advertisers; the accepted wisdom is that one personal endorsement from a beloved star is better value for money than larger amounts of scattershot branding. So far, we've been spared any plugs for athletes' personal sponsors because the Olympic branding rules forbid them (to keep the field clear for overall advertisers such as Coca Cola and Adidas). But these expire on Wednesday, so expect a blizzard of tweets about how Sports Drink X fuelled their medal-winning performance or Tracksuit Brand Y helped them to victory.</p> <p>This return to normality will undoubtedly harshen the Olympic buzz. While many athletes are genuinely grateful to the companies that fund their training bills, there's always something unnerving about watching people sing for their supper when they're supposed to be speaking from the heart. (Who can forget the time that David Beckham crowbarred in a mention of his sponsors into the revelation that he suffered OCD? \"I'll put my Pepsi cans in the fridge and if there's one too many then I'll put it in another cupboard somewhere,\" he told an interviewer.)</p> <p>How bad will it be? Look at Usain Bolt, whose Twitter bio accurately, if immodestly, describes him as \"the most naturally gifted athlete the world has ever seen\". At the moment, his feed is a jolly collection of babies doing the Lightning Bolt and him hugging Jason Statham (his hero, apparently). But before the Games he was an unabashed product placement tweeter. Behold this totally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/usainbolt/status/217670222461677568\" title=\"\">unstaged photo of his fridge</a>.</p> <p>Luckily for Bolt \u2013 and his sponsors \u2013 it's much harder to lose Twitter followers than gain them, and he'll have to post a lot of pictures of soft drinks before enough people desert him to make advertisers think again.</p> <p>But for anyone who isn't a global superstar, maintaining momentum will be tough, There simply isn't much interest in the long jump, for example, outside the big competitions, no matter how engaging and funny Greg Rutherford is.</p> <p>Even worse for the Olympic afterglow, in a few days' time, the sports world's very own vampire squid, the Premier League, starts up again and Twitter will be alive with wall-to-wall retweets of Joey Barton quoting Nietzsche from here to 2013.</p> <p>Oh well.

If the vast majority remain thrilled to have Martin O'Neill occupying the manager's office, they are increasingly eager for him to start spending the owner Ellis Short's money.</p> <p>If there was far too great a \"churn\" factor under Steve Bruce \u2013 O'Neill's predecessor signed a staggering 30 players, including loans, during his two and a half years at Sunderland \u2013 the Stadium of Light's once constantly revolving door now appears to be in danger of jamming shut.</p> <p>Although infinitely preferable to Bruce's rather scattergun approach to dealings, this somewhat cautious approach to O'Neill's first season in charge \u2013 so far only one first-team player has been recruited, the former Aston Villa defender Carlos Cu\u00e9llar on a free transfer \u2013 is provoking anxiety. Fanciful rumours that James Milner had checked into Seaham Hall hotel ahead of a medical were swiftly proved false, but welcome as the Manchester City midfielder's arrival might have been, the team's overriding requirement is goals.</p> <p>With Asamoah Gyan having made his bizarre loan move to Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates permanent and Nicklas Bendtner returning to Arsenal at the conclusion of his stint, O'Neill's side are not only light in the attacking department but extremely short of an aerial threat up front.</p> <p>This not only explains a series of underwhelming pre-season results \u2013 four defeats in six and only four goals scored \u2013 but the lengthy game of brinkmanship with Wolves over Steven Fletcher which has formed a backdrop to Sunderland's summer and now sees the Molineux board demanding \u00a315m for their prize asset.</p> <p>Granted the physically imposing centre forward has twice been relegated from the Premier League \u2013 with Burnley and Wolves \u2013 but Fletcher did score 12 Premier League goals for Mick McCarthy's struggling side last season, seven of them with his head.</p> <p>At least the gifted St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon is still around \u2013 even if fans will, with justification, be fearful of a bid for the Benin forward or attacking midfielder right up until September dawns. Rumours that he may be exchanged for Tottenham's Jermain Defoe refuse to disappear.</p> <p>O'Neill has recognised the need to ease the load on Sess\u00e8gnon by increasing his side's creativity and fluency, and remains optimistic of adding some new faces. When it comes to selling the club to would-be players it can only help that an indoor practice area is finally scheduled to be ready for use at the training ground in October, thereby sparing players from the worst of the chill winds whipping in off the North Sea at the notoriously blustery weekday base in Cleadon.</p> <p>O'Neill's managerial brilliance has often been reflected by his uncanny knack of welding players his peers might term ordinary into extraordinary units, but even the 60-year-old Northern Irishman might struggle to guide his current squad towards Europa League qualification.</p> <p>That said, the addition of another two or three fresh faces could entirely change the complexion of a unit already boasting the old fashioned left-wing skills of James McClean, the set-piece accuracy of Sebastian Larsson, the left-footed midfield promise of Jack Colback, the bite of Lee Cattermole and the stellar goalkeeping of Simon Mignolet. Further forward, the arrival of a robust Fletcher-type figure to play off might permit the young striker Ryan Noble to prove to his manager that an unerring goalscoring knack (and the locally born Noble has been prolific at reserve level) can more than compensate for an apparently frail physique.</p> <p>Defensively things should be bolstered by Cu\u00e9llar's arrival but much depends on whether Wes Brown can overcome his latest knee injury and somehow stay fit, and whether the talented yet sometimes still slapdash Titus Bramble surmounts his own injury worries before finally learning to master the art of concentration. With Michael Turner sold to Norwich, Matt Kilgallon, a centre-half frozen out by Bruce, should have a chance to establish himself but, like Brown, Bramble and John O'Shea, Kilgallon has a tendency to spend too much time on the treatment table.</p> <p>Serious question marks concern the left-back spot, a position not occupied by a specialist for some time. Admittedly Phil Bardsley, a right-back, has exceeded the call of duty when occupying the role but with Bardsley currently injured and Kieran Richardson, who can fill in on the left of defence, seemingly heading for the departure gate, an expert reinforcement would be welcomed. The smart money is on Stephen Warnock arriving from Villa before September.</p> <p>Whoever arrives and/or departs O'Neill \u2013 who, after taking over in December, dragged Sunderland out of a relegation battle, into the top 10 and to an FA Cup quarter-final before finally seeing the side slip, exhausted, into a disappointing 13th place \u2013 is determined to regularly fill the Stadium of Light to its 48,000 capacity.</p> <p>\"The potential is absolutely frightening,\" he says. \"It's there and it would be lovely to do something about it. And I think now there is an added incentive, if not pressure, with Newcastle doing so well.\"</p> <p>Both can only be increased by the knowledge that thanks to this summer's overseas initiatives, budding Mackems everywhere from Dakar to Dar es Salaam, and Seoul to Sierra Leone, will be tuning in to this season's Tyne-Wear derbies.</p> <p>Regionally, nationally and internationally Sunderland aim to put themselves firmly back on the map. Significant challenges await but with O'Neill in charge few doubt they can be surmounted.</p>",
  "<p>Among the many differences between Francis Maude and the Cabinet Office ministers who preceeded him, three seem particularly important from a reform perspective.</p> <p>First, Maude has been in office longer than any of the 12 Labour politicians who held the role between 1997 and 2010.</p> <p>Second, although some of Maude's thinking is not radically different from that of the previous government, he is more determined, for good or ill, about implementation.</p> <p>Third, he is under greater pressure from the wings of his own party, making it trickier to quickly dismiss the mad and bad ideas they champion. This is all too evident from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/09/civil-servants-bear-brunt-francis-maude-government-cuts?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">scale of cuts revealed on 9 August</a>, including a staggering \u00a31.5bn from jobs and pay.</p> <p>The current obsession with shrinking the state misses the point. As the aftermath of the quango cull has shown, the work still needs doing. Changes to organisation, location and resourcing impact critically and directly on outcomes.</p> <p>A more strategic approach is needed, building from a better understanding of what already exists. For example, the system of locating analysts within policy teams results in greater confidence in the evidence, appropriate use and agility of response.</p> <p>It is easy but misleading for ministers to counterpose this system with one based on commissioning policy and advice from third parties. The facility to do this already exists, and has value, but it cannot replace the need for integrated day-to-day policy advice provided by civil servants with knowledge of the issues and institutional memory. Arguably the current mess that is civil service pay policy could have been avoided if ministers had listened more to HR practitioners and less to their favoured thinktanks.</p> <p>Further, the proposal to rely more on 'crowdsourcing' and 'policy labs' reinforces the perception that the government does not value the specialist knowledge of its own employees.</p> <p>At the very least, there should be enough skills left within the government to enable it to be an intelligent customer and sufficiently informed as to the quality of the advice it procures or receives.</p> <p>If Maude wants to learn from other governments, he need not look as far afield as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/06/new-zealand-contractual-civil-service-model?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">New Zealand</a>. The devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales are both quietly making progress in joining up public sector policy and delivery. They are not afraid to do things differently, but in consultation with staff and unions.</p> <p>The Welsh government consultation <a href=\"http://wales.gov.uk/consultations/improving/workingtogether/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Working together for Wales: The Public Service Workforce</a>, which ran between May and July 2012, highlighted the need continual improvement in services and put at the heart of this process a workforce partnership council, bringing together devolved public sector employers and trade unions. Though still at an early stage, our feedback is that there is genuine commitment to making this work.</p> <p>Also encouraging is the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CEkQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalengland.org.uk%2FImages%2FNEBPU3007-annex2_tcm6-32195.pdf&amp;ei=KcUjUM3aLIit0QXAm4GgBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxKDqC6ghHU6MhuDEuk-i_-d1iBQ\" title=\"\">partnership agreement </a> between Natural England, an agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Prospect, based on a shared aim of helping to build the organisation as a thriving business and leading employer of choice.</p> <p>We hope that when it comes to developing the five-year capabilities plan proposed in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/jun/20/civil-service-reform-dogmatic-banal-disappointing\" title=\"\">civil service reform plan</a>, lessons will be learned from the discredited departmental capability reviews. The emphasis on strengthening skills is welcome, particularly the focus on professionalism and career paths. The current review of the science and engineering profession across government is a welcome and serious initiative, and Prospect is pleased to be fully engaged with this work.</p> <p>To support it we have recently <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flibrary.prospect.org.uk%2Fid%2F2012%2F01117%3Fdisplay%3Dpreferred&amp;ei=mcUjUP2QJqLX0QXZrIC4BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqLplh0eZsWoPRSi6u7HKqFjK83A\" title=\"\">surveyed</a> our women members working in science and engineering. Given their experience that part-time working remains a barrier to progression or promotion, many of our 2,000 respondents will welcome the recognition implicit in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/06/richard-heaton-cabinet-office-permanent-secretary?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Richard Heaton's</a> appointment as as permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office that important and senior jobs can be done on a part-time basis (although few will envy the pressure that will be on Heaton to combine this role effectively with his existing job).</p> <p>Perhaps, after all, Maude does not need to seek solutions from elsewhere but to search more systematically for the good practice on his own doorstep and then really work hard to ensure that it is applied consistently. High-quality government will result from working with staff rather than constantly undermining them.

  "<p>In Zambia's Central province, men have started cycling long distances to undergo a traditionally stigmatised procedure: circumcision. According to Fred Mbewe, who performs circumcisions at Nangoma Mission hospital, men bear the pain \u2013 both from the surgery and the bumpy bike ride the following day \u2013 to protect themselves against HIV.</p> <p>Zambia has become active in fighting HIV, largely because of the toll the disease has taken on the country, which has the sixth highest infection rate in the world, at 13.5%. <a href=\"http://www.avert.org/aids-zambia.htm\" title=\"\">It is estimated</a> 200 Zambians become infected with the virus every day.</p> <p>In addition to distributing condoms and sterile needles to prevent transmission, experts are turning to male circumcision as an HIV prevention strategy. <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2807%2960312-2/fulltext\" title=\"\">According to some</a> \u2013 though, importantly, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003362/abstract\" title=\"\">not all</a> \u2013 scientific studies, male circumcision can reduce female to male transmission by up to 60%. This means that the risk of a man contracting the disease from an HIV-positive woman decreases by more than half if he is circumcised. The procedure is relatively inexpensive, which is attractive for donors.</p> <p>Given its low cost and purported effectiveness, policymakers and donors across Africa have started aggressively pushing circumcision as a prevention strategy. The US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) programme <a href=\"http://www.daily-mail.co.zm/?p=6237\" title=\"\">has a target of 1.9 million circumcised men in Zambia by 2015</a>, up from an estimated 200,000 now. Donors such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Gates Foundation are also funding circumcision.</p> <p>To garner local support, especially in parts of Zambia where men are not traditionally circumcised, foreign donors have been meeting traditional leaders. \"The feeling [among the 27 traditional leaders we met] was: 'If you give us funds, we will make sure all our men are circumcised',\" said Pepfar country co-ordinator Kristie Mikus.</p> <p>After learning about the benefits of male circumcision, Chief Mumena of Zambia's North-western province decided to get circumcised. \"If it's good enough for others, it's good enough for me,\" he said. He hopes his example will encourage others in his region.</p> <p>Donors are training health workers to conduct circumcisions at local health centres. The Global Fund supports a two-week circumcision training programme, which enables people like Mbewe to conduct the procedure. Mbewe passes information about circumcision's benefits and risks to volunteer community health workers, who spread the message throughout villages.</p> <p>\"We were told of benefits, about 60% prevention of disease,\" said 45-year-old Joshua Mwangala, a volunteer health worker who was circumcised. The volunteer health workers tell people how hygienic circumcision is and how it can <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/news/20110106/male-circumcision-cuts-womens-cervical-cancer-risk\" title=\"\">prevent cervical cancer in women</a>. The potential risks and limitations of male circumcision are relatively muted. Health workers are informed of the infections that could result from the process, but still encourage community members to undergo the procedure.</p> <p>One concern is whether everyone understands that a 60% reduction in HIV risk does not obviate the need for condoms. \"We tell people it's not a passport to have unprotected sex,\" said Gideon Mwiinga, a 63-year-old healthworker. \"But we know there are people who don't use condoms after being circumcised.\" Clement Chela, director general of Zambia's <a href=\"http://www.nac.org.zm/\" title=\"\">National Aids Council</a>, said he was unsure how widespread the perception is.</p> <p>\"Male circumcision,\" said Zambian Aids activist Mannaseh Phiri, \"is the best vaccine in Africa.\" Yet some scientists, like <a href=\"http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/130/1/e175/reply\" title=\"\">J Steven Svoboda, worry</a> that circumcision will lull men into a false sense of security, which he believes will \"lead to a decrease in condom use and [ultimately] endanger women\".</p> <p>Some are also concerned about the effect circumcision could have on the country's homosexual population. According to several <a href=\"http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD007496/male-circumcision-for-prevention-of-homosexual-acquisition-of-hiv-in-men\" title=\"\">recent studies</a>, the procedure has no significant protective effect against HIV transmission in homosexual men. Yet this nuance is virtually absent in circumcision advice in Zambia, which criminalises homosexual behaviour. \"The messaging around circumcision is not holistic,\" said Lundu Mazoka, a Zambian gay rights activist. \"It needs to be coherent with the science.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Sarika Bansal travelled to Zambia with the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria</em></p>",

  "<p>While the social entrepreneurship field has been around for several decades in some countries, it has only begun to emerge in China in the last decade. So there is little understanding about the current organisational structures, origin, size, scope of work and impact of social enterprises in China.</p> <p>To fill the void <a href=\"http://www.fyse.org/\" title=\"\">FYSE</a> has conducted an annual survey among social entrepreneurs in China for the past two years. In this four part series we share more about the current state of social enterprises in China. Since around 2004 the concept has begun to gain supporters, advocates, incubators, impact investors, the media and academic researchers \u2013 have expanded across the country. 95% of respondents to FYSE's annual <a href=\"http://www.fyse.org/event/2012-social-enterprise-report-launch-london/\" title=\"\">Chinese Social Enterprise Survey</a> got involved in social entrepreneurship after 2006, with the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 being a major driving force for participation.</p> <p>The recent interest in social enterprise is reflected in the youthfulness of enterprises: 54% of them are under three years old and 38% are older than five years. One notable development is that of an inverted pyramid with fewer new social enterprises compared to the number of mature social enterprises. The number of mature social enterprises who were older than five years rose from 15% in 2011 to 38% in 2012. On the flipside the pipeline of early \u2013 state social enterprises is drying up, with the number of enterprises up to two years of age and again aged 3-5 years are notably decreasing, indicating that a large proportion of social enterprises are not graduating to the next level and size of operations.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the perception of China as serious economic competitor with internationally expanding enterprises such as Haier, Lenovo and Sinopec, social enterprises are still limited in scale and economic impact, mainly due to their youthfulness.</p> <p>Firstly, 71% of surveyed social enterprises generate less than 500,000 Yuan (\u00a350,000) in annual revenues and while social enterprises grow in size over time, older social enterprises are still relatively small. For example, only two surveyed social enterprises achieved a turnover above 10million Yuan (\u00a31m).</p> <p>Secondly, social enterprises are limited in geographic scope with 63% operating on a village or city level, 13% operating on provincial level, 17% reaching national level and 8% operating on an international level.</p> <p>Thirdly, two-thirds of surveyed social enterprises are headquartered in either Beijing or Shanghai, with very few social enterprises operating out of China's smaller cities.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://dsi.britishcouncil.org.cn/publication_new.shtml\" title=\"\">2008 China Social Enterprise Report by the British Council</a> 68% of interviewees predicted social enterprises to be most likely to evolve from existing NGOs. Indeed an increasing number of NGOs in China are embarking towards marketisation and commercialisation out of necessity due to a revenue shortage and institutional challenges facing NGOs. One example is Bread For Life founded by Keith Wyse. Keith originally established an orphanage outside Beijing, for children diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, commonly known as brittle bone disease. Eager to see the children strive for more beyond the orphanage walls and with the ambition to break free from a grant dependency model, Keith established the Bread of Life Bakery six years ago. The bakery, which produces and sells western style bread to the mostly expatriate community in Beijing, provides employment to four disabled women who hail from the orphanage and generates profits that are reinvested into the orphanage.</p> <p>Yet many NGOs striving to become social enterprises struggle to become social enterprises due to inadequate business and market expertise, institutional challenges, an unclear business model and inefficient income generating strategies. Therefore they often revert back to grants and donations to cover costs or are unable to expand. These challenges have led many Chinese experts to question the ability of NGOs to turn into viable social enterprises. Instead they believe that the most promising Chinese social enterprises are to be found in the business sector, among the businesses across China that might not even identify themselves as social enterprises. One example is <a href=\"http://www.new-ventures.org/company/beijing-landwasher-science-technology-development\" title=\"\">Beijing Landwasher Science &amp; Technology Development</a>, which produces environmentally friendly toilets that use a water-free flushing system. This technology both conserves resources and meets the sanitation needs of rural communities lacking access to current public infrastructure.</p> <p>Since 1999 Landwasher has sold over 2,200 of its environmental toilets and achieved sales revenues of \u00a36.6m. This places Landwasher as a leader in the environmental sanitation industry in China.</p> <p>However, these entrepreneurs often do not know of the concept of social enterprise and do not consider themselves to be social entrepreneurs. In fact, only 63% of social entrepreneurs in our survey consider themselves to be a social entrepreneur (down from 75% in our 2011 survey).</p> <p>Yet, no matter the size and location social entrepreneurs in China face a variety of challenges, some in common with their global counterparts, some unique to China.
