The first recorded reference to the place was in 1398.</p> <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said the foam was a result of natural organic matter present in the sea \u2013 for example, phytoplankton growing \u2013 which is whipped up into a foam by the wind.</p> <p>Aberdeen City Council said the sea foam was an unusual phenomenon but was not causing concern. A spokesperson added: \"The spume at Footdee was blown in off the sea. It will dissipate naturally and is meantime being washed away by the rain. Members of the environment team will go and sweep the area out once the foam has cleared. There are no environmental concerns about it.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere in Aberdeen, a clean-up operation was underway to remove dangerous trees felled by the storm. Major roads including Union Terrace and Willowbank Road were closed as a result of fallen trees and branches.</p> <p>Aberdeen City Council said it received dozens of calls and it could take a considerable amount of time for all to be dealt with. Sand and water blew onto the city's esplanade and drivers were advised by Grampian Police to be cautious. Bus operators reported delays and cancellations with services in both the city and Aberdeenshire.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Scotland, heavy rain and severe winds caused power cuts and travel problems. Around 2000 households were without power after gusts up to 70mph hit the country overnight. There was damage to property but no injuries.</p> <p>SEPA issued 10 flood warnings and six flood alerts across Scotland.</p>",
  "<p>In previous years Tiger Woods may well have approached the Ryder Cup with indifference. This time the 36-year-old has cause for enthusiasm.</p> <p>The last Ryder Cup was probably one of the hardest for Woods, played within 12 months of the epic coverage of the personal misdemeanours which had such a damaging effect on the American's status. When people whispered in galleries about Woods in 2010, his on-course talents were not the topic of conversation. And he knew it.</p> <p>In earlier appearances, too, for the United States against Europe Woods had done little to dissuade anyone that he was uncomfortable in a team environment. His record is not as disastrous as some would loosely suggest \u2013 14 points from 29 matches \u2013 but it remains an anomaly that someone with 14 major wins has been on a Ryder Cup-winning side only once, at Brookline in 1999.</p> <p>He did miss the most recent American Ryder Cup win at Valhalla in 2008 while he was recovering from serious knee surgery. But on Tuesday morning at Medinah Woods, in a rare glimpse of self-criticism, offered to take responsibility for his relatively poor showing when asked to consider recent European successes in this competition.</p> <p>\"Well, certainly, I am responsible for that because I didn't earn the points that I was put out there for,\" Woods said. \"I believe I was out there for five sessions each time and didn't go 5-0 for our side. So I certainly am a part of that and that's part of being a team. I needed to go and get points for my team and didn't do it.</p> <p>\"Hopefully I can do that this week, hopefully the other guys do the same and we can get this thing rolling.\"</p> <p>From one member of the European team there was a viable explanation for the relative Ryder Cup struggles of Woods.</p> <p>\"I kind of liken it to playing Premier League football for the biggest teams \u2013 Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal,\" said Graeme McDowell. \"Any lesser team that comes to play these guys has a tendency to raise their game. It's a huge game for an underdog to play Tiger Woods and they get up for it. They're not expected to win.</p> <p>\"When expectation levels drop, your game tends to improve. I think a guy who plays Tiger Woods doesn't expect to win so he lets it all go, plays out of his skin and gets the upset. Golf is a very individual sport. Tiger Woods is perhaps the best player to play the game of golf. What he does individually is so phenomenal it would be very hard to emulate that at the Ryder Cup.\"</p> <p>Still Woods himself appears in a better place now than at almost any time over the past five years. He continually asserts how strong his health and fitness are and he has won three times on the PGA Tour this season.</p> <p>He tied third at the Open Championship at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes this summer, his best finish in that event since 2007. Woods also has a natural Ryder Cup partner nowadays in Steve Stricker, with whom he is unbeaten.</p> <p>It may well be, therefore, that Woods views the 39th Ryder Cup as a further opportunity to endorse the progress he is adamant he is making. And if that is in an environment where he has previously toiled, all the better to prove a point.</p> <p>\"This is very similar to what we did in college,\" Woods added. \"We played for our university at the time but for us to represent the United States of America, and our team-mates, it is something else. In all these practice sessions we want to get to know each other and get our games right to be ready for the Ryder Cup.</p> <p>\"There is so much heat on you, which is very different to playing by yourself. Playing for your team-mates just adds that element. It means so much because it is our country.\"</p> <p>If Woods did not believe that, he is an even better spoofer than he is routinely given credit for. There was also a warm recollection of 13 years ago, when he was part of a stunning final-day comeback by the United States.</p> <p>\"The way we did it on that Sunday, no one has ever seen it,\" Woods said. \"And to be a part of that, a part of that rush; Hal Sutton started us off, then Tom Lehman, then David Duval. I think I was fourth or fifth match out.</p> <p>\"These matches were being not just won but we were winning by such huge margins. We were blowing these matches out, which added to the atmosphere.</p> <p>\"That was certainly an experience. I've never been part of anything like that. I have never seen a comeback like that in golf, in a team atmosphere. It is something that I will never, ever forget.\"</p> <p>Chicago, and Medinah specifically, also hold special significance for Woods. He won two USPGA Championships here, in 1999 and 2006, and has claimed the same number of BMW Championships at nearby Cog Hill. When Woods describes the likelihood of the Medinah atmosphere being \"partisan\",\"loud\" and \"raucous\", he is well placed to comment.</p> <p>\"1999 was a big one for me because I had changed my swing in '97 and it took basically a year and a half to get it dialled in,\" Woods said. \"I believe I won eight times that year but to win my second major was so important. It validated my first and gave me the confidence that I could go ahead with this swing. And lo and behold, 2000 came around and things got rolling after that.</p> <p>\"I've always loved coming here. I enjoy playing in Chicago and, for some reason, I have had a lot of success here. I don't know why it is but I just seem to be very, very comfortable here.\" The Europeans have been warned.</p>",
  "<p>So, iPhone users, how do you like being collateral damage?</p> <p>If you \"upgrade\" to iOS6, Apple's latest mobile operating system, you are going to lose an essential app that was native and bundled in previous systems. What you'll get instead is, by all accounts, inferior to what's gone missing. I refer, of course, to the mapping software that Apple has cobbled together from several small-company buyouts and its own considerable, if inadequate to date, efforts to create a serious rival to the banished Google Maps.</p> <p>If you are an iPhone user, you're suffering \u2013 I use that term almost in jest, as this is a classic #FirstWorldProblem, in Twitter hashtag lingo \u2013 as a consequence of a war between two corporate giants. In this particular case, your situation stems from: Apple's desire to dominate tomorrow's computing; its absolute loathing of Google; and its willingness to treat customers badly, at least in the short term, in order to achieve corporate goals.</p> <p>This is nothing new in the technology world. In its heyday, Microsoft made all kinds of unilateral decisions to thwart competition, caring not in the slightest \u2013 monopolists don't have to care \u2013 that it was giving its own customers fewer and, in some cases, inferior choices. Apple has entwined its mobile customers so completely at this point that they'll tend to accept any and all abuses of this kind. Just try to read an Amazon Kindle book, which currently dominates the ebook market, on another platform. The list goes on and on and on.</p> <p>It should not be surprising that Apple's mapping solution is nowhere near as good as Google's at this stage of its development. But there's reason to believe it may never be. As the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/\">Atlantic magazine's Alexis Madrigal pointed out</a> in a deep look at the systems and people behind the Google product, this team has been doing things with enormous care and precision for many years now, and shows no sign of slowing down.</p> <p>Apple has the deepest pockets in the corporate world, however, with more than $100bn in cash and a sales machine that mints billions more each month. It's spending some of that to make a competitive mapping product. Already, the production values of its app \u2013 the way it looks and feels \u2013 are better than Google's in some ways, though the details of streets and places lag far behind, <a href=\"http://www.spydergrrl.com/2012/09/apple-maps-epic-fail-or-stunning.html\">with Escher-like results</a> brightening the day of countless internet wags.</p> <p>Apple is also spending some of its cash on lawyers, battalions of them around the world, suing companies that have the temerity to make Android-powered hardware. Samsung is the primary target so far. This \"lawfare\" is related to the map battle, because the larger strategic goal for Apple is all about controlling mobile computing and everything that relates to it. At this point, Google and its Android allies are the most serious impediment.</p> <p>Maps are dashboards to incredibly valuable information and services. When Apple sends its users to Google Maps, as it did in the past, it was sending them into the Google ecosystem, where the search giant can leverage its own area of dominance: online advertising. In coming years, as we do more and more with our mobile devices, whichever company can get us to use <em>its</em> dashboard will have a big advantage in other areas of mobile activity, especially commerce.</p> <p>I'm not fond of Apple, as I've noted here, because of its incessant, and increasing, control-freakery towards suppliers, software developers and customers. But I'd rather see it compete with its own maps than let Google utterly own the field.</p> <p>Google and Apple aren't the only alternatives in the mapping universe. <a href=\"http://maps.nokia.com/?lang=en-US\">Nokia is among</a> a number of companies investing in the field. I'm not fond of the notion, however, that giant corporations should control mapping in any event. So I'd like to see the great <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\">Open Street Maps project</a> get even more traction. Its goal is to create a global, user-generated and open map database that anyone can use. If more people would take the time to add their knowledge of their local areas, it would get even better.</p> <p>Meanwhile, users of Apple's mobile devices have to choose between getting the latest operating system tweaks and a native mapping app that gives reliable results. My suggestion: if you feel compelled to use iOS6, use Google or Nokia maps from the browser, realizing that you won't get the coolest features. Or stick with iOS5. Or, if you can't imagine life without doing what Apple tells you to do in every respect, be prepared to not find what you're looking for, or end up somewhere you didn't expect.</p> <p>That's how life goes when one company launches its weapons at another, and you're in the line of fire.</p>",

  "<p>No chittering, no fluting, no chissicking. The bleak silence of a spring without its birds is the central image of <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Rachel-Carson-Silent-Spring-Get-Movie-Adaptation-33132.html\" title=\"\">Rachel Carson's most famous work</a>. Since its publication 50 years ago, humanity has continued silencing the languages of nature, through the pesticides that Carson examined, habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, overhunting and climate change, reducing numbers and driving some species to extinction.</p> <p>The losses of the natural world are our loss, their silence silences something within the human mind. Human language is lit with animal life: we play cats-cradle or have hare-brained ideas; we speak of badgering, or outfoxing someone; to squirrel something away and to ferret it out. I wish there was a verb to otter, ottering around in pure play, to honour <em>Otter ludens</em>, which plays in my mind long after I've seen one. But when our experience of the wild world shrinks, we no longer fathom the depths of our own words; language loses its lustre and vividness.</p> <p>The human mind needs nature in order to think most deeply. Pretending to be other creatures, children practise metaphor and empathy alike. Cultures have long heard wisdom in non-human voices: Apollo, god of music, medicine and knowledge, <a href=\"http://www.pantheon.org/articles/d/delphi.html\" title=\"\">came to Delphi in the form of a dolphin</a>. But dolphins, which fill the oceans with blipping and chirping, and whales, which mew and caw in ultramarine jazz \u2013 a true rhapsody in blue \u2013 are hunted to the edge of silence.</p> <p>In the Sumerian period, according to legend, messengers of the gods in the shape of fish would spend their nights below the oceans, and in the days would teach humans the moral code and the arts. After the flood they did not return, so human scholars dressed themselves in fish cloaks, with fins and tails.</p> <p>The stupidity of overfishing would have shocked Carson, herself a marine biologist. Since the 1950s, when she published her trilogy The Sea, two-thirds of the species we have fished have collapsed, and some species are down 99%, according to Callum Roberts, a professor of marine conservation, in his vitally important <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jun/07/callum-roberts-ocean-of-life\" title=\"\">Ocean of Life</a>. Dredgers carve graveyards in seabeds, fertilisers fuel plankton blooms that result in oxygenless dead zones, and climate change threatens much sea life.</p> <p>Many cultures, such as the Iroquois, regard animals as guides. Biomimicry in architecture and design treats nature as a teacher; aeronautical engineers have studied the precise angle of eagle feathers. Art listens to the natural world, unwilling to shake the linnet from the leaf, refusing to silence the Rite of Spring. Take nature out of Shakespeare and it would be incalculably impoverished; without his bunch of radish or shotten herring Falstaff wouldn't be truly Falstaff, nor would Ophelia's lament be so poignant without her <a href=\"http://panini.northwestern.edu/mmueller/ShakeQuirks/rosemary%20and%20rue.htm\" title=\"\">rosemary for remembrance and rue for you</a>. And in a silent spring, the very Forest of Arden would be voiceless.</p> <p>The forest doctors of the Amazon say each plant has its \"song\", and that to know how to use the plant you must listen to its voice. The silencing of the rainforests is a double deforestation, not only of trees but a deforestation of the mind's music, medicine and knowledge. Forest doctors use medicines the west needs so badly, and they say <a href=\"http://www.ayahuasca-info.com/\" title=\"\">ayahuasca</a>, the most profound of all medicines, guides the psyche; as I know from experience, it is the finest treatment for severe depression, the psyche's most terrible silence.</p> <p>But those who want to make nature history attempt to silence its protectors. Carson has been vilified with false accusations that her influence on DDT-restriction caused millions to die of malaria. (It was not banned in anti-malarial use but in agricultural use, and that partly because its indiscriminate use created resistance in malarial mosquitoes.) In the Amazon, the forest doctors are attacked by missionaries and the forests are destroyed for timber extraction and cattle ranching. We are taking the most precious mind-medicine and turning it into beefburgers. Here's rue for us all.</p> <p>In silenced forests, in silenced seas, in silenced springs, the human mind loses its thoughtways, risking the extinction of metaphors, losing the resonance of language, putting the significance of wildness on a <a href=\"http://www.cites.org/\" title=\"\">Cites</a> list of endangered ideas. The web of life is also a web of thought, and our minds are cats-cradled in the unsilenced, singing earth.</p>",
  "<p>Polly Toynbee (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/24/pleb-jobe-tories-flashman-thinking\" title=\"\">This pleb jibe exposes the Tories' Flashman thinking</a>, 25 September) repeats the Institute for Fiscal Studies' assertion that the bottom third earn too little to pay tax. Actually, so far as households go \u2013 and, despite upper middle class feminism's gift to the well off of separate tax assessments for couples, it is households which matter in relation to income distribution \u2013 the bottom third pay a rather higher percentage of their income in tax than the top third. The main culprit is indirect taxation, and particularly VAT.</p> <p>The IFS argues that since the cash benefits and tax credits of the bottom 30% of households actually amount to more than the taxes they pay, the very high proportion of their income that goes in taxes is not an issue. Why? Income is income, and whatever its source it is taxed. Many benefits are based on contributions, despite the best efforts of welfare \"reform\" to destroy the insurance principle for unemployment and sickness/incapacity, if not yet for pensions, so people often have paid for what they get, or at least pooled risks to receive it. Other benefits, particularly means-tested supplements to low wages, subsidise employers, including many notorious tax dodgers.</p> <p>And don't buy the IFS line about low incomes being temporary. Low-income recipients do not move far in the income distribution. If you read the IFS assertions on the impact of tax on poor households, you would think that they all contained film directors taking a break between engagements. The poor pay tax, lots of tax, and lots in relation to their poverty. We need to remember this. <br><strong>Professor David Byrne</strong><br><em>Durham University</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Polly Toynbee quotes David Laws as saying \"As a liberal, I feel uncomfortable at the idea of the state taking half or more of anyone's income.\" Mr Laws, a former investment banker and briefly chief secretary to the Treasury, with a double first in economics at Cambridge, must know that the 50% marginal tax rate applies only to income exceeding \u00a3150,000 a year (after deduction of allowances), not to total income. Such a misleading defence of the coalition's decision to reduce the rate to 45% to help the rich, while sharply increasing VAT which even the poorest pay, may be thought much more objectionable than calling a cop a pleb.<br><strong>Brian Barder</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Good to hear that Vince Cable contemplates the idea of a state bank (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-small-business-bank1\" title=\"\">Cable reveals \u00a31bn backing for bank to fund small firms</a>, 24 September).

But charities and voluntary organisations will at best be junior partners to corporate capital, \"bid candy\" camouflaging private profit.

  "<p>Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have been crisscrossing America on the campaign trail for months but seldom turn up on the same day at the same event. They did Tuesday at Bill Clinton's annual international aid conference.</p> <p>It was a rare opportunity to compare and contrast, a clash in New York of the White House incumbent and the challenger. </p> <p>Obama is still the bigger draw, with long lines forming 90 minutes before to hear him. Romney did not come close to matching that, although this might have been in part because he was speaking early in the morning, just after 9am, with people still making their way from breakfast.</p> <p>Romney, under huge strain after a series of campaign disasters and polls showing him trailing Obama, rose to the occasion. Normally a poor speaker, often dismissed as 'wooden', he was surprisingly poised and relaxed and his delivery relatively smooth. He also dispensed with his normal stump speech and largely avoided attacks on Obama, instead making a case for tying international aid to free trade deals and stimulating the private sector.</p> <p>By contrast, Obama looked tired, as if he is the one that should be under strain in the election race rather than Romney. But, even tired, Obama is a better speaker than Romney. </p> <p>He devoted his speech to human trafficking, an emotional plea to tackle what he described as \"barbaric\" problem, modern-day slavery. He sounded as if he was addressing a much bigger theme than Romney's, and with passion.</p> <p>Both were speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative conference, the aid foundation set up by the former president which delivers millions of dollars to the developing world each year. Those attending are a mixture of leaders from the developing world, philanthropists, corporate representatives and the heads of non-governmental organisations.</p> <p>The conference audience leans more towards Obama than Romney. Romney received a standing ovation at the start of his speech. Obama received one at the beginning and end.</p> <p>On the face of it, the conference was potentially awkward for Romney, given that it is being hosted by Clinton, who delivered a widely admired speech of the Democratic convention in which he made the case against a Romney presidency. That speech helped contribute to Obama's campaign bounce. </p> <p>But Clinton, introducing Romney, was cordial and Romney smiled as the two stood at the podium. The two shook hands and Romney was on.</p> <p>It was not only that Romney's delivery has improved, he also managed to laugh at himself.</p> <p>\"I appreciate the kind words and your invitation here today. If there's one thing we've learned this election season, it's that a few words from Bill Clinton can do any man a lot of good \u2026 After that introduction, I guess all I have to do is wait a day or two for the bounce.\"</p> <p>The core of Romney's speech was international aid, promising that as president he would tie it to encouraging the private sector in the developing world and to free trade deals, what he called a Prosperity Pact.</p> <p>\"For American foreign aid to become more effective, it must embrace the power of partnerships, access the transformative nature of free enterprise, and leverage the abundant resources that can come from the private sector,\" he said.</p> <p>The closest he came to criticising Obama was saying that Americans were \"troubled\" by events in the Middle East. He also, without naming him, described the Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, attending the UN general assembly, as \"a voice of unspeakable evil and hatred\".</p> <p>When Obama arrived, Clinton went one better than a handshake, giving the president a hug. Obama, returning the favour, praised not only Clinton's speech to the Democratic convention but Hillary Clinton for her grace and grit that he said had made her one of the finest ever secretaries of state, a tribute that helps in building her up for a potential 2016 presidential run.</p> <p>Obama, who has opted for more sober, downbeat speeches this year, offered glimpses of the speaker he had been in 2008, making an emotional plea for an end to worldwide human trafficking. He put it in the context of the Emancipation Proclamation, a copy of which was hanging from the wall of his office in the White House.</p> <p>Human trafficking, Obama said, \"ought to concern every person, because it's a debasement of our common humanity. It ought to concern every community, because it tears at the social fabric. It ought to concern every business, because it distorts markets. It ought to concern every nation, because it endangers public health and fuels violence and organised crime. I'm talking about the injustice, the outrage, of human trafficking, which must be called by its true name \u2013 modern slavery.\" </p> <p>He promised the US would tackle the problem more vigorously than it was at present and announced a few measures. In reality, though, the US does little, as Clinton acknowledged after the speech, noting that most of the work is done by non-governmental bodies rather than governments.</p> <p>Obama has attended the conference every year he has been president and Romney, towards the end of his own speech, said: \"A year from now, I hope to return to this meeting as president.\" </p> <p>If he had delivered speeches throughout the year with the same apparent conviction as he did at the Clinton conference, he might stand a more realistic chance of fulfilling that hope.</p>",

There is a woman dressed as a leopard, with wild animals attached to her nails: giraffe, elephant, panda, parrot, lion. A working water feature twines around one model's waist, gushing towards her feet, causing a woman in front of me to rush to the ladies. There is a heart-stopping moment when a model painted gold gets one 10in-long nail caught in her hair, and struggles for a second, before finally, perilously, extricating it.</p> <p>A competitor from Italy stops to tell me about her design. From left to right, a fable unfolds about a woman who gets mixed up with an amorous werewolf, becomes a vampire, ends up in a coffin, and is then saved by a handsome prince. The nails look heavy, but not painfully so. In some cases the models appear to be buckling beneath the weight of the designs. Head judge <a href=\"http://nailartgallery.nailsmag.com/elainewatson\" title=\"\">Elaine Watson</a> tells me later that on one score sheet, for an otherwise excellent effort, she noted the technician should \"give some consideration to the weight of their work\", she says, \"because the poor girl&#xa0;couldn't even lift her hands\".</p> <p>This is the eighth year of the Nailympics, an event run by <a href=\"http://www.scratchmagazine.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Scratch magazine</a> editor Alex Fox, in which nail technicians compete in categories including nail embellishment, stiletto nails and soak-off gel manicure. There are 452 competitors, from 24 countries, with Moldova and Estonia taking part for the first time. It's expensive to compete, with technicians having to pay an entrance fee, plus travel and accommodation costs for themselves and their models, but the event's popularity reflects the boggling success of nail art right now. According to <a href=\"http://www.gcimagazine.com/marketstrends/regions/world/156321685.html\" title=\"\">Euromonitor International</a>, global sales&#xa0;of nail polish increased 43% between 2008 and 2011 \u2013 as sales of lip&#xa0;products grew just 7% and facial makeup 11%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/aug/01/olympic-nail-art-style-watch\" title=\"\">Nail art was the fashion sensation of&#xa0;the 2012 Olympics</a>, with the Minx brand creating flag designs for every nation's athletes, which were applied at nail salons in the Olympic Park. Almost every time a female winner held up her medal, some nail art seemed to flash up.</p> <p>The current success of the market is often attributed to affordability, but Fox mentions two other familiar factors: fashion and celebrity. \"It probably started with London fashion week. Alexander McQueen was one of the first designers who said: 'I want the nails done to go with the hair and makeup. And now pretty much every show has nails backstage. So the fashion world woke up to nails about seven years ago, and now it's just, ka-boom!\"</p> <p>Since then, she says, \"you've had Rihanna, Katy Perry, Gaga, all those celebrities suddenly wanting to put nail art on their fingers, and go crazy with their costumes \u2026 We've had this explosion on the high street, and now we have nail bars popping up everywhere.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396694793\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/25/1348596083687/Rihanna---and-nails---at--010.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna \u2013 and nails \u2013 at the 2012 MTV Video Music awards\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rihanna \u2013 and nails \u2013 at the 2012 MTV Video Music awards.

Those children are adults now, with their own disposable income, so they have grown up around it, and it's gone&#xa0;mainstream.\"</p> <p>Fellow judge <a href=\"http://www.izayahjeffrey.com/izayahjeffrey/Welcome.html\" title=\"\">Izayah Jeffrey, from Palm Springs, California</a>, feels the success is due to nail art's limitless possibilities. Jeffrey is in his early 40s and has always been an artist, but he first started painting nails eight years ago, after meeting \"the godfather of nails\", the late <a href=\"http://www.nailpro.com/remembering-tom-holcomb\" title=\"\">Tom Holcomb</a>, who became his partner. \"I was just intrigued, wanting to spend every moment with him,\" he says. After six months as a nail technician, training under Holcomb, he came to the first London Nailympics in 2005, entered three competitions \u2013 mixed-media, tip overlay and silk wraps&#xa0;\u2013 and won them all, becoming the&#xa0;grand champion of champions. The mixed media competition involves 10 artificial fingertips, he explains, each a&#xa0;different size, exhibited in a closed container, with at least three mediums used in their decoration. His entry was inspired by The Phantom of&#xa0;the Opera \u2013 an ornate, colourful masquerade ball. \"One mask was the goddess of the stars, one was the king of the universe \u2013 they each had deities and gods and goddesses \u2013 doing this whimsical dance, going down a staircase, with a chandelier and&#xa0;then a gauze of flowers made of acrylic roses.\"</p> <p>Now, he says, if people like a certain time period, say the 1950s or 60s, \"they can have that look, or if they like the hookers in the Victorian era, that whole bordello look, they can have that. They live vicariously through their nails.\" He's a big fan of marbling, particularly in colours that make nails resemble vintage Pucci fabrics. Fox mentions a trend for felt nails, and designs made from lace. UV-cured polishes \u2013 dried under a lamp, and exceptionally hardwearing \u2013 have also transformed the industry, says Watson.</p> <p>Ornate, painted, long, embellished nails nonetheless still seem one of the least practical fashion trends of all time. <a href=\"http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/people/ribeiro-aileen.shtml\" title=\"\">Professor Aileen Ribeiro</a>, author of Facing Beauty: Painted Women and Cosmetic Art, says long nails have been popular for centuries, partly because they denote wealth and leisure. \"People in the Ming dynasty had incredibly long fingernails,\" she says, \"and obviously this implied they really couldn't do very much work at all. So&#xa0;it's about status, really. Leisurely status. And long nails give out a lot of different signals. They elongate the fingers, and for hundreds of years, long, slim fingers have been very much admired. People [displayed] their hands much more in the past than we do today. There was far more in the way of hand deportment, so a man would put his hands within the buttons of his waistcoat to show off their elegance, and a woman would use a fan.\"</p> <p>Yet the vogue for nail polish is surprisingly recent. <a href=\"http://angustrumble.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Angus Trumble</a>, senior curator of paintings and sculpture at the Yale Centre for British Art, and author of The Finger: A Handbook, says that in the 19th century, in European cultures, \"there were all sorts of nostrums and powders, products that were designed to make nails look shiny, pink or fresh, youthful and smooth, but they were generally used rather like shoe polish. So you put it on, and polished it off, and it would leave a tint or a tinge.\" When women polished their nails back then, says Ribeiro, \"they buffed them with chamois leather, or they put lightly coloured beeswax on their nails to give them a shine.\" It was a very natural look. So in the 1920s, when paints developed for cars and aircraft began being applied to nails, many found them startling.</p> <p>The question critics asked, says Ribeiro, is why women \"with all these relative new freedoms, having won the vote, and able to stride out, no longer hobbled by skirts, tight whalebone corsets, and so on \u2013 why would they need to wear makeup and polish their nails so much? I think what the complaint is, from critics \u2013 and they're nearly always male critics \u2013 is that women are illogical. Long nails, particularly when polished, give out the look of a kind of harpie, a woman who is ferocious, and is almost prepared to&#xa0;be bloodthirsty in her quest for a man. There's been quite a lot of discussion as to why red is so popular, because it is the colour of blood, it is the colour of danger, it is the colour of subversion. But of course it is just an enhanced and artificial way of replicating the colour of one's lips.\" Early on in nail polish's evolution, brands began selling matching lipstick and nail&#xa0;colour.</p> <p>In the early days, too, some were so suspicious of the trend they suggested it was a form of self-harm. Trumble writes about lauded psychiatrist, Dr&#xa0;Karl A Menninger, who in 1934 \"presented his case to the American Psychiatric Association that 'bobbed hair and tinted nails' were a form of self-mutilation no less harmful than the abnormal cutting off of an arm, or starving oneself to death\". There were also suggestions that nail polish must be a means of covering up sin or dirt. Ribeiro says the trend might&#xa0;have been associated with \"an&#xa0;element of sluttishness, that if you paint your nails, you hide dirt under the fingernails. Given the notion of health and hygiene, which was so big in the early 20th century, this again would seem to be going a step backwards. So I think there were a&#xa0;lot of quite complex feelings that people had, which they may not have fully understood.\"</p> <p>Nail polish was taken up by Hollywood stars, with actors including Rita Hayworth popularising red nails in the 40s and 50s. In the 70s, artificial nails were invented, and in that decade women in the African American community, and the African Caribbean community in the UK, began pioneering brilliant new styles and ideas. Dr Shirley Tate, author of Black Skins, Black Masks, says manicured nails were always a way of showing class distinctions. \"Certainly, in the Caribbean, the people who used to have nails that were long and manicured were women who didn't have to do housework. So having long nails that were manicured was a way of showing class.\" If a woman couldn't afford a salon manicure, \"you did your own manicure every Sunday, because that was about middle-class femininity, the aspiration for professional and middle-class life.\"</p> <p>What's interesting, says Tate, is how the meaning of different looks changes. \"Now we have dancehall artists with fake nails and loads of art on them, and&#xa0;that shows a different version of femininity, maybe, than that middle-class one.\" Mainstream culture has appropriated nail art in the same way as it has other black beauty practices, including hair extensions, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396694794\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/25/1348596282499/A-models-nails-2012-Naily-010.jpg\" alt=\"A model's nails, 2012 Nailympics\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hardly practical: a model shows off her nails at the 2012 Nailympics.

The theme for this competition is the Olympics. A model from Ostend in Belgium has designs painted in bright yellows and greens on her natural nails, each showing a different Olympic sport \u2013 diving, football, cycling, weight lifting. David Ciaccio, from Rome, is wearing acrylic nails painted blue, green and gold. Anita Podoba, a nail technician from Hungary, says she has tried to capture the&#xa0;Olympic spirit of Ancient Greece, so her design includes the Parthenon \u2013 as well as a nail depicting the Queen and James Bond parachuting into the&#xa0;park, my favourite of the whole&#xa0;competition.</p> <p>Karishma Patel is a professional hand model, working with the company Hired Hands, and while she likes the design she is wearing \u2013 when she holds her nails together, they form a union flag, picked out in crystals \u2013 she&#xa0;doesn't think she could wear long nails&#xa0;every day. \"You can just about push your hair back, but you might scratch your eyes out \u2013 you'd be dangerous to yourself, and dangerous to other people.\" Like all the nail models I&#xa0;meet, those blessed with beautiful hands \u2013 the key is slender fingers, and long nail beds, apparently \u2013 she prefers the natural look.</p> <p>But there are many who insist that long nails enhance the hand's beauty, and are perfectly easy to work with. Olga Clapcott, a competitor from Bournemouth, has just created an immensely intricate, involved design, based around the Olympic flame, while&#xa0;sporting conical stiletto nails 4cm long. Doesn't she find it tricky to&#xa0;work with them on? On the contrary, she says; she finds everyday tasks of all&#xa0;kinds much more difficult without them. \"When I'm typing,\" she says happily, \"I can reach all the keys without moving my hand.\"</p>",
  "<p>Born into almost unimaginable wealth and privilege, Lady Edwina Grosvenor is not someone you might expect to bump into on a prison landing. But over the past 12 years, the <a href=\"http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list/g/lady-edwina-grosvenor\" title=\"second daughter\">second daughter</a> of Britain's richest landowner (the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080937/Duke-Westminster-donates-country-house-use-new-rehab-centre-wounded-troops.html\" title=\"Duke of Westminster\">Duke of Westminster</a>, 7th on Britain's Rich List with a fortune of around \u00a37.3bn) has been quietly establishing a role for herself as a discreet but potent champion of prison reform. Her work, which began when she spent part of her gap year working in Kathmandu Central prison in Nepal when she was 18, has taken her into more than 50 prisons in the UK and abroad. Aged 22, she commissioned research into the multiple needs of ex-offenders. Since then she has sat in on prisoner adjudications, been involved in restorative justice sessions and spent a year as a support worker in the notorious Styal women's prison in Cheshire. As impressive as her prison-related activities are however, the big question for me is: why?</p> <p>We meet for lunch in the Clink restaurant, the fine dining eatery at <a href=\"http://www.theclinkcharity.com/high-down/book-now/\" title=\"High Down prison\">High Down prison</a> in Surrey, which provides high-level catering training for prisoners. Grosvenor is a trustee of the Clink charity and has invested several hundred thousand pounds in the start up costs. This month saw the launch of <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/need-to-read/2012/08/31/take-a-first-look-inside-cardiff-prison-restaurant-the-clink-91466-31731615/\" title=\"another Clink restaurant in HMP Cardiff\">another Clink restaurant, in HMP Cardiff</a>, which unlike the Clink in High Down is open to the public. If all goes to plan, the concept will be rolled out in up to a dozen prisons across the country.</p> <p>I ask her, does she know who Lady Bountiful is? Her blue eyes flash defensively and then she lets out a little laugh. \"Yeah,\" she says. So is she Lady Bountiful? \"That depends on people's views, really. My view is that I cannot escape the fact that I am a wealthy person and the daughter of a duke and duchess, because I am, and I'm not apologetic about that. You can be embarrassed about it or you can forget about it or you can be proud of it and I've done all those things. I'm now 30 and I feel more at peace with myself and I'm more confident about what I'm doing. At the end of the day I think people should be judged on what they do and how they do it.\"</p> <p>And why they do it? \"Yes, and why they do it.\" So why does she do it, this prison reform thing? \"From a young age closed institutions fascinated me and things I didn't know about I wanted to know about.\"</p> <p>She recounts her father taking her in her early teens to a drug rehabilitation centre in Liverpool where she met recovering addicts. Later her mother took her to a charity supporting troubled families. \"It was something darker than I was used to,\" she says. \"I remember feeling quite outraged that nobody at school had taught me anything about this other way of life. I&#xa0;wanted to know more.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395634255\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346764921365/edwina-grosvenor-and-fami-008.jpg\" alt=\"edwina grosvenor and family\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edwina Grosvenor aged two with her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Westminster, and her older sister Tamara.

Her father went to Harrow, \"and hated it\", she says.</p> <p>She and her three siblings all went to Mostyn House because her father didn't want them to suffer at boarding school as he had. Was she a good student? She laughs again. \"I did better than my dad [who left Harrow with just one O level]. But at Mostyn we got so much more than just an academic experience \u2013 we had good mates, we were given shit and we gave shit back.\" Shit because she was a lady?</p> <p>\"Having a title there was definitely a novelty but the grief we got from other kids was nothing compared to what we got from some of the teachers. I remember one saying to me: 'Edwina, if I kidnapped you, how much ransom would your father pay?' That struck me as a very odd thing for a teacher to say.\"</p> <p>Grosvenor was a goddaughter of Princess Diana and her father is a godfather to Prince William. But the family motto, <em>virtus non stemma</em> \u2013 it's what you do, not who you are connected to, that counts \u2013 seems to have had a particular significance for her. \"It's really from my early teens that I remember thinking properly about these issues,\" she says. \"When I learned about the destructive dangers of drugs, I remember thinking, 'how come that person has taken drugs and I haven't?' I became fascinated by the idea of people being born into different families and the way that that can determine their life journeys. After working in the prison in Nepal I knew I&#xa0;had found what I wanted to do.\"</p> <p>Studying sociology and criminology at Northumbria University, she says, gave her little real insight: \"I didn't learn much about criminals and learned nothing at all about prison. What I did learn was that academics like to put things into boxes.\" Her dissertation was on children reared in prison. \"I think a lot of people are unaware that we do have babies in our prison system. There aren't very many mother and baby units. The differences in the west <a href=\"http://globalpressinstitute.org/global-news/asia/nepal/education-elusive-nepali-children-raised-jail\" title=\"compared to the east\">compared to the east</a> are huge, but the question is the same \u2013 should we have babies in prison?\"</p> <p>She says she didn't really know the answer until she had a child of her own.

But having now got a baby daughter the whole process fills me with horror. I find it quite difficult. I almost don't want to go there, thinking about what it must be like to go through that, no matter what you have done.\"</p> <p>She volunteered in Styal prison when it had one of the worst records for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/11/women-prisoners-suffering-mental-health\" title=\"prisoner suicides\">prisoner suicides</a> in the country. \"It was grim sometimes,\" she says, \"but I learned so much.\" Later she worked in Garth category B adult male prison, helping with the <a href=\"http://www.restorativejustice.org.uk/what_is_restorative_justice/\" title=\"Restorative Justice\">Restorative Justice</a> programme. \"A lot of people think restorative justice is soft, but there was nothing soft about what I saw \u2013 the prisoners were terrified and humbled when they had to face members of the public who had been victims of crime.\"</p> <p>One of the kindest, gentlest women I ever came across while serving my own prison sentence was raped by a prisoner in the prison chapel. Another female prison worker I knew was taken&#xa0;hostage and held captive for three days. Has Grosvenor ever felt in any danger in a prison? How does Snow feel about her going on to wings and landings? \"In a way, naivety is bliss,\" she says. \"I've read and I've heard stuff, but Dan is pretty relaxed about it. My parents and Dan are more proud of the fact that I'm actually doing something that I love doing and that means something to me. I love going to work \u2013 and they just see that. I've always got one eye on the possibility of things going wrong. One day something awful might happen to me, but if it ever happens I'll deal with it.\"</p> <p>Wouldn't it be easier just to sit back and enjoy the wealthy lifestyle? Why persevere with the thanklessness that abounds in prison reform work? \"If a family member of mine was attacked, if something awful happened to them, I'd want that offender to go inside, but I'd want him or her to come out less likely to hurt anyone else. A lot of people think you're investing your money in prison, in bad people. I get asked: 'Why aren't you helping sick children?' A lot of people talk about prison and prisoners without ever mentioning the victims. Anyone who helps an offender is doing it because they want to reduce the number of future victims.\"</p> <p>Her most ambitious investment project to date is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BD1kQi_7EI\" title=\"Pathways\">Pathways</a>, a \u00a310m community regeneration programme organised around St Anselm's church in Kennington, south London. The plan is to create a variety of sustainable businesses run by ex-offenders, including an 80-cover bistro and restaurant that will run along the same lines as the Clink. Grosvenor has spent half a million pounds developing the project, the plans of which were approved by the council earlier this year. \"It's based around the church but it's not faith-based,\" she says. \"Pathways really is about a community working together to provide employment, skills training and accommodation, not just for ex-offenders but also for any local young people who need that support.\"</p> <p>What does she hope her work will achieve? Does she have an end goal? \"I never came into this work with an agenda,\" she says. \"It has just crept up on me, and for better or worse it has consumed me. Like anyone who has a job I have some really good days and I have some really shit days when I want everyone to get lost. But I'm never put off. In 20 or 30 years' time I&#xa0;want to be able to look back and say I&#xa0;did something worthwhile \u2013 I made a&#xa0;difference.\"</p>",

An investigation by the FSA is likely to focus on heavy trading on Friday, which sent the shares down over 20%, even though the allegations were only made public on Monday.</p> <p>On Tuesday Bumi defended its investment in the Indonesian mining assets. \"The bottom line is that we have high quality, valuable Indonesian coal assets and we have been clear about delivering on high standards of corporate governance,\" said Nick von Schirnding, head of corporate affairs at Bumi plc. \"We have clearly had our challenges and structure remains one of the key issues we are looking at \u2013 something we need to resolve over the next few months.\"</p> <p>The saga has fascinated the City, particularly as Rothschild had worked furiously to become known as a serious financier and shed the playboy image of his university days, when he was famously a member of Oxford University's Bullingdon Club at the same time as the chancellor, George Osborne.</p> <p>A string of deals including creation of investment vehicles focusing on natural resources, plus winnings from running the hedge fund Atticus, meant the Sunday Times Rich List put his worth at \u00a31bn.</p> <p>However, shares in Bumi plc have lost 41% since Friday and 85% since floating last year, a huge blow to Rothschild's reputation and his fortune: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/sep/24/bumi-shares-slump-small-investors?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">investors have begun to question</a> whether the financier and his non-executives have failed on promises to bring western-style corporate governance to emerging market companies.</p> <p>Bumi, JP Morgan and Hannam declined to comment on the background to the transaction, although it is understood that at the time of the introduction the Bakrie family that controlled PT Bumi Resources was a client of the investment bank in Asia, which had helped in the raising of a high-yield bond.</p> <p>Hannam, a former member of the territorial SAS and one of the City's most senior bankers, quit his job at JP Morgan in April after being fined \u00a3450,000 by the FSA for market abuse.

However, it added that Hannam's \"honesty and integrity is not in question\".</p> <p>The banker is appealing against the punishment on the grounds that it was not insider information, and was disclosed as part of his job.

  "<p>President Barack Obama today sought to reset US relations with the Arab world in the wake of anti-American riots triggered by an amateur video insulting the prophet Mohamed, that led to the death of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.</p> <p>Obama used his speech to the UN general assembly, expected to be his last major foreign policy address before the November elections, to pay a personal tribute to Stevens, highlighting the murdered diplomat's passion for Arab culture and support for democracy, and present it a model for American-Arab relations.</p> <p>The president also restated the US position on the Iran nuclear programme: that there was still time for diplomacy, but not \"unlimited time\". He also called for the emergence of a new, democratic and inclusive government in Syria, but offered no new ideas about how the international community should help attain that goal, or how the deadlock in the UN security council over Syria might be broken.</p> <p>In a landmark speech in Cairo three years ago, Obama promised a \"new beginning\" in the relationship between his country and the Islamic world, but that relationship is now at its lowest point since the start of the Arab spring as a result of a YouTube video clip made by an Egyptian American insulting the prophet Mohamed.</p> <p>The crude 14-minute clip went viral over the summer, triggering furious anti-American demonstrations across the Middle East and the wider Islamic world.</p> <p>Obama balanced condemnation of the \"crude and disgusting\" video, with a denunciation of the violence that it sparked and a demand for the new Arab governments to do more to defend American diplomats.</p> <p>\"I have made it clear that the US government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity,\" Obama said. \" It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well.

The question, then, is how we respond. And on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence,\" he said. He also criticised double standards in the protection of religion in the Middle East.</p> <p>\"The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. Yet to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied,\" the president said.</p> <p>He also made clear his dissatisfaction with the reaction of some Arab governments to the wave of anti-American riots. US officials have singled out the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, in this regard.</p> <p>\"If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an embassy; or to put out statements of regret, and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama expressed gratitude to the government and people of Libya, after pro-American protesters seized control of the bases of the extremist militias implicated in the attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi, but he made it clear Washington did not believe all the perpetrators had been caught, and left open the option of taking direct action.</p> <p>\"The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and the Libyan people. And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice,\" the president said.</p> <p>Earlier, the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon issued an unusually stern denouncement of security council inaction over Syria, which he called \"a regional calamity with global ramifications.\"</p> <p>\"This is a serious and growing threat to international peace and security which requires security council action,\" Ban said. \"The international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control.\"</p> <p>UN officials said that Ban has become increasingly frustrated by the security council's deadock over Syria and had decided to speak out in his bluntest speech to date.</p> <p>He also called for those responsibility for atrocities in Syria to be held accountable, noting \"there is no statute of limitations for such extreme violence\", and placing most of the blame on the Assad regime. At present, Russian and Chinese objections are blocking the international criminal court from launching an investigation into war crimes, and Ban's comments were widely seen at the UN as a direct rebuke for their obstruction of the machinery of international justice.</p> <p>\"Brutal human rights abuses continue to be committed, mainly by the government, but also by opposition groups. Such crimes must not go unpunished,\" he said. \"It is the duty of our generation to put an end to impunity for international crimes, in Syria and elsewhere. It is our duty to give tangible meaning to the responsibility to protect.\"</p> <p>The responsibility to protect was a principle adopted by the UN in the 1990s, stating that the international community to intervene to protect civilian populations when their states were unwilling or unable to do so.</p> <p>Ban also had pointed words for two leaders due to speak at the same UN podium later in the week: Binyamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling for them to pull back from the brink of a new Middle East conflict, and to ratchet down their rhetoric.</p> <p>\"I \u2026 reject both the language of de-legitimisation and threats of potential military action by one state against another. Any such attacks would be devastating. The shrill war talk of recent weeks has been alarming,\" Ban said. \"Leaders have a responsibility to use their voices to lower tensions instead of raising the temperature and volatility of the moment.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu has been successful in displacing the Israel-Palestinian impasse from the international agenda by repeated threats to take military action against Iran. But he was warned by Ban that his government's policies in the West Bank were stoking renewed conflict.</p> <p>\"The two-state solution is the only sustainable option. Yet the door may be closing, for good. The continued growth of Israeli settlement settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory seriously undermines efforts toward peace. We must break this dangerous impasse,\" Ban said.</p>",
  "<p>Record droughts in the US and Russia are threatening to curtail the world's bacon supply, farmers in the US and Europe are warning.</p> <p>So dire is the situation that a world shortage of pork and bacon is \"unavoidable\" next year, according to Britain's National Pig Association. And in the US farmers predict pork prices will hit new highs in 2013 as farmers cut back on production due to soaring feed costs.</p> <p>Across Europe swine herds are shrinking. Ireland's farmers cut their herd 6.6% in the 12 months to June 2012, Denmark's fell 2.3%, Germany, Europe's largest pork producer, cut back 1.3% and there were cuts in countries including Spain, France, Italy, Hungary and Poland.</p> <p>In the US the cost of bringing home the bacon has almost doubled since 2006, according to economist Steve Meyer at Paragon Economics, and an adviser to the National Pork Producers Council. Consumption is falling as less pork is produced and prices rise, down from 50.8lbs per person per year in 2007 to a predicted 44.16lbs in 2013.</p> <p>\"It's not that people don't want to eat pork, it's just that they increasingly can't afford to,\" said Meyer. \"We've been warning about this for years. Now that we are talking about bacon, we've really got everyone's attention.\"</p> <p>US pork producers have been hit as corn and soy prices have soared following this year's drought. Livestock farmers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/30/farmers-obama-administration-ethanol-drought\">blame a US government mandate</a> that 10% of the US's fuel supply must come from corn-based ethanol for propping up sky high prices. The average cost of producing 100lbs of pork was $52.76 between 1999 and 2006, said Meyer. Next year he expects it to top $100.</p> <p>Dr Zo\u00eb Davies, general manager of the National Pig Association in the UK said US corn prices and the impact of the ethanol subsidy were being felt worldwide. \"We are competing in a fierce global market for feed,\" she said.</p> <p>Davies said 7,000 extra pigs per month were now being slaughtered in the UK by farmers looking to get out of pork production. By the end of the year she expects an extra 35,000 sows to have been killed early. \"The market will sort this out, people will go out of business, there will be less pork products and prices will rise,\" she said.</p> <p>Meyer said one person who might be pleased about rising bacon prices was Michelle Obama, a champion of health eating. </p> <p>\"I'm not much for conspiracy theories but if people are eating less meat, that's a good thing as far as they are concerned,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>China's response to a wave of protests in Tibet this year, including restricting access to the Tibetan Himalayas, may have led to a higher number of casualties in the mountaineering disaster this weekend, expedition organisers have claimed.</p> <p>China rejected climbing permits for mountaineers wanting to climb in Tibet, meaning that more people than usual attempted to ascend the mountain in Nepal.</p> <p>About 25 climbers were preparing to leave their tents at a camp high on the mountain of Manaslu, the world's eight highest peak, at dawn on Sunday morning when debris from a falling ice cliff swept over them. Rescuers have so far brought down the bodies of eight victims \u00f3 four French, one each from Germany, Italy and Spain, and a Nepali guide.</p> <p>With several other climbers missing, the death toll is expected to rise, making the tragedy one of the worst in recent mountaineering history. Ten were successfully evacuated.</p> <p>Though veteran climbers and experts say that the numbers attempting an ascent of the mountain did not cause the disaster, many more mountaineers were present on the mountain than is usual after Chinese authorities cut down on permits for mountaineers hoping to climb in Tibet.</p> <p>About 30 teams registered to climb Manaslu, a 50 percent increase over last year, said Ang Tshering, who runs the popular Asian Trekking agency in Nepal.</p> <p>Local journalists reported that there were around 250 climbers on the mountain when disaster struck, almost flattening a camp at an altitude of 7,000m. Most were at base camp however and out of danger.</p> <p>Expeditions attempting the 8165 metre peak appear to have included two teams both aiming to complete the first ski descent of the mountain without the assistance of bottled oxygen. One team had been forced to switch to a Nepali peak at the last minute after being refused a visa by Chinese authorities.</p> <p>Tibet is a sensitive area for Chinese authorities which limit access for foreign tourists when tensions there rise. Permits to mountaineering expeditions were cut off altogether in 2008 while Chinese climbers took the Olympic torch to the top of Mount Everest before the Beijing Games.</p> <p>More than 50 Tibetans have died after setting light to themselves since March last year to bring attention to what they say is their suffering under China's repressive policies. In the most recent incident, two teenagers, a monk and a former monk, died near the Kirti monastery, a centre of protests in eastern parts of the historical area of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tibet\" title=\"\">Tibet</a> , outside the current \"Tibetan Autonomous Region\".</p> <p>The protests have led to major security clampdowns.</p> <p>China says Tibet has always been part of its territory and calls <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/26/what-drives-tibetan-self-immolate\" title=\"\">protesters who self-immolate</a> criminals or \"separatists\". Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries.</p> <p>Bikram Newpane of the Katmandu-based Himalayan Rescue Association said China's ban on permits for climbing the northern face of the Himalayas in Tibet could have added to the dangers.</p> <p>\"It is never 100 percent safe up on the mountains and the risks are always there. But there were more people on the mountains this year,\" Newpane said.</p> <p>Veteran Nepali climbers called the disaster \"natural\" and said it was wrong to say it was \"man made\".</p> <p>But overcrowding has been a constant concern on sought-after peaks because of limited space on popular routes and short \"weather windows\" when conditions allow climbers to reach the summit of mountains.</p> <p>Four people were killed on Mount Everest earlier this year when dozens of climbers clogged the same narrow trail to the summit, forcing many to stay too long at high altitudes and exhaust their oxygen supplies.</p> <p>One Nepalese official said the popularity of Manaslu, first climbed in 1956, was not a problem.</p> <p>\"Yes, base camp might have been a bit crowded but the route higher up was not. This is a natural disaster. Not man-made in any way,\" he told The Guardian shortly after news of the tragedy broke on Sunday.</p> <p>Authorities in poverty-stricken Nepal are sensitive to charges that too many permits for climbing mountains are sold to foreign expeditions. However, the permits generate much needed hard currency. A permit for Manaslu costs $5000.</p> <p>Ang Tsering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association who has climbed Manaslu several times, said there was \"no any exact reason for any one avalanche\" though climate change could have played a role.</p> <p>Climbers blame global warming for some of the recent tragedies on the Himalayan peaks, which have been hit by warmer temperatures which make sudden melting of otherwise stable frozen snow slopes more likely.<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>Cairn Energy</strong> has had mixed fortunes in its drilling exploits in Greenland and it seems to be concentrating much of its efforts now on the North Sea.</p> <p>To that end it has raised nearly $1bn towards the cost of funding future developments - and possible acquisitions - by selling part of its remaining stake in its Indian subsidiary. It has sold 152m shares in Cairn India in the market for $910m, representing 8% of the business and leaving it with a 10% shareholding. Last year Cairn sold a controlling stake in the Indian business to <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> for $8.7bn.</p> <p>Cairn closed 2.3p lower at 282.7p while Vedanta finished 9p lower at \u00a310.47, down with the rest of the mining sector.</p> <p>Investors remained nervous ahead of any request from Spain for a bailout, and amid continuing uncertainty about the fate of Greece. So riskier assets like miners were unwanted, with <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> down 8p at 322.6p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> losing 40p to \u00a329.40.</p> <p><strong>Glencore</strong> fell 7.45p to 346.7p awaiting developments in its merger offer for <strong>Xstrata</strong>, down 19.8p at 980p. Meanwhile Glencore unveiled a $1.4bn agreement to raise its stake in Kazakh zinc producer Kazzinc to nearly 70%.</p> <p>Overall better than expected housing, consumer confidence and manufacturing figures from the US gave the market a late lift. So by the close the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was up 20.87 points at 5859.71.</p> <p><strong>Weir</strong> was the biggest riser in the leading index, as investors latched on to suggestions the engineer might become a bid target for GE.</p> <p>On Monday the US group created a new mining unit and said it was on the lookout for acquisitions. Weir, whose oil and gas division could already be seen as attractive to the likes of GE, also has a minerals business. Oriel Securities was one broker to suggest Weir could be on GE's shopping list.</p> <p>So after a 1.7% decline in its shares on Monday, Weir rose 70p to \u00a318.11. At that level the company is valued at nearly \u00a34bn.</p> <p>A revival in its cruise business after its Costa Concordia vessel ran aground off the coast of Italy in January helped <strong>Carnival</strong> to a better than expected set of third quarter figures. With net income of $1.2bn for the three months and a 9% rise in booking in the last six weeks, the company said it expected full year revenues to be flat to slightly down on last year. This was marginally better than its previous guidance in June, and the news pushed its shares 76p higher to \u00a323.42.</p> <p><strong>Diageo</strong> added 3p to \u00a317.54 as the drinks company confirmed last week's speculation that it was in talks about buying a stake in India's United Spirits.</p> <p>But <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> lost 23p to 1457.5p following reports a key 18% stake could be up for grabs.</p> <p>Singapore investor Temasek is, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a27e3094-0671-11e2-bd29-00144feabdc0.html#axzz27NV1lQrO\" title=\"\">according to the Financial Times</a>, considering selling its shareholding which is worth around \u00a36bn. Temasek reportedly wishes to cut its exposure to financial services given the economic uncertainty, and at the same time has given up the idea of merging the bank with another of its investments, Singapore's DBK bank, given the current attitude to bid banking mergers.</p> <p>Apparently there are no discussions currently underway, so any sale process could take a while. Even so, the thought of an 18% stake overhanging the market was enough to send Standard Chartered's shares lower, although analysts said it could also ignite bid speculation.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, coal miner <strong>Bumi </strong>recovered 20.4p to 168p following Monday's news of an investigation into alleged irregularities in Indonesia.</p> <p><strong>Inmarsat</strong> jumped 18.5p to 602p following a buy note from Jefferies. The broker's analyst Giles Thorne said:</p> <blockquote> We see the recent re-rating as the market fully unwinding the discount it had put on the equity following the August 2011 profit warning. The stellar second quarter 2012 results should have emphatically put to bed any lingering concerns on legacy operational issues. With up to 260p of potential upside, we now look to the future and consider the single biggest catalyst for the shares: Global Xpress. </blockquote> <p>Global Xpress is a super-fast broadband network to be delivered by the (yet to be launched) Inmarsat-5 satellite system and will allow Inmarsat to offer two services, the Ka-band fast broadband and established maritime L-band system.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Bwin partydigital </strong>added 1.8p to 107.6p on takeover speculation. Malaysia's Genting was one name in the frame, alongside an Australian company or a consortium bidder, with a price of 180p a share mentioned.</p> <p><strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Communications</strong> - which last week revealed it was in talks about selling its Monaco &amp; Islands operations for around $1bn - fell 0.79p to 37.11p after a negative broker note.</p> <p>Liberum Capital moved its recommendation from hold to sell, saying that the shares had recovered after May's dividend cut, partly buoyed by hopes of restructuring. A possible deal to sell its Monaco &amp; Islands operations suggested there was substance to this hope, said analyst Lawrence Sugarman, but the valuation was starting to look stretched.</p> <p>Finally logistics company <strong>Wincanton</strong> added 2p to 51.25p on talk its records management division could be up for sale, at a price representing a substantial chunk of the company's current market capitalisation.</p>",
  "<p>We have always shaped the environment around us in order to achieve a particular function. Today, our homes should provide comfort, our workplaces should support productivity, and our hospitals should make us healthy. The choices we make when designing and operating these spaces are fundamental in achieving the desired outcome and determining how we live and feel.</p> <p>There have been a large number of studies into the effect of workplace design on employees in a corporate setting, but much less focus on other workplace environments such as hospitals. In the healthcare setting, studies have predominantly focused on the effect of the environment on patients rather than employees.</p> <p>There is now widespread consensus that a hospital's physical environment can have a big effect on patient outcomes and recovery times. Factors such as space, lighting, use of colour, acoustics, noise levels, smells and the degree of control a patient has over their environment can all have an impact on the wellbeing and mood of the individual.</p> <p>Control over the environment, for example, has been shown to be linked to a person's real or perceived ability to determine their own outcome and make positive choices. Noise can have a particularly adverse effect on patient sleep patterns, which can be particularly problematic given that nurses are often accustomed to high noise levels and will not notice sounds that may disturb patients, particularly at night. Brain development of premature babies can also be disrupted by a noisy environment and/or by artificial lighting. Alzheimer's patients exhibit less aggression, anxiety and fewer psychotic symptoms when they are placed in private rooms with their own personal objects around them.</p> <p>This understanding of the role of the environment in patient care has advanced to the extent that the Department of Health now has specific guidelines that must be met in the design of new hospitals.</p> <p>However, in contrast to patient care, less attention has been given to the effect that the hospital environment has on the wellbeing and productivity of healthcare staff themselves. And yet, research has shown that levels of staff motivation and job satisfaction can have a direct impact on patient outcomes. By strengthening the bond between the working environment and optimum levels of staff satisfaction to improve patient care, more attention should be given to the parts of hospital design directly affecting healthcare staff. In particular, physical layouts and interior ambience related to communication, productivity and team working.</p> <p>One organisation giving serious consideration to these matters is <a href=\"http://www.merseycare.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Mersey Care NHS Trust</a>. Here, the senior management team has recognised that the physical work environment should be viewed as an important operational tool which influences the way staff provide care.</p> <p>Arup have worked with Mersey Care to provide input into the design of a number of new mental health facilities. The overall aim was to ensure that design interventions reflect the needs of all user groups, including healthcare staff.</p> <p>Studies were carried out at 18 wards to understand the core activities of all staff groups.</p> <p>In most organisations, changes in workplace design are naturally implemented through a new building or refurbishment of existing spaces. In addition to the obvious improvements this generally brings, many organisations now use such opportunity as a catalyst for a much wider culture change, fundamentally rethinking how work is arranged and how services are delivered.</p> <p>Healthcare organisations can learn from organisations like Mersey Care and better utilise changes in the design of spaces as a catalyst for cultural changes, which will ultimately facilitate improved delivery of services.</p> <p>There is clearly an opportunity for health trusts with large property estates to consider these issues \u2013 in particular improvements in the working environment \u2013 when planning interventions around the efficiency, cost, environmental impacts, and health outcomes for patients.</p> <p>Other organisations have clearly shown that by focusing on space design as an enabler of change, a wide range of benefits can be realised; for an organisation like the NHS, this is an opportunity not to be missed.</p> <p><em>Mary-Clare Race is an associate working within the Consulting practice at Arup in London.

  "<p>Don't think of Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion as a mere handheld companion to Epic Mickey: The Power of Two, which hits the Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3 this November. Instead, think of it as a long overdue sequel to Castle of Illusion, the lavishly crafted Sega game from 1990.</p> <p>In truth, of course, it's both of these things, retaining the paint and paint-thinner mechanics of Warren Spector's series, and the delicate 2D art and side-scrolling action that made the famous mouse's 16bit incarnations such wonderfully sumptuous charmers. Power of Illusion's shaping up to be far from your average 3DS tie-in, in other words \u2013 nostalgic and creative by turns.</p> <p>The plot, such as it is, sees Mickey exploring the shifting chambers of the Castle of Illusion on yet another quest to save Minnie; it's just an excuse, and a fairly bare-bones one, to bottom-bounce your way through decades of classic Disney fare. Early levels channel Peter Pan, for example, sending you racing over the midnight skyline of a sleeping London, leaping from chimney pots to spars of cloud, and eventually heading on to the jungles of Neverland. A few minutes later, Aladdin gets his turn, with stages set in the streets of Agrabah, where pendulum blades swing from awnings and good old quicksand is on hand to keep you moving along at a decent clip.</p> <p>It's all gloriously pretty, using the stereoscopic 3D in smart, understated ways, but that's only half the game - the top half, as it turns out, since a jab of the 3DS' touch screen allows you to pause the action and meddle with the environment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397049795\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348517567924/mickey_2.png\" alt=\"Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is where the paint and paint-thinner come in, as you erase junk that's blocking Mickey's path, and draw in ledges that will help him over long jumps. It's tightly controlled, with the interactive pieces shown in ghost form on the bottom screen, but there's a pleasant arcade flourish to things, too, as you're graded on how well you match the outline to add or remove each item. </p> <p>By the second or third level, you'll be switching between screens every ten seconds, adding cannons that will propel Mickey right across the map, and removing hazards as well as simple obstacles. On paper, it might threaten to break the flow of the game, but in reality in merely builds the rhythm: this is a puzzler as much as a platformer, and it encourages you to use both logic and timing.</p> <p>If any of this screen-swapping stuff sound vaguely familiar, it's because the team at Dreamrift, who are responsible for making Power of Illusion, include veterans of EA's wonderfully deranged Henry Hatsworth DS game, which let players blend together the mechanics of a platformer and a match-three puzzler to synapse-frying effect. Hatsworth was known for its awkward difficulty spikes, incidentally, but if anything Mickey seems surprisingly tooled-up for his adventure, facing off against a selection of enemies with whirlwind and jumping melee attacks, as well as paint and paint-thinner ranged weapons.</p> <p>He's also got a handful of sketches he can employ on each level, which act a little like special moves. One might conjure a chest filled with power-ups, while another might grant him temporary invincibility. Some of them even pile on the cameos, plucking Scrooge McDuck right out of the old Capcom Duck Tales games and sending him pogoing across the landscape on his cane.</p> <p>It's a lovely aside, and it feels entirely appropriate, too. Epic Mickey's a game caught in ceaseless orbit around the ancient lore of Disney's films and theme parks. Surely it's only fitting that the 3DS instalment draws on the company's rich history in games, too?</p> <p><em>\u2022 Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion is released in the UK on 3DS on 23 November</em></p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney could do worse than look to the Book of Mormon (the musical, not the scripture) for some tips on how to increase his likeability. When I saw the show a few days ago \u2013 an odd experience, in the middle of an ongoing global blasphemy debate, not least because half the audience looked as if it would have been more at home at Evita or Wicked \u2013 it somehow managed through the mockery, to make one feel quite fond of Mormons. </p> <p>And of the elasticity of American culture. The Guardian is pretty relaxed about swearing, but there is a line in the first 10 minutes of the show that's too rude even for here, and which might delicately be summarised as a character's suggestion that God, in his cruelty, be penetrated in every orifice, with an itemised list of what that entails. People were expecting something a bit naughty from the creators of South Park, but this drew a unified gasp across the auditorium. In a mainstream theatre on a Sunday afternoon, it was hard not to find this cheering.</p> <p>Of course, those likely to be seriously offended by the show probably wrote off New York as Sodom and Gomorrah long ago and are too busy picketing abortion clinics in Mississippi to bother with Broadway. And in terms of the show's topicality, Mormonism isn't a religion whose members might be feeling more broadly under siege. No one is going to stop a dorky white guy at airport security for looking like a Mormon. But still. </p> <p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone always said it was an affectionate portrait of the church, the kind of affection that comes with a pat on the head for being cutely delusional. In fact, it's a deeply scathing attack on religion in general, depicting the two main characters \u2013 missionaries to Uganda \u2013 as well-meaning idiots who sing a song about how they'll believe anything and who hope that, with any luck, the promised land will look like Orlando.</p> <p>Interestingly, the biggest laugh of the afternoon went to a line from a \"Ugandan villager\", who pointed out that Salt Lake City, spiritual home of Mormonism, should be taken not literally, but as a metaphor. The Ugandans, it turned out, were more sophisticated than the Americans in understanding this \u2013 a point everyone in the theatre was very pleased with themselves for enjoying.</p> <p>In spite of all this, you came out of the show feeling weirdly warm towards the Mormons, for having the ability to laugh at themselves, even though it wasn't them doing the laughing. Given that one of Romney's image problems has been a brittle sense of his insecurity, it wouldn't hurt him to take note of the fuzzy dividends that come with being seen to know one's own faults. You know: \"I have such distance and clarity in regard to these drawbacks in my personality, they practically belong to someone else!\"</p> <p>Before the Book of Mormon opened, people anticipated protests outside the theatre, but unlike the Christian protesters who disrupted Jerry Springer: the Opera 10 years ago, that didn't happen. The Mormon church played a blinder with its response to the show, in a well-measured statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The production may attempt to entertain audiences for an evening, but the Book of Mormon as a volume of scripture will change people's lives forever by bringing them closer to Christ.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Which makes you wonder who their PR team are, and why they aren't working for the Romney campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Already <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/24/anti-badger-culling-petition-signatures\" title=\"\">distraught at the notion of the badgers being culled</a> en masse because of their perceived role in spreading bovine tuberculosis, the nation is now gagging at the suggestion, from celebrity chef Clarissa Dickson Wright that the innocent, stripy-faced animals should be cooked. And eaten. (Small surprise: the former \"Fat Lady\" has a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clarissas-England-Through-English-Counties/dp/1444729098/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348582211&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">new book</a> to promote.)</p> <p>Since 1992 it has been illegal to kill badgers in Britain \u2013 so the only way to get hold of one to eat has been by picking one off the road. But if the government's full culling programme goes ahead thousands of badgers could be shot this winter. Meat is getting more expensive after the global grain prices spike of this summer. Wild meats like venison, rabbit, pigeon and, yes, badger and hedgehog, are looking rather tastier.</p> <p>Arthur Boyt thinks Dickson Wright is talking good gastronomic sense. He has been eating badger most of his life: he stewed up a piece of back meat with the animal's genitals for supper last Thursday. \"Dog, especially labrador, is my favourite, but badger makes a pretty good meal.\" Boyt, a 73-year-old former civil servant and scientist, does not kill animals. All his free meat comes from the roads around his home on Bodmin Moor.</p> <p>\"I'm against the cull,\" he said, \"but it would be ridiculous not to use the dead badgers. I've eaten badger for 55 years and I certainly haven't got TB. As with all meat you just make sure you cook it long and hot enough to kill any bugs.\"</p> <p>A badger will make a meal for two, says Boyt, though his wife Sue is a vegetarian. So he often shares the animal with his son and daughter-in-law, who comes from Papua and is used to eating \"maggots and grubs.\" Boyt's favourite part of the animal is the head: \"There's five tastes and textures in there, including the tongue, the eyeballs, the muscle \u2026 The salivary glands taste quite different. And of course, the brain. You get that by putting a teaspoon in the hole in the back and rooting around.\"</p> <p>To a modern cook, eating badger might sound like a terrible idea, but people who grew up in rural Britain during the second world war remember eating it and there are historic recipes for it from across Europe.</p> <p>Badger doesn't appear in any of the great 18th century British cookbooks, and though Dickson Wright says the animal has always been a staple, it seems to have been a food only for the poor. But in France <a href=\"http://www.gastronomydomine.com/?p=184\" title=\"\"><em>blaireau au sang</em> (badger with blood) is a well-remembered recipe</a>. In Italy and the Balkans rural people have a culture of badger-eating. In Russia badgers have been a food and a folk-medicine, their fat a cure for coughs. The Prussians even bred a dog \u2013 the dachshund (badger hound) \u2013 to hound the poor beasts out of their setts.</p> <p>There are tales of West Country pubs serving badger ham as a bar snack (although these might be classed with the stories of fermenting the scrumpy with a dead rat). Boyt's usual recipe is simpler. He skins and joints the badger, saves the offal and then makes a traditional casserole, adding whatever vegetables are in the house. No wine, though he may drink a glass with the meal. \"I'm a down-to-earth chap \u2013 I like simplicity. It's nice meat \u2013 why titillate it?\"</p> <p>European recipes for badger often ask you to lay it in running water for several days to get rid of a rank flavour. But Boyt says that's only necessary for fox. And badger, though it doesn't need to be hung, can be eaten when it's \"quite green\" - that's assuming the diners aren't similarly tinged.</p>",

  "<p>Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentleman: I would like to begin today by telling you about an American named Chris Stevens.<br> </p> <p>Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps, and taught English in Morocco. He came to love and respect the people of North Africa and the Middle East, and he would carry that commitment throughout his life. As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria; from Saudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked \u2013 tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic and listening with a broad smile.</p> <p>Chris went to Benghazi in the early days of the Libyan revolution, arriving on a cargo ship. As America's representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded, and crafted a vision for a future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. After the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy, as Libyans held elections, built new institutions, and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship.</p> <p>Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the country he served, and saw dignity in the people he met. Two weeks ago, he travelled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital. That's when America's compound came under attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city he helped to save. He was 52 years old.</p> <p>I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures, and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents. He acted with humility, but stood up for a set of principles \u2013 a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice, and opportunity.</p> <p>The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and the Libyan people. And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice. I also appreciate that in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region \u2013 including Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen \u2013 have taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities, and called for calm. So have religious authorities around the globe.</p> <p>But the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America. They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded \u2013 the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; and that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens.</p> <p>If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an Embassy; or to put out statements of regret, and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis. Because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart, and the hopes we hold in common.</p> <p>Today, we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations.</p> <p>It has been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country, and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation that has taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change.</p> <p>We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own beliefs in the aspirations of men and women who took to the streets.</p> <p>We insisted on change in Egypt, because our support for democracy put us on the side of the people.</p> <p>We supported a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were not being served by a corrupt status quo.</p> <p>We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition, and with the mandate of the U.N. Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents; and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant.</p> <p>And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar al-Assad must come to an end so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop, and a new dawn can begin.</p> <p>We have taken these positions because we believe that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. These are not simply American values or Western values \u2013 they are universal values. And even as there will be huge challenges that come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that ultimately government of the people, by the people and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity, and individual opportunity that serve as a basis for peace in our world.</p> <p>So let us remember that this is a season of progress. For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians, and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were credible, competitive, and fair. This democratic spirit has not been restricted to the Arab World. Over the past year, we have seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal, and a new President in Somalia. In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society; a courageous dissident has been elected to Parliament; and people look forward to further reform. Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity, and the right to determine their future.</p> <p>And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said: \"to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.\" True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe, and businesses can be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear; on the rule of law and due process that guarantees the rights of all people.</p> <p>In other words, true democracy \u2013 real freedom \u2013 is hard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation to crack down on dissent. In hard economic times, countries may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies, at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform.</p> <p>Moreover, there will always be those that reject human progress \u2013 dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend upon the status quo; and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern Ireland to South Asia; from Africa to the Americas; from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we've witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order. At times, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of faith, race or tribe; and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world. In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask how much they are willing to tolerate freedom for others.</p> <p>That is what we saw play out the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world. I have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity. It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well \u2013 for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and religion. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country. We not only respect the freedom of religion \u2013 we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe. We understand why people take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among them.</p> <p>I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video. The answer is enshrined in our laws: our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs. Moreover, as President of our country, and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and I will always defend their right to do so. Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views \u2013 even views that we disagree with.</p> <p>We do so not because we support hateful speech, but because our Founders understood that without such protections, the capacity of each individual to express their own views, and practice their own faith, may be threatened. We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can become a tool to silence critics, or oppress minorities. We do so because given the power of faith in our lives, and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression, it is more speech \u2013 the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.</p> <p>I know that not all countries in this body share this understanding of the protection of free speech. Yet in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete. The question, then, is how we respond. And on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence.</p> <p>There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There is no video that justifies an attack on an Embassy. There is no slander that provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in Lebanon, or destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death and destruction in Pakistan.</p> <p>More broadly, the events of the last two weeks speak to the need for all of us to address honestly the tensions between the West and an Arab World moving to democracy. Just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not, and will not, seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions abroad, and we do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue. Nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks, or the hateful speech by some individuals, represents the views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims\u2013 any more than the views of the people who produced this video represent those of Americans.</p> <p>However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all leaders, in all countries, to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism. It is time to marginalize those who \u2013 even when not resorting to violence \u2013 use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel as a central principle of politics. For that only gives cover, and sometimes makes excuses, for those who resort to violence.</p> <p>That brand of politics \u2013 one that pits East against West; South against North; Muslim against Christian, Hindu, and Jew \u2013 cannot deliver the promise of freedom. To the youth, it offers only false hope. Burning an American flag will do nothing to educate a child. Smashing apart a restaurant will not fill an empty stomach. Attacking an Embassy won't create a single job. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together: educating our children and creating the opportunities they deserve; protecting human rights, and extending democracy's promise.</p> <p>Understand that America will never retreat from the world. We will bring justice to those who harm our citizens and our friends. We will stand with our allies and are willing to partner with countries to deepen ties of trade and investment; science and technology; energy and development \u2013 efforts that can spark economic growth for all of our people, and stabilize democratic change. But such efforts depend upon a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect. No government or company; no school or NGO will be confident working in a country where its people are endangered. For partnership to be effective, our citizens must be secure and our efforts must be welcomed.</p> <p>A politics based only on anger \u2013one based on dividing the world between us and them \u2013 not only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately undermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an interest in standing up to these forces. Let us remember that Muslims have suffered the most at the hands of extremism. On the same day our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than ten Yemenis were killed in a car bomb in Sana'a; and several Afghan children were mourned by their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul.</p> <p>The impulse towards intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over time it cannot be contained. The same impulses toward extremism are used to justify war between Sunnis and Shia, between tribes and clans. It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim-majority countries than a decade of violence. Extremists understand this. And because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant. They do not build, they only destroy.</p> <p>It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the past. We cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future.</p> <p>The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt \u2013 it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted \"Muslims, Christians, we are one.\" The future must not belong to those who bully women \u2013 it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons. The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country's resources \u2013 it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs; workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the men and women that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support.</p> <p>The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. Yet to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied. Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims, and Shiite pilgrims. It is time to heed the words of Gandhi: \"Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit.\" Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and not defined by them. That is what America embodies, and that is the vision we will support.</p> <p>Among Israelis and Palestinians, the future must not belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect of peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on conflict, and those who reject the right of Israel to exist. The road is hard but the destination is clear \u2013 a secure, Jewish state of Israel; and an independent, prosperous Palestine. Understanding that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the parties, America will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that journey.</p> <p>In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today, it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings. And we must remain engaged to assure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence.</p> <p>Together, we must stand with those Syrians who believe in a different vision \u2013 a Syria that is united and inclusive; where children don't need to fear their own government, and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed \u2013 Sunnis and Alawites; Kurds and Christians. That is what America stands for; that is the outcome that we will work for \u2013 with sanctions and consequences for those who persecute; and assistance and support for those who work for this common good. Because we believe that the Syrians who embrace this vision will have the strength and legitimacy to lead.</p> <p>In Iran, we see where the path of a violent and unaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people have a remarkable and ancient history, and many Iranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside their neighbors. But just as it restricts the rights of its own people, the Iranian government props up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist groups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the opportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful, and to meet its obligations to the United Nations.</p> <p>Let me be clear: America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that power for peace. Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear-arms race in the region, and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty. That is why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian government accountable. And that is why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>We know from painful experience that the path to security and prosperity does not lie outside the boundaries of international law and respect for human rights. That is why this institution was established from the rubble of conflict; that is why liberty triumphed over tyranny in the Cold War; and that is the lesson of the last two decades as well. History shows that peace and progress come to those who make the right choices.</p> <p>Nations in every part of the world have travelled this hard path. Europe \u2013 the bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century \u2013 is united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa; from Turkey to South Korea; from India to Indonesia; people of different races, religions, and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations. </p> <p>And it is because of the progress I've witnessed that after nearly four years as President, I am hopeful about the world we live in. The war in Iraq is over, and our troops have come home. We have begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaeda has been weakened and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. I've seen hard choices made \u2013 from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan \u2013 to put more power in the hands of citizens.</p> <p>At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the G-20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency, and worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent. New commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. And later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking.</p> <p>But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of leaders \u2013 it is the people I've seen. The American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away. The students in Jakarta and Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit humankind. The faces in a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations. The young people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. These men, women and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the globe who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity.</p> <p>So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That's what we see on the news, and that consumes our political debates. But when you strip that all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes from faith; and the justice that exists when governments serve their people \u2013 and not the other way around.</p> <p>The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people, and all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. And that is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life.</p> <p>And today I promise you this \u2013 long after these killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens' legacy will live on in the lives he touched. In the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook FB 0.00% photo to one of Chris; in the sign that read, simply, \"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.\"</p> <p>They should give us hope. They should remind us that so long as we work for it justice will be done; that history is on our side; and that a rising tide of liberty will never be reversed. Thank you.</p>",

Their African-American credentials should be snatched if they don't vote,\" proclaimed an impassioned Representative Emanuel Cleaver (Democrat, Missouri) in his address to the 42nd annual legislative conference of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation before the <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/308294-1\">\"voting rights and new age discrimination\"</a> panel.</p> <p>The sense of community responsibility to vote is all the more palpable leading into the November presidential election \u2013 as 17 states passed voter identification laws that would place restrictions on the quarter of the black population that does not hold a form of government-issued ID. In 2012, voting rights have become a resurgent civil rights issue, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/22/michelle-obama-congressional-black-caucus-speech_n_1906631.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003\">prompting First Lady Michelle Obama to call</a> it \"the march or our time\" and \"the sit-in of our day\". While attempts to obstruct voting by African Americans attest to the community's voting power, voter suppression laws serve as painful reminder of the disenfranchisement they perpetually face, even 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.</p> <p>Institutional discrimination has historically driven black voter apathy, which remains an intangible, submerged fact permeating the lives of African Americans unable to see how their voice matters in America. The current challenges for black Americans \u2013 an above-average 14% unemployment rate, more than 27% living in poverty, violence and crime increasing steadily, alongside mortgage foreclosures and debt, and racialized law enforcement initiatives such as \"stop-and-frisk\" \u2013 lead some to feel the need for survival may usurp the right to vote. <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/users/josiepickens\">Writer and Ebony.com contributor Josie Pickens says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That apathy is more common than we'd care to admit- that feeling of powerlessness \u2026 we must also examine a political system that makes its own citizens feel unrepresented and ignored.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The poll taxes and literacy tests that discouraged the \"negro vote\" in a segregated country a century ago have mutated into the voter ID laws and recessionary pressures that deter African Americans from exercising their voting rights in an increasingly polarized political environment. Besides apathy, there is also active resistance from black Americans, who abstain from participating in a flawed political system in which they believe each party serves to oppress and not empower its citizens. Ferrari Sheppard, artist and independent journalist, expresses his reasons for not voting thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The United States [is] run by banks and global elite, presidents and other so-called elected officials are nothing more than customer service representatives, entertaining and lulling the masses to sleep. I refuse to play their game.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Disillusionment with the system finds historical resonance in the political evolution of the renowned African-American scholar, WEB Du Bois, who pivoted from advocating the vote in 1903, to abstentionism in 1956. In his essay, <a href=\"http://www.blackeconomicdevelopment.com/why-i-wont-vote-by-web-du-bois-the-nation-20-october-1956/\">\"Why I Won't Vote\"</a>, published in the Nation in 1956, Du Bois' scathing critique of corporate greed and its influence on politics, of the lack of affordable healthcare, of racial disparities, and of warmongering reads like a manifesto for modern-day popular <a href=\"http://www.officialoccupythehood.org/\">movements like Occupy the Hood</a>. </p> <p>While the abstentionist critique of voting is rooted in a tradition of black American radicalism, it remains \u2013 along with apathy \u2013 a hotly-contested topic of community discussion, as was recently evidenced by the <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1694167/lupe-fiasco-roland-martin-voting-twitter-debate.jhtml\">Twitter debate</a> between Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco and CNN contributor Roland S Martin. Tweets variously denouncing Lupe as a \"clown\", praising this decision to abstain, and supporting his political freedom to choose, exposed a myriad of diverging opinions on how African Americans can create substantive change inside and outside of government.</p> <p>In his famous speech <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9BVEnEsn6Y&amp;feature=related\">\"The Ballot or the Bullet\"</a>, Malcolm X simultaneously encouraged blacks Americans to form a unified bloc that could serve as a swing vote and expressed skepticism that voting could bring about equality.&#xa0;That lecture, delivered nearly 50 years ago, still captures much of the complexity of the black voting landscape today.</p> <p>For many African-American non-voters, whether they are alienated into apathy or willfully abstain, the legacy of black inequity is inescapable, even in the era of an African-American president. So some still ask: we are in this country, but are we of this country?</p>",

It's brilliant so far.

  "<p>The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, has issued an unusually stern denouncement of security council inaction over Syria, which he called \"a regional calamity with global ramifications\".</p> <p>\"This is a serious and growing threat to international peace and security which requires security council action,\" Ban said. \"The international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control.\"</p> <p>UN officials said Ban had become increasingly frustrated by the security council's deadlock over Syria and had decided to speak out in the bluntest terms.</p> <p>He also called for those responsibility for atrocities in Syria to be held accountable, noting \"there is no statute of limitations for such extreme violence\", and placing most of the blame on the Assad regime.</p> <p>At present, Russian and Chinese objections are blocking the international criminal court from launching an investigation into war crimes.</p> <p>\"Brutal human rights abuses continue to be committed, mainly by the government, but also by opposition groups. Such crimes must not go unpunished,\" he said. \"It is the duty of our generation to put an end to impunity for international crimes, in Syria and elsewhere. It is our duty to give tangible meaning to the responsibility to protect.\"</p> <p>The responsibility to protect was a principle adopted by the UN in the 1990s, stating that the international community had to intervene to protect civilian populations when their states were unwilling or unable to do so.</p> <p>Ban also had pointed words for two leaders due to speak at the same UN podium later in the week, Binyamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling on them to pull back from the brink of a new Middle East conflict, and to ratchet down their rhetoric.</p> <p>\"I \u2026 reject both the language of delegitimisation and threats of potential military action by one state against another. Any such attacks would be devastating. The shrill war talk of recent weeks has been alarming,\" Ban said. \"Leaders have a responsibility to use their voices to lower tensions instead of raising the temperature and volatility of the moment.\"</p> <p>Netanyahu has been successful in displacing the Israel-Palestinian impasse from the international agenda by repeated threats to take military action against Iran. But the secretary-general warned that his government's policies in the West Bank were stoking renewed conflict.</p> <p>\"The two-state solution is the only sustainable option. Yet the door may be closing, for good. The continued growth of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory seriously undermines efforts toward peace. We must break this dangerous impasse,\" Ban said.</p>",
  "<p>In the first nine months of the year, we have seen the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/26/cambodia-police-shoot-dead-antilogging-activist\" title=\"\">killing</a> of Cambodia's leading environmental activist, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/sep/12/journalist-safety-cambodia\" title=\"\">journalist</a> and a 14-year-old girl whose community faced eviction. We've also seen the conviction of <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/29/cambodia-joint-letter-regarding-boeung-kak-lake-activists\" title=\"\">13 land activists</a> for legitimate protests; a <a href=\"http://www.fidh.org/Cambodia-Judicial-harassment-of-Mr\" title=\"\">judicial move against</a> one of the country's most respected human rights activists; the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sG6iLwj95o\" title=\"\">harassment</a> of politically active monks; and the arrest of an independent radio station owner on charges of <a href=\"http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2012091258660/National-news/trial-begins-for-alleged-secessionist-mam-sonando.html\" title=\"\">secessionism</a>. And these are just the most outlandish and publicised incidents.</p> <p>As disparate as these cases may seem, there is a common thread that runs through each of them: conflict over natural resources.</p> <p>Cambodia is in the grip of a land-grabbing crisis that has seen more than <a href=\"http://www.camnet.com.kh/cambodia.daily/selected_features/Carving%20Up%20Cambodia.pdf\" title=\"\">2m hectares</a> (5m acres) of land transferred mostly from subsistence farmers to agribusiness. And as good land becomes scarce, the battle for it is becoming increasingly intense. An estimated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/03/cambodian-soldiers-land-rights-prey-trolach\" title=\"\">400,000 people</a> have been affected by land disputes since 2003.</p> <p>This massive transfer of natural resources has been accomplished mostly through Cambodia's economic land concession (ELC) scheme, in which the government leases large plots of land to companies that agree to farm them. Those evicted to make way for superfarms are entitled to compensation, but rarely get it. Cambodia's land title system is in shambles, and poor farmers rarely hold deeds for their land \u2013 even if they are legally entitled to them, based on possession rights.</p> <p>Even a so-called <a href=\"http://www.earthaction.org/2012/05/success-prime-minister-hun-sen-institutes-land-concession-moratorium-in-cambodia.html\" title=\"\">moratorium</a> on new ELCs in May has <a href=\"http://www.forestcarbonasia.org/in-the-media/cambodia-hun-sen-grants-four-economic-land-concessions/\" title=\"\">failed to stem the tide</a>. International donors and civil society groups have long pushed for a ban, but since the moratorium, news of at least another 12 concessions, totalling more than 80,000 hectares, has emerged.</p> <p>The moratorium contains a little-noticed <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/26/us-cambodia-land-idUSBRE85P0G520120626\" title=\"\">loophole</a> \u2013 one so big that it swallows the ban itself. It allows the government to award ELCs that were \"agreed in principle\" prior to May. Of course, there is no public list of the ELCs \"agreed in principle\", so we simply have to take the government's word for it.</p> <p>In other words, it's business as usual \u2013 there's just a new gloss to <a href=\"http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/cambodia/documents/press_corner/20120509_eu_statement_on_economic_land_concessions_en.pdf\" title=\"\">distract</a> confused foreign donors.</p> <p>The driving force behind Cambodia's land crisis may be shortsighted greed, but its legacy could be long-term social and environmental catastrophe. The land grab is creating an underclass of landless citizens who have no stake in society and nothing left to lose.</p> <p>Recourse to the law is not an option. In fact, the law is often used against victims of land grabs, as in the case of the 13 women activists of the Boeung Kak lake community. They were arrested and convicted in May after taking part in a peaceful demonstration over a land dispute <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/aug/10/world-bank-suspends-cambodia-lending\" title=\"\">land dispute</a> that led to the forcible eviction of more than 3,500 families. The women were released in June after <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/24/cambodia-request-joint-statement-concerning-boeung-kak-lake-human-rights-defenders\" title=\"\">international outcry</a>, but three months later, <a href=\"http://www.protectionline.org/Yorm-Bopha-and-Tim-Sakmony-women.html\" title=\"\">two more</a> land activists \u2013 including another Boeung Kak community leader \u2013 were arrested.</p> <p>For the average Cambodian, the only avenues that offer the prospect of success are public protest and individual action. The government is well aware of the desperation, and this fact helps explain the recent spate of arrests, killings and harassment. The authorities are increasingly using violence to keep a lid on things. If evictees don't go peacefully, private firms are willing and able to tap the resources of the state to forcefully capture land.</p> <p>The violence and arrests are symptoms of an accelerating breakdown in Cambodian society. People need outlets for complaint. They need recourse and accountability. Cambodia increasingly has neither. Pressure is building and the system is having difficulty keeping discontent bottled up.</p> <p>On Wednesday, officials will gather for a major conference in Phnom Penh between the Cambodian government and aid partners. At the last conference, in 2010, donors pledged <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/content/cambodias-donors-pledge-11-billion-for-development-95519109/165789.html\" title=\"\">$1.1bn</a> in assistance \u2013 half of Cambodia's national budget. This year presents an opportunity for donor governments to take action to ensure Cambodia addresses the root causes of this breakdown \u2013 from the culture of impunity and corruption to the lack of a proper system of land titles.</p> <p>The first step would be to call for the loophole in the ELC moratorium to be closed \u2013 before more Cambodians are marginalised and it becomes too late. Only when this is done can the country begin its long journey towards transparency and fairness in land rights.</p>",
  "<p>\"Send him to The Hague\" is the chant adopted by activists the world over when discussing their least favourite war criminal. Yet, although the international criminal court (ICC) has been around for 10 years, it's only in the last few months that building work has started on its permanent location.</p> <p>The Dutch were remarkably slow in catching on to the potential benefits of such a high profile for their sleepy seaside administrative town, even though they parade the country's historical links to the 17th Century father of international law, Hugo Grotius, with pride. Now they are full of ways to cash in on their identity as justice capital of the world.</p> <p>In the run up to the negotiations over the ICC in Rome, the Dutch went all out for the right to host the new institution. Their diplomats played a version of \"total football\" the likes of which have not been seen since Johan Cruyff captained the Dutch soccer squad in the 1970's and as a result The Hague was selected as host city without any competition.</p> <p>But even as the government celebrated, there was some anxiety that the court shouldn't end up as \"a free ride for the rest of the world at the Netherlands' expense,\" according to a senior diplomat who helped in the negotiations. Professor Willem Genugten, professor of law in Tilburg, agrees that the Dutch were concerned: \"At the beginning of the millennium it was not clear what the economic benefits would be,\" he says.</p> <p>\"The Dutch are extremely Calvinistic \u2013 making things difficult when it comes to money issues,\" says Professor Peter van Krieken of Webster University. Some of those fears have been allayed by <a href=\"http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/de-gemeente-Den-Haag/internationale-stad/vrede-en-recht/to/Feiten-en-cijfers-stad-van-Vrede-en-Recht.htm\" title=\"\">research</a> by the city authorities showing that international jobs in and around The Hague increased by 50% to 18,000 in the five years to 2010 and that those employees' spending power, along with that of their organisations, supported nearly as many jobs again.</p> <p>To maximise the potential economic benefit for Dutch companies, the government has part-funded <a href=\"http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/\" title=\"\">The Hague Institute for Global Justice </a>(HIGJ) a new legal thinktank in the city. When it <a href=\"http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/toespraken/2011/06/10/opening-of-the-hague-institute-for-global-justice.html\" title=\"\">opened</a> much was made of the links between global justice and the economic realm as two sides of the same coin. The thinktank's brief is to find practical ways to put law to use. One of its projects involves the development of an eco-economic dispute resolution mechanism. \"This is about companies in the Netherlands and elsewhere using natural resources,\" explains van Genugten, who has become HIGJ's Dean.</p> <p>From a diplomatic perspective the Netherlands expects to profit from championing justice and the ICC. The Hague's Mayor, Jozias van Aartsen, <a href=\"http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/de-gemeente-Den-Haag/college-van-B-en-W/to/Speech-by-Mayor-Jozias-van-Aartsen-at-the-reception-for-the-honorary-consuls-11-June-2012.htm\" title=\"\">likes to tells audiences</a> abroad that international justice is the \"vocation of Holland\" and that the Netherlands has a leading role to play in a supranational legal community.</p> <p>But some Dutch officials worry. Warner ten Kate, former political advisor to the UN at the Juba peace talks, describes Dutch support for international justice as \"very extreme\". \"It doesn't allow much space for other considerations to do with conflict resolution. I mean these things do tie your hands diplomatically,\" he says He cites tensions last year around the Sudanese referendum when the Dutch development minster Ben Knapen <a href=\"http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1846099/2011/01/04/Knapen-al-Bashir-kan-aan-macht-blijven.dhtml\" title=\"\">argued</a> in favour of leaving Omar al Bashir in power rather than risking \"chaos\" despite the ICC's arrest warrant against the Sudanese president for genocide. \"It was a fragile situation so that's why he said it,\" says Ten Kate. But then Knapen faced questions in parliament and the minister clarified his position, saying that he was presenting the views of colleagues in Sudan and that <a href=\"http://www.rnw.nl/nederlands/bulletin/uitspraken-knapen-over-sudan-vallen-verkeerd\" title=\"\">\"the Netherlands stood absolutely\" </a>by the demand that Bashir appear before the ICC.</p> <p>Ten Kate asks whether the government can make sensible policy choices or whether they are \"obliged to take the route of simply supporting the ICC and nothing else. It's a limitation on policy options.\"</p> <p>The Dutch are now busy putting the Netherlands more firmly on the map as \"the worldwide centre of expertise in the area of peace and justice,\" van Aartsen said recently.

  "<p>Ideas of how to fund social house building abound. Most are technocratic solutions, failing to tackle deep-seated policy issues and tend to emphasise private investment models or <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/item/why-aren-t-we-building-enough-attractive-homes-myths-misunderstandings-and-solutions?category_id=24\" title=\"\">sale of social housing assets</a> in high value areas.</p> <p>There are a number of interrelated problems that social housing funding proposals need to address. First is a dwindling social housing supply; there are simply not enough homes to meet the nation's needs. There are <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/stockincludingvacants/livetables/\" title=\"\">25% fewer social homes</a> than 30 years ago and our supply of social housing stock has fallen by 10% in the last decade alone. This is at a time when waiting lists and homelessness are growing, and home ownership remains unaffordable to many hopeful first time buyers.</p> <p>Second, the move to mixed public-private funding from 1988 onwards has enabled social housing investment to be kept off the national accounts, but has been underpinned by transfer of subsidy from bricks and mortar to housing costs. Today, for every \u00a31 spent on social house building, \u00a310 is spent on housing benefit compared to a ratio of \u00a31 to \u00a31 in 1979. So investment has moved from economically rational activity that provides national assets to subsidising private lenders.</p> <p>A third issue arises around inequality. One of the deepest economic divides in the UK is generated by housing. Tenure is a more accurate metaphor for inequality today than at any time since the first world war. The wealth gap between home owners and social tenants now averages \u00a3100,000, and this quadruples for the gap between outright owners and tenants.</p> <p>So I am proposing a funding model that seeks to re-balance investment in bricks and mortar from rent subsidies. At a time when government can borrow for virtually no cost, and where investment in physical assets would show on the national balance sheet (whereas housing benefit is a lost subsidy in accounting terms), public spending on social housing is prudent.</p> <p>Our idea is to channel new social housing investment through a tenants mutual, to enable social tenants to own assets, to reduce the wealth gap with home owners and to create an asset-owning democracy. All tenants would be members of the tenants mutual which would aggregate tenants' asset accounts in the style of the <a href=\"http://www.thechildrensmutual.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Children's Mutual</a>. Tenants could save into these accounts, too, and social landlords and others would also be able to invest.</p> <p>The costs of creating such a mutual are considerable, although represent great value for money to the taxpayer by targeting public investment on economically valuable new social housing and community infrastructure. We estimate that providing all social tenants with an average \u00a33,000-5,000 would cost around \u00a312bn in the first year and \u00a32bn annually thereafter. But this would be offset by less strain on housing benefit because the homes provided could be let at lower rents.</p> <p>In the present economic environment, it is critical that we think creatively to challenge wealth inequality and invest in our homes and neighbourhoods. A tenants mutual would increase the number of social homes by at least 200,000 over one parliamentary term, upgrade community facilities to replace lost regeneration funding, stimulate economic growth, improve the self esteem and life chances of social tenants and reduce dependency upon high-cost lenders. It would further foster a savings culture among those on low incomes.</p> <p>In short, a whole range of our policy targets could be achieved in concert within the context of a single mutual model.</p> <p><em>Kevin Gulliver is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.humancity.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Human City Institute</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest jobs in your area</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Weir</strong> is topping the FTSE 100 risers as investors latched on to suggestions the engineer might become a bid target for GE.</p> <p>On Monday the US group created a new mining unit and said it was on the lookout for acquisitions. Weir, whose oil and gas division could already be seen as attractive to the likes of GE, also has a minerals business. Oriel Securities was one broker to suggest Weir could be on GE's shopping list.</p> <p>So after a 1.7% decline in its shares on Monday, Weir is now up 63p to \u00a318.04, a 3.6% jump. At that level the company is valued at nearly \u00a34bn.</p> <p>Overall, in another uncertain day, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently up 10.10 points at 5848.94.</p> <p>Among the mid caps satellite group <strong>Inmarsat</strong> has jumped more than 4% - up 24p to 607.5p - following a buy note from Jefferies. The broker's analyst Giles Thorne said:</p> <blockquote> We see the recent re-rating as the market fully unwinding the discount it had put on the equity following the August 2011 profit warning. The stellar second quarter 2012 results should have emphatically put to bed any lingering concerns on legacy operational issues. With up to 260p of potential upside, we now look to the future and consider the single biggest catalyst for the shares: Global Xpress. </blockquote> <p>Global Xpress is a super-fast broadband network to be delivered by the (yet to be launched) Inmarsat-5 satellite system and will allow Inmarsat to offer two services, the Ka-band fast broadband and established maritime L-band system. Thorne said:</p> <blockquote> Once operational, the Inmarsat-5's will provide Inmarsat with a comprehensive range of global mobile satellite services including mobile broadband communications for deep-sea vessels, in-flight connectivity for airline passengers and streaming high-resolution video, voice and data. It is planned to launch in 2013 and will offer downlink speeds of up to 50 Mbps and up to 5 Mbps over the uplink, from compact user terminals. Furthermore, and this is a critical competitive differentiator, it is being offered bundled with Inmarsat's FleetBroadband meaning the user gets the superior capabilities of Ka-band, but in combination with the weather resilient L-band to deliver an overall highly reliable, high performance communications platform. <br> With this in mind Jefferies believes Global Xpress will mitigate competition from rival VSAT operators, and will also open up new markets such as cruise liners and oil rigs. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Over the past five years I&#xa0;have been acutely aware of the isolation that girls and young women can feel when their needs are forgotten either because of their gender, as happens within youth justice and school exclusion services, or their age, as is the case when they experience violent relationships. From the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/may/03/politics.crime\" title=\"\">Corston review</a> of women in the adult criminal justice system, to attempts to tackle the impact of youth violence on boys and young men, girls have been outnumbered, and, on occasion, forgotten in both policy and practice.</p> <p>Girls are attuned to this gap in services: they have told me that they have felt too young to be in refuges designed for adult women, and felt intimidated in youth violence services. This service gap has made attempts by girls, who are already vulnerable, to turn their lives around even more difficult.</p> <p>So the first ever <a href=\"http://dayofthegirl.org/about/un-international-day-of-the-girl-child/\" title=\"\">UN International Day of the Girl</a> next month is a chance to focus on the specific needs of girls and young women, and the role that girls play in shaping society. I, for one, am thrilled to be involved on 11&#xa0;October, taking part in a speed mentoring session with young women in London.</p> <p>Nationally, we are also seeing progress. Last week, the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/19/teenage-victims-domestic-violence-definition\" title=\"\">announced</a> that the definition of domestic abuse would be changed to include victims aged 16 and 17 (prior to this it only applied to those aged 18 and above). I have used this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/series/girl-in-the-corner\" title=\"\">column</a> to relay young women's accounts of violent relationships over the past two years. This change in definition signals an&#xa0;increased awareness that young women, as well as young men, experience violence in their relationships.</p> <p>However, concerns remain at a local level. Last week, I attended a workshop on girls and gangs. Throughout the day, practitioners raised frustrations about their inability to access girl-only spaces within which to work with young women. Professionals repeatedly cited the challenge of working with vulnerable young women in male-dominated services such as youth offending teams; and how for those girls who were in violent relationships, such an environment was simply too intimidating for them to feel safe and engage with the support on offer.</p> <p>With the change in definition of domestic abuse comes a potential change in services. Questions remain: will this broader definition result in an extension of children's or adult services to cover violence in teenage relationships? And, furthermore, will programmes delivered to adult perpetrators of domestic abuse be extended to perpetrators who are under 18, or will age-specific interventions be developed for young people?</p> <p>As international and national policy begins to shift to recognise the experiences of girls, local services require support, training and co-ordination to make these policies a practical reality. And, throughout this process, girls and young women must be allowed to influence these policies.</p> <p>This month, I visited a girls' school in Durham, and was met by hundreds of teenagers who wanted to make a positive contribution to society and change things for the better. Nationally, the government is committed to working with young people to help develop its work on domestic abuse; we&#xa0;are yet to see if this level of participation extends locally. Now that the voices of girls have been given international recognition, we must ensure they are not lost within their own neighbourhoods.</p> <p>\u2022 Carlene Firmin is a principal policy adviser at the Office of the Children's Commissioner for England.

  "<p>As someone who has been reading YA for years, long before I sat down to write a book of my own, it was less of a surprise and more of a relief to read that, according to a Bowker Market Research survey published earlier in the month, 55% of buyers of YA books are over 18. Why? I take it you're looking for an answer more profound than: because they're brilliant.</p> <p>It's easy to dismiss books for teenagers as books about teenagers. After all, teenagers only care about split ends and beautiful, brooding vampires, right? But teenagers read as widely as adults and yes, they love books like Twilight and The Hunger Games, but to assume that's all they want to read because they're bestsellers is to assume that all adults want to read is Stieg Larsson and Fifty Shades of Grey. And let's not forget that these teenagers are reading Shakespeare and Seamus Heaney at school. If Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Purple Hibiscus, which I read myself recently, is a GCSE text, why wouldn't teenagers want books that are as compelling, as beautiful?</p> <p>But when it comes to crime, do they want the same thing as adults?</p> <p>I think most people who grew up with Nancy Drew and Scooby Doo, as I did, assume that crime for children is more wholesome. They shouldn't be reading about brutal, bloody murders, they should be charging around with magnifying glasses and drinking lashings of ginger beer. And they do, except now there's Lauren St John's Laura Marlin, an 11-year-old detective who solves mysteries with her trusty companion, Skye, the three-legged husky. Or Anthony Read's The Baker Street Boys, a series that sees a group of lads helping Sherlock Holmes solve cases. But what about teenagers? Do they want good old-fashioned mysteries that are solved in time for supper?</p> <p>What do you think?</p> <p>Teenagers are just as demanding as adults. They want to be kept up until 1am, their eyes sore, but desperate to read one more chapter like I was when I read SJ Watson's Before I Go to Sleep. But the stakes are different for teenagers. They don't care if a detective's wife is about to leave him because he's working too much. In the end, a teenager's world can be reduced to just three things: home, school and friends. Threaten just one of those and it's devastating. </p> <p>In my book, one of the characters has to go into Witness Protection. If she had been 30, there may have been some things she'd like to leave behind, some mistakes she'd rather forget. But at 17, she loses everything - her home, school, her friends, her boyfriend - and she's forced to be someone else when she's not sure who she even is yet. </p> <p>That, to me, is the joy of writing for teenagers. They feel things so deeply and for the first time. When something awful happens to a teenager, their loss is their own. It is unreachable. No one has ever been that scared, that lonely. </p> <p>Unlike adults, they don't always have the experience \u2013 or the maturity \u2013 to know what to do, which makes them fearless. They don't think twice about climbing over a fence in the same way an adult would and, because they know everything, don't always ask for help. Take Alex in Daisy Whitney's The Mockingbirds - when she realises that she was date raped, she doesn't go to the police, she approaches a secret society at her school for help. Then there's Jane in Michelle Jaffe's Rosebush, who, after waking from a coma, comes to realise that she wasn't the victim of a hit and run and has to work out which of her friends tried to kill her.</p> <p>That's the remarkable thing about teenagers: they want to tell their own stories, even if they are the victim. When Lauren in Sophie McKenzie's Girl, Missing series finds out that she was snatched as a baby, she's the one who goes looking for her biological parents. And when Gemma is kidnapped in Lucy Christopher's Stolen, the story isn't about her family's effort to find her, as it might be in an adult book, rather Gemma's relationship with her kidnapper. </p> <p>There's no talk of blood splatter in these books, no curmudgeonly detectives who drink too much. These are stories of teenagers learning to deal with horrific things, things an adult would struggle with \u2013 loss, betrayal, grief \u2013 while going to school and trying to graduate as grown ups.</p> <p>Perhaps that's the appeal for teenagers. It certainly is for me. The thrill is not just in solving the mystery, but in surviving, in the same way Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games is. Take Gemma in Stolen, she finds herself in an impossible situation \u2013 kidnapped and taken to the Australian Outback \u2013 yet she doesn't sit there, waiting for Harry Hole to find her, she saves herself.<br><strong><br>Have you got a crime fiction recommendation to share?

  "<p>So Nick Clegg wants to tax the rich? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/29/lib-dems-french-style-tax-wealthy-assets?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Clegg proposes French-style tax on wealth, 7 September)</a>. That sounds good and, yes, making cuts should not be the only solution proposed as those who can afford it should certainly pay a fair share.</p> <p>But who are Britain's rich? The vanguard of this most privileged club is made up of foreigners living in Britain in order to take advantage of beneficial taxation conditions. So if Britain is going to tax these people to pay for Britain's problems where did those people \"earn\" their money?</p> <p>Here there are several significant issues: if wealthy foreigners (or Britons) are holding their billions in Britain and are avoiding paying tax in the country where that wealth was generated or indeed are failing to pay adequately for workers or for resources in the country where products are extracted, grown or manufactured, then what right does Britain have to tax that wealth?</p> <p>By allowing rich foreigners to park&#xa0;their cash in the UK, Britain is aiding and abetting tax avoidance. And if, on top of this, that money is made by damaging the environment or by exploiting cheap labour then the injustice committed is double-edged. And if subsequently western consumers are benefiting from the supply of the resulting cheap products, then the injustice is even more multifaceted.</p> <p>So what to do? My suggestion would be that, before we move forward on the taxation of the rich, we should first clarify and rectify taxation and exploitation issues and production/pollution abuses as these factors are major contributors to the original accumulation of that wealth.</p> <p><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong></p> <p>Cologne, Germany</p> <p><strong>Get out the tumbrels</strong></p> <p>Royal tits and bums in Closer magazine resulted in St James's Palace issuing a \"red line has been crossed\" statement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/14/kate-middleton-topless-pictures-palace-lawyers?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(News in brief, 21&#xa0;September)</a>.

In France the photographs are viewed with wry amusement, and seen as tit-for-tat payback for the Sun's exposure of Carla Bruni when she and Nicolas Sarkozy were on their state visit to meet the Queen. So any legal challenge will certainly keep the subject on the boil longer than it would have been had publication of the photos simply been ignored.</p> <p>The royals, like all celebrities, love the media and publicity when it's favourable, but hate it when it's not. And William, of all people, should be aware of this. Unfortunately, sometimes it can get quite difficult to control \u2013 as happened recently when the royal couple were in Malaysia. What on earth, just by the way, were they doing in a country where detention without trial is commonplace and judicial caning has hit epidemic proportions, according to Amnesty International?</p> <p>Unless a tiny bit of self-titillation was involved, why would anyone parade around topless anywhere when they know there is always a high likelihood of peeping Toms lurking in the form of paparazzi, servants or even security officers? (And, more pertinently, where were these people when the photographer was shooting away, luckily, with his camera rather than a gun?)</p> <p>It's high time that everyone in the royal family came to terms with the fact that they are no longer considered deities.

They also found evidence of an already operational filtering capability.</p> <p>At the core of the network was high-end equipment made by the Chinese firm Huawei that is capable of sophisticated online surveillance of traffic. The network is already \"internally consistent and widely reachable\", concluded the report.</p> <p>William Plummer, vice president for external affairs at Huawei, said: \"Huawei has not sold equipment to the Iranian government nor does it support monitoring traffic. Huawei only sells commercial equipment built to global standards to commercial operators.\"</p> <p>The findings are likely to worry internet freedom activists and the Obama administration, which has spent tens of millions of dollars on initiatives designed to ease access to the internet in Iran and other countries with repressive governments. Officials had expressed concerns even before the release of the latest research.</p> <p>\"We have concerns from not only a human rights perspective, but about the integrity of the internet,\" David Baer, deputy assistant secretary for the US state department's bureau of democracy, human rights and labour, said. \"When countries section off parts of the web, not only do their citizens suffer, everyone does.\"</p> <p>Experts say a protected Iran-only network could help officials counter US-funded programs that allow Iranian activists to evade online surveillance. It could also help insulate Iranian computers from a covert cyber-attacks campaign that Iranian officials say the US and Israel continue to wage.</p> <p>The Iranian network is not expected to entirely replace the internet. But for ordinary Iranians it could be a well-run alternative to the internet, which in Iran is often still accessed through dial-up connections. Internet speeds are intentionally suppressed to make certain web activities, including the streaming of video, virtually impossible. Many websites, such as Facebook and YouTube, are blocked.</p> <p>Having the infrastructure for a skeleton Iran-only internet in place would give the government greater power to shut off access to the internet at times of civil unrest, such as the anti-government protests in 2009.</p> <p>\"The main reason for this project is security,\" said Moussavi Khoeini, a former Iranian reformer and parliament member now living in exile. \"They may say it's to increase internet speeds or protect against harmful content, but it's always been security.\"</p> <p>Not all experts are convinced that an Iranian network would be viable, especially given the need for access to the internet for commercial purposes and international communication.</p> <p>\"Any attempt by a country to make an intranet is doomed to failure,\" Cedric Leighton, a retired deputy director at the National Security Agency, said in an interview. But he said Iran's \"cyber-army\", a network of government-supported hackers that has attacked western targets in recent years, does stand to gain from the attempted creation of a national network. By connecting thousands of servers inside Iran, the government would \"build on their knowledge of networks and how they operate\", he said, increasing their capabilities to both launch and repel cyber-attacks.</p> <p>The US administration and internet freedom experts have expressed concern that the launch of the Iranian network could set a precedent for repressive governments. \"We don't want governments to believe that it is now legitimate to take a country offline,\" said Brett Solomon, executive director of AccessNow.org, a global digital freedom initiative. \"If we look back to the Egyptian revolution, where the regime shut down the free flow of information, you can see how this act could give rise to the creation of a new international norm.\"</p> <p><em>This story appeared in the </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from the </em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\" title=\"\">Washington Post</a></p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 28 September 2012 to reinstate a quote from William Plummer, vice president for external affairs at Huawei, denying that the company supplied equipment to the Iranian government or supports monitoring traffic.</p>",
  "<p>British supermarkets face a possible backlash from animal rights activists by supporting the government's controversial plans for a badger cull, it has emerged.</p> <p>As the new farming minister, David Heath, made it clear that the government is fully committed to implementing pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire this autumn \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/24/anti-badger-culling-petition-signatures\" title=\"\">despite an online anti-culling petition passing the 100,000-signature milestone</a> \u2013 supermarkets issued statements clarifying their position on the policy.</p> <p>Tesco appears to support the cull, and Sainsbury's M&amp;S, Waitrose and the Co-op have adopted a more neutral position, while making it clear that they are not sourcing supplies from the pilot area in west Gloucestershire. Anti-cull activists have warned of boycotts and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9561016/Supermarkets-threatened-with-vandalism-in-campaign-against-badger-cull.html\" title=\"\">even vandalising supermarket cash machines</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Telegraph newspaper published a letter from the chief executive of the RSPCA, Gavin Grant, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9563335/RSPCA-call-for-badger-friendly-milk.html\" title=\"\">calling for \"badger-friendly\" labels on milk that has been sourced from the pilot culling areas</a>.</p> <p>At a fringe meeting at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton on Monday night, Heath launched a robust defence of the policy when he was asked by a representative of the <a href=\"http://www.league.org.uk/\" title=\"\">League Against Cruel Sports</a> whether he would reconsider the policy.</p> <p>\"This is something that fell into my in-tray and some say I should be revising the policy. I don't think I should because I am persuaded by the science I have looked at that the trials should go ahead. The trials are trials. They will tell whether the cull can be done in a safe, effective and humane way,\" <a href=\"http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/livestock/new-farming-minister-insists-badger-cull-will-go-ahead/49932.article\" title=\"\">he was reported as saying</a>.</p> <p>Broadcaster and food writer Clarissa Dickson Wright also sparked controversy on Monday when <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9562992/Eat-badgers-says-Clarissa-Dickson-Wright.html\" title=\"\">she suggested</a> that Britons should eat badger meat. The former star of TV's Two Fat Ladies said she enjoyed eating the creatures \u2013 now a protected species \u2013 when she was younger, and believes people should consume the bodies of animals which are killed as a result of culling.</p> <p>A Tesco spokesperson said: \"Animal welfare is an important and sensitive issue for many of our customers and we take our responsibilities in this area very seriously. We also recognise the significant threat that bovine tuberculosis disease poses to our dairy farmers and their livelihoods. We are committed to supporting them through this challenging time and have no plans to stop sourcing from farmers in the affected areas. The cull policy and its implementation are a matter for government and the farming community to take forward.\"</p> <p>Sainsbury's said in a statement: \"We take animal welfare very seriously; it is a top priority for us and many of our customers. We recognise that the culling of any animal is a difficult subject. We are neither for, nor against, the cull. This is something that needs to be led by experts in this field. The government has made a decision, based on science, following a public process and it is not for us to second guess this\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman for M&amp;S said:\" There are no M&amp;S milk pool suppliers in the pilot area. We understand the issues facing the farming industry and that a solution needs to be found. We are awaiting the results of the government trial.\"</p> <p>Morrisons said: \"Our position on the badger cull is that we will continue to take milk and livestock from farmers in the areas where the culling is due to take place.</p> <p>Asda said: \"We are aware of the debate on a badger cull, however as a retailer it is a matter we have never taken a view on, and we don't anticipate this changing. Nevertheless, we understand and acknowledge the genuinely held beliefs on both sides of the argument.\"</p> <p>A Waitrose spokesman said: \"We understand the strength of feeling on both sides of this debate but this is a government initiative and participation is entirely up to the discretion of farmers themselves.\"</p> <p>The Co-Op said in <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/join-the-revolution/our-plan/protecting-the-environment/nature-conservation/the-co-operative-group-statement-on-proposed-badger-cull/\" title=\"\">a statement</a>: \"None of the farmers within The Co-operative Dairy Group are located in the proposed trial areas, however, as we do not operate a segregated milk supply chain, in common with other retailers a small proportion of our milk may have come from farms in the proposed trial areas.\"</p> <p>The licence for culling in Somerset is expected to be issued by the governmental body Natural England later this week, following the <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2012/170912.aspx\" title=\"\">licence granted for west Gloucestershire last week</a>.</p>",
  "<p>As America's elections approach, with President Barack Obama slightly in front of his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, pollsters still rate the races for control of the presidency and the United States Senate too close to call, with the House of Representatives likely to remain in Republican hands. The differences between the candidates are considerable, and highly consequential for American economic policy and the global economy, although enactment of their programmes will depend on the makeup of Congress.</p> <p>The most important differences between the two candidates can be summarised as follows:</p> <p><strong>Spending</strong>: Obama has dramatically increased spending. He would likely continue many of his temporary programmes (as Milton Friedman once observed, \"There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government programme.\"); double down on having government pick winners and losers in green energy; expand spending on education and infrastructure; and substantially reduce defence expenditures.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, favours limiting overall federal spending, currently 24% of GDP, to 20%, and keeping defence at 4%. He wants private markets, not government, to choose winning firms and technologies.</p> <p>Democrats oppose most non-defence spending cuts, arguing that reductions would cause the economy to contract. That case is strongest if the spending reductions are large and abrupt in a weak economy. If phased in over a multi-year period as the economy recovers, as Romney proposes, thrift would likely be expansionary. For example, federal spending relative to GDP fell by five percentage points from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s in the US, and by an even larger margin in recent decades in Canada \u2013 that is, through periods of strong economic growth.</p> <p><strong>Taxes</strong>: Obama would raise the top marginal tax rates on wages, capital gains, dividends, interest, and estates, especially on higher-income individuals and small businesses. Yet he has never proposed comprehensive reform of either the personal or corporate income tax.</p> <p>By contrast, Romney would reduce America's corporate tax rate (the highest in the OECD) to 25% and tax American multinationals on a territorial, rather than a worldwide, basis in order to increase their tax competitiveness. He would also lower personal tax rates by 20%, and make up lost revenue by limiting tax deductions and credits, particularly at the upper end, thereby raising about 18.5% of GDP, just above the historical average, at full employment. Romney's fiscal plan thus reduces deficits sufficiently to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio. He favours a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, and hopes to balance the budget over eight years.</p> <p>Obama, by contrast, would run larger deficits \u2013 his spending increase is much larger than his tax increase \u2013 which imply large tax hikes in the future. Moreover, he would run far larger debt ratios than Romney, because the main driver of the debt is entitlement spending.</p> <p><strong>Entitlements</strong>: Obama has remained silent about reform of Medicare and social security, whose long-run deficits are several times the national debt. Vice President Joe Biden has even said that \"no changes\" to social security are to be made.</p> <p>Romney supports gradually increasing retirement ages, a premium-support model for Medicare, and shifting Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) to the states via block grants. The Obama campaign is pummelling Romney on Medicare, and the Romney campaign is hammering Obama for his refusal to negotiate or even propose a solution.</p> <p>The Obama policy would thus lead to ever-higher deficits and debt ratios well over 100% of GDP, a level that numerous studies imply would reduce US economic growth by one-third or more and might induce a sovereign debt crisis. Some observers suggest that Obama's unspoken plan is ever-growing entitlements eventually paid for by a European-style value-added tax.</p> <p><strong>Trade</strong>: Obama is the first US president in a long time who has not played a leading role on global trade liberalization. The Doha Round of global trade talks remains stalled, and Obama delayed the three bilateral free-trade agreements that awaited approval when he came into office. Romney is a proponent of free trade, but has said that he would be tougher on China's trade practices and currency policies.</p> <p><strong>Regulation</strong>: Obama wants to expand federal command-and-control regulation further (though the courts have stopped his extension of some regulatory powers). Romney vows an economically balanced approach that would reform Obama's major health-care, environmental, and financial-services regulations.</p> <p><strong>Appointments</strong>: Every US president appoints thousands of officials, many with considerable power. Romney has said that he would not reappoint Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman (likely candidates: economists Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, John Taylor, and Martin Feldstein). Other presidential appointees exert considerable influence on firms, industries, or the entire economy. For example, Obama's appointees to the obscure National Labor Relations Board tried to prevent Boeing from expanding in South Carolina, despite the state's anti-union \"right to work\" legislation.</p> <p>These policies would affect US economic growth, the budget deficit, national saving, and hence global trade and capital flows. With larger deficits under Obama than under Romney, America would need more capital from Europe, Latin America, and Asia, while higher taxes and debt would impede US growth and thus undermine these regions' exports. Obama would steer America in the direction of European social-welfare states; Romney's agenda is designed to prevent that.</p> <p>Whoever wins, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/02/imf-us-fiscal-cliff-global-economy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">a fiscal cliff looms at the end of 2012</a>. Previous legislation, if not reversed, will lead to large abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts, which the Congressional Budget Office forecasts would likely cause a recession in 2013. While a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress will address the fiscal cliff, the deep differences between Republicans and Democrats on taxes and spending remain wide and difficult to bridge.</p> <p>With uncertainty plaguing Europe's finances and China slowing, the last thing the global economy needs is a stagnant or shrinking US economy. But it will take strong leadership by the president-elect to avoid it.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012.</p>",

I rely on the kindness of strangers \u2013 and friends \u2013 and cannot overstate how much support and talking-down-off-the-roof that has involved. My faith in human nature is all silky and shiny and may never quite collapse again. And I would recommend to anyone the experience of flat hunting during something of a heat wave and two consecutive major sporting events in an already crowded city. At least, I would recommend it to anyone I didn't like at all in any way.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2012/jul/31/al-kennedy-still-writing\" title=\"\">Having spent my last blog extolling the virtues of focus</a> and of somehow maintaining a tiny eye of peace in life's storms, I have had to live up to my pronouncements while a fair amount of sand has been blown into my tiny eye and it has occasionally been poked with a stick. I've tried to keep on, but serious writing has slowed. I've managed one short story since we last spoke. Among other things, this has reminded me again how much I genuinely, deep-down enjoy writing fiction. I not only miss it when circumstances prevent me from accessing the keyboard in a meaningful way, I actually start to feel quite peculiar as a result. I think this stems from a blend of frustration and professional/financial anxiety and something rather more profound: a sense that without writing, I am mainly at the mercy of my often toxic interior monologue. Writing creatively is so intensely involving that for hour after hour it can completely remove the standard torrent of doubts, fears, gripes, resentments and rubbish which my unattended subconscious delights in manufacturing. After only a few days, I really do long for the kind of meditative absence of self that building fiction can provide.</p> <p>But I've had more than that to remember and prise me out of my own head. Like many others, I had all kinds of ethical reservations about the Olympics: the sometimes graceless behaviour of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-organising-committee-olympic-paralympic-games\" title=\"London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games \">Locog</a>, the associated social cleansing of Newham and a number of <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/the-people-delivering-the-games/olympic-partners/\" title=\"\">the Games' chosen sponsors</a>. I watched a little on telly and was only delighted that the multiple, firm decisions of people largely held in contempt by our politicians and large corporations transformed something grasping, paranoid and shoddy into a generous joy. I was shown the effect of excellence, something we're rarely allowed to associate with everyday people, or long-term effort \u2013 and, of course, always kept as far as possible from the arts. Then, despite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/28/atos-paraylmpic-involvement-brings-protests\" title=\"\">the vilely inappropriate intrusion of Atos</a>, I spent rather more time watching the Paralympics. Many commentators have mentioned how exciting and beautiful it was to see dedicated sportsmen and sportswomen with disabilities being treated like dedicated sportsmen and sportswomen. Which is to say, how great and surprising it was to see our media treating human beings as human beings and allowing them dignity. And how lovely it was to see a new generation of sensible, enthusiastic, well-informed and un-self-obsessed presenters with disabilities appearing in an environment which generally has a problem with such deviations from \"normality\" as mild cellulite, humility and being over 30.</p> <p>More specifically, I remembered the first 10 years of my career as a writer, during which I earned my living by working with writers who had what were termed \"special needs\". As I tried to wrestle my own words on to paper in the evenings and at weekends, I spent my days with human beings who were elderly, who had mobility difficulties, learning difficulties, or visual impairments, who had physical and mental illnesses, who were very young, who were addicts, or who were very poor. At that point, all of them were being punished for their vulnerabilities by the government they could not, in some cases, even have a say in electing. They were often housed in horrible environments with poor resources; they were patronised, ignored and sometimes abused. And yet all of them had \u2013 among many other qualities \u2013 depths of understanding and words to say: beautiful, funny, troubling, wonderful things to create and offer others. I was young, self-obsessed as only a budding writer can be, and generally panicked about running effective workshops, or trying to overcome the technical difficulties of people with varying barriers between them and the wider expression of themselves. Even so, it was impossible not to notice that something as simple as being heard, being respected, could change someone's life. It was impossible not to realise how much I was being taught while I flailed my way through \"teaching\". It was impossible not to realise how very tenuous anyone's grip is on \"normality\" and how briefly any of us will be considered as fully human by the authorities and individuals who are supposed to serve the public. It was impossible not to be disgusted by how often I couldn't really talk about what I did for a living because even the idea of a disabled person troubled those listeners who believed themselves to be without significant handicaps. And it was impossible not to be electrified by how quickly and beautifully writing and the arts in general could release power and status for those who were meant to be kept very far from both.</p> <p>I'm glad if the Paralympics coverage and its athletes have changed perceptions of people with disabilities. That it was necessary to change those perceptions is profoundly disappointing. And I'm happy to say here \u2013 and anywhere else \u2013 that disabled writers made me the writer I am today and gave me a faith in words and their potential which doesn't shake, even when everything else is in disarray. They are a way to change worlds. Onwards.</p>",

Part of the mixture of idealism and pragmatism that makes social enterprise work best is that we find useful things we can do and do them \u2013 without being paralysed by the fact that we can't do everything immediately. And an added positive is that while Buy Social is being facilitated by SEUK, it's up to us as social enterprises to either make it work or not.<br>The Buy Social campaign clearly isn't an overall answer to question of how social enterprises can sell enough products and services to keep going and grow while also delivering positive social change \u2013 but it's useful platform for us to reach new customers who, by virtue of their stated social commitment, should already be at least partly interested in what we've got to offer.

  "<h2><strong>Melanie Bryan \u2014 founder, </strong><a href=\"http://www.whynotchange.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>WhyNotChange</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Three tips on how to encourage women in social enterprise:</strong> First, highlight great examples of women social entrepreneurs to provide positive role models. Secondly, be more innovative in the ways in which we equip and support women social entrepreneurs with the knowledge, skills and practical help they need. Finally, be the kind of women that when our feet hit the floor each morning the devil says \"oh crap she's up!\"</p> <p><strong>Staying engaged with long term strategy:</strong> When you're passionate about your social purpose it can be hard to keep the same level of focus on the 'enterprise' bit of social enterprise. The temptation is to get so involved in working 'in' the business, for instance in delivering your services/products, that you stop working 'on' the business. Working 'on' the business is about planning ahead and managing. This can often lead to short term thinking and not enough focus on building a sustainable enterprise.</p> <p><strong>The background of social entrepreneurs is increasingly diverse:</strong> Whilst it's certainly true that lots of social enterprises develop from charities and the voluntary sector where there are already higher numbers of women in leadership roles, the background of social entrepreneurs is increasingly diverse. For example, they are now coming out of the public sector. This is interesting as again in the public sector there are higher numbers of women in senior roles than typically found in private sector.</p> <p><strong>Using feedback forms to measure impact:</strong> We've found customer satisfaction forms to be great within our service. They're simple for customers to complete and alongside the information that we need we include a question that asks customers to tell us how our service has helped them \u2014 the tick boxes are a list of our social aims. This has really helped us to show what we achieve. Equally importantly the completed forms led to us changing the way in which we brand and market our service.</p> <p><strong>A willingness to collaborate is key:</strong> One of the great strengths that the social enterprise community should have, and that women in particular are renowned for, is collaboration. This is where we can be innovative, build a culture of co-operation and leverage our networks to achieve our social purpose.</p> <p><strong>Self-confidence and attitudes to risk:</strong> The research shows that men and women start businesses for the same reasons. However, women state lack of confidence and family commitments as being barriers more often than men do. Research also shows that women tend not to 'think big' when it comes to growing their business. However, once past the initial couple of years female owned businesses tend to be more sustainable. Attitude to risk is definitely an issue both in terms of setting up a business and in terms of growing it.</p> <h2><strong>Andrea M Krause \u2014 founder and director, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fyse.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>FYSE</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Passion, but not passion alone:</strong> Passion should be the basis of your venture. However, passion alone doesn't sell any products, or make you win contracts or grants. Only passion paired with skills, expertise and experience will lead to success.</p> <p><strong>Women create fewer jobs than men:</strong> As part of our work we have just completed research into social entrepreneurs in China and what they achieve. Interestingly almost half of China's social enterprises are women led. However their ventures are mostly early-stage and therefore, compared to men, do not achieve the same level of profitability. On the other hand women social enterprises in our survey create on average only four jobs, while male social enterprises create 14.</p> <p><strong>The importance of gender integration:</strong> One thing is clear when we talk about supporting female social entrepreneurs: we cannot support them within a gender biased bubble. We need to connect and integrate them into existing networks and programs that include men. In the end it doesn't matter who you do business with, you need to learn to get along.</p> <p><strong>The level of female engagement in social enterprise is country specific:</strong> The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2011) found that men are more likely to start a social venture than women, yet the ratio varies tremendously across countries. For example, women in Malaysia or Russia are more likely to start a social venture than men. For China it found the ratio to be about equal.</p> <p><strong>Impact measurement must be multi-faceted:</strong> Job creation is not the only measure for impact, but certainly one for all entrepreneurs. In terms of implementing simple <a href=\"http://www.thesroinetwork.org/\" title=\"\">SROI</a> often social enterprises do not measure their impact. Roughly 25% of the respondents in our survey have no idea whether they benefited their customers in any way. Looking at job creation, increase in turnover, number of beneficiaries etc are dimensions that have to be included in a comprehensive survey to evaluate the impact of a social entrepreneur.</p> <p><strong>Having a corporate background can be an asset:</strong> I think the benefit of having a corporate background is certain experience in structuring work, working and dealing with hierarchies, having a sense of competition and having had some professional training that most NGOs/ government sector cannot offer.</p> <h2><strong>Servane Mouazan \u2014 founder, </strong><a href=\"http://www.ogunte.com/innovation/\" title=\"\"><strong>Ogunt\u00ea</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Women have a talent for thinking long term:</strong> I think that women are probably very wired to think in a long term way and that helps to build a protective world, a world that connects and cares, and weaves resources for good and for the future. It doesn't mean that men don't/can't do it, they just have a more linear way of delivering I think. We need both systems to work well.</p> <p><strong>For better or for worse, a corporate background will influence your social enterprise:</strong> They are the worst and the best you can learn from and working in large companies has an impact on how you run a social enterprise (or why you decide to run one). What really boosted me is the performance, the ability to move mountains efficiently, the choice these large corporations still had to influence positively if they wanted to.</p> <p><strong>Helping women to understand money is key to success:</strong> How do we \"\"open the box\" for women to show the full potential in the best way? Shall i stress: Understanding money Understanding money Understanding money Understanding money will help too...!</p> <p><strong>Bringing women together to learn from their mistakes:</strong> We run <a href=\"http://www.ogunte.com/innovation/awards\" title=\"\">Women's Social Leadership Awards</a> every year to promote the achievements of women in the sector, women who are able to prove their impact, overcome obstacles, fall and rise again, are great at connecting and sharing resources.</p> <h2><strong>Robert Ashton \u2014 </strong><a href=\"http://www.robertashton.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>The Barefoot Entrepreneur</strong></a><strong>, business author &amp; adviser</strong></h2> <p><strong>Women in social enterprise:</strong> I think there are two reasons why it's easier for women to lead social enterprises than traditional businesses. Firstly, social enterprise is new and so there is a less established tradition and history of gender bias. Secondly, many social enterprises grow out of charity sector where gender balance is far more even.</p> <h2><strong>Bernie Cullen \u2014 founder, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bikerescueproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bike Rescue Project CIC</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Social enterprise and female equality:</strong> I think flexibility and adaptability are some of the common strengths that women may bring to social enterprise. I also believe however that these qualities can lead to women being exploited and giving too much for too little. I've thought for a long time that to see women rise to their full height requires a different structure in business. Social enterprise offers this opportunity.</p> <p><strong>The absence of reliable data for impact measurement:</strong> SROI models are not necessarily going to give an accurate reflection of the impact of the social enterprise because no one is monitoring the standard figures used to calculate impact. Where is the data bank that is properly resourced and easily available that gives us accurate, consistent, reliable and accredited data to use?</p> <h2><strong>Jenny Garrett MA \u2014 founder and director, </strong><a href=\"http://reflexion-uk.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Reflexion Associates</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Social enterprise and flexible working:</strong> One of the great things about setting up for yourself is that although you have to work your socks off, you have flexibility to work around your other commitments. Women that I have interviewed have picked up children from school or cared for elderly relatives and fitted their enterprise around it.</p> <p><strong>Women readily collaborate and connect with values:</strong> I agree that women are generally great collaborators. In addition they think systemically about the impact of their actions on others. My experience of working with female leaders is that they are often quite maternal in their role, seeing their team or organisation as a family. I see this connectedness as a really good thing and an antidote to short term thinking and corporate greed.</p> <h2><strong>Bert-ola Bergstrand, </strong><a href=\"http://scwf12.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Social Capital Forum</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Diversity is key for innovation:</strong> My focus over the last year has been to developing social capital that can foster social innovation. One of the most important aspects of social capital development is diversity. So generally speaking women as a group bring a critical dimension into the conversation and increase the potential for innovation.</p> <p><strong>Leadership and knowledge are crucial:</strong> There is no easy solution for \"showing the full potential of women\" but it is a question of both leadership and knowledge, and to let go of all prestige.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Consumers are acting \"conservatively\", repaying loans and shopping around for the savings accounts with the highest interest rates, according to the latest figures from the <a href=\"http://www.bba.org.uk/\" title=\"BBA website\">British Bankers' Association</a> (BBA).</p> <p>The data shows that although net mortgage lending grew by 0.6% in the year to August, the outstanding level of unsecured borrowing from the banks contracted by 3.1% over the same period.</p> <p>Meanwhile, payments into cash Isas were up 5.8% as consumers sought to get the best interest rates on their savings by sheltering them from tax.</p> <p>The BBA's figures showed that the number of mortgages approved for house purchases was down 13% year-on-year, although it had increased from 56,282 in July to 59,631.</p> <p>This could be an early sign that the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/01/funding-for-lending-scheme-scepticism\" title=\"Funding for Lending scheme launches amid scepticism\">Funding for Lending scheme</a>, launched at the start of August to boost lending by banks, may be having an impact.</p> <p>There was also a slight pick-up in activity in the remortgage market, where a lot of the best mortgage deals have been focussed, with 17,558 loans approved compared with 15,895 in July. However, the figure is down by a third on August 2011.</p> <p>New borrowing on credit cards was at \u00a37.1bn, in line with the recent monthly average, but consumer demand for borrowing in the form of personal loans and overdrafts remained weak.</p> <p>Individuals' outstanding loan amounts are now almost half of what they were at their peak in late-2007/early-2008.</p> <p>The BBA's statistics director, David Dooks said. \"People are acting conservatively in this weak economic environment, maintaining debt repayments and building up deposits, particularly in Isas.\"</p> <p>Martin Stewart, director of independent mortgage broker London Money, said August \"was as quiet as a mouse with gloves\".</p> <p>\"The first two weeks of September were also uneventful but in the past week or so things have finally started to pick up,\" he said. \"The Funding for Lending scheme has given lenders more confidence and is driving competition, but that competition is still at lower loan-to-values. The scheme has had no impact whatsoever on house purchase levels and has failed to ignite consumer confidence.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"This net mortgage repayment in August reflects both muted housing market activity and high capital repayments.\"</p> <p>\"This supports the view that house owners are looking to take advantage of low mortgage interest rates to reduce their outstanding mortgage levels to improve their balance sheets.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's just after 11am and a group of young men, some bare-chested, others wearing tattered T-shirts, rush in carrying fresh fish of all kinds: some carry their catch on their head; others dangle the fish by their tails. They quickly unload before rushing back to the truck parked outside to fetch more fish.</p> <p>Inside, the potholed cement floor is covered with everything from dead baby sharks to sea turtles. Glowing in a dark corner buzzing with flies are the eyes of a cat with four new kittens to add to the litter of animals that live in the market. This is Mogadishu's fish market: the biggest market in Somalia, and the only surviving one in the city.</p> <p>Before the start of the civil war, the city had two such markets; the other one, which was next to Liido beach, was destroyed when a stray tank shell hit the building at the height of the conflict.</p> <p>The remaining market resembles a warehouse that has seen better days. The only light comes through the dome-shaped holes in the ceiling that were once its windows. There are no shelves and customers just point their fingers at the fish they want to buy. Ali Ahmed, a fisherman who has worked at the market for more than 20 years, says earning a living has never been more difficult, even during the civil war.</p> <p>The once lucrative export market has been banned for safety reasons, affecting the price local fishermen get for their catch. Between chopping and weighing blocks of shark meat for a customer, Ahmed says: \"Before, we used to sell our catch to the Gulf countries and we used to get a good price; now we only sell to locals and they don't have as much money.\"</p> <p>That's not the only challenge facing Mogadishu's fishermen, says Ahmed. When the seas are calm they go further out to fish, where they are constantly searched and interrogated by foreign navies that mistake them for pirates. \"They search us and everywhere in the boat. They tell us we look like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/21/somali-pirates-rethink-tactics\" title=\"\">pirates</a>,\" he says.</p> <p>Back on shore, they face an even greater challenge. The government and African Union forces only allow the fishermen to go out to sea before 11am and they aren't allowed to return to shore after 5pm. This restriction is particularly unpopular with the fishermen at the market, who jostle for a chance to complain about the curfew.</p> <p>\"I stayed out at sea last night [after missing the 5pm curfew] because I didn't want to risk been shot at in the dark by soldiers when I got back,\" says Yasin Mohamed. \"I didn't catch any fish during the day. If I return with no fish, I can't afford petrol for my boat next time.\"</p> <p>Abdirahman Sheikh Ibrahim, Somalia's minister for fisheries, marine resources and environment, says the curfew exists for the safety of the whole city. \"We are fearful of [Islamist militants] al-Shabab; we are in a state of war and the enemy can pretend to be fishermen and enter the city during these hours. We're trying to implement a verification system. A system that's forgery proof.\"</p> <p>With a dwindling catch and the difficulties they face on shore, many fishermen are abandoning the trade to try their luck in other dangerous and illicit enterprises.</p> <p>\"We've lost 80% of experienced fishermen in Mogadishu because they joined piracy gangs,\" says Bashir Yusuf Barre, chairman of the Banadir fishermen's union. \"Experienced fishermen make good pirates and the bad guys know this, so they offer them good money and hire them.\"</p> <p>At the market, the fishermen bringing in their catch mainly appear to be in their mid-20s, suggesting the majority of more experienced seamen have left the trade.</p> <p>In a shaded spot outside the market, Farah Funani, a fisherman for more than 35 years, is barking orders at a younger man nearby. \"There's no dignity in being a fisherman any more,\" he says. \"At sea, armed men in speedboats search you because they say you look like a pirate and when you come back soldiers can shoot you if you return outside curfew hours.\"</p> <p>Agents working for pirate chiefs are exploiting the situation. Funani says almost every week he gets phone calls or visits from agents offering him a lot of money. \"If I'm lucky, I make $10 a day in the market. The agents are offering me as much as $4,000 a month.\" The father admits it is tempting but he says: \"My best friend joined them a year ago. He built a new house and bought a new car, but no one has heard from him since he went to sea four months ago.\"</p> <p>Pointing both hands at the sea, which is just a few metres away from the market, Bashir says: \"We've got the longest coastline in Africa yet we can't catch enough fish any more. We're the poorest fishermen in Africa.\"</p>",

A wall was demolished by the Tyne at Wallsend to ease the pressure of flood water.</p> <p>By mid-morning on Tuesday, the river Wansbeck in Morpeth had breached local flood defences. Northumbria police said they were working with the local authority to help people affected and a rest centre at the town hall has been set up.</p> <p>Officers were positioned along the river at various points to monitor the situation. Large tree trunks and debris were being swept along by the river as it continued to rise.</p> <p>Around 90 residents from the Dawson Place area of the town were evacuated as a precaution.</p> <p>Chief Inspector Sarah Pitt said: \"We are getting a number of calls about road closures and localised flooding.

We will respond to all of them. Only use the 999 service in an emergency situation and please be patient. We have a lot of officers out on the ground helping keep people safe.\"</p> <p>Embankments have been strengthened in central Leeds and the Calder valley town of Hebden Bridge is heavily sandbagged and equipped with emergency pumps, with the river perilously close to inflicting the town's third serious flood since May.</p> <p>The M6 motorway was partially closed in Cumbria as lanes turned into streams and train services have been disrupted in Lancashire, with buses replacing services between Wigan and Southport and Blackburn and Clitheroe, and at Newcastle where services to Edinburgh on the east coast main line have been cancelled.</p> <p>The Environment Agency has issued 60 flood warnings and 151 alerts and deployed emergency teams across northern England, moving debris, monitoring river levels and preparing pumping equipment to clear towns of flood water.</p> <p>David Jordan, the agency's director of operations, said 200 homes had been flooded across England and Wales so far. He said: \"Our thoughts are with those affected. Flooding has a devastating impact on property and possessions.</p> <p>\"Our teams have been out around the clock over the last few days to minimise the risks and prepare for flooding. We urge people to keep up to date with the weather forecast and remain prepared for flooding in their area, sign up to receive free flood warnings and stay away from dangerous flood water.\"</p> <p>The north-west took the initial brunt of the downpour as the core of very low pressure moved north on Monday after creating havoc in south-west England and the West Midlands. Warm air from the Atlantic and an erratic pattern in the jetstream drew in a much colder front from north of Scotland, creating perfect conditions for relentless rain that is not expected to ease until Tuesday night.</p> <p>Ten residents were evacuated in dinghies by fire crews at St Helen's in Merseyside as the rain crept first across the north-west before settling over the Pennines, which drain into rivers on both sides. Twenty more homes were evacuated at Maghull on Merseyside and the fire and rescue services in north Wales said they had been kept busy overnight, rescuing stranded motorists and pumping out a flooded caravan site at Llangollen.</p> <p>The service's spokesman, Paul Jenkinson, said: \"When there is so much surface water around it is best not to travel unless absolutely necessary. If you are faced with floodwater, do not try to drive through it as it may be much deeper than it looks.\"</p> <p>Drivers helped from cars on the A1 at Dunston in Gateshead included Rachel Sweeney who works for Tyne Tees TV. She tweeted: \"My car is stuck! I'm in a van with a prisoner and two cops called Emma and Alec!\" Twenty miles south, the river Wear burst its banks in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, and police warned that many roads in Durham city and Darlington were affected by flooding with some impassable.</p> <p>Conditions in Leeds, where the river Aire is close to riverside flats in the city centre, were given an unusual twist when a refrigerated lorry shed its load of milk cartons, which burst and turned the flooded road past Leeds United's Elland Road stadium white.</p> <p>The Aire, Calder and Wharfe are being closely watched by Environment Agency teams as rainfall is expected to be heaviest over the Pennines on Tuesday afternoon, before drier conditions arrive.</p> <p>The Met Office said rainfall had exceeded 50mm (2in) in most of the affected areas on Monday afternoon with a further 25mm (1in) falling overnight.</p>",
  "<p>A ban on shark finning and the adoption of a global shark conservation plan is being sought at a meeting of more than 50 countries in Bonn this week.</p> <p>The UK-backed draft plan to monitor and manage shark populations is under discussion at the first official meeting of signatories to a landmark memorandum of understanding on the <a href=\"http://www.cms.int/species/sharks/MOS_Mtgs/mos1_docs_overview.htm\" title=\"\">Convention of Migratory Species</a> (CMS). A decision is expected on Thursday.</p> <p>The market for shark fins, used in shark fin soup, is a major threat to shark populations, with fins <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/domes_fish/ReportsToCongress/SharkFinningReport11.pdf\" title=\"\">among the most expensive fish products in the world at $740 (\u00a3456) per kilo</a>. The high value of fins compared to the usually lower value of the rest of the shark meat creates an economic incentive for the wasteful practice of slicing off a shark's fins and discarding the body at sea. Several hotel chains in Asia, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/18/shangri-la-hotels-shark-fin-soup\" title=\"\">Shangri-La</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/24/shark-fin-peninsula-hotels\" title=\"\">Peninsula</a>, have banned shark fin soup as a result of campaigning for an end to finning.</p> <p>Shark finning has been banned by more than 60 fishing nations as well as the European Union. But in the EU and in many countries, permits for processing on board can be obtained in some cases, whereby shark fins can be removed from the carcasses and stored separately. A vote in the European parliament's committee on fisheries voted on the issue on 19 September, but failed to close the loopholes.</p> <p>Sandrine Polti, shark policy adviser to the Pew Environment Group, said: \"Pew strongly supports the European commission's proposal [made in 2011, to end the permits] and urges all parliamentarians to endorse a strict EU policy against removing shark fins at sea, without any more exceptions,\"</p> <p>The plan under discussion at this week's CMS would commit countries to: \"Where not already in place, consider enacting legislation or regulations requiring sharks to be landed with each fin naturally attached.\"</p> <p>Officials from the UK hope to strengthen the language so as to achieve a global, watertight and exception-free commitment to a ban on shark finning. The fisheries minister, Richard Benyon, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URTsFG5feJI\" title=\"\">plunged into a tank of sharks \u2013 behind a net \u2013 at the Sealife London Aquarium in August</a> to highlight the UK's opposition to shark finning.</p> <p>\u2022 Stanley Johnson's new book, Where the Wild Things Were: Travels of a Conservationist, is published by Stacey International</p>",
  "<p>As a languages teacher, it never ceases to astound me to think that the rasping, whistling and vibrating sounds emanating from our mouths and noses when you talk can be effortlessly decoded by our interlocutors as meaningful language, allowing us to communicate with one another in astonishing levels of complexity. Language is a defining feature of people.</p> <p>In many western societies we might be tempted to assume that being able to speak and understand more than one language is the exception. However, it is estimated that between half and three quarters of the world's population is bilingual to some degree. That's more than four billion people who understand that with different languages come different ways to interpret the world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/marcelproust\">Marcel Proust</a>, the French novelist, observed that \"the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new lands but in seeing with new eyes\". He realised that by working with other people we learn about their cultures and become able to explore new ideas and prospects. Options that would not have occurred to us before stand out as obvious if we understand how other people experience the world. This is why, I believe, it is so important for students to have a deeper global awareness and understanding of other cultures.</p> <p>In my own experience, leaving my small town in southern Spain to explore Italy for two weeks during my sixth form opened up a whole new world. As I found myself immersed in a different culture, it struck me that Italians, previously perceived by myself as peculiar beings, were in fact the norm in their context and that I was the stranger. Students nowadays are more likely to have travelled abroad by age of 16 and have easy access to a world of information through the internet. However, they still need to be guided through the process of discovery so that a deeper understanding of their own place in the word is developed.</p> <p>This is why fostering global awareness and international collaboration in our classrooms are so beneficial to our students. Schools understand this and have traditionally encouraged the need to put learning into context. The history trip to Berlin, the French exchange, the cultural visit to Andaluc\u00eda, pen pal writing schemes and foreign language assistants who bring a little bit of abroad into our classrooms are just a few of the many examples of contextualised learning that we provide our students. At my school we have three foreign language assistants and hold four foreign exchanges each year - in addition to a range of cultural trips abroad.</p> <p>The moment in which a cohort of year 8 pupils land in Seville and realise that Spanish has a life beyond the textbook, the year 7s visiting Normandy and noticing that people behave and react in familiar ways but the small differences are what really matters. The awkward dinner conversations of foreign exchange students with their German host families, the sudden realisation that Dubai is such a long way away on so many different levels. These are character building experiences that bring out the best and worst in all of us and from which we learn so much.</p> <p>However, in today's increasingly interconnected and globalised world, tradition is being supplemented by new and exciting ways to bring the world into our classrooms. Modern means of communication such as social networks and video conferencing can ensure that our students experience foreign cultures with unprecedented ease.</p> <p>Class <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\">Twitter</a> accounts link students in real time across the face of the planet with projects devised around common academic subjects and cross-cultural understanding. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/skype\">Skype</a> allows us to converse face-to-face with people from other countries, allowing us to knock down classroom walls and hear it direct from the source. <a href=\"https://maps.google.co.uk/\">Google Maps</a> lets our pupils take a walk down the streets of every major town and city in the world, allowing them to sight-see and get a sense of other cultures from the comfort of their own classroom. And blogs provide geographically distant schools with the means to partner together so that their pupils can interact in a safe virtual environment, contributing a valuable international dimension to peer assessment.</p> <p>Both Britain - through the <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org\">British Council</a> - and the EU - through the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-programme/comenius_en.htm\">Comenius</a> and <a href=\"http://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\">eTwinning programmes</a> - are actively encouraging international partnerships between schools. These projects also promote the sharing of their resources so that, not only students, but also teachers can benefit from the exchange of practices, knowledge and expertise, with welcome positive implications for teacher training and professional development.</p> <p>Global awareness and international collaboration during the formative years results in more rounded individuals, encouraging our pupils to see things from different perspectives and helping them to make informed decisions, acquiring transferable skills that will be useful to them and will remain with them for life. According to the <a href=\"http://www.agr.org.uk/Content/GLOBAL-GRADUATES-NEEDED\">Association of Graduate Recruiters</a> companies cannot find enough applicants with the requisite skills to operate in an international market place, indicating that greater efforts by schools in fostering global awareness and international collaboration are needed to best prepare our students - and ourselves - for life in the 21st century.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Picardo is head of modern foreign languages at Nottingham High School.

  "<p>Love the Clintons or hate them, but give them their due.</p> <p>As the former president Bill Clinton reminded us during his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/bill-clinton-hillary-presidential-2016?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Face the Nation</a> performance, few American politicians are as adept at the Washingtonian art of launching a well-crafted speculation balloon into the media winds. His claim to have \"no earthly idea\" what Hillary might decide to do about a 2016 run, followed only by his declaration that \"I've never met anybody I thought was a better public servant\" was the kind of master move that pundits and chess players alike should study for months to come.</p> <p>This past year's strategically engineered reconciliation between the former president and the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/10/120910fa_fact_lizza\" title=\"\">current one</a> positioned Clinton to mend some bridges with the Obama 2012 camp before he came out swinging for his wife's potential 2016 bid. So did his stellar performance on Barack Obama's behalf at the Democratic National Convention: arguably, he made a better case for the administration's record than it has ever been able to make for itself. And the Clinton camp's decision to limit his Face the Nation comments to four or five soundbites created a powerful echo chamber that's still resonating 700 news items later with the same strong messaging about her skills and his support.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton should have her chance at the presidency in 2016. Not only because a lot of the public would like certain parts of the 1990s back \u2013 the economy, the comparably healthier state of constitutional rights (including human, civil, and reproductive rights), most of which have gone into serious decline over the past 12 years under two different administrations. Or because Clinton's track record includes true bona fides when it comes to building consensus and bringing opposing sides to the table while standing tough and refusing to give away the farm.</p> <p>She deserves a shot because she possesses three skills crucial to the office of the president: making lemonade out of life's many lemons, learning from her mistakes and taking the heat. Case in point: she was demonised as the political wannabe who killed healthcare reform; she was publicly humiliated as a cuckolded spouse from one of the most visible perches in the world; she was kicked to the curb during the 2008 presidential primaries by the senior white guys in her party, the ones who had never succeeded in becoming president themselves, but would be damned if they'd ever see her do it either (with all due respect to the late Ted Kennedy). And yet she took it all in stride.</p> <p>Plenty of stones can legitimately be thrown Clinton's way. Yep, she lied about having been under enemy sniper fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, voted for the Iraq war, allowed her campaign to engage in some nasty race baiting and belongs to a political family whose willingness to sacrifice the poor for the sake of consensus has led to some ugly results (think welfare \"reform\"). Still, this truth stands: that few among us would ever uncurl from the fetal position after the gauntlet she ran during the 1990s, let alone pull it together to become a highly visible and popular secretary of state with better approval ratings than her boss.</p> <p>She'll need that kind of toughness, and not just because obstructionism is practically a plank in the Republican party platform. The mere 17% of women in Congress speaks to the prejudices and difficulties that keep women from office and will continue to bedevil Clinton. Despite all that's been written about the centrality of the women's vote in swing states like Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57506101/womens-vote-hinges-on-social-issues-pocketbook/\" title=\"\">for example</a>, the major political parties still don't set much store by mentoring or supporting women candidates; nor is there much reason to believe that women voters will vote for their own sex. Then there's the media, where women candidates continue to be smeared, ridiculed and belittled in every corner from left to right. During the 2008 presidential primaries, Clinton was, as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jessica-wakeman/on-sexist-media-coverage_b_98869.html\" title=\"\">Jessica Wakeman reminds us</a>, \"targeted for everything from her <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2008/01/04/fox-news-graphic-rudov-clintons-nagging-voice-i/142056\" title=\"\">tone of voice</a> and her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandhealth/gallery/2008/mar/17/fashion.photography?picture=333143554\" title=\"\">style of dress</a>, to her eyes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/10/hillaryclinton.uselections2008\" title=\"\">welling up with tears</a> and her <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2008/01/09/after-vowing-not-to-underestimate-clinton-matth/142096\" title=\"\">credentials as a senator</a>\".</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Clinton will be willing to endure all that, yet again, for a shot at this country's highest office. Surely no one can blame her if she takes Bill's current route and pursues some global initiative that allows her to advance her interests without having to contend with Congress or the press. For now, all we can do is track the progress of the speculation balloon that Bill has floated \u2013 bearing in mind all the while the Clintons' proven powers of political resurrection.</p>",
  "<p>It seems to be the prevailing belief that there is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19621341\" title=\"\">little left of the world to explore</a>; Antarctica, the north pole, the Himalayan peaks, various inpenetrable rainforests and raging rivers, all have been \"discovered\" or, at least, provided a picturesque backdrop to the achievements and glory of a rakish adventurer or two. Perilous challenges of exploration or \u2013 depending on your opinion \u2013 desperate howls for attention, now have to try that bit harder and skiing down K2 or swimming the 2,000 miles of the Volga have become the next adventures. After that we've only got an attempt to pedalo up the Congo, hang-glide around a hurricane or cartwheel across the Kalahari left, although it should be noted that someone has already cycled to the south pole.</p> <p>In this relentless quest for daredevil derring-do we miss the sublime and exotic on our own doorsteps, so it's a relief to see Gavin Pretor-Pinney, the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.cloudappreciationsociety.org/\" title=\"\">Cloud Appreciation Society</a>, press his case for a new category \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19700699\" title=\"\">undulatus asperatus</a> \u2013 to be added to the World Meteorological Organisation's International Cloud Atlas. He makes the case that it probably isn't a new kind of cloud at all, just one suddenly brought to the fore as it is captured more frequently with the worldwide ubiquity of the cameraphone.</p> <p>In that spirit, I would like to present five more amazing and exotic natural spectacles that can be seen, simply by paying closer attention to the world around us. You can hurl yourself off mountains, tightrope your way across the Andes or do the triathlon in space, but exploration starts only when you stop and take notice.</p> <h2>1. The night sky</h2> <p>A dark vault of void speckled with pinpoints and twinkles, an occasional meteor, the part-time moon and the milky way, the night sky is endlessly fascinating as befits its status as a tiny excerpt of the most astonishing thing that has ever happened, the universe. Up there, among the easy constellations there are some more exotic features, such as the clusters and nebulae where stars are born or the barely discernible, tiny scuffed smudges of distant galaxies. Get as far away from light as possible, give your eyes 20 minutes to become accustomed to the dark and watch the sky come alive.</p> <p>We don't spend enough time looking at the night sky \u2013 in fact, I would go as far as to suggest that we fear the consequences of doing so. If you see someone out and about showing more than a passing interest in the stars, when all around there are more immediate pleasures and pressing concerns, you might be inclined to feel that they were either drunk or, worse, a poet. But, from my far-from-ideal suburban spot I can just make out the Andromeda galaxy and wonder whether anything is looking back.</p> <h2>2. The ground</h2> <p>The British Isles are \u2013 at their most mature \u2013 3 billion years old and have been assembled from disparate parts in far-flung regions of the globe. There have been plenty of volcanoes and earthquakes and the wholesale dislocation and crumpling of rock as though it was no more substantial than a pack of playing cards. The South Downs are the foothills of the Alps, the Northwest Highlands were once a part of what is now Canada. The beach at Lyme Regis bears fossilised ammonites the size of cartwheels, while Edinburgh famously has volcanoes. The coast of Anglesey boasts piles of pillow lava from underwater eruptions that look like giant heaps of dung from preternaturally huge horses while the cliffs of Hunstanton in Norfolk are banded red and white like a Christo installation. Everything besides and in between bears exploration and discovery for yourself.</p> <h2>3. Bird colonies</h2> <p>Watching birds is often thought of as a quiet, introspective occupation, but all that changes in a place like South Stack, an island 30 metres of Anglesey's Holy Island, where an awe-inspiring colony of sea birds including guillemots, razorbills, fulmars and kittiwakes, wheel and dive between sea and sky in a kind of avian tornado. In Cornwall, the gulls and auks are \u2013 in a few locations \u2013 joined by chough, rare oily-black crows with a Post Office-red beak. Elsewhere you might see peregrine falcon and ravens sharing the cliff ledges, the peregrine being the fastest animal in the world with its 200mph dive to catch the odd hapless shorebird or pigeon.</p> <h2>4. Deer rutts</h2> <p>One of nature's most amazing spectacles, a deer rutt is when a stag faces down and sometimes locks antlers with others for the right to breed. It starts around now and lasts until the end of October. It is at its best at dawn and dusk and as far away from crowds as possible, so if you want to see deer rutting, you'll have to lose yourself in some uncharted reach of your local forest and be prepared to be very quiet and patient.</p> <h2>5. Autumn</h2> <p>Another spectacle about to reach its height and best explored in a forest, for obvious reasons, is the autumnal leaf fall. Arboreta such as those at Westonbirt are obvious spots to explore, but there are so many patches of old woodland and forest in Britain, there's always one close by and free. The New Forest in Hampshire even has a pair of \"ornamental drives\" along quiet roads in the forest so that you can witness the spectacle in the kind of comfort the modern adventurer would despise.</p>",
  "<p>Wind turbines harness the energy of moving air to generate electricity. Onshore wind refers to turbines located on land, while offshore turbines are located out at sea or in freshwater. In the UK, the pros and cons of onshore wind energy, in comparison with other low-carbon and fossil fuel energy sources, have recently been the subject of debate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower\">in the press</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/28/cameron-meets-tory-mps-windfarm\">among politicians</a>.</p> <p>Onshore wind already plays a leading role in the generation of renewable electricity in the UK. In 2010, it generated around 7TWh \u2013 more than a quarter of the electricity provided by British renewables at that time and enough to save <a href=\"https://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/meeting-energy-demand/wind/5197-onshore-wind-faqs.pdf\">six million tonnes</a> of CO2, according to government estimates. By 2020, onshore wind is expected to generate up to <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/meeting-energy-demand/future-elec-network/4263-ensgFull.pdf\">30TWh</a>. Onshore wind can therefore play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions created by the UK's power sector \u2013 which will be crucial to meeting the UK's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/28/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">legally binding carbon budgets</a>. </p> <p>Onshore wind has the advantage of being one of the <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Media/Releases/2012/MR110612-review-evidence-about-onshore-wind-power.aspx\">most affordable renewable energy sources</a>. Generating electricity from onshore wind turbines typically costs around 7\u20139p per kWh, which is around half the cost of offshore wind and a quarter of the costs of solar photovoltaic panels. It is also slightly cheaper, on average, than nuclear power. Onshore wind generation is still slightly more expensive than fossil fuels (generating electricity from gas power plants currently costs between 4.1 and 7.5 p/kWh), but its price is expected to fall in the coming years.</p> <p>Some emissions are created by the manufacture, transportation and installation of wind turbines, but these are considered fairly low. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/28/wind-turbines-carbon-emissions\">Additional emissions</a> are attributed to the fact that wind energy (like solar and wave power) is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/29/intermittant-solar-wind-energy\">intermittent</a>, generating electricity only when the wind is blowing, and at sufficient strength. When wind strength is insufficient for turbines to operate, fossil-fuel-based power supply is needed as \"backup\". The current small proportion of renewable electricity in the UK market requires very little backup, but as the share increases additional backup will be needed. However, other technologies, such as inter-linkages with other countries' grids, energy storage and electricity demand management, are expected to help tackle intermittency in the future, so the overall future impact on emissions is considered relatively low.</p> <p>Onshore wind has been criticised for its visual impact. Although other power infrastructure, like fossil fuel and nuclear power stations, can also modify landscapes and habitats, onshore wind turbines are typically more spread out than other large-scale energy infrastructure projects and so can affect a larger area. Another criticism is that species such as birds and bats may also be affected by wind turbines \u2013 though bird fatalities due to turbine collisions are relatively low compared to other fatality causes, such as traffic and domestic cats. Impacts on wildlife can be minimised by careful site selection and by avoiding areas of high conservation or habitat value. A third potential issue is that turbines can contribute to noise pollution, but government studies find noise levels are comparatively low and should not significantly impact on nearby residents. <a href=\"http://www.ioa.org.uk/about-us/news-article.asp?id=252\">New guidance is being drafted</a> to inform future planning policy on noise issues.</p> <p>Environmental Impact Assessments review these kinds of potential impacts on a case-by-case basis and seek to protect unsuitable areas, such as those of high conservation or heritage value. In some cases, undesirable local impacts may make more expensive renewable technologies, such as offshore wind or solar, more attractive. The extra cost of offshore wind can be seen as the premium society is willing to pay in order to avoid the local environmental cost of onshore turbines.</p> <p>The choice between more affordable electricity (which would favour onshore wind) and local environmental protection (which may favour other low-carbon technologies) is ultimately a societal and political one. Given the economic and environmental trade-offs, technological uncertainty and the absence of one clear winner when it comes to energy sources, <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/publications/Policy/docs/PB-onshore-wind-energy-UK.pdf\">many economists suggest</a> (pdf) the best approach is a portfolio of different technologies to balance the cost to consumers and environmental concerns. Onshore wind has a role to play in this energy mix and in helping the UK achieve its emission reduction targets.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was written by Samuela Bassi and Naomi Hicks of the <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute\">Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment</a> at LSE in collaboration with the Guardian</em></p> <h2>The ultimate climate change FAQ</h2> <p>\u2022 This answer last updated: 10.07.12<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/05/ultimate-climate-change-faq\">Read about the project and suggest a question</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/09/climate-faq-report-error\">Report an error in this answer</a></p> <p><strong>Related questions</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/16/economic-impact-climate-change\">What is the economic cost of climate change?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/15/stern-review\">What is the Stern review?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/21/countries-responsible-climate-change\"> Which nations are most responsible for climate change? </a></p> <h2>This editorial is free to reproduce under Creative Commons</h2> <p><br>This post by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">The Guardian</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/uk/\">Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License</a>.<br>Based on a work at <a xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" rel=\"dc:source\">theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>During the recent summer holidays, 11-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/25/11-year-old-flies-rome-manchester\" title=\"\">Liam Corcoran left his home in Wythenshawe</a>, caught a bus to Manchester airport and boarded a Jet2 flight to Rome. The tabloids had a field day, but the incident highlights a serious concern for the travel industry: child safety and protection.</p> <p>Liam was escorted home on the return flight. But with millions of families jetting off on foreign holidays every year, what can the travel industry do to ensure their young charges arrive back unharmed?</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>The fact that an 11-year-old could board a plane without a ticket or accompanying adult raises very specific issues. Airport security was clearly grossly inadequate. UK Border Agency rules do not permit children to fly without correct documentation or boarding pass.</p> <p>Likewise, standard airline procedure requires security staff to check a child's boarding pass and passport at check-in and at the gate, as well as the boarding pass stub once the child is on board. A passenger headcount before take-off is also habitual \u2013 a procedure that Jet2 had discontinued, but has since reinstated.</p> <p>Over and above these routine checks, special provisions are in place for children (generally defined as under-16) who are travelling without adults. Responsibility for these unaccompanied minors falls to the airline or their handling agent, clarifies Sarah Brookes, head of public affairs at Manchester airport.</p> <p>Policies on unaccompanied minors differ from airline to airline. In the case of Jet2, it \u2013 supposedly \u2013 operates a blanket ban on children flying without an accompanying adult. Higher-end carriers are more lenient. British Airways, for instance, will carry unaccompanied children under 12 as long as they are registered under its <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/travel/childinfo/public/en_gb\" title=\"\">Skyflyer Solo</a> service.</p> <p>The UK carrier insists that the child is checked-in in person, not online or at an airport kiosk, and that the adult stays in the airport until the plane has left. Other provisions include photographs of the person responsible for meeting the child at the other end.</p> <p>Ferry and train companies exhibit a <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Yourchildshealthandsafety/Roadandtravelsafety/DG_10037078\" title=\"\">similar range of policies</a>. Many ferry companies refuse to take unaccompanied children full-stop. Others have an age limit. Eurostar, for instance, will not take unaccompanied children under 12, but <a href=\"http://www.eurostar4agents.com/a-z/unaccompanied_minors.htm\" title=\"\">\"will consider\"</a> taking children aged between 13-17.</p> <p>Breaches are possible, but extremely rare, transport operators say. In Jet2's case, the airline undertook a thorough investigation following the Corcoran affair. \"Revised procedures have now been implemented,\" clarifies Gaby O'Grady, a spokesperson for the airline.</p> <p><strong>Once on holiday </strong></p> <p>Travelling alone is the exception. The vast majority of children heading abroad for their holidays do so in the company of their family. Ensuring these child holidaymakers come to no harm starts with basic health and safety in their hotel or resort, insists Angela Hills, destination services manager at the UK travel trade association <a href=\"http://www.abta.com\" title=\"\">Abta</a>.</p> <p>Abta produces a Health and Safety Technical Guide, which includes child-specific safety measures, such as signing children in and out of the hotel, and notification of parents' contact details. Since the guide was introduced in 2003, Abta has distributed it to all its 5,500 members, plus around 40,000 suppliers.</p> <p>At a facilities level, child-related risks tend to be wrapped up in general health and safety management, according to Barbara Powell, senior director of corporate social responsibility at the hotel chain Marriott International.</p> <p>Where specific child protection policies kick in is to cover child violence or trafficking. Since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/madeleinemccann\" title=\"\">Madeleine McCann</a> case in Portugal in 2007, such issues have become a top-line priority for the tourism industry, notes Abta's Hills.</p> <p>Marriott follows many other large hoteliers and tour operators in having tailored training for all its employees on <a href=\"http://www.marriott.com/corporate-social-responsibility/community-involvement.mi\" title=\"\">child protection and human rights</a>. The training provides guidance on how to spot suspicious activity, as well as protocols on how to report it, Powell explains.</p> <p>\"We don't put this in the hands of an associate [hotel employee] as it's too sensitive\", she states. \"Instead, they are told to report it to their supervisor and then it goes through a chain of command in the hotel.\"</p> <p>It falls to the hotel's head of security or hotel manager to then investigate and intervene if necessary. Depending on the seriousness of the case, hotel security will either approach the guest directly or put in a call to the local police.</p> <p>Marriott's position keeps with the zero tolerance approach set out in the Industry Position Statement on Human Trafficking \u2013 a collective agreement drawn up by members of the <a href=\"http://www.tourismpartnership.org\" title=\"\">International Tourism Partnership</a>, which represents 16 global hoteliers.</p> <p>Leading tour operators take a similar approach. <a href=\"http://www.thomson.co.uk/editorial/child-protection.html\" title=\"\">The global travel company TUI</a> has gone further than most. Working with children's charity <a href=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NSPCC</a>, it has set up a train-the-trainer programme that sees all its 350 childcare staff receive instruction on child protection issues. This is in addition to the child safety content of the NVQ2 qualification required of all TUI's childcare staff.</p> <p>In addition, NSPCC provides a 24-hour helpline service that TUI staff can call when suspicious incidents arise. The charity's expert staff can advise them on what action to take locally, as well as dealing with social services and other agencies in the child's place of residency.</p> <p>\"While kids are away, we need to make sure that doesn't become a vulnerable time\", clarifies Ian Chapman, director of holiday experience at the TUI brands <a href=\"http://www.thomson.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Thomson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.firstchoice.co.uk/\" title=\"\">First Choice</a>. \"The NVQ and in-house training, plus the NSPCC partnership, means that we've been able to deal directly with the handful of cases that we've had or pass them on to the appropriate authorities.\"</p> <p>The tourism sector cannot make the scourge of child trafficking disappear for good. That said, it is making \"positive\" steps to combat it when incidents occur, insists Fran Hughes, spokesperson for the International Tourism Partnership.</p> <p>\"We've gone from a position where child trafficking wasn't on the radar for some companies\", she notes, \"to one where they are developing their own policies and training.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Among the reasons why people love sport is the way the obvious does not always materialise. Teams who look relegation certainties before a ball is kicked win two of their first four games. Other sides, more fancied, unravel inside a month. Previously unconsidered contenders for national recognition suddenly become the urgent answer to England's prayers, at least for a week or two.</p> <p>The trick, for coaches, players and pundits alike, is to recognise the difference between a flash in the pan and a longer-term asset. We can only assume Sale's chief executive, Steve Diamond, is blessed with appropriate psychic powers to make that crucial distinction. Even by the standards of Lord Sugar, the firing of the Sharks' forwards coach, Steve Scott, at the weekend, four matches into the new season, was as brutal \u2013 or desperate \u2013 as it gets.</p> <p>Diamond is basically inviting us to believe that Scott, who was hired only in December 2010, has gone from quality Premiership coach to clueless muppet inside three weeks. How else to explain the managerial thinking that believes everything is ready for a top-four finish on 1 September and then abandons the plan on 22 September, having called an emergency meeting for all staff? It is not often Gary Barlow gets a mention on the Guardian's rugby pages but maybe the pre-match DJ at Salford City Stadium should give <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=273eSvOwpKk\" title=\"\">Patience by Take That</a> a spin prior to the next home game.</p> <p>Scott can hardly say he was not forewarned. He would have known about Diamond's itchy trigger-finger from the abrupt departure of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/mar/24/sale-sharks-tony-hawks\" title=\"\">Tony Hanks as coach in March after a heavy home defeat</a> by Saracens. Losing badly in front of Sale's own supporters, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/22/sale-london-welsh-premiership\" title=\"\">as happened again against London Welsh on Friday</a>, clearly drives Diamond, and the club's owner, Brian Kennedy, to distraction. What happens next will be fascinating.</p> <p>\"There are people who are wanting to have a go at me and the team and I don't mind that because I know where we are going over the next three, four or five years,\" stated Diamond, fully aware that his new head coach, Bryan Redpath, has been back at the club for only a few months himself and cannot be held entirely responsible for the squad he has inherited. \"I have got total confidence in Bryan and, let's be honest, I put all of that team together that played on Friday, not Brush. So if anyone should take the flak for that, it should be me.\"</p> <p>But what price that still being the case if Sale keep on losing? Does the buck stop with Diamond, now coaching the forwards again, or Redpath? Not so long ago it was all Mike Brewer's fault. It is verging on a soccer-style soap opera, another example of the increasing footballisation (to use an appropriately ugly word) of rugby union.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/20/olly-barkley-bath-racing-metro?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Olly Barkley's hasty switch from Bath to Racing M\u00e9tro</a> reflects the same trend. One minute Barkley is the linchpin of Bath's backline and swearing undying love to his first senior club, having previously decamped to Gloucester and never settled. The next he is off to Paris with scarcely a backward glance.</p> <p>Professional sportsmen are perfectly entitled to earn a buck wherever they can but this particular deal has a collective whiff of knee-jerk about it. If Barkley can land in France mid-season and make an instant success of things, good luck to him. I fear it is more likely both he and Bath will ultimately regret their abrupt parting. As for Racing's seeming inability to rear, or produce, their own homegrown players, it implies a club where desperation for success is outpacing common sense.</p> <p>There are already mutterings from within the Bath dressing-room about the surfeit of coaches analysing their every move. \"You can't do anything at training without someone standing behind you,\" one Bath player told me recently, painting a not entirely flattering Big Brother-style portrait of the working environment. Nor were Barkley and the ex-England defence coach Mike Ford bosom buddies back in the days when the former was in the national set-up. Perhaps the fly-half needed less financial persuasion to swap the Avon for the Seine than people imagined. Either way, it is clear rugby clubs do not resemble most normal offices.</p> <p>Those in charge must surely recognise by now that constant tinkering is counter-productive. Freddie Burns, Luther Burrell and Tom Savage, by way of example, are all young players who have made an excellent impression in the season's early weeks. More top-level evidence is required, though, before Stuart Lancaster can start getting really excited. Identifying the right players \u2013 and coaches \u2013 in the first place and then sticking with them through thick and thin is the only surefire route to lasting success. Supporters of Bath and Sale can only hope those calling the shots appreciate this. If it is simply a case of change for change's sake, it will be years before either of the two clubs wins a trophy.</p> <h2><strong>Big in Japan</strong></h2> <p>Sometimes just one line in the paper can induce melancholy. In this instance it was the following: \"Former All Blacks centre Sonny Bill Williams has scored his first try since his high-priced move to Japanese rugby.\" The piece went on to report that Williams' Panasonic Wild Knights had gone down 32-22 to Toshiba Brave Lupus in Tokyo. Apparently Williams is set to earn about \u00a3750,000 for playing 12 games in Japan's Top League.</p> <p>What a waste, not for him but the rest of us. Williams could be playing for his country in their historic first Rugby Championship visit to Argentina this weekend. Instead the most talented midfield back that rugby union has seen in ages is battling forlornly against the Brave Lupus.</p> <p>But hold on. Maybe Sonny Bill, and his agent, are ahead of the game. Japan is staging the 2019 World Cup and it is in everyone's interest for rugby in Asia to grow in popularity. Signing the king of the offload will certainly assist that. So instead of lamenting what might have been, we should all be wishing Sonny Bill well. The more tries he scores in Japan, the better for the sport in the long term.</p> <h2><strong>Hold on tight for \u2026</strong></h2> <p>Argentina v New Zealand in Buenos Aires this weekend. The Pumas are a different proposition at home and not many teams come away victorious. They are also due to play the Springboks in Rosario the following week, another potential cracker. The All Black game should be some fiesta, particularly if Argentina score early.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What do you do for Sigma, within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development?</strong></p> <p>Sigma is a joint initiative of the OECD and the European Commission to provide technical assistance in public administration reform to countries in central and eastern Europe.My fields of expertise include civil service reform, HR management and anti-corruption policies. Sienna</p> <p><strong>How do different governments compare when it comes to the relationship between politicians and civil servants?</strong></p> <p>In all countries, relationships between politicians and civil servants are problematic; most are politicised. In many countries, reformist forces are struggling to professionalise their civil services, which is often likened to de-politicisation.</p> <p>Legal predictability and accountability, impartiality, professional integrity, meritocracy and political neutrality should be enshrined in law and reflected in civil servants' attitudes and management practice.</p> <p>In certain countries, creating a senior civil service corps is seen as a way to improve professionalism. However, this should not be encouraged in little-developed administrations, where the politicisation of upper levels remains too high.</p> <p><strong>The UK government is </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/03/tender-outsourced-policy-thinktanks-decline\" title=\"\"><strong>commissioning a review of overseas administrations</strong></a><strong>.

Concord can only be achieved if the government is presided over by justice. Today we are still struggling with the idea of equality as a component of good government.</p> <p><strong>What happened in Serbia to cause the civil service 'brain drain' there?</strong></p> <p>The dismantling of the communist state and emergence of a private sector in Serbia drew a lot of talent from the state towards business. The priority was creating a private sector, but the government neglected simultaneously to build a robust state able to regulate it. International institutions encouraged the privatisation of public assets and a business-like approach to the management of the public administration, as propounded by the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story094/en/index.html\" title=\"\">Washington consensus</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_public_management\" title=\"\">new public management movement</a>. The private business sector, often resulting from foreign investments, proposed attractive remuneration packages, while the public administration salaries were frequently frozen or directly reduced.</p> <p><strong>What three lessons have taught you most during your career?</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The approaches to reform of public administration need to be modest and should be made only when really necessary. Do not propose changes only because you are enticed by them, intellectually or otherwise.</p> <p>\u2022 Communication is a tool for creating consensus about possible change strategies and goals, not to impose on others decisions already taken by you.</p> <p>\u2022 It is crucial to embed change strategy into the cultural environment of a country or organisation. Neglecting the culture, for instance by overlooking traditional public service values, demotivates those willing to improve their capabilities to serve the public interest.</p> <p><strong>What has been your greatest achievement?</strong></p> <p>The one I am most satisfied with is the reform of Lithuania's civil service, which I assisted in designing in the aftermath of the Soviet Union collapse, and which has been sustained for more than 10 years. It has already created a critical mass of professionals in the country, sharing a professional culture of service orientation and impartiality.</p> <p><strong>What's your management style?</strong></p> <p>Responding to the needs of the countries in the Sigma programme requires flexibility, persistence, openness and commitment.</p> <p><strong>How do you relax?</strong></p> <p>Literature, walking, cinema</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>ICT shouldn't just be utilised within ICT lessons. There are many applications out there that allow teachers to dazzle their students with their ICT skills. There are so many, in fact, that its very difficult to know where to start. Furthermore, you don't want to be using your time and effort investigating something which might not be of any use to you. So here's a list of my top five, free, ICT applications.</p> <h2><a href=\"www.edmodo.com\">Edmodo</a></h2> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> Edmodo has been a game changer for me. It describes itself as a educational social network and it does much of what a expensive VLE does. As a teacher you are able to set up groups for your classes and invite students in. These groups work much like groups in Facebook, teachers and students can share information and links with each other. Teachers are also able to set assignments with their groups, collect work and mark it digitally. Resources can be uploaded and shared with whichever groups you want. You can even sync your resources with Google Docs. As well as setting assignments teachers can also create self-marking quizzes which are great. Each assignment and quiz grade are then saved in your Edmodo mark book and available to download. This is just a small part of what it can do. All in all a fantastic website.</p> <p><strong>Where can it be used?</strong> Throughout the lesson and the Edmodo app allows access from anywhere if you have a WiFi connection.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.socrative.com/\">Socrative</a></h2> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> This is one of the best resources that I discovered last year. We are all aware that purchasing student response equipment can be extremely expensive, factoring in the maintenance costs can almost make buying the equipment prohibitive. Socrative places the response system right where you want it, into the hands of students either through the desktop or their mobile phone. The system can be used to deliver quizzes or simply to gauge the understanding of the class. There is a separate teacher and student portal with allocated group specific code. Simply set up your quiz, share the code, launch the quiz, Socrative does the rest. What's more is Socrative will even allow you to save and download the results, allowing you to analyse and plan your future lessons accordingly.<br>Where can it be used? Almost anywhere within a lesson - starter, plenary or right in the middle.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p> <h2><a href=\"http://prezi.com/\">Prezi</a></h2> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> Wow your students with this alternative presentation application. In most cases using PowerPoint in your classroom does exactly the job you need. However, if you want to really dazzle your audience, then look no further than Prezi. Prezi offers you an endless scroll of digital paper, offering a non-linear environment to present ideas in a different way. Prezi has changed a great deal in two years, so if you haven't tried it recently then I would urge you to revisit the site. Prezi now offers you the option to customise your presentations in a more bespoke way, so creating your own theme is now possible. One of my frustrations with Prezi in the past was its clunky editing tools. Where matching up text sizes was very difficult, the improvements now make copying and pasting significantly easier. Furthermore, they have improved the navigation options which means setting up your Prezi is now very simple to create and edit.</p> <p><strong>Where can it be used?</strong> As your main class presentation</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>Education Enjoy licence is free and is the one I have always used, there is the Education Pro licence and that is $5 a month.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://wallwisher.com/\">Wallwisher</a></h2> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> One of the main issues I have found when asking students to respond to a stimulus or discussion point, is collating their responses on the board in an effective way. One way around bits of paper floating about or the dreaded flip chart is a free website called Wallwisher. The site allows you to create custom digital notice boards, which have individual URLs, so students can create digital Post-it notes. Notes can be arranged as you wish on the board, allowing for the grouping of ideas and themes. Students can insert their names on each post or they can be left anonymous. Furthermore, each post can have multimedia rich content added to them, an image or a even a YouTube video. As each board has its own URL, it should always be available to view and refer back to for future revision sessions.</p> <p><strong>Where can it be used?</strong> Mainly for starters or plenaries.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"http://popplet.com/\"><strong>Popplet</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>What is it?</strong> This is sort of a hybrid application which mixes similar features of both Prezi and Wallwisher. You can use Popplet as a way of presenting information to your class in a non-linear way or it can be used simply as an elegant brainstorm tool. In a similar fashion to Prezi you are presented with a never-ending sheet of digital paper. This canvas can then be used to place individual Popplets, which can be customised to contain links, images or YouTube clips. Your Popplets link directly to YouTube so you can search for the video you need without opening a separate tab. Each Popplet can be linked together and then a motion path recorded, thus turning your brainstorm into a visually enticing presentation.</p> <p><strong>Where can it be used?</strong> Once again this can fit into almost any aspect of a lesson.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> The basic five Popplet subscription is free. However, <a href=\"http://blog.popplet.com/school-and-class-group-subscriptions-now-available/\">Popplet</a> has recently announced an education/school based subscription. Prices are based on a sliding scale, 50 subscriptions start at $2 then up to 500+ at $0.75.</p> <p><em>Mike Britland is head of ICT at a comprehensive school in Bournemouth.

  "<p>At its inception in 1995, the Gwangju Biennale's founders declared that the event owed much to the tumultuous events of May 1980. This year's biennale \u2013 overseen by six female curators from Asia and the Middle East \u2013 is no different.</p> <p>Recognising the venue's pivotal role in the dawn of South Korean democracy, there are exhibits that deal with popular resistance campaigns on its own doorstep to those of the Arab spring and the global Occupy movement.</p> <p>The theme of civic protest is implicit in Michael Joo's Indivisible, a collection of oil-clay reproductions of his personal effects and objects from his past that appear to hover just above ground level, but are actually suspended from a sloping roof comprising plastic police riot shields.</p> <p>For a more interactive experience, Agung Kurniawan invites visitors to try on pairs of trainers, deliberately modified to make them uncomfortable, as part of his exegesis on political protest from Gwangju to Ramallah and Cairo.</p> <p>Tu Wei-cheng tackles Gwangju's history in installation form with his Optical Trick Museum, a combination of real and imitation antique furniture brought to life by the images and words of five people with personal experience of the uprising and its bloody aftermath.</p> <p>\"Interviewing people affected by the massacre was incredibly moving,\" said Tu. \"Their experiences are not only about Gwangju \u2026 they speak volumes for the struggle for democracy elsewhere in Asia and the rest of the world.\"</p> <p>Word Projection is a reminder of China's most famous dissident, Ai Weiwei, whose presence in Gwangju was impossible due to travel restrictions imposed by the Chinese authorities. The giant slideshow, repeated daily in the square outside the main venue, draws on thousands of images to examine his thoughts on everything from art and culture to politics and food.</p> <p>As with previous biennales, this year's exhibition is not confined to conventional display spaces.</p> <p>The vivid paintings of Vatking's World form just one exhibit to have taken up residence in vacant lots in the sprawling Daein market, where contemporary art meets the more traditional aroma of dried fish.</p> <p>The market workers themselves, snoozing in the sun after the morning rush, are represented in murals and the cobalt-hued portraits, adorned with Hangul script, of William Andersen.</p> <p>The upper floor of Mugak-sa temple provides a vast canvas for Wolfgang Laib's Unlimited Ocean. The unmistakably East Asian surroundings complement the German conceptual artist's symmetrically positioned mounds of rice, their monotony broken by five mounds of chestnut pollen that symbolise life and regeneration.</p> <p>The space is also occupied by LED lighting installations by the South Korean artist U Sun-ok. Gentle changes in light occur every three minutes in meditative alcoves running along two sides of the room, where visitors can sit and, in the artist's words, contemplate their connection to the cosmos.</p> <p>Some of the exhibits attempt to interpret memory of past subjugation and its legacy across Asia. At a time when Japan's wartime conduct on the Asian mainland is again under the spotlight, Motoyuki Shitamachi's contribution is particularly well timed.</p> <p>Shitamachi's photographs of <em>torii</em> - the vermillion and stone portals that mark Japanese Shinto shrines - were not taken in his native Japan, but in countries invaded as it sought to imposed the ill-fated \"greater co-prosperity sphere\" on the rest of east Asia in the first half of the 20th century.</p> <p>Shorn of their religious context \u2013 the shrines were dismantled after Japan's defeat in 1945 \u2013 the torii linger as a reminder of an age when democracy eluded not only the Korean peninsula, but an entire region.</p> <p>Gwangju's mayor and biennale co-founder Kang Un-tae alluded to the political significance of this year's event. By encouraging collaboration between curators from diverse backgrounds and artistic traditions, the biennale, he said, promised to be a \"very democratic affair\".</p> <p>\u2022 The 2012 Gwangju Biennale runs until 11 November. Tickets from 14,000 won (\u00a37.60) for a single day ticket and 30,000 won for an exhibition pass. For more information, visit www.gwangjubiennale.org.</p>",
  "<p>For the past 12 years, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">millennium development goals</a> (MDGs) have shaped policy, guided political agendas, and channelled hundreds of millions of dollars of aid money around the globe. But with the MDGs due to expire at the end of 2015, the international community is starting to tackle the huge, inevitable follow-up question: what comes next?</p> <p>The post-MDG process will officially begin on Tuesday, when a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named\" title=\"\">UN-appointed committee </a>of international political big-shots will meet for the first time in New York. Led by the UK prime minister David Cameron, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Johnson_Sirleaf\" title=\"\">Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susilo_Bambang_Yudhoyono\" title=\"\">Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a>, the 26-member committee has been assigned the task of creating a \"development vision\" to replace the MDGs after they expire.</p> <p>\"The stakes are very, very high,\" says Ben Leo, global policy director of the anti-poverty organisation, <a href=\"http://www.one.org\" title=\"\">One Campaign</a>. \"Not just in terms of money, but also how much time and energy is going to be spent on monitoring and implementing these goals \u2013 and creating additional political momentum over the next 10 to 15 years.\"</p> <p>The MDGs, which were agreed at a meeting in New York in September 2000, set out eight specific \u2013 and ambitious \u2013 goals for the international community, including eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary school education and reducing childhood mortality rates.</p> <p>Some of those goals in some countries are expected to be achieved by the 2015 deadline; others <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/13/world-target-development-goal-child-mortality\" title=\"\">most definitely will not</a>. But the MDGs have had an enormous impact on the international donor community and how it spends its money.</p> <p>\"Now everybody knows what's at stake and how important this is,\" says Olav Kj\u00f8rven, director of the Bureau of Development Policy at the <a href=\"http://www.undp.org\" title=\"\">UN Development Programme</a> (UNDP). \"So now everyone with a particular interest will want to make sure that their particular issue is covered in the next framework.\"</p> <p>The activists lobbying the hardest are likely to be those whose issues were ignored completely by the MDGs. Topics like climate change, human rights, non-communicable diseases and economic inequality were all left out of the MDGs.</p> <p>Deciding on the key issues will be a tall order for the committee, officially known as the High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. But the committee members will also have to deal with questions such as whether to set measurable targets; whether to focus on ends rather than means; and whether the post-2015 goals should be aimed at poor countries or the world as a whole.</p> <p>Tuesday's introductory meeting is likely to produce few concrete results, as it is the first time the members of the group will have sat down together as a panel. The real action will come in the first half of next year, which is when the committee is due to produce its final report. Those findings will then be presented to UN member states for consideration in September 2013.</p> <p>The process this time is much more drawn out than it was for the MDGs \u2013 and for good reason. \"There was a perception that [the MDGs were] negotiated and agreed behind closed doors, and then basically jammed through the General Assembly,\" says Leo. But that shouldn't happen this time, he adds. The spread of mobile phones and internet connections means the world is much more connected than it was in 2000. More voices can and should contribute to the post-2015 discussions, he says.</p> <p>Leaders realise that things need to be different this time. \"We want to look at how we can learn lessons from the MDG process,\" says a source from the office of David Cameron, who is co-chairing the committee. \"The co-chairs want the process to be as broad and engaging as possible.\"</p> <p>As the committee prepares its report, it will be taking input from a broad range of sources \u2013 academics, activists and UN experts, as well as the public.

  "<p>Planet Rock owner Malcolm Bluemel is exploring a sale of the loss-making digital radio station.</p> <p>The millionaire entrepreneur and rock music fan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/04/commercialradio.gcapmedia\" title=\"\">who bought the station from GCap Media in 2008</a> is understood to have had approaches from four potential buyers.</p> <p>Bluemel has invested around \u00a33m of his own money into the station, which is currently believed to be losing between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3300,000 a year.</p> <p>Planet Rock, which features a line-up of DJs including Alice Cooper, Nicky Horne and Def Leppard frontman Joe Elliott, is the oldest-surviving commercial digital-only radio station with nearly a million listeners a week.</p> <p>Bluemel, who turns 60 later this year, said the most important issue in any discussion about a possible sale was securing the future of Planet Rock.</p> <p>\"Digital radio has come of age and Planet Rock is at the forefront of that,\" Bluemel told MediaGuardian.</p> <p>\"I have put four and a half years of my life into this and \u00a33m of my own money.

  "<p>Micro-volunteering \u2013 participating in small increments of time \u2013 is not necessarily new itself and it can arguably exist on a face-to-face basis. Advancements in technology, however, have led to a recent interest in using computers and smartphones to develop more convenient and mobile forms of micro-volunteering. In its <a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/8146.aspx\" title=\"\">2011 Giving white paper</a>, the government expressed a keen interest in micro-volunteering and the role of technology and innovation in raising levels of giving time and money. Such sentiments are echoed by practitioners who view micro-volunteering and internet-connected devices as a potential way to engage those who are less likely to volunteer in a more traditional manner.</p> <p>Despite high levels of interest, we know very little about micro-volunteering's potential value and impact, or about its relationship to other forms of volunteering. In an attempt to fill this gap in knowledge, the<a href=\"http://www.ivr.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Institute for Volunteering Research </a>surveyed people who micro-volunteered through <a href=\"http://dosomegood.orange.co.uk/partners/\" title=\"\">Orange's Do Some Good smartphone app</a>. While it is far from a conclusive study of micro-volunteering, the findings shed light on the some of the important issues and questions.</p> <h2>The changing nature of volunteering</h2> <p>In many ways the recent rise of micro-volunteering is indicative of the supposed changing nature of volunteering. Contrary to the altruism or strong sense of duty to others that is often associated with traditional volunteering, the data suggest that the overriding factor driving micro-volunteering is a self-orientated motive to occupy a short period of time. This arguably results in spontaneous and transient involvement, as the micro-volunteer is more concerned about activity itself than the cause or the wider outcomes of their actions. Such fluid engagement is facilitated by the organisational environment that micro-volunteering constitutes: in the case of Do Some Good, a loose network of people operating in a virtual sphere who can pick from a range of activities.</p> <p>While such distinctions can be drawn between micro-volunteering and more traditional types, it would be wrong to overstate that micro-volunteers are a new breed of volunteers, discrete from those defined as traditional. The findings imply that micro-volunteers may hold a mix of self-and-other orientated motives and swing across the spectrum of volunteering forms, both new and old. Concerns surrounding new volunteering types replacing more traditional ones, in this sense, are possibly unfounded or at least premature.</p> <h2>Engaging the disengaged</h2> <p>The coexistence of micro-volunteering and more traditional forms raises questions regarding the potential of micro-volunteering to engage the disengaged. Critically, the fact that three-quarters of the participants had</p> <p>previously volunteered highlights the danger of assuming that micro-volunteering will attract large numbers who don't engage in other forms of volunteering. At the same time, the greater proportion of participants who fell in the younger age groups (78 per cent are between 16 and 34) points to the potential of micro-volunteering initiatives in reaching and captivating groups who are less likely to engage through more traditional means. Furthermore, the evident appetite for convenient and quick volunteering arguably suggests that micro-volunteering can be well suited to responding and attending to the preferences and circumstances of volunteers who live hectic and busy lives. Setting up and/or incorporating micro-volunteering initiatives to supplement existing programmes \u2013 providing more choice and flexibility for volunteers \u2013 may therefore be an increasingly vital way to engage and retain a wider range of people.</p> <h2>Developing and managing micro-volunteering</h2> <p>If organisations hope to build on such possibilities, their success may partly depend on their ability to develop and implement recruitment and management practices that adapt to the specific motivations and needs of micro-volunteers. The factors commonly recognised as important to attracting and retaining volunteers, such as building friendships or gaining a sense of satisfaction through helping others, are arguably less evident in micro-volunteering. The findings from this study suggest that a greater emphasis should be placed on the activity, creating new and different actions that are easy and quick to complete. A potential tension is that this may widen the gap between the personal preferences of the volunteer and the aims and objectives of the organisation.</p> <p>The possible detachment between the volunteers and the organisation is further exacerbated by the remote position of the volunteer and the subsequent bypassing of more common procedures of management and support. This point ultimately raises the question of what level of support organisations need to put in place to enable micro-volunteers to undertake the activity effectively. What will be deemed appropriate will vary, but most organisations will arguably be faced with the challenge of meeting the volunteers' demands for quick and convenient actions at the same time as providing them with an adequate level of direction and support.</p> <p>The themes to emerge from the study raise more questions than answers, and indeed much more research is needed to understand and establish the implications of micro-volunteering. This is a gap that Institute for Volunteering Research in partnership with<a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> NCVO </a>will be addressing in an exciting follow-on study, starting this autumn \u2013 for more information click<a href=\"http://www.ivr.org.uk\" title=\"\"> here</a>.</p> <p><em>Jonathan Paylor is research officer at </em><a href=\"http://www.ivr.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Institute for Volunteering Research</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>More than six years after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/13/trafigura-ivory-coast-documents-toxic-waste\" title=\"\">the dumping of large quantities of toxic waste in the Ivory Coast</a>, there is still nothing to stop a similar disaster in developing countries because politicians and courts have failed to learn from the lessons, a new report has found.</p> <p>In 2009, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/17/trafigura-minton-report-revealed\" title=\"\">Guardian fought a landmark legal battle to reveal the links from Trafigura, a multinational oil trader, to the dumping of tonnes of toxic waste</a> in the African nation three years earlier, causing a public health crisis that affected more than 100,000 people. Effects included breathing difficulties, nausea, stinging eyes and burning skin.</p> <p>But such devastating dumping could easily be perpetrated again in developing countries, according to a three-year investigation into the incident by Amnesty International and Greenpeace. Their report, published on Tuesday, has concluded that too little has been done to strengthen national and international regulations, even after the scale of the toxic dumping became clear.</p> <p>\"This experience shows that a company can put a country into a medical crisis through toxic waste dumping, and still get away with it,\" said Marietta Harjono, campaigner at Greenpeace. \"This is a failure on every level. That is why we are very worried that it could happen again.\"</p> <p>Trafigura has argued that it was not responsible for the dumping of toxic waste by the Probo Koala. It was onboard this ship that a partially-refined fuel was subjected to \"caustic washing\" treatment and turned it into foul-smelling toxic sludge. The 229-page report, entitled The Toxic Truth, disputes this claim and argues that the company's account \"lacks credibility\".</p> <p>Trafigura sent the Guardian a copy of <a href=\"http://www.trafigura.com/our_news.aspx\" title=\"\">a one-and-a-half page letter</a> the company had written to Amnesty and Greenpeace. It said: \"We believe the report contains significant inaccuracies and misrepresentations. The report oversimplifies difficult legal issues, analyses them on ill-founded assumptions and draws selective conclusions which do not adequately reflect the complexity of the situation and the legal processes. Courts in five jurisdictions have reviewed different aspects of the incident, and decisions and settlements have been made. It is simply wrong to suggest that the issues have not had the right judicial scrutiny.\"</p> <p>Trafigura refused to say, after repeated requests, which parts of the report it found inaccurate, misrepresented or ill-founded, or which legal issues had been simplified.</p> <p>The NGOs that wrote the report called for Trafigura to face a criminal trial in the UK. Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said: \"It's time that Trafigura was made to face full legal accountability for what happened. People in Abidjan were failed not just by their own government but by governments in Europe who did not enforce their own laws. Victims are still waiting for justice and there are no guarantees that this kind of corporate crime will not happen again.\"</p> <p>In its letter, Trafigura said: \"Trafigura deeply regrets the impact the Probo Koala incident had \u2013 both real and perceived \u2013 and we have sought to assist the people affected through the variety of the settlements that have been made. It is regrettable \u2013 but entirely outside our control \u2013 that the funding made available appears not to have benefited those people, nor reached the projects intended.\"</p> <p>The report has been presented to the United Nations. Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said: \"We will study this very detailed report into a human tragedy that occurred in a fragile country that should never have happened and must never be repeated \u2013 in Cote d'Ivoire or elsewhere.\"</p> <p>He said the toxic waste dumping underline \"the urgency of strengthening the UN treaties covering shipping and hazardous wastes, specifically the Basel convention\", and called for countries to bring into force the amendment to the convention that would prohibit the export of toxic waste from developed to developing countries.</p> <p>The multibillion pound company has had to pay an estimated \u00a3300m in legal and reparation costs over the last five years as a result of the incidents. But the report found that, despite the legal precedents that the Guardian's investigations gave rise to, there was still no agreed international process for preventing and dealing with toxic dumping activities.</p> <p>There have also been indications that the authorities in the Ivory Coast have failed to redistribute compensation to the victims of the dumping.</p> <p>Greenpeace and Amnesty are calling for freedom from toxic waste dumping to be a human right, which would allow victims of large and smaller-scale dumping to seek legal redress more easily, in national and international courts. Revisions to the Basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal are now under fresh discussion but face opposition.</p> <p>The Toxic Truth report also found that it was relatively easy for companies to sidestep regulations on toxic waste movements.</p> <p>The row over Trafigura's links to the toxic dumping in the Ivory Coast was a test case for the new \"superinjunctions\" that started to appear in the UK in the 2000s, and which allowed companies and individuals to prevent the publication not just of the substance of allegations involving them, but even of the existence of such allegations. Such wide-ranging gagging orders had rarely been granted in UK law, but quickly became widely used by celebrities and companies.</p> <p>In the instance of Trafigura, the result was that the Guardian could not report on the contents of an initial report in the aftermath of the dumping, commissioned by Trafigura.</p> <p>In 2009, it appeared the terms of the superjunction were even wide enough to prevent the Guardian from reporting on a House of Commons debate on Trafigura \u2013 an unprecedented restriction, because for centuries all parliamentary proceedings had been covered by the convention of \"privilege\", which meant that debates and questions in the Houses of Parliament were entitled to be heard by the people.</p> <p>Outcry over that extraordinary restriction, and the fact that the information was swiftly available on the internet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-gagged-parliamentary-question\" title=\"\">eventually led to the lifting of the Trafigura superinjunction</a>, but has not prevented the increasingly widespread use of such legal instruments by companies, celebrities and others.</p> <p>Tuesday's report found that Trafigura had not been held to account for its dumping under UK jurisdiction, although the authors allege there is strong reason to believe that key decisions made by the company over activities such as \"caustic washing\" were made in its UK-based employees. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/23/trafigura-dutch-fine-waste-export\" title=\"\">Trafigura has been convicted of illegally exporting waste in the Netherlands</a>, where it is headquartered, but the Dutch courts decided that much of the substance of the allegations was beyond their jurisdiction. Trafigura was granted substantive immunity from prosecution in Cote d'Ivoire, as part of a local settlement.</p> <p>This sort of wrangling over legal jurisdiction was condemned as \"opportunistic\" by Greenpeace's Harjono. She said strengthening the Basel regulations would prevent companies being able to benefit from playing off one jurisdiction against another.</p> <p>The chain of events leading to the dumping was that in late 2005 large amounts of coker naptha, an unrefined fuel, were bought by Trafigura and subjected to a process called caustic washing on board the Probo Koala, resulting in the creation of tonnes of hazardous waste. In July 2006, the ship attempted to unload this in the Netherlands but was told it would be costly. The waste was then taken to Abidjan in Cote d'Ivoire, where it was dumped. The next year, Trafigura entered an agreement with the country's governments to pay nearly $200m in return for immunity from prosecution. A report, entitled <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/10/16/mintonreport.pdf\" title=\"\">the Minton report</a>, on the incident was obtained by the Guardian, which was prevented from publishing it by Trafigura's legal representatives, the Carter-Ruck law firm.</p>",

The issue at a glance</h2> <p>The justice and security bill's most controversial element is the extension of secret courts, known as closed material procedures (CMPs), into the civil courts in England and Wales. Opponents believe the powers will enable ministers, rather than judges, to manipulate the way evidence is withheld or presented in the courts \u2013 depriving claimants of a fair trial. The government claims the reform will enable judges to hear a greater range of national security cases. The bill also alters parliamentary scrutiny of the intelligence services.</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>2. The legal origins</h2> <p>In May 2010, the government was forced to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/04/government-secret-evidence-guantanamo-torture1\" title=\"\">pay out millions of pounds in compensation to Binyam Mohamed</a> and other former Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404886150\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347364677660/Binyam-Mohamed-005.jpg\" alt=\"Binyam Mohamed\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Binyam Mohamed, the UK resident secretly rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, whose case sparked the row over intelligence disclosed in court. Photograph: Shaun Curry/AFP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Curry/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The settlement came after the court of appeal rejected requests by MI5 and MI6 that they be able to present security evidence in secret without disclosing it in full to the claimants. \"Trials should be conducted in public and the judgments should be given in public,\" the judges ruled. Rather than reveal \"sensitive\" intelligence, the government settled out of court claims for wrongful imprisonment and complicity in torture.</p> <p>The result, according to <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm81/8194/8194.pdf\" title=\"\">the former justice secretary Ken Clarke</a>, has been a \"UK justice system unable to pass judgment on these vital matters\". Claimants, he argues, are denied any judicial findings while the intelligence agencies cannot clear their names. The government says the justice and security bill is designed to ensure such a predicament never recurs by extending the use of secret courts while preserving intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies.</p> <p>Without transparent justice, critics counter, abuses of power will remain hidden.</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>3. Why are secret trials in the news?</h2> <p>The legislation, introduced in the House of Lords, has provoked deep anxiety among civil liberties groups,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/05/secrets-scrutiny-green-paper-justice\" title=\"\"> senior lawyers </a>and politicians who fear it is the thin end of a wedge, overturning long-established, common law precedents about fair and open justice. The Labour party supports some elements but <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/54266/sadiq_khan_secret_hearings_undermine_credibility_of_our_entire_legal_system.html\" title=\"\">argues that the secret court developments are \"too widely drawn\" </a>and create \"damaging mistrust and a dangerous gulf between government and the citizens it is purporting to protect\".</p> <p>The bill is also sharpening <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/13/secret-courts-bill-liberal-democrats\" title=\"\">divisions between Liberal Democrats and Conservatives </a>within the coalition. The prime minister, David Cameron, justified secret hearings on the grounds that \"... it isn't currently possible to use intelligence information in a court of law without sometimes endangering national security\".</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>4. A short history of secret hearings</h2> <p>Closed, or \"in camera\", hearings are not unprecedented. Cases in the family division of the high court relating to child custody and divorce issues are regularly held in private.</p> <p>Public interest immunity (PII) certificates date back to the mid-20th century and empower courts to make an order, usually at the request of the government, preventing disclosure of secrets if their release is deemed damaging to the public interest. Neither side in such cases can rely on the withheld information.</p> <p>So-called \"closed material procedures\" (CMPs) go one stage further, enabling authorities to introduce sensitive information in a trial that can only be seen by the judge and security-cleared \"special advocates\" who represent the interest of an individual claimant. The special advocate may not give his or her client precise details of the evidence and can only provide a \"gist\" or loose summary. The claimant may not therefore be aware of all the allegations being made. Critics say this results in parties to a legal dispute no longer being on an equal footing, tilting the advantage in the government's favour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404886151\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/10/1320941804650/Royal-British-Legion-Popp-003.jpg\" alt=\"Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Royal British Legion and Nick Clegg pressured the government to exempt coroners' courts from the bill.

First, the judge can make a decision only if the secretary of state makes an application and has no other jurisdiction to consider it. Secondly, when the judge does come to consider it, it is not for him to weigh up the relative merits of PII or CMP, or to decide what the fairest way would be to decide the case.

The prize is improved executive accountability, a court system equipped to handle sensitive material, and security and intelligence agencies that are able to get on with their job: a safer Britain, a fairer Britain.\"</p> <p><strong>Not perfect but better than nothing</strong><br>The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/27/justice-security-bill-is-sound\" title=\"\">the Liberal Democrat Lord Carlile, describes the debate as involving \"finely balanced issues\"</a>. He comes down on the side of extending closed material procedures. \"The puritans in this debate demand that 'open justice' must be protected, whatever the cost to the public and to the intelligence needs of our country,\" he wrote this summer. \"Subject to some fine tuning, the government is on the right track with a responsible piece of legislation \u2026 It should not be forgotten that claimants themselves have consented to closed hearings, realising that they were the only way in which their concerns would be properly scrutinised \u2013 one reason why I believe the government should ensure that both parties in a case can apply for a CMP.\"</p> <p>The current independent reviewer, David Anderson QC, believes the proposals <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jun/19/secret-court-genuine-problem-disproportionate\" title=\"\">would be \"tolerable\" as a last resort</a>. He said there is \"a small but indeterminate category of national security-related claims, both for judicial review of executive decisions and for civil damages, in respect of which it is preferable that the option of a CMP \u2013 for all its inadequacies \u2013 should exist.\" </p> <p><strong>Intelligence services will become more accountable</strong> <br>The security services, who have lobbied for and publicly supported the bill, insist that nothing currently revealed will be hidden in future.

This means that such material cannot in practice go into court at all. This situation is bad for us, bad for the other party to proceedings and bad for the administration of justice.</p> <p>\"... No material that is currently considered in public will be made secret under the new arrangements and the effect will be that more, rather than less, material will go before the courts. But the sensitive material will be protected. This will mean better justice and better accountability.\"</p> <p><strong>Security co-operation with our closest allies is at risk without legal reform</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.malcolmrifkind.com/news.aspx?id=5\" title=\"\">Malcolm Rifkind, the former defence and foreign secretary,</a> believes that \"foreign intelligence material provided by another country on the strict promise of confidentiality\" should remain behind closed doors. \"Many of the most serious terrorist plots in the UK in the past decade have had significant links abroad, so foreign material is often vital for the protection of the UK. When other countries share material with us, they want to know that we will protect it. It still belongs to them and is controlled by them: it is not ours to do with as we wish. This 'control principle' is sacrosanct and we must not break it. If we do, foreign agencies will not trust us and will not share material with us in future.\"</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>8. What will disappear behind closed courtroom doors? </h2> <p>Critics of the bill fear that a host of security scandals unearthed with the help of court challenges, including allegations of torture and secret rendition, would never have been exposed under the bill's proposed system of closed material procedures. Even fundamental personal rights such as freedom from imprisonment, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jul/13/secret-court-habeas-corpus-reprieve\" title=\"\">guaranteed by the ancient writ of habeas corpus, might be compromised by the new regime,</a> peers have suggested. The fact that a court could sit in secret without giving notice to the public or the media of a forthcoming hearing has drawn <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/aug/19/secret-court-hearing-compared-superinjunctions?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">comparisons with the excesses of privacy superinjunctions</a>. The government dismisses such claims as alarmist.</p> <p>While the government claims that the proposals are intended to protect the control principle that covers intelligence provided by foreign governments, the material sought in the Guant\u00e1namo case were mostly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/interactive/2010/jul/14/toture-files-key-passages?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">internal British government communications</a>, and their disclosure caused grave embarrassment. The government says claimants will receive a summary of the closed material sufficient for them to instruct the special advocate representing their interests.</p> <p>The US government made its first complaint that disclosure in the Binyam Mohamed case would damage the UK-US intelligence sharing relationship <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/15/foreign-office-guantanamo-torture\" title=\"\">only after the foreign office asked it to do so</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>9.

FAQ</h2> <p><strong>Is this the end of fair trials?</strong><br>Critics claim that under a CMP, the legal playing fields are no longer even, entrenching the government's advantage in any secret court case. The government insists such measures will only be used in a very limited number of cases and that courts, including Strasbourg, have found that CMPs are capable of delivering fair trials. </p> <p><strong>Have UK courts ever exposed US military secrets?</strong> <br>No examples have ever been given of past \"betrayals\" of confidential intelligence material obtained from allies. However, the government argues that the overturning of the Foreign Secretary's PII certificate in Binyam Mohamed - and publication of seven paragraphs of advice - caused damage to the US-UK intelligence-sharing relationship and national security. </p> <p><strong>How large is the problem? </strong><br>The number of civil cases affected is likely to be small but it is the expansion of the principle of closed material procedures that worries civil liberties groups.

  "<p>The CIA's programme of \"targeted\" drone killings in Pakistan's tribal heartlands is politically counterproductive, kills large numbers of civilians and undermines respect for international law, according to <a href=\"http://livingunderdrones.org\">a report by US academics</a>.</p> <p>The study by Stanford and New York universities' law schools, based on interviews with victims, witnesses and experts, blames the US president, Barack Obama, for the escalation of \"signature strikes\" in which groups are selected merely through remote \"pattern of life\" analysis.</p> <p>Families are afraid to attend weddings or funerals, it says, in case US ground operators guiding drones misinterpret them as gatherings of Taliban or al-Qaida militants.</p> <p>\"The dominant narrative about the use of drones in Pakistan is of a surgically precise and effective tool that makes the US safer by enabling 'targeted killings' of terrorists, with minimal downsides or collateral impacts. This narrative is false,\" the report, entitled Living Under Drones, states.</p> <p>The authors admit it is difficult to obtain accurate data on casualties \"because of US efforts to shield the drone programme from democratic accountability, compounded by obstacles to independent investigation of strikes in North Waziristan\".</p> <p>The \"best available information\", they say, is that between 2,562 and 3,325 people have been killed in Pakistan between June 2004 and mid-September this year \u2013 of whom between 474 and 881 were civilians, including 176 children. The figures have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/aug/02/us-drone-strikes-data\" title=\"\">assembled by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, which estimated that a further 1,300 individuals were injured in drone strikes over that period.</p> <p>The report was commissioned by and written with the help of <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/cases/2012_03_28_noor_khan/\" title=\"\">the London-based Reprieve organisation, which is supporting action in the British courts by Noor Khan</a>, a Pakistani whose father was killed by a US drone strike in March 2011. His legal challenge alleges the UK is complicit in US drone strikes because GCHQ, the eavesdropping agency, shares intelligence with the CIA on targets for drone strikes.</p> <p>\"US drones hover 24 hours a day over communities in north-west Pakistan, striking homes, vehicles, and public spaces without warning,\" the American law schools report says.</p> <p>\"Their presence terrorises men, women, and children, giving rise to anxiety and psychological trauma among civilian communities. Those living under drones have to face the constant worry that a deadly strike may be fired at any moment, and the knowledge that they are powerless to protect themselves.</p> <p>\"These fears have affected behaviour. The US practice of striking one area multiple times, and evidence that it has killed rescuers, makes both community members and humanitarian workers afraid or unwilling to assist injured victims.\"</p> <p>The study goes on to say: \"Publicly available evidence that the strikes have made the US safer overall is ambiguous at best \u2026 The number of 'high-level' militants killed as a percentage of total casualties is extremely low \u2013 estimated at just 2% [of deaths]. Evidence suggests that US strikes have facilitated recruitment to violent non-state armed groups, and motivated further violent attacks \u2026 One major study shows that 74% of Pakistanis now consider the US an enemy.\"</p> <p>Coming from American lawyers rather than overseas human rights groups, the criticisms are likely to be more influential in US domestic debates over the legality of drone warfare.</p> <p>\"US targeted killings and drone strike practices undermine respect for the rule of law and international legal protections and may set dangerous precedents,\" the report says, questioning whether Pakistan has given consent for the attacks.</p> <p>\"The US government's failure to ensure basic transparency and accountability in its targeted killings policies, to provide details about its targeted killing programme, or adequately to set out the legal factors involved in decisions to strike hinders necessary democratic debate about a key aspect of US foreign and national security policy.</p> <p>\"US practices may also facilitate recourse to lethal force around the globe by establishing dangerous precedents for other governments. As drone manufacturers and officials successfully reduce export control barriers, and as more countries develop lethal drone technologies, these risks increase.\"</p> <p>The report supports <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un\" title=\"\">the call by Ben Emmerson QC, the UN's special rapporteur on countering terrorism, for independent investigations </a>into deaths from drone strikes and demands the release of the US department of justice memorandums outlining the legal basis for US targeted killings in Pakistan.</p> <p>The report highlights the switch from the former president George W Bush's practice of targeting high-profile al-Qaida personalities to the reliance, under Obama's administration, of analysing patterns of life on the ground to select targets.</p> <p>\"According to US authorities, these strikes target 'groups of men who bear certain signatures, or defining characteristics associated with terrorist activity, but whose identities aren't known',\" the report says. \"Just what those 'defining characteristics' are has never been made public.\" People in North Waziristan are now afraid to attend funerals or other gatherings, it suggests.</p> <p>Fears that US agents pay informers to attach electronic tags to the homes of suspected militants in Pakistan haunt the tribal districts, according to the study. \"[In] Waziristan \u2026 residents are gripped by rumours that paid CIA informants have been planting tiny silicon-chip homing devices that draw the drones.</p> <p>\"Many of the Waziris interviewed spoke of a constant fear of being tagged with a chip by a neighbour or someone else who works for either Pakistan or the US, and of the fear of being falsely accused of spying by local Taliban.\"</p> <p>Reprieve's director, Clive Stafford Smith, said: \"An entire region is being terrorised by the constant threat of death from the skies. Their way of life is collapsing: kids are too terrified to go to school, adults are afraid to attend weddings, funerals, business meetings, or anything that involves gathering in groups.</p> <p>\"George Bush wanted to create a global 'war on terror' without borders, but it has taken Obama's drone war to achieve his dream.\"</p>",
  "<p>Is it possible that the only person on the USA side in the Ryder Cup who will not hit a single drive, line up one putt, play out of any bunkers or have his name written on a solitary page of the Ryder Cup record book could end up playing one of the most pivotal roles this week at Medinah Country Club?</p> <p>It does not require an extreme bend of the imagination for such a scenario to come true, at least not in the mind of the USA captain, Davis Love, who is stirring a special ingredient into his team mix \u2013 a bald, 49-year-old, cigar-chomping, billionaire former basketball player named Michael Jordan.</p> <p>He plays neither pro basketball nor Ryder Cup golf but make no mistake, Jordan's presence as one of Love's assistants will somehow affect the outcome. We've seen this before. This is not the first occasion that Jordan, the one-time superstar of the National Basketball Association, has been brought on board by a USA captain in international golf competition. Fred Couples had Jordan as an assistant in the 2009 Presidents Cup, a 19\u00bd\u201314\u00bd victory for USA over the International team.</p> <p>Couples said Jordan had one mission to accomplish and one mission only. \"His role was to have fun with the guys,\" Couples said. \"That's it. He's certainly not telling them how to hit a chip shot.\" And Love envisages a similar outcome happening again, this time on the tree-lined layout of Medinah's famed Course No3 in suburban Chicago. \"Air Jordan,\" said Love, invoking Jordan's nickname earned by the manner in which he seemed to play the game above the court. \"Michael's going to be hanging around \u2026 and be an influence.\"</p> <p>Working out the details on exactly how that happens is probably going to be more extemporaneous than planned. At best, Jordan, motivator extraordinaire, is on hand to keep the players loose, to serve as possibly the greatest role model for success in sport and to pass out cigars. At worst, the USA lose for the fifth time in six Ryder Cup matches since 1999 and the Michael Jordan Experiment comes to an abrupt conclusion.</p> <p>Jordan and the Ryder Cup began their association in 1997 at Valderrama, where USA's captain, Tom Kite, plucked Jordan out of the gallery, invited him on to his golf cart and spent a great deal of time driving him around the course.</p> <p>Europe won by one point and one of the lasting images is that of a worried Kite behind the wheel chauffeuring Jordan while Europe's captain Seve Ballesteros charismatically steered his team to victory through sheer will.</p> <p>Of course, not everyone feels that way. Love thought the Jordan-Kite thing was an inspired moment then and continues to do so now. \"I thought one of the neatest things I ever saw in the Ryder Cup was Michael riding in the golf cart with Tom Kite,\" Love says. \"One of the coolest things. I want him to be seen and I want him to be in our team room.\"</p> <p>Certainly Jordan's influence has been broad and even unprecedented, not only in the world of professional sport, but also in the world of commerce, brand marketing and global reach. Jordan's brand of Nike sneakers have surpassed $1bn in sales and made Jordan a major contributor to Nike's $19bn worldwide empire. It was Nike who took a gamble in 1984 on the first-year pro basketball player when it signed the 21-year-old Jordan to a 5-year, $25 million contract.The more Jordan's legend grew, the more success he had, his fans wanted a piece of him, and so that translated into sales of his sneakers. A phrase arose, 'Be Like Mike.' And one of the best ways to be like Mike was to wear the shoes he wore</p> <p>With Jordan as the star attraction, the Chicago Bulls won six NBA championships, he was the league's most valuable player five times, a 14-times All-Star and he also led the NBA in scoring 11 times. Jordan was considered a great team-mate, although he demanded excellence of others, because he made his fellow players better. The Lakers' Magic Johnson was the same. Jordan brought out the best in his team-mates, perhaps in no greater case than that of Scottie Pippen, a little-known college player who went from a bit-part performer to a Hall of Fame career that never would have happened without Jordan's influence bringing it out of him.</p> <p>Although he has not had much success in his current job as head of basketball operations for the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats \u2013 their 7-59 record last season was the worst of any team in NBA history \u2013 Jordan remains an iconic figure and enjoys cult status, which is important to Love. And he retains a love affair with golf, which is important to Jordan.</p> <p>His only public stumble in recent years was possibly his 2009 speech when he was inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame, curiously turning the occasion into an opportunity to say something bad about everyone he perceived to have wronged him somewhere along the way.</p> <p>But in the golf world Jordan is unassailable and also valuable for what he seems to offer to captains such as Love and Couples. Jordan is devoted to golf, he represents success and he gains even more traction with the players because he is both instantly recognisable and authoritative. He established a bond with the younger USA players Sean O'Hair and Hunter Mahan at the Presidents Cup, although neither are in the team at Medinah.</p> <p>Tiger Woods, however, is in the USA team and Jordan was one of Woods' earliest friends and boosters, largely because of their business affiliation with Nike. Woods still refers to Jordan as MJ and considered him a close confidante because of their shared superstardom in their particular sports. They are no longer as close, largely because Woods tightened his inner circle after his personal meltdown in 2009.</p> <p>But as the ultimate professional from a team sport, this week Jordan may fill a major need to help bring together as a team golfers who are accustomed to playing the game purely as individuals.</p> <p>As for Jordan's view of what he brings to the table, he offered a rare insight into his thoughts about individuals in sports and team sports at the Presidents Cup. \"When I walk away from this \u2026 I know that as a team you have leaders, you have followers, you have certain role players within a team \u2026 any championship team I ever played on, everybody makes their own contribution,\" Jordan said. \"That means a lot when you talk about winning. It's about bringing that guy up \u2026 to take guys who had not really been successful on certain days \u2026 giving them confidence to help them rebound and get back to their game form. That, to me, symbolises what a team is all about.\"</p> <p>That may be the way the play is drawn up on paper for the USA side. If Jordan can influence one extra putt to disappear into the hole, it may all be worthwhile and he will be then free to pass out more cigars.</p> <p><em>Thomas Bonk has covered golf since 1988.
