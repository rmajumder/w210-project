  "<p>It is said there's someone for everyone. Who would have predicted, when Todd Akin, the Republican representative, was abandoned by his party for his \"legitimate rape\" comments a month ago, Newt Gingrich would be his knight in shining armour.</p> <p>But at the first major fundraising event held by the Akin campaign since the Missouri senate candidate was blackballed by the party funders and leaders, Gingrich pledged his support and said he was just the first in a wave of well-known Republicans to stand by Akin.</p> <p>Republican party leaders have said the controversial remarks have made it impossible for Akin to unseat incumbent US senator Claire McCaskill. They have pleaded with him to step down in time to name a replacement for the election.</p> <p>Gingrich came to Missouri on Monday to back Akin at a $500-a-ticket fundraising lunch, at which he addressed about 50 of the congressman's supporters \u2013 and earlier, the media.</p> <p>At at a press conference at a train station in Kirkwood, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, Gingrich said Akin was running a winnable race and made his own prediction \u2013 that the national Republican leaders, including Mitt Romney, would reverse track and back the candidate once they \"adjust to the reality\" that he is staying in the race.</p> <p>\"If Todd and the people of Missouri prove it's a close race, what's the moral case for not backing the Republican nominee?\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>Gingrich told the crowd, made up of reporters and a handful of supporters that it all came down to a simple question. \"Do you want to keep Harry Reid as the majority leader?\" Gingrich said to shouts of \"No\" from Akin supporters.</p> <p>Gaining McCaskill's seat is seen as vital if the GOP is to take over the Senate in November. \"How do you go back to your donors and say: 'Let's throw the Senate away?',\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>The former presidential candidate dismissed comments on Sunday by Republican national committee chairman Reince Preibus who declared on TV that there was no way any RNC money would be used to help Akin. \"My expectation would be that in the crunch, in October, governor Romney is going to be for the entire ticket, and he's going to be for Todd Akin,\" Gingrich said.</p> <p>He compared Akin to Harry Truman, senator and later president who was dumped by the party machine in the 1940s.</p> <p>The fundraiser would have netted Akin up to $42,000 from the cost of the tickets alone, in addition to the $600,000 Akin has already raised online.<br>Rick Tyler, a former longterm aide to Gingrich, who is now advising Akin, said he had \"adequate funding\" to fight the election.</p> <p>The polls are showing a close contest, and Tuesday is the last day that Akin could seek a court order to drop out. On Monday, he reaffirmed that he had no plans to withdraw, telling supporters that a number of prominent Republicans have already agreed to campaign on his behalf but declining to name names. He begins a four-day \"Common Sense\" bus tour.</p> <p>Akin has aplogised for the remarks on \"legitimate rape\" he made in a televised interview and has even drummed up a \"Women for Akin\" group. <a href=\"http://www.akin.org/campaign/missouri-women-stand-todd-akin\">A video on his website</a> has one woman weeping as she recounted having an abortion as she endorses the pro-life candidate she said speaks up for women.</p> <p>His supporters say he a mistake and should be forgiven for it. Paula Ritter, 78, who was at Kirkwood station with her husband to support Akin said he and other politicians needed to learn \"who they are talking to\". \"I think he's sorry. But I don't think he's sorry for thinking that\" she said. Ritter said she didn't agree with him \"but I wouldn't change my vote because of it. I'm not for single-issue politics\".</p> <p>Gingrich joked: \"if saying something dumb disqualifies you, Joe Biden couldn't be vice-president.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396631025\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348525557579/gingrich-akin-protests-010.jpg\" alt=\"gingrich akin protests\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">About 50 people gathered outside the fundraiser to protest Akin's candidacy.

One held up a banner which said: \"Lets shut Todd Akin down\" in reference to his comments that rape victims had a way of \"shutting down\" pregnancies.</p> <p>Jane Von Kaenel said his remarks had re-invigorated the feminist base in Missouri. \"He's an embarrassment, he's out of touch,\" she said of Akin. \"You just can't hold your nose and get away from the smell.\" She said she thought that \"many, many\" Republicans would vote for McCaskill.</p> <p>Susan Cunningham, 73, a retired teacher from Pacific, in Franklin, Missouri, who was holding the banner declaring \"Let's shut down Todd Akin\" said she was worried about Republican party becoming more and more conservative on social issues. She said: \"I'm very worried about what is happening in this country. I'm against Todd Akin's voting record on everything, from women's issues, to the environment and education.\"</p> <p>\"I don't understand why Newt Gingrich is supporting him, but to be honest I don't understand why Newt Gingrich does anything. Newt must have an ulterior motive. They are blowing smoke and they are very good at it. But Todd Akin is scary. When I think of my daughter and my grandchildren, are they going to have access to birth control of are they going to have to put a veil on? It's crazy here, we are going backwards.\"</p> <p>Gingrich refused to say what conversations he had with the party leadership that led him to predict a u-turn on Akin.</p> <p>Asked if anyone from the party had tried to stop him from coming out in support of Akin, he said: \"I'm not going to talk about my conversations with party leadership.\"</p> <p>Tyler, a former long-term aide to Gingrich who now works for Akin, said he thought the candidate would raise an \"adequate amount\" of money to stay in the race, but added that he believed if would be \"political malpractice\" if the Republican party did not get back behind him.</p> <p>Marsha Walker, a social worker from Chesterfield, who attended the fundraiser, said she hoped the voters would forgive Akin his remarks. She said she was voting for him because of his strong pro-life views.</p> <p>\"Everyone who has spoken has erred in some way, and not to forgive is unforgivable. We need someone like Todd to fight for morality in Washington, and Todd is s a fighter.\"</p>",
  "<p>The bittersweet musical Once is to transfer to London's West End after winning awards and financial success on Broadway.</p> <p>The show directed and choreographed by the same creative team behind Black Watch, will move in to the Phoenix theatre on Charing Cross Road, home of Willy Russell's Blood Brothers for the past 21 years.</p> <p>Speculation last week that Once was transferring to London was confirmed by a <a href=\"http://www.phoenixtheatrelondon.co.uk/once/\" title=\"\">statement, on the Phoenix's website,</a> that it will open after the nine-week run of Goodnight Mister Tom over Christmas.</p> <p>The show is based on the low budget 2007 film of the same name which had even the toughest of critics warming to its romanticism. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/19/romance\" title=\"\">Guardian's Xan Brooks wrote</a>: \"It's a soulful valentine to music, friendship and the joys of honest hard graft, played out in the bedsits and recording studios of a deglamourised Dublin.\"</p> <p>Written by Irish playwright Enda Walsh and set in Dublin, the love story follows the relationship of two songwriters, an Irish busker and a Czech migrant.

  "<p>'<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122721278056345271.html\" title=\"\">You never want a serious crisis to go to waste</a>,\" Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama's chief of staff,&#xa0;quipped in late 2008 as Wall Street descended into chaos in the waning days of the Bush presidency and the new administration prepared its response. Four years on, many influential figures in Europe feel the same way, judging from president of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso's widely discussed call this month for closer integration and \"<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/president/news/archives/2012/09/20120912_1_en.htm\" title=\"\">a democratic federation of nation states</a>\".</p> <p>Europe's handling of the crisis to date has been nothing if not faltering and disjointed. According to a recent paper by economist Edwin Truman at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, the lack of timely co-operation among members of the eurozone has <a href=\"http://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime/?p=3001\" title=\"\">led to a shortfall in world output of about $1.1 trillion</a>, of which Europe itself has suffered $730 billion \u2013 more than 3% of its total GDP.</p> <p>But what kind of opportunity has the sovereign debt crisis provided? The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/european-central-bank-powers-grow\" title=\"\">newly enhanced role of the European Central Bank</a> has emerged as a firefighting measure, a means of damping down the flames and calming the markets. Beyond this, both Barroso and German chancellor Angela Merkel see the muddling through of the&#xa0;last two years as a prelude to a necessary longer term strengthening of European solidarity through new institutions and&#xa0;powers at the European level: a union-wide system of banking supervision to begin with; later, perhaps, some kind of European treasury or finance ministry, a greater pooling of border policing, and a leap forward to the kind of co-ordinated diplomacy that will allow the EU to punch at its weight on the international stage.</p> <p>Of course, a large number of people in Europe will resist any further drift towards federation. To Eurosceptics, the&#xa0;new proposals simply confirm the omnipresent nightmare of a superstate in the making. They see both the commission and the German chancellery as embarked on a long-term power grab, and they have no time for Barroso's argument that, in the age of globalisation, pooled sovereignty means greater power for individual members. Indeed the nationalist response across Europe is to claim the opposite \u2013 to insist that both political virtue and economic interest demand a halt to integration and a reassertion of the powers of national legislatures.</p> <p>They are perhaps half right. For Europe's dilemma is a historically unparalleled one. The intense pace of global financial integration during the last 30 years poses an acute political challenge. Can the members of the union, traditionally so wedded to their national institutions, keep these intact and remain globally influential? Not even the Germans would have the kind of standing they now enjoy if the union were to disintegrate.</p> <p>So here is the rub. Economically, there can be little doubt that some sort of enhanced co-ordination is desirable for Europeans to prosper in a multipolar world. But politically, the likely outcome is a further shift in power from&#xa0;elected representatives to unelected technocrats and a further weakening of democracy; and greater powers for bankers at the European Central Bank and lawyers at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/european-court-of-justice\" title=\"\">European court of justice</a> \u2013 along with the civil servants in Brussels who interpret&#xa0;their judgments.</p> <p>The 11 EU foreign ministers who last week put out a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/eu-foreign-defence-policy-overhaul?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">report on the future of Europe</a> are alive to this danger. They want the European parliament to be consulted more, and they talk about improving democratic legitimacy. But they are short on ideas for doing this, and their proposal to streamline European decision-making by reducing member states' veto powers pushes further in the opposite direction. As for a powerful directly elected European president \u2013 another of their proposals \u2013 this might attract voter interest but would still be only tangentially connected to the political parties which dominate national politics.</p> <p>The eurozone crisis has made this conflict between the logics of global economics and national politics emerge starkly. In the early years of the euro, electorates were willing by and large to pool sovereignty, and hence give up their right to be consulted, when the payoff was greater prosperity and mobility. But if austerity measures leave the continent floundering in a Japanese-style recession for the next decade, all bets are off. In such circumstances, with&#xa0;high levels of unemployment across much of southern and eastern Europe, electoral sentiment may move sharply away from Brussels and demand instead that their politicians protect their national economies.</p> <p>In short, unless there is a plan for integration that prioritises recovery and growth, what we may end up with is not a Europe that is a \"democratic federation of nation states\" at all but a gradual unwinding of the entire integration process. A prospect to make some Eurosceptics rejoice, no doubt, but replete with dangers of its own.</p> <p>Europeans thus have a tough choice to make: the historic preservation of their national institutions, or greater co-operation and derogation of powers. If, as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/holland-new-coaliton-eu-caution\" title=\"\">Dutch elections suggested last month</a>, they would still mostly opt for the latter then the real argument becomes about the nature of the new institutions, their powers and the philosophy behind them.</p> <p>This is where the battle is now joined&#xa0;\u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>'s pro-growth France battles Merkel's inflation-obsessed Germany, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi\" title=\"\">Mario&#xa0;Draghi's European Central Bank</a> tussles with the German Bundesbank. It is the critical struggle for anyone concerned with the preservation of the European model of social welfare. What a sad commentary on the state of British diplomacy that what David Cameron's government thinks about this remains entirely irrelevant.<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>After several years of calumny related to its business in sex-related classified advertising, the company that owns the Village Voice, as well as a collection of other papers that used to be called the alternative press, has decided to sell the papers and keep the lucrative sex ads. In truth, this is more legerdemain than actual transaction, and nothing but some corporate filings will likely change. But put that aside for the moment.</p> <p>The Village Voice and other like-minded papers have always been supported in part by sex ads. In the case of the Voice, that's more than 60 years of sex ads. Indeed, the Voice's ads might fairly be said to have helped make the world safe for a remarkable variety of fetishes.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch bought the Voice in 1977, in part because he recognized that the Voice's famous back page, where its sex ads appeared, yielded one of the highest per line rates in the world of classified advertising (every newspaper's most profitable revenue source). Helped by those sex ads, he sold the Voice in 1985 for vastly more than he'd bought it, and financed his acquisition of 20th Century Fox. </p> <p>While the papers themselves have long been faltering as revenue generators, the sex ad business has continued to be a reliable producer. From time to time, there have been main street outbursts against this raunchiness, mostly redounding to the brand value of the Voice and other alternative titles. But it is really only now, after all these years \u2013 at a time when sex service advertising is as ubiquitous and available online as oxygen \u2013 that main street censure has really scored a direct hit. This opprobrium has involved a sustained campaign by media, politicians, and amorphous citizen groups directed against the company's management, investors, and advertisers.</p> <p>So why now? And about what exactly?</p> <p>The ostensible charge is sexual perniciousness: the Voice and its advertising, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/kristof-where-pimps-peddle-their-goods.html?gwh=CEFF16E95D6F6E0FCACF4E43396BEAA3\">say critics</a>, aids sex trafficking. The evidence here is awfully slim, but sex-trafficking is one of those phrases, like weapons of mass destruction, that requires little factual support. Who isn't against sex-trafficking \u2013 even if its exact definition and operation is elusive? </p> <p>The Voice's foremost antagonist is <a href=\"http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/responding-to-village-voice-on-sex-trafficking/\">Nicholas Kristof, a New York Times op-ed columnist</a>, which has rather set the weight of the liberal establishment against the company and its ads. Kristof is an unfortunate enemy. Alone on the op-ed page in his lack of style, specialty, or point of view, he has compensated by adopting a mission with the greatest zeal: he's a one-man NGO for girls forced into prostitution in Africa. Trying to push his campaign into America (encouraged, no doubt, by his editors to ground his story a little closer to home), he's focused on the Voice. </p> <p>His are highly personalized columns in which Kristof introduces us to a particular victim \u2013 someone he has gotten to know and who he's taken a personal interest in helping to save \u2013 who then stands as a personification of countless more like her. Almost all his columns on the subject are written like this. And his personalization is always much stronger than his case.</p> <p>At any rate, he does not have to prove that there is a sex trade and that there is advertising for sexual services. It would, however, be whistling into the wind to attempt to hold the web itself, and its global red light district, accountable. The Voice, with its abundant and quantifiable revenues and the lasting power of its alternative and, I suppose, suggestively amoral brand, is a more focused villain.</p> <p>Along with Craig's List, it has became a favorite anti-vice target. While, for nearly two generations, it has been hard to make much of a case against pervasive sexuality, the argument suddenly has new legs. It's not about promiscuity, which makes you sound square; it's not about prostitution, which makes you sound dirty; it's about sex-trafficking, which makes you sound like you're on the side of the angels, know-nothing though they might be.</p> <p>And then, there is Scientology. For some hard-to-fathom reason, the Voice's editor, Tony Ortega, has pursued an obsession with Scientology. In turn, the Scientologists, famous hasslers, have used their hassle machine to help demonize the Voice's sex ads. (<a href=\"http://jimromenesko.com/2012/09/14/tony-ortega-resigns-as-village-voice-editor/\">Ortega, who resigned recently</a>, may be a victim of Scientology and the Voice's efforts to save the sex ad business.)</p> <p>And then, there is too the significant point that the Voice and its sister alternative papers don't really exist anymore. Once, these were journalistic organizations with a particular moral and political view that made sex advertising a lot more defensible \u2013 and rallied a lot more defenders. But now, these heretofore alternative papers are adjuncts to a marketing organization (of movies, restaurants, clubs, acts, under-resourced brands), which, for legacy reasons, employes a few inexperienced and low-paid people who would like to be journalists, and who hope someone other than the Voice will eventually hire them to do that. Nobody, alas, really cares about the Village Voice anymore.</p> <p>I do not say this with any venom. The web has obviated any reason for there to be an alternative press. It is gone. But out of its ashes, the Voice's owners have been clever enough (or desperate enough) to create a different sort of enterprise \u2013 which, as it happens, is not all that interesting to anyone who doesn't want a prostitute. </p> <p>You see the problem here in defending itself. But there is, curiously, less of a problem if there is not a pretense of virtue, not a legacy to defend \u2013 or besmirch. \"We publish sex ads, like innumerable other places on the internet, so sue us\" is a better place to be now we are just pathetic, than it was when we used to be culturally important.</p> <p>Hence, the separation. On the one hand, the Voice's owners will continue to rake in the dough from the sex ad business over here, which, it being the web, really doesn't have anything to do with newspapers anyway. (The sex ad business may be called \"Backpage.com\", but there is nothing in front.) And then, over there, tongue comfortably in cheek, they'll \"sell\" \"control\" of the papers to some of their employees. Indeed, with what, one wonders, are the employees buying the papers, if not the owners' own money \u2013 get it?</p> <p>What the hell. In a world where everybody is playing loose with facts, inventing narratives, and pursuing self-interests, it seems like a reasonable solution.</p>",
  "<p>The news that the pupil premium is failing to be used as intended is unsurprising (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/20/ofsted-chief-warns-pupil-premium?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Pupil premium rises</a>, 22 September). Head teachers are under financial pressure and other priorities may seem more pressing. In the context of government cuts they are caught between a rock and a hard place. However it is not what parliament intended and cannot be defended. We will never know if the measure helps financially disadvantaged pupils if the money is not used for its intended purpose.</p> <p>There is also a deeper problem raised by <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/pupil-premium\" title=\"\">the Ofsted report</a>, centring on the role of the head teacher. Local management of schools is perfectly reasonable, but it has been taken to a level where school autonomy has superseded any form of regulation. David Laws says \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2012/sep/20/nick-clegg-apology-politics-live\" title=\"\">We're giving these schools the freedom to use the money as they think best</a>\", but this cannot be the case where money is voted for a specific purpose.</p> <p>The doctrine of school autonomy underpins the academy and free schools policy, where its effects on results is very dubious indeed. But on the spending of money there can be no case for total autonomy. The pupil premium should be ring-fenced immediately.<br><strong>Michael Bassey, Trevor Fisher </strong><em>Editor, Education Politics,</em><strong> Colin Richards</strong></p> <p>\u2022 While the chief inspector of Ofsted is correct to look at how schools spend their pupil premium, he'd do well to &#xa0;scrutinise the way exam boards penalise poorer students. Today I had yet another student move up an A-level grade after paying AQA the \u00a345 re-mark fee. In August another student paid AQA \u00a375 for an emergency re-mark. Her grade rocketed from an E to a B securing her university place. These grade changes almost never materialise because many families can ill-afford such charges. While charges are refunded if the marks increase, such inconsistencies in exam marking are unacceptable. The educational apartheid caused by these unwarranted fees masks another reason why the rich outperform the poor.<br><strong>Chris Thompson</strong><br><em>Christchurch, Dorset&#xa0;</em></p> <p>\u2022 Ofsted rightly raises concerns about whether the millions of pounds of pupil premium money is being spent effectively on raising the attainment of our most disadvantaged children. But arguments about whether head teachers or ministers are best placed to decide how this resource is spent miss the essential point, which is not who takes the decision but how the decision is made.</p> <p>It is robust, quality research, yielding independent evidence about what works in our classrooms, that must inform how the pupil premium is spent. Sometimes such research points towards counterintuitive and uncomfortable directions, such as questioning the benefit of reducing class sizes or the impact of teaching assistants, but neither heads nor ministers can be expected to know what works without reference to the proper evidence.</p> <p>Often this academic work is not easily accessible, and this is why a group of educationists with a passion for evidence-informed education are working to set up an independent and impartial <a href=\"http://www.cebenetwork.org/projects/education-media-centre-%E2%80%93-enhancing-use-evidence-media\" title=\"\">Education Media Centre</a>. <br><strong>Greg Dyke </strong><em>British Film Institute</em> <strong>John Dunford</strong>, <em>Whole Education</em> <strong>Jonathan Sharples </strong><em>Institute for Effective Education, University of York </em><strong>Estelle Morris, Sue Littlemore</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The government reports that maths test scores for 11-year-olds this year show that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/20/primary-school-pupils-sats-targets?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">84% of pupils have reached the required standard level 4</a>, the highest percentage ever (More primary school pupils hit Sats targets, 21 September). What is not reported is how much teaching time has been spent achieving these test scores, against the broad and balanced curriculum that the National Curriculum was set up to achieve.</p> <p>Between 1997 and 2007 my research team collected and reported on teaching times by subject for the government; in 2006 we published a report that showed that the time spent on \"teaching to the test\" for maths and English had exceeded half of the available teaching time each week (at the expense of the nine other subjects teachers were legally obliged to teach). The government immediately ceased collecting the teaching time data so now there is no constraint on schools reducing their curriculum provision to improve test scores. <br><strong>Professor Bill Boyle</strong><br><em>University of Manchester</em></p>",
  "<p>We could call it Romnesia: the ability of the very rich to forget the context in which they made their money. To forget their education, inheritance, family networks, contacts and introductions. To forget the workers whose labour enriched them. To forget the infrastructure and security, the educated workforce, the contracts, subsidies and bailouts the government provided.</p> <p>Every political system requires a justifying myth. The Soviet Union had Alexey Stakhanov, the miner reputed to have extracted 100 tonnes of coal in six hours. The US had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragged_Dick\" title=\"\">Richard Hunter</a>, the hero of Horatio Alger's rags-to-riches tales.</p> <p>Both stories contained a germ of truth. Stakhanov worked hard for a cause in which he believed, but his remarkable output was probably faked. When Alger wrote his novels, some poor people had become very rich in the US. But the further from its ideals (productivity in the Soviet Union's case, opportunity in the US) a system strays, the more fervently its justifying myths are propounded.</p> <p>As the developed nations succumb to extreme inequality and social immobility, the myth of the self-made man becomes ever more potent. It is used to justify its polar opposite: an unassailable rent-seeking class, deploying its inherited money to finance the seizure of other people's wealth.</p> <p>The crudest exponent of Romnesia is the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18187364\" title=\"\">Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart</a>. \"There is no monopoly on becoming a millionaire,\" she insists. \"If you're jealous of those with more money, don't just sit there and complain; do something to make more money yourselves \u2013 spend less time drinking or smoking and socialising and more time working \u2026 Remember our roots, and create your own success.\"</p> <p>Remembering her roots is what Rinehart fails to do. She forgot to add that if you want to become a millionaire \u2013 in her case a billionaire \u2013 it helps to inherit an iron ore mine and a fortune from your father and to ride a spectacular commodities boom. Had she spent her life lying in bed and throwing darts at the wall, she would still be stupendously rich.</p> <p>Rich lists are stuffed with people who either inherited their money or who made it through rent-seeking activities: by means other than innovation and productive effort. They're a catalogue of speculators, property barons, dukes, IT monopolists, loan sharks, bank chiefs, oil sheikhs, mining magnates, oligarchs and chief executives paid out of all proportion to any value they generate. Looters, in short. The richest mining barons are those to whom governments sold natural resources for a song. Russian, Mexican and British oligarchs acquired underpriced public assets through privatisation, and now run a toll-booth economy. Bankers use incomprehensible instruments to fleece their clients and the taxpayer. But as rentiers capture the economy, the opposite story must be told.</p> <p>Scarcely a Republican speech fails to reprise the Richard Hunter narrative, and almost all these rags-to-riches tales turn out to be bunkum. \"Everything that Ann and I have,\" Mitt Romney claims, \"we earned the old-fashioned way\". Old fashioned like Blackbeard, perhaps. Two searing exposures in Rolling Stone magazine document the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-20120829\" title=\"\">leveraged buyouts which destroyed viable companies, value and jobs, and the costly federal bailout</a> which saved Romney's political skin.</p> <p>Romney personifies economic parasitism. The financial sector has become a job-destroying, home-breaking, life-crushing machine, which impoverishes others to enrich itself. The tighter its grip on politics, the more its representatives must tell the opposite story: of life-affirming enterprise, innovation and investment, of brave entrepreneurs making their fortunes out of nothing but grit and wit.</p> <p>There is an obvious flip side to this story. \"Anyone can make it \u2013 I did without help\", translates as \"I refuse to pay taxes to help other people, as they can help themselves\": whether or not they inherited an iron ore mine from daddy. In the article in which she urged the poor to emulate her, Rinehart also proposed that the minimum wage should be reduced. Who needs fair pay if anyone can become a millionaire?</p> <p>In 2010, the richest 1% in the US captured an astonishing 93% of that year's gain in incomes. In the same year, corporate chief executives made, on average, 243 times as much as the median worker (in 1965 the ratio was 10 times lower). Between <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/was-greed-good/\" title=\"\">1970 and 2010</a>, the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, rose in the US from 0.35 to 0.44: an astounding leap.</p> <p>As for social mobility, of the rich countries listed by the OECD, the three in which men's earnings are most likely to resemble their father's are, in this order, <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/publicfinanceandfiscalpolicy/45002641.pdf\" title=\"\">the UK, Italy and the US</a>. If you are born poor or born rich in these nations, you are likely to stay that way. It is no coincidence that these three countries all promote themselves as lands of unparalleled opportunity.</p> <p>Equal opportunity, self-creation, heroic individualism: these are the myths that predatory capitalism requires for its political survival. Romnesia permits the ultra-rich both to deny the role of other people in the creation of their own wealth and to deny help to those less fortunate than themselves. A century ago, entrepreneurs sought to pass themselves off as parasites: they adopted the style and manner of the titled, rentier class.

  "<p>Rarely in history has the reaction to a politician's announcement been as utterly unanimous as that to the speech Portugal's conservative prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, gave a fortnight ago. In it, he had announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/portugal-u-turn-social-security?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">a rise in social security contributions</a> that would have instantly increased workers' payments by nearly two-thirds. What followed was a wave of outrage: political and business leaders, even members of his own party and last but not least the Portuguese public all vocally expressed their concern. On Friday, after an eight-hour state council meeting called by the president, An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, Passos Coelho finally gave in and dropped the rise.</p> <p>Optimists may say that the government U-turn will put a stop to the social unrest sparked by the hike, a measure that would have represented a significant salary cut for workers who have already seen massive cuts to their wages. For the prime minister the headache is far from over: the \u20ac78bn lent to the country by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/10433798\" title=\"\">troika</a> (European Commission, IMF and European Central Bank) will eventually have to be paid back. The government <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444813104578016043305870194.html\" title=\"\">has already announced that it is planning to raise more taxes</a> \u2013 who this affects will be known soon. But recent developments may dramatically change the political landscape in unexpected ways.</p> <p>A week ago, more than half a million people marched in cities across Portugal to protest against the government: they were the biggest protests since the end of the dictatorship in 1974. My generation, the so-called \"children of the revolution\", had never seen protests on such an overwhelming scale. The peaceful marches were a milestone in a country where people are not known for a protest culture. From left to right, from moderates to radicals, from young to old, from professional protesters to first-timers, it was an unmistakable warning shot for the government. Protests were scheduled even in wealthy Cascais, a coastal city near Lisbon famous for its upper-class demography.</p> <p>As Passos Coelho well knows, his predecessor, the socialist Jos\u00e9 Socrates, was forced to resign in spring 2011 after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/11/occupy-movement-global-weekend-action\" title=\"\">M12</a>, a protest organised through Facebook that took hundreds of thousands to the streets.</p> <p>The protests come a week after Passos Coelho wrote a post on Facebook addressing the public as \"friends\" and complaining how hard it had been for him to say what he had to say. That, coupled with a TV interview in which he criticised Portuguese who have lived \"beyond their means\", probably drove more people on to the streets than any opposition politician could have done.</p> <p>The new austerity measures were contested both by the left and the right \u2013 that wasn't new. What was different this time was the language in which it was condemned. Leading figures of Passos Coelho's party, such as the former finance minister Manuela Ferreira Leite, demolished the government's economic policy with harsh language, encouraging people to protest and MPs to vote against the annual budget.</p> <p>After the protests, Paulo Portas, leader of the minority coalition party CDS-PP, triggered a government crisis by publicly criticising the austerity measures. The meeting with the president on Friday was called in part to calm the waves between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_%28Portugal%29\" title=\"\">PSD</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_and_Social_Centre_%E2%80%93_People%27s_Party\" title=\"\">CDS</a> so as to not put the governing coalition at risk.</p> <p>The march had been organised on Facebook over the last few weeks, as a protest against the troika. It ended up as a huge outcry against the government. What does it mean for the future of Portuguese politics? Blindly following troika policies will become harder for Passos Coelho's government. It might also just mean that the Portuguese are finally engaging more with their country's politics.</p>",

Hmm.</p> <p>Laws is going to be quite powerful in the Liberal Democrats in the months and years ahead. Teather was responsible for early years and childcare, whereas Laws covers schools, but that's really just the start of his domain. He also has a \"roving brief\" looking out for Lib Dem interests across the whole department, and in addition is shadowing Tory policy minister Oliver Letwin, which means he is in charge of monitoring every aspect of coalition policy for the Lib Dems - except, he stresses, those that fall to Danny Alexander: the economy, energy and defence.</p> <p>But if he is powerful within the party, he seems less so within his department. Laws was asked a lot about the new ebacc, the qualification replacing GCSEs. He said Lib Dems had altered the policy beyond recognition compared to what it looked like when education secretary Michael Gove first floated it: \"I wouldn't say we tweaked the proposals. Compared to what was [originally] announced in the Daily Mail, this was a completely different set of proposals,\" he said.</p> <p>Lib Dems had also argued that more subjects than just English, maths and science needed to be brought under the ebacc umbrella: \"We don't want a second tier of qualifications which are important but which will be seen to left behind in a discredited brand.\" He would continue to argue for this, he said. \"I suspect the secretary of state doesn't see this as the final word on it.\" But it seemed that it would be Gove rather than Laws having that final word.</p> <p>Similarly, Laws said that despite the huge growth in academy schools, which exist outside local authority control and now make up more than half of all secondaries, there would always be a role for local authorities - but this seemed to be more his prediction than an announcement of the government's position. \"I don't think you can sensibly design an education system for the future for 23,500 schools that relies either on all the schools acting autonomously or some minister taking responsibility for 23,500 schools,\" he said. It was \"not practical\" for a minister to take responsibility for issues such as planning, transport and allocating capital at that local level.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he was \"far from starry-eyed about the role of local authorities in education in the past\", and it was down to Lib Dems to make the case for their new role with that in mind, Laws said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>David Laws at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/SyDdPFWr\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250273876041408512\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T16:41:57+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50609156c0e327c3f7c90521\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T16:59:06.248Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Alan Travis</strong> has sent me this from a fringe meeting.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord McNally, the last remaining member of Ken Clarke's ministry of justice team, was at a fringe meeting reflecting on Clarke's fate. \"The only benefit of Ken's departure is that the Liberal Democrats will stop giving all the credit to Ken Clarke for any liberal measure the Ministry of Justice takes and may start to give me some credit as well,\" he said.</p> <p>McNally said, somewhat unhappily, that the future in prisons and probation was more market testing, more outsourcing and more payment by results.

(See<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live?commentpage=1#block-5060712a58f9bdd2eeba0191\"> 2.06pm.)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19699652\"><strong>\u2022 Nick Clegg has rejected suggestions that he wants to soak the rich.</strong> </a>Although he has not given any details about his plan to introduce a new tax on wealth, beyond saying that the mansion tax is the Lib Dems' preferred model, he dismissed a Daily Mail report saying his proposals would clobber the middle classes. (See <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live#block-50602e8dc0e38ada80016340\">11.12pm.)</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have voted down a call for an economic Plan B.</strong> After a lively debate, during which Steve Webb, the pensions minister, said defeat for the leadership would panic the financial markets and lead to interest rates rising, an amendment to a growth motion that called for a Plan B was defeated by a large majority. Delegates then passed the motion, which criticised Conservatives for refusing to acknowledge that investing in carbon-reducing technologies could make an important contribution to growth.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Jeremy Browne, the Home Office minister, has said that the Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell should explain what he actually said to the police.</strong> While other Liberal Democrats have said little about the Mitchell affair because the party does not want it to distract attention from its conference, Browne said Mitchell's morning apology did not go far enough.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think people want to know what was said. Explaining to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what was said.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have voted for a motion saying the speed limit in urban areas should be cut to 20mph. </strong>Under the plan, all new roads would have a 20mph limit and the government would encourage councils to switch from 30mph to 20mph on existing roads.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have backed a motion urging the government to increase the science budget by 3% above inflation for the next 15 years.</strong> Julian Huppert, the MP who moved the motion, said: \"Britain has a proud history of leading the world in science - innovations from British researchers have changed our planet and our way of life. But we are in danger of losing our reputation as a world leader in research and development. We are in danger of limiting our access to vital technological developments and the benefits they bring.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dems have committed themselves to campaign for measures to promote John Lewis-style mutual businesses.</strong> As the Press Association reports, they backed proposals which would give workers in publicly listed firms with more than 250 employees the right to request an employee share scheme. The policy would also give greater opportunities for workers to buy out a firm if its owners put it up for sale or to pick up shares at a discount if their firm goes public.</p> <p>That's all from me for today.

Reeves declared that \u2018out of necessity, as well as principle, we can\u2019t be a party of the centre left anymore\u2019. Jeremy Browne, the Home Office minister and one of the leading Orange Book liberals, said that \u2018there\u2019s now no need for lazy, leftwing oppositionist people to vote Liberal Democrat as they can now vote Labour\u2019.</p> <p>The implication of all this is that, like Viking warriors, the Liberal Democrats have burnt their boats on the beach by entering government, and now need to make a success of it and stick with Clegg. There\u2019s undoubtedly some truth to this. But the leadership murmurings will continue as long as the polls suggest that Vince Cable would boost the party\u2019s poll ratings.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/09/24/clegg-least-popular-party-leader-foot/\">\u2022 Peter Kellner at YouGov looks at Nick Clegg's poll ratings and suggests the Lib Dems will have to replace him before the general election.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After Mr Brown discovered that his remark about Gillian Duffy had been caught on a microphone he wrongly thought was off, he dashed round to her house and told her how sorry he was. The next day we asked people about this apology. Just 26% said it was genuine, while 56% thought it was not. In our latest poll for the Sunday Times, we asked the same question about Mr Clegg\u2019s apology. This time, 40% told us it was genuine, while 35% disagreed.</p> <p>That is where the good news ends. 41% think his apology makes him look weaker, while just 21% think it makes him look stronger. Only 5% say his apology will make them more likely to vote Lib Dem at the next election, while 15% say it makes them less likely. No wonder Lib Dem support is so low \u2013 just 8% in our post-apology poll \u2013 while Mr Clegg himself has slumped to his worst-ever rating. Having risen briefly (after the first leaders\u2019 debate on TV in April 2010) to become more popular than Churchill, he is now Britain\u2019s least popular main-party leader since Michael Foot.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://markreckons.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/interview-with-nick-clegg-part-one.html\">\u2022 Nick Clegg tells Mark Thompson in an interview for his blog that the war on drugs has been a failure.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m at the Liberal Democrat end of this debate in that I start from an assumption that the so-called war on drugs is a spectacular failure and that we\u2019ve got to be driven by evidence, not prejudice nor dogma.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/daily-mails-bizarre-attack-cleggs-tax-plan\">\u2022 George Eaton at the Staggers saying people earning more than \u00a350,000 are not representative of the middle class.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the Office for National Statistics <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/ashe-results-2011/ashe-statistical-bulletin-2011.html\">reported</a> last year, the median full-time UK salary is \u00a326,200. Those who earn at least twice as much (as only 10% do) are not, despite the <em>Mail's</em> protestations, entirely representative of the country's middle class. Nor are those whose homes are worth than \u00a31m (as just 3.1% of properties are) easily identifiable as standard bearers of the \"squeezed middle\". Yet nowhere in its account of the deputy prime minister's holy war against the \"middle class\" does the <em>Mail </em>find room for such details.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/random-conference-observations-from-an-new-old-grouch-30368.html\">\u2022 Peter Walter at Liberal Democrat Voice gives his verdict on the speeches he has heard at the conference.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T16:56:06.806Z\">at 5.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50607f1cc0e327c3f7c90517\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T15:41:18.447Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Alexander Q&amp;A is over.

This is yet another government policy thrown into uncertainty by bickering in government before it has even got off the ground.</p> <p>A major problem with the government\u2019s previous failed schemes to get lending going to businesses, including Project Merlin and credit easing, was that they relied on the banks themselves getting money out of the door, without any real safeguards to ensure this happened. It is far from clear that Vince Cable\u2019s business bank will be immune from these shortcomings.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Vince Cable concentrated on the key issue of the moment - growth. It is always tempting for politicians to play to their conference gallery, and I am pleased that Vince's speech went to the heart of the growth debate.</p> <p>A new-style boutique, government-backed bank for growth firms can bring something new to the business lending toolkit. The big gripe today from many growth businesses is a gap in the market for long-term investment finance. The new \u00a31bn wholesale fund will enable banks to provide \u201cpatient capital\u201d to high growth businesses.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Longworth</strong>, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The business bank announced by Vince Cable could be one of the lasting legacies of this government, and a key pillar of UK competitiveness in the years to come. While a \u00a31bn commitment is an important first step, Whitehall must ensure that the business bank gets off the ground with an independent mandate and a mission to support growing companies.</p> <p>Six in 10 chamber members told us just last week that they would feel more confident in securing finance if Britain had a government-backed business bank. Commercial banks should have a first right of refusal, but, as we have argued before, the business bank will eventually need the infrastructure to make its own decisions on loans, and its own channels to deliver funds to growing businesses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T14:46:18.888Z\">at 3.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5060674158f9bdd2eeba018a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:59:30.152Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Guardian video from the Cable speech.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"Vince Cable unveils \u00a31bn backing for business bank - video\"                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/sep/24/vince-cable-1bn-business-bank-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506062ae58f9bdd2eeba0187\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:39:58.529Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-237eb050-fe8e-481d-b571-25f2b153181c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348493964288/d5052b6a-50eb-4789-a5eb-6d435c7c9591-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson, Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg, Lorely Burt, and Vince Cable vote on a policy motion.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Swinson, Danny Alexander, Nick Clegg, Lorely Burt and Vince Cable vote on a policy motion.

This is from my colleague, the Observer's <strong>Daniel Boffey.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A presentation by Rick Nye from pollsters Populus is painting a far from pretty picture for the party. Apart from the slide behind Ukip, as recorded by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/22/observer-launches-opinium-observer-poll\">Observer/Opinum poll</a> this weekend, there are few signs of hope. Over half of people (57%) in September 2009 believed the Lib Dems were honest and principled. That's now down to 32%. More significantly, their time in government hasn't seen an improvement in people's perception of the party's credibility \u2013 far from it. Two in five (44%) in 2009 believed the party was competent and capable but that is now down to one in five (21%). Around two in five believe the party has made a difference and are<br> responsible, slightly up on 2009. But still only a third (32%) believe coalition governments are strong and decisive, marking a small slide from three years ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Daniel has one other nugget.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The discussions also covered Liberal Democrat policy and its failures and successes in the field of civil liberties.

Other parties such as Labour were even more opportunistic, he claimed.</p> <p>A female delegate took him to task for the tuition fees claim. She said that far from it being opportunistic, \"that was the strong feeling of a majority of the party who voted for that policy because they believed it\".</p> <p>Ashdown said he tried to get the party to abandon that policy in 1999 \"but you smashed me into the ground\". He backed Nick Clegg's point that the Lib Dems should have been honest about what was realistic.</p> <p>Ashdown also poured scorn on the polling evidence presented by Populus at the meeting (bad for the Lib Dems in every way), saying that \"anybody who predicts the future from the mid-term polls is talking nonsense \u2026 If you ask people what they're going to do on a wet Saturday afternoon half way through a parliament they usually give the sitting government a kicking.\"</p> <p>He added that \"unpopularity is the price of doing difficult but necessary things \u2026 There's no point in being a liberal if you're a cosy little herbivore.\"</p> <p>Clegg, he said, was \"the best party leader we have had for 100 years, myself included, well, maybe not - yes!\"</p> <p>And he added: \"Do I love the Tories? No I don't. I hate the Tories!\" before taking that back: \"I can't hate anyone; I'm a liberal.\" Nevertheless he had harsh words for the mayor of London, noting: \"Old Boris Johnson is more popular than David Cameron - doesn't mean to say he'd be good as a prime minister, guys - absolutely not.\"</p> <p>And in case you were wondering, yes, Ashdown did repeat his well-worn line that he is \"the only party leader ever represented in the opinion polls by an asterisk, denoting that no discernible support could be found\".</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Populus polling at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/IX6QlGSi\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214162960097281\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T12:44:41+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Populus polling at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/3EcuqWB8\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/250214405227282432\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T12:45:38+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50605c17c0e327c3f7c90501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:11:51.152Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's <strong>Paddy Ashdown</strong> on Nick Clegg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itmpYw15sxc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:27:15.990Z\">at 2.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50604db558f9bdd2eeba017e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T13:06:29.587Z\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Vince Cable's speech - summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Vince Cable</strong> enjoys writing and his speeches often contain relatively subtle messages. That was certainly true of this one, which was ostensibly about growth and the economy, but actually read like the opening bid in the coalition negotiations for 2015.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Vince Cable predicted that the next election would result in a hung parliament and he insisted that the Lib Dems would be able to work with either of the two main parties in the national interest.</strong> At least, that's how I read Cable's peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After over two years in government we are battle hardened but certainly not war weary. None of us knows exactly how it will end. But we all know we must fight the next general election as a totally independent, national, credible challenger for power.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe actually that the British people will want to entrust their future to any one party next time. If Britain wants sustainable growth, competence with compassion, fairness with freedom and more equality, not ever greater division, then that government must have Liberal Democrats at its heart.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cable joked about the reports that he has exchanged text messages with Ed Miliband - \"I have good communications with politicians across the political spectrum,\" he said - and his speech indicated a willingness to work with Labour as well as the Tories. He had this to say about Ed Balls.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our critics on the left say \u2013 \u201ccut more slowly\u201d. The government has already extended the period to eliminate the structural deficit from four to six years. Yet Ed Balls says: \u201cWorkers of the world unite. We need a Plan B. We should not cut the deficit in six years but seven\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>That sounds like a jibe, but actually he is saying that there is little difference between Balls's policies and the government's. And Cable was quite positive about George Osborne too. Earlier Danny Alexander (Osborne's Treasury deputy) opened a debate on a motion criticising the Tories (and, by implication, Osborne) over green policies. But Cable was quite complimentary.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When we came into government we had to balance competing risks: of aggravating the economic downturn through excessive cuts versus the risk of losing the confidence of lenders. I believe we struck the right balance and adopted a deficit reduction plan. I make no apology for my continued support for that fiscal discipline.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cable said the Lib Dems would not let slow growth lead to further spending cuts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The central point is that the country must not get stuck on a downward escalator where slow or no growth means bigger deficits leading to more cuts and even slower growth. That is the way to economic disaster and political oblivion. We will not let that happen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He launched a strong attack on the banks, accusing them of being \"anti-business\" in the past.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our leading banks are often anti-business, especially anti-small business. They threw traditional relationship banking over the side and sold useless insurance and dodgy derivatives instead.</p> <p>Public anger at the greed and stupidity in this industry will continue for a long time. But I am looking forward to, and I want to work with the new generation of sensible bankers to support the real economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that, without the Lib Dems, the Conservative would not have agreed to support the Vickers proposals to divide investment banking from retail banking.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He confirmed that the government would set up a British business bank.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am working with the chancellor to develop a new institution that will combine a billion pounds of new government capital with a larger private sector contribution. This will apply leverage through guarantees to support up to \u00a310bn of finance to small and mid-sized business \u2013 a significant portion of all the lending currently available.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the World at One just now, when asked if the \u00a31bn would be a one-off investment or an annual one, he said it would start as a one-off payment \"for the moment\".</p> <p>He would not say when it would launch, but said he hoped to get it operating quite quickly.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked \"head bangers\" on the Tory right who wanted the government to allow no-fault dismissal.</strong> This was a reference to the so-called \"fire at will\" plan in the Beecroft report.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have seen off the \u2018head bangers\u2019 who want a hire and fire culture and seem to find sacking people an aphrodisiac: totally irrelevant in a country with flexible labour markets which have created over a million private sector jobs in the last two years.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked Labour, saying that under Tony Blair it lost its soul.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour can still be a ruthless political machine. But it used to be a lot more than that. It once had a soul and new ideas. Then we had 13 years of rootless New Labour. A hard-earned reputation for economic competence disappeared under the rubble of collapsing banks. Their party\u2019s long-standing commitment to individual freedoms was buried in a graveyard of civil liberties. Principled foreign policy was laid to rest in Iraq. They have scarcely begun the long march back from there.</p> </blockquote> <p>What's interesting about this is that he was not dismissing the party in an unqualified way, and he seemed to express a desire for Labour to change.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He reaffirmed his call for a mansion tax.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know some of you hanker after a Hollande-style assault on top incomes. But we know that very high marginal rates of income tax are counter-productive. If I were advising Monsieur Hollande, I would recommend a \u2018chateau tax\u2019 \u2013 for those of us who never even managed a dumbed-down GCSE in French, that means a \u2018mansion tax\u2019. Core Lib Dem policy. A first step to the proper taxation of wealth and land. It horrifies the Tory backwoodsmen, but it is popular and right.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his World at One interview, Cable told Martha Kearney that she would be \"surprised\" how many Conservatives had an open mind about the mansion tax idea. Asked about whether George Osborne would support it, Cable said that he still had \"some persuasion to do\" but that Osborne was \"an intelligent man who sees the pros and cons\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He mocked Andrew Mitchell, making a joke about being a pleb.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now I don't know what Boris and Dave got up to in Eton. Perhaps a pillow fight got out of control in the dormitories. I have been told, however, that jokes about social class are not good for the unity of the coalition. But as a mere pleb, I couldn't resist it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cable paid tribute to Clegg's leadership.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of our central aims as Liberal Democrats is to show that coalitions work. And Nick Clegg\u2019s major contribution as leader is to do just that. At a time of crisis, coalition government was and is still the only way forward \u2013 and it required considerable political courage from Nick to make it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cable said Clegg's contribution \"is to do just that\", but the text released to journalists in advance was not quite so loyal. It quoted Cable as saying Clegg's contribution \"has been to do just that\".</p> <p>I've described the speech as the opening bid in the coalition negotiations for 2015.

It says the Lib Dems are concerned by:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The refusal of the Conservatives to acknowledge that investing in carbon-reducing technologies has the potential to make an important contribution to long-term growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>That means Alexander is inviting the Lib Dems to vote for a motion criticising his boss.</p> <p>Second, this debate will show whether Lib Dem members actually support the government's economic policy. There are two amendments, and although the first, proposed by Ed Randall and Linda Jack, looks relatively innocuous, it would knock four words out of the original one. Those four words are \"within its fiscal mandate\", and so it is effectively telling the government to rip up Plan A and adopt Plan B.</p> <p>In his speech, Alexander urged delegates to reject this.</p> <p>We will get the vote at about 12.15pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T10:28:04.490Z\">at 11.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50602e8dc0e38ada80016340\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T10:12:16.635Z\">11.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nick Clegg's interviews - summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to <strong>Nick Clegg</strong>. He did several interviews this morning and, although he spent quite a lot of time talking about Andrew Mitchell (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live#block-5060058058f90bd4c3fd4ab0\">8.02am</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live#block-5060088e58f90bd4c3fd4ab2\">8.15am</a>), there was also quite a lot on Lib Dem politics. Here are the main points. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Clegg rejected suggestions that his call for a new tax on the wealthy meant that he was determined to \"soak the middle class\".</strong> He was responding to<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2207618/Lib-Dem-conference-2012-Nick-Clegg-wants-hit-millions-earning-50k-higher-tax-bills.html?openGraphAuthor=%2Fhome%2Fsearch.html%3Fs%3D%26authornamef%3DJames%2BChapman&amp;videoPlayerURL=http%3A%2F%2Fc.brightcove.com%2Fservices%2Fviewer%2Ffederated_f9%3FisVid%3D1%26isUI%3D1%26publisherID%3D1418450360%26playerID%3D72484359001%26domain%3Dembed%26videoId%3D&amp;hasBCVideo=true&amp;BCVideoID=1857481223001\"> the Daily Mail splash, which is headlined today - Clegg: Soak the middle class.</a> Asked if this was accurate, Clegg (who has attacked Daily Mail reporting in the past) said it wasn't.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you are referring to a Daily Mail headline. It won't surprise [you] that I'm not going to do what the Daily Mail is suggesting. We are not planning to soak anybody.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if those earning more than \u00a350,000 would pay more tax in the way that the Mail was suggesting, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You will not be soaked in the way that the Daily Mail [is suggesting].</p> </blockquote> <p>He stressed that those earning more than \u00a350,000 were earning well above the national average.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said a mansion tax was still the Lib Dems' preferred means of getting more tax out of the wealthy.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our focus does remain on very high value property for the simple reason that I think most people in this country just don\u2019t understand why people who have very high value properties just don\u2019t pay their fair share, in the way that everybody does.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 He claimed that there was a \"dividing line\" in politics between those who wanted extra tax revenue to come from the rich and those who wanted it to come from the poor.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I'm saying is that there's a big dividing line in British politics between people who, when asked to reach to make more savings, immediately ask the poorest to make more savings and [those who think the opposite].</p> </blockquote> <p>This was interesting because it implies that the Lib Dems and Labour are on one side of a dividing line, while the Tories are on the other.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that many rich people accepted that it was fair to ask them to pay more.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My experience is people, decent fair-minded folk who are earning far, far more than the national average understand that they do need to make a fair contribution because that's what the nation demands right now.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He defended Vince Cable's right not to rule out standing for the Lib Dem leadership at some point in the future.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think any politician should start ruling out doing anything well into the future ... Of course, Vince is entirely right and entitled to say what he says about his own feelings about politics and about his future.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Clegg said that in future political parties would increasingly distinguish between manifesto policies which were priorities and those which were not.</strong> They would identify which policies they would \"die in the ditch for\", and which were \u201csubject to circumstances and resources and so on\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that distinction is one that parties will increasingly have to make in British politics as we move towards greater plurality and more coalitions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T10:26:54.456Z\">at 11.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50602616c0e38ada8001633b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T09:21:26.291Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne is not willing to draw a line under the Andrew Mitchell affair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/robindbrant/status/250162546676477952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Lib dem home off min Jeremy Browne adds to pressure on Mitchell, tells bbc still 'loose ends to be tied up'.</p>&mdash; Robin Brant (@robindbrant) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robindbrant/status/250162546676477952\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-24T09:19:33+00:00\">September 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5060240cc0e38ada80016339\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T09:12:44.162Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Paul Owen has written<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/business-bank-vince-cable-thick-of-it\"> a lovely blog about the similarities between Saturday's episode of The Thick of It and today's British business bank announcement from Vince Cable. </a>Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Saturday's episode of The Thick of It saw the show's Lib Dem surrogates - junior minister Fergus and his adviser Adam - bumble their way into accidentally agreeing to a pretty young female economist's proposal of a \u00a32bn micro-bank to \"set up a network of micro-credit lenders at neighbourhood level\" to help businesses such as \"sisters who want to set up a pop-up baker's in a disused travel agents\". Cable's bank is not quite as hip as that, helping only \"the manufacturers, exporters and high-growth companies that power our economy\", and while The Thick of It's bank is funded by a Robin Hood tax which will \"steal from the fat cats and raise enough seed capital for hundreds of start-up funds for fledgling businesses\", the business secretary's will be paid for by \"underspends\" in Whitehall departments.</p> <p>Nevertheless, although Cable is unlikely to echo Adam's verdict that the idea is \"so fucking us it's brilliant\" when he addresses the Lib Dem conference today, he could do a lot worse than copy Fergus's description of the bank as \"a helping hand for hands-on people - making sure the can-doers don't get canned.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506021ad58f90bd4c3fd4ac2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-24T09:08:48.619Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some of the more interesting Lib Dem stories and articles in the papers today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9561957/Never-mind-all-those-badgers-weve-got-to-save-the-Cleggster.html\">\u2022 Boris Johnson in the Daily Telegraph defends Nick Clegg, saying he is a natural Tory.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Quick, before it is too late.

According to one reliable analyst, the ratings of the Lib Dem leader are currently standing at minus 62 per cent \u2013 lower than Osama bin Laden. Expert after expert steps forward to give the Deputy PM a kick in the pants, and the overwhelming view is that he should be defenestrated before the next election. He is not just toxic for the Libs, say these pundits \u2013 he is contaminating the entire Coalition. Some talk of Vince Cable replacing him, some of Ed Davey.</p> <p>So in the dwindling months we have available, it is time for us Clegg fans to echo those kindly folk who are trying to save the sweet furry badgers from the wrath of farmers.

They'd be unlikely to get the necessary two-thirds majority, but a simple numerical one would be such a stinging rejection of Clegg that he would have to resign. Then, the argument goes, the party could find a different leader (probably Cable, as a stopgap) for the 2015 election, and save as many seats as possible.</p> <p>Usually, we're told that conference plots are fantasies, and we should concentrate on the policies. Well, this time round, it's the other way about.

  "<p>Lovers and children, men and monsters and the artist himself appear in <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2011/03/thomas_schutte.html\" title=\"\">Thomas Sch\u00fctte's new exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London</a>. Here he is, a young student in&nbsp;1975, long-haired, pensive, eyes downcast behind his aviator glasses. One of 20 self-portraits he painted while a student of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2011/oct/12/gerhard-richter-tate-modern-retrospective\" title=\"\">Gerhard Richter</a>, Sch\u00fctte reworked the same photographic image, gridding it up and rehearsing his own face wearing the same expression, over the course of a summer month.</p> <p>A sort of memento of lost time, the youthful portrait shares a room with a sunken-cheeked, heavy-browed and bearded old man. This fanciful 2011 bronze head on its tilted plinth, titled Memorial for Unknown Artist, might also be a kind of self-portrait, throwing up his hands in warning or exasperation at his younger self. Who is this old, patinated green geezer: an ancient god, a projection of the artist in an imagined old age? The raised forearms and hands, smooth as rubber gloves, measure the void. He is almost funny, like <a href=\"http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-bill-nighy-is-davy-jones-in-pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-worlds-end\" title=\"\">Bill Nighy's squid-faced captain</a> in Pirates of the Caribbean. Almost, but not quite.</p> <p>Sch\u00fctte's show is full of such uncomfortable surprises and dualities, different registers of touch and feeling. This is to be expected of an artist whose output is enormously varied. Ranging from architectural models and actual buildings, to diaristic watercolours, observational drawings and sculptures, Sch\u00fctte's variety could be bewildering, and larger exhibitions often attempt to present an overview. The Serpentine, and a concurrent, related exhibition at London's <a href=\"http://www.frithstreetgallery.com/\" title=\"\">Frith Street Gallery</a>, focus almost entirely on human presence: heads, figures and the artist himself.</p> <p>Even with this focus, Sch\u00fctte's work is full of invention. A whole room is devoted to imaginary bronze heads, each on a little shelf. Think of <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=hv8&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;biw=1454&amp;bih=960&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=ar60zasVJwhTbM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.stephengdewyer.com/Cynicism_in_Honore-Victorin_Daumiers_Caricatures_of_Nineteenth_Century_Paris.html&amp;docid=cZ2pHh7bBuDBuM&amp;imgurl=http://www.stephengdewyer.com/Images_StephenGDewyer.com/Writing%252520Illustrations/Cynicism%252520in%252520Honore-Victorin%252520Daumier%2527s%252520Caricatures%252520of%252520Nineteenth%252520Century%252520Paris/Figure%2525203.jpg&amp;w=500&amp;h=375&amp;ei=MFBgULueBsOZhQfO2YBo&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=335&amp;sig=104594091292268369520&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=143&amp;tbnw=191&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=39&amp;ved=1t:429,r:5,s:0,i:86&amp;tx=62&amp;ty=65\" title=\"\">Honor\u00e9 Daumier's caricatures</a>, Picasso, <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/09/30/the-heads-of-franz-xaver-messerschmidt/\" title=\"\">Franz Xaver Messerschmidt</a>: Sch\u00fctte riffs on both art and on the lump, on material and meaning. These heads are called Wichte, or Jerks, and they're just the kinds of jerks you might avoid in a bar. \"Hair, feet, hands, they're a nightmare!\" Sch\u00fctte joked to me last week, though I don't think he was really joking.</p> <p>Look more closely and you see that Sch\u00fctte is also riffing on basic problems and opportunities: how to form noses, or eyes in their sockets, eyebrows, ears, hair, character and expression. He has no set method, approaching each anew.</p> <p>One head appears to be sleeping. She glows with a strangely indeterminate colour: layers of lacquer have been applied to the aluminium cast by the specialists who pimp up motorcycle fairings and tanks with layers of sprayed colour, giving this smooth, tender face and her crunchy impasto hair an otherworldly quality. She seems to come from the future. In fact, she is Walser's Wife, an imagined portrait of the wife of the great German-Swiss writer of \"micro-fictions\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/14/berlin-stories-robert-walser-review\" title=\"\">Robert Walser</a>.</p> <p>Sch\u00fctte's works, too, might be seen as micro-fictions \u2013 moments rather than stories, each from a different sculpted or drawn world. Another head sleeps, resting on her cheek, a little lumpen tear bulging beneath her eye. Look at the braidedness of her bronze hair, the malleable directness of the sculpted flower in her hair. There is an idea of beauty here, and beauty in art is immeasurably difficult. This sculpture could be kitsch, but isn't. Somehow, Sch\u00fctte manages to undermine the form, giving it a twist. I stand there and think, how dare he?</p> <p>Then there come monsters and weird beings. Surrounded by black-and-white photographs of babyish, malevolent, ghostly heads, from a series of small Fimo sculptures the artist made in the&nbsp;1990s, stands Father State or Vater Staat, a looming, rust-coloured, almost&nbsp;four-metre tall and deliberately inexpressive figure in a voluminous robe and hat. An implacable patriarch, he is like a figure from an undiscovered civilisation, or an unbending father from a scary puppet theatre, commanding the Serpentine's central gallery with an iron (or in this case steel) will.</p> <p>The contrast with Sch\u00fctte's rows of drawings and watercolours could not be greater, but again we see a whole gamut of approaches, though his drawings and prints are invariably more personal. For a long time, Sch\u00fctte has drawn himself, using a mirror, or simply working over his own reflection on an etching plate with a drypoint needle; he has followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney\" title=\"\">David Hockney</a> (and Ingres) in his <a href=\"http://painting.about.com/od/oldmastertechniques/ss/camera_lucida_5.htm\" title=\"\">use of a camera lucida</a>, a drawing device that projects a reflected image on to a surface. Here he is again and again, staring into a little round glass as though through a porthole, unsmiling and focused, somehow other than himself. Other sitters come and go: an ex-girlfriend, his daughter, his son nodding off in a chair. There is a great deal of tenderness. The strokes are sometimes delicate and precise, sometimes looser.</p> <p>The inverted reflection in Sch\u00fctte's camera lucida is only ever a starting point, and often he doesn't use it at all. A terrific draughtsman, he is an inventor rather than a copyist. There are faint, perspicacious pencil lines, quick swipes of fatty black ink, lively, confident portraits, bright washes and stuff erupting from the paper that makes you want to back off a pace or two: a toothy Halloween head, a faded swan that turns into Hitler (replete with snaggly little swastika), bleak drawings from the artist's debilitating bouts of depression, funny images that seem to be drawn in code.</p> <p>Over at Frith Street Gallery, there is a series of drawings of flowers, wan little images of limp decay. There's almost nothing to them, but they make my stomach drop. And here, too, are some of the most extreme sculptures I have seen by the artist, huge men with staves, based on small sculptures (so small, the men wear bottle-caps for hats), but computer-scanned, enlarged and cut from laminated wood, stained brown. For all the directness of his drawing, Sch\u00fctte employs highly sophisticated techniques to enlarge his sculptures. Outside the Serpentine stand a pair of his United Enemies \u2013 originally small modelling clay, cloth and bamboo sculptures that sat under bell jars, now battling bronzes, pairs of bound-together figures that rear over us, roped together in conflict.</p> <p>Just blowing things up doesn't make them better. Sch\u00fctte knows this. As a ceramicist, he also knows how to use the accidents of glazes, and how sculptures can slump or break in the kiln. The question is, how to take advantage of such accidents. This is true even in drawing \u2013 a slip of the pen, a line that careers off on its own unwilled way. Such unpremeditated things are often where the art is. \"You don't make art,\" Sch\u00fctte observed when we spoke last week. \"You find it.\"</p>",
  "<p>The police barricades are up and the traffic has begun to congeal across midtown Manhattan as more than 120 world leaders make their annual pilgrimage to the UN headquarters to declaim, appeal, cajole and sometimes threaten each other.</p> <p>It is seldom an edifying spectacle but the mood this year is so sour it is being compared to the cold war.</p> <p>The root of the bitterness lies in the worsening Syrian conflict, which has divided the security council to the point of paralysis along familiar faultlines. Russia and China have vetoed three resolutions in a row aimed at curbing the slaughter, and the council has not even been able to agree on humanitarian relief.</p> <p>The conflict is already spilling over Syria's borders, at a time when another Middle East conflict, possibly with even darker consequences, is constantly threatening to break out between Israel and Iran. Binyamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are both in New York this week to deliver speeches more likely to stoke than soothe the gathering fear of war. The world's powers have no coherent response.</p> <p>France's UN ambassador, G\u00e9rard Araud, setting the scene at the UN Turtle Bay headquarters before this week's general assembly, said the security council \"has never been as paralysed as it is today since the end of the cold war\".</p> <p>The key players are distancing themselves from the unfolding debacle. Vladimir Putin and Hu Jintao are not coming at all. Barack Obama is expected to make a \"drive-by\" appearance, with a stern speech on Tuesday very much with UN-averse American voters in mind. He will not stick around for lunch or for the customary round of bilateral meetings with other leaders, leaving that to Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Even the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, normally a byword for courtesy and euphemism, is expected to issue an impatient rebuke to the global statesmen in the chamber for their fecklessness when he opens the session. Aides are describing the address as \"no more Mr Nice Guy\".</p> <p>If there was ever a moment for speaking out, this is probably it. The security council is no stranger to impasse, but seldom has the deadlock come at such a high human cost. The death toll in Syria by UN estimates is 20,000 and climbing sharply, and 1.5 million civilians, probably far more, have fled their homes.</p> <p>Abeer Etefa, a World Food Programme officer who visited Homs and other areas last week, said: \"People are constantly on the move. Some have moved two or three times trying to escape the violence. There are 35 people in an apartment in some places, living in places with no doors or windows. They badly need blankets and baby milk.\"</p> <p>Leila Zerrougui, the UN special representative on children in conflict, warned the security council last week that children were suffering disproportionately, saying UN agencies had \"documented government attacks on schools, children denied access to hospitals, girls and boys suffering and dying in bombardments of their neighbourhoods and also being subject to torture, including sexual violence\".</p> <p>Human Rights Watch has reported that government forces appear to be deliberately targeting bread queues, citing 10 cases of artillery bombardment or air strikes outside bakeries in Aleppo province in August alone.</p> <p>Reporting by human rights groups and the UN itself has consistently found that the overwhelming majority of atrocities in the Syrian conflict have been committed by forces loyal to the president, Bashar al-Assad, although abuses by the fragmented rebel groups are also on the rise as the conflict spirals.</p> <p>In the face of clear evidence of abuses by the Syrian regime, however, both Russia and China have adamantly refused to support any security council resolutions that pressure Assad, even when the wording excludes military action. They are also not prepared to discuss authorising an international criminal court investigation into the war crimes committed by all sides.</p> <p>Even after Zerrougui gave her chilling briefing last week on the killing and torture of children, the response of the Russians and Chinese, together with Pakistan and Azerbaijan, was to seek (unsuccessfully) to restrict the scope of the UN envoy's inquiries and to refuse to back an annual resolution condemning the use of child soldiers and the deaths of children in conflict. Michael Williams, who served both as UN special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process and for Lebanon, said: \"I hope that in the margins in New York there would be some possibility to engage with the Russians and Chinese, but I'm not going to hold my breath.\"</p> <p>There are many factors underpinning Moscow and Beijing's hard line. Damascus has long been a Russian ally, and a buyer of Russian arms. The Syrian port of Tartus is the only Russian military base outside the former Soviet Union and its sole foothold in the Mediterranean. Both Russia and China feel badly burned by allowing security council resolution 1973 to pass in March 2011 authorising \"all necessary measures\" to protect Libyan civilians, which was then used by Nato as a mandate to help topple Muammar Gaddafi.</p> <p>The ghosts of the 2003 Iraq invasion and the furious debates that preceded it still hang in the air. Even though it was not fought on humanitarian grounds but rather on spurious claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the fiasco and subsequent US and British attempts to justify it helped reverse what was arguably one of the great moral advances of the post-cold-war era: the UN-backed principle that the international community had the \"responsibility to protect\" civilian populations when their own states were unable or unwilling to.</p> <p>\"The whole concept of responsibility to protect has been forgotten and no one among the statesmen here has the courage to utter the words,\" Williams said.</p> <p>He also criticised the west for giving up on diplomacy in the face of Russian and Chinese resistance. \"Even compared with the old cold war days, there doesn't seem to be much active diplomacy to engage Russia and China. And there is a complete absence of the EU as a political actor,\" Williams said.</p> <p>\"The tragedy is that the security council has not given diplomacy a chance in the case of Syria,\" Mark Malloch Brown, a former UN deputy secretary general, said. He argued that a tentative deal between the west, Russia and China in Geneva in June \u2013 by which the specific demand for Assad to step down was omitted in favour of the backing for a new government in Damascus by \"mutual consent\" \u2013 could have provided the basis for a settlement.</p> <p>\"There was a road map forward,\" Malloch Brown said, adding that the US, Britain and France \"got caught up in the theology\" of trying to pass a \"chapter 7\" involving sanctions, and so divided the security council once again. Western diplomats counter that the Assad regime has shown it would use any agreement not enforced by sanctions as cover to buy time and intensify its counter-insurgency.</p> <p>Wherever the exact balance of blame lies, it is directed at the major powers in the security council rather than the UN as an institution. UN agencies such as the high commission for refugees and the World Food Programme are widely agreed to have performed as well as could be expected in Syria, hampered by severe restrictions on access and a critical lack of emergency funding from donors.</p> <p>However, Richard Gowan, an expert on the UN at New York University, said the security council had been effective on other fronts.</p> <p>\"The paradox is that while the council has been paralysed over Syria, it has worked pretty efficiently on other issues this year. It has headed off a war between Sudan and South Sudan, and has provided a lot of co-ordination of peacekeeping operations in Africa. In Libya, it has helped the creation of the post-Gaddafi state,\" Gowan said, adding that, notwithstanding the ominous echoes over Syria: \"We are not back in the cold war.\"</p> <p>But he admitted: \"Everything else is absolutely overshadowed by Syria. Let there be no doubt that for many countries the Syrian crisis is really corroding high-level trust in the security council. And what is really looming on the horizon is a crisis over Iran.\"</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/03/ukcrime.sophielancaster\" title=\"\">Sophie Lancaster</a> was a 20-year-old goth with dreadlocked hair. On 11 August 2007, she and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, went to talk to a group of teenagers in Stubbylee park in Bacup. The group turned on them. As she tried to protect Maltby from their assault, Lancaster was kicked so viciously that her face was left imprinted with the shape of a metal star from the end of some trainer laces. She never regained&nbsp;consciousness.</p> <p>First produced on Radio 4, Black Roses is an elegy for Sophie. It intercuts Sylvia Lancaster's recollections of her daughter with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/12/poetry-should-be-subversive\" title=\"\">Simon Armitage</a>'s first-person poetic sequence, which gives the silenced Sophie back her voice. Sophie was a vegetarian and a pacifist. What was it about her and Maltby that so aggravated their attackers? \"Something in their lives despises ours. The difference between us is what they can't&nbsp;stand.\"</p> <p>Sarah Frankcom and Susan Robert's simple, moving production is played out on a set designed by Amanda Stoodley. This creates a physical separation between the living and the dead, the domestic and the poetic, and cunningly offers a vision of a green and pleasant England where the birds always sing and there are no threatening shadows. What follows reveals that vision as a lie.</p> <p>Sophie is played with unshowy command by Rachel Austin, and Julie Hesmondhalgh is superb as Sophie's mother, struggling to make sense of her daughter's life and death. The play may not entirely escape its radio origins, but it gains a great deal on stage: Sophie's beauty and difference are underscored because they are visible. \"Now let me go. Now carry me home. Now make this known,\" says Sophie. Black Roses makes it known that hate crimes take many forms.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>The International Monetary Fund dropped the broadest of hints on Monday night that it would give Greece more time to implement its hardline cuts programme as it warned that Europe posed a \"critical risk\" to a weakening global economy.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the Fund's managing director, said the Washington-based institution was \"prepared to be flexible\" and said both growth and austerity were needed to put an end to a crisis which will next month again force the IMF to cut its global growth forecasts.</p> <p>The head of the IMF was speaking as financial markets responded nervously to Portugal's decision to dilute its deficit-reduction programme, the protracted talks over a new package of help for Greece, and mounting political pressure on the Spanish government over its package of cuts and tax increases.</p> <p>Pedro Passos Coelho, Portugal's prime minister, said his government was abandoning plans to raise employee social security payments from 11% to 18% of their salary following widespread public protests. In Spain, Mariano Rajoy's government was facing one of its toughest weeks since it came to power last year as it sought approval for a new wave of reforms designed to pave the way for a European rescue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Greece there was mounting suspicion among members of Antonis Samaras's government that the IMF has been deliberately blocking agreement on \u20ac11.9bn (\u00a39.5bn) of spending cuts necessary for Greece to receive the next tranche of its bailout.</p> <p>\"Basically they want the measures to fail so that Greece is forced to ask for another haircut [on its debt] but we know that is not the view of the EU commission or Germany which is strongly against another debt restructuring at this time,\" said one well placed insider in Athens.</p> <p>Samaras personally telephoned Lagarde on Friday to appeal for a cooling of tensions after the organisation's mission chief to Greece had a fiery exchange with Athens' finance minister over the spending cuts.</p> <p>Lagarde said that Europe's debt crisis and the projected sharp budget retrenchment in the US early next year posed critical risks, and said the Fund would show flexibility to countries in trouble.</p> <p>\"We continue to project a gradual recovery, but global growth will likely be a bit weaker than we had anticipated even in July, and our forecast has trended downward over the last 12 months\", she said in a speech in Washington. The Fund had been expecting the global economy to grow by 3.5% this year and by 3.9% in 2013.</p> <p>\"A number of factors are weighing the global economy down. At the centre of them all is the element of uncertainty; uncertainty about whether policymakers can and will deliver on their promises.\"</p> <p>The IMF managing director said the lasting scars from the crisis included youth unemployment in countries like Greece and Spain, high levels of public debt and a poorly functioning financial sector.</p> <p>\"Worryingly, the energy to implement the reforms that have been agreed \u2013as well as the other reforms that we need \u2013 is waning. I am often asked, five years into the crisis, whether the financial sector is safer today than it was then. My answer? 'Despite real progress, not yet.'\"</p> <p>Lagarde said Europe remained the epicentre of the crisis, adding that programmes should be tailored to the needs of individual countries and backed by financial help.</p> <p>\"On the Fund's part, we are favourably considering that this be done in as timely and flexible a manner as possible: slowing the pace of fiscal adjustment where needed; focusing on measures rather than targets; and, above all, keeping the emphasis not just on austerity, but also on growth as we believe that the two can be reconciled and should not be mutually exclusive.\"</p> <p>In Madrid, some 1,300 police were being drafted in to keep protesters away from the Congreso de los Diputados, the parliament building, as an \"occupy parliament\" movement called for a popular, indefinite blockade starting on Tuesday.</p> <p>Metal fencing and several rings of security manned by police were being put in place to keep demonstrators away from the building, with authorities claiming a blockade would be a direct attack on Spanish democracy.</p> <p>\"We will not let parliament be surrounded or taken over,\" warned Cristina Cifuentes, the interior ministry's Madrid chief, who claimed extreme left-wing and right-wing groups were both involved.</p> <p>It was unclear whether organisers, who define themselves on the internet as \"democratic, anti-neoliberal, anti-capitalist and anti-patriarchal\", would be able to mobilise a large number of demonstrators.</p> <p>The protest coincides with the beginning of a debate in the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona which threatens to see it demand that Rajoy's government formally recognise a right to self-determination for the wealthy north-eastern region.</p> <p>Rajoy's government will this week approve a new reform programme and next year's budget, opening the way for it to request a bailout from eurozone countries. That would allow the European Central Bank to intervene in bond markets and drive down the country's exorbitant borrowing costs.</p> <p>Several of Spain's most important indignado protest groups have refused to back Tuesday's attempted peaceful blockade of the Congreso de los Diputados organised by the \"On Your Feet!\" group, which says it does not intend to stop deputies going to work.</p> <p>a</p>",
  "<p>Britain's Indian summer has been turned into little more than a wistful memory after almost the entire average rainfall for September fell within 24 hours.</p> <p>Few parts of the country have been spared as a front with four deep and soaking troughs has moved slowly eastwards from the Atlantic, followed belatedly by watery sunshine but then a further series of downpours.</p> <p>Several people died in accidents related to the weather, which mixed the rain in places with fierce gusts of wind reaching 50mph. Emergency services rescued scores of people from flooded homes or cars stuck on stretches of road which turned within minutes into impassable lakes.</p> <p>The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in south-west London closed as a precaution after a branch fell on Sunday and killed a 30-year-woman on a visit from New Zealand. A driver also died when his car left the road between March and Wisbech on Monday morning.</p> <p>Other fatalities from the wild, wet weather included a mother and toddler son from eastern Europe whose car hit a tree near Downham Market in Norfolk and a driver whose car left the road between March and Wisbech in heavy morning rain.</p> <p>Disruption to services included the launching of contingency plans at the NHS blood transfusion service in Filton, Bristol, because of the scale of the local deluge, and a ban on cranes being used at the UK's busiest container port at Felixstowe, Suffolk. A spokesman said: \"For the safety of all port users we are currently restricting access to operational areas. Vehicles are being marshalled on site and will be processed through to operational areas as soon as it is safe to do so.\"</p> <p>Truck deliveries have been delayed and haulage firms warned of the disruption, but the police's Operation Stack, which organises orderly queues away from the ferries, has not yet been invoked.</p> <p>The south-west's initial battering, which saw villages such as Chew Magna near Bristol almost cut off, abated but the <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Environment Agency </a>had 23 flood warnings and 135 flood alerts in place, with the most serious in the West Midlands and south-west. Residents of towns habitually hit by flooding such as Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, which has spent some \u00a3600,000 on extra defences since being swamped in 2007, have been making preparations following Sunday night and Monday morning's deluge.</p> <p>Train passengers were trapped for more than two hours on trains near Bristol after a tunnel was flooded and services between Great Malvern in Worcestershire and Hereford were cancelled when part of an embankment subsided. London-bound trains from the south-west were seriously delayed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Met Office</a> warned of further downpours with conditions remaining \"very unsettled\" everywhere but with the most persistent rain and strongest winds in the north. The forecast then shifts the heaviest weather back to southern and western England on Wednesday before drier spells later in the week.</p> <p>The rain is particular relentless because the low pressure system has pulled in cooler polar air from the north, mixing it with warmer conditions and advancing at a meandering rate because the Atlantic jet stream is currently less vigorous than usual and in no hurry to blow things away. The Met Office said: \"After a mainly settled start to the weekend, conditions will soon turn more unsettled again as rain spreads south-eastwards across the UK. Changeable weather is then expected through next week with showers or longer periods of rain affecting most regions. However, there should also be some drier and brighter interludes.\"</p> <p>In the longer term the maximum 30-day forecast suggests \"typical autumn weather\" for much of October, with pleasant dry periods alternating with spells of rain. Temperatures should remain around average for the time of the year, too, until the end of the month when Scotland may get a foretaste of snow ahead, with the autumn's first \"wintry showers\".</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton strayed into presidential politics on Monday with a call for the global elite to pay more taxes, a day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/bill-clinton-hillary-presidential-2016\">her husband re-ignited speculation she would seek the White House herself in 2016</a>.</p> <p>The barbed comments, made in a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative event, were widely seen as a dig at Mitt Romney. The Republican contender has been under attack \u2013 from Bill Clinton among others \u2013 for paying a relatively small portion of income tax despite his immense wealth.</p> <p>The secretary of state's remarks on taxing the rich were directed at developing countries, and they included a disclaimer. \"I am out of politics now,\" she said. But she said she had become increasingly convinced of the need for changes in tax structures around the world.</p> <p>\"One of the issues I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable manner, especially from elites around the world,\" Clinton said. \"It is a fact that around the world the elites of every country are making money.</p> <p>\"There are rich people everywhere, and yet they do not contribute to their growth of their own countries.\"</p> <p>The remarks met with nods of recognition inside the room as a rebuke at Romney and earned a smattering of applause.</p> <p>It was hard to escape the parallels with comments made by Bill Clinton on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday \u2013 that it would be hard for America to dig itself out of the recession with low tax rates on the rich. The former president's remarks were seen as a reference to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/romney-releases-tax-return-summaries\">the release of Romney's 2011 tax return on Friday</a>, which showed the Republican candidate paid an effective tax rate of 14.1% on $13.7m in income.</p> <p>\"I don't think we can get out of this hole we're in if people at that income level only pay 13% or 14%,\" the former president said.</p> <p>The secretary of state, in her remarks, also called for the rich to do more.</p> <p>\"They don't invest in public schools and public hospitals and other kinds of development internally,\" she said. \"So it means for leaders telling powerful people things they don't want to hear. It means being transparent about budgets and revenues and bringing corruption to light.\"</p> <p>The similarity of such comments from a former president and a serving member of the Obama administration was striking \u2013 and reminiscent of Bill Clinton's comments many years ago that he and his wife were a double act. The Bill-Hillary show was in evidence on Sunday, when the former president re-ignited speculation that his wife would make another run for the White House in 2016, having failed to secure the Democratic nomination in 2008.</p> <p>Officially, the secretary of state plans to retire when she fills out her term. She has said that she does not want to serve in a second Obama administration, if the president is re-elected in November. She has spoken about taking time off after a grueling schedule, and about writing a memoir.</p> <p>In July, Clinton racked up more distance traveled than any other secretary of state, with more than 27,000 miles on the road. There have been more trips since then.</p> <p>Clinton also used her speech on Monday to deliver a message to protesters in the Middle East and north Africa that violent demonstrations would not improve their lives.</p> <p>\"If you look around the world today, countries that are focused more on fostering growth than fomenting grievance are racing ahead,\" she said. \"Building schools instead of burning them; investing in their people's creativity, not inciting their rage; opening their economies and societies to have more connections with the wider world, not shutting off the internet or attacking embassies.</p> <p>\"The people of the Arab world did not set out to trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. There is no dignity in that.\" </p> <p>Despite such exertions as secretary of state, speculation that Clinton may have enough energy for another run for the White House continues. On Sunday her husband, in his appearance on CBS, failed to offer a denial that his wife still had political ambitious. </p> <p>\"I have no earthly idea what she will decide to do,\" the former president said. \"She wants to take some time off, kind of regroup. Write a book.\"</p> <p>By the time the secretary of state turned up for her rapturous welcome at the CGI on Monday morning, however, that was seeming less and less likely.</p>",
  "<p>It is not the most obvious candidate to be a graphic novel \u2013 but, claim the authors, the history of the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/widermovement/\" title=\"\">Co-operative movement</a> and the outstanding radicalism of its 28 Rochdale Pioneers is every bit as thrilling as a story of superheroes.</p> <p>The Co-op is publishing <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/graphic-novel/\" title=\"\">The Co-operative Revolution</a> to tell the story of a movement that now employs more than 100 million people across the world, but which began in east Lancashire back in 1844.</p> <p>The financial crisis has been an undoubted spur, says the Co-operative's head of social goals, Paul Monaghan: \"We thought, if this is not our moment, that if we don't get out there and be a little more assertive, then what do we deserve?\"</p> <p>He wants the movement's story to be much better known. \"These people were the Occupy movement of the day, but they were more radical than Occupy. They did something deeply practical, which spread round the world. What these people did back then, with the little that they had, shows what is possible.\"</p> <p>The people he is talking about are known as the Rochdale Pioneers, the 28 men who came up with the principles co-ops around the world follow to this day. It's a thrilling story set against the backdrop of grinding poverty and hunger as well as events such as the Peterloo massacre, in 1819, in which police killed six people and badly injured 600.</p> <p>\"There is this picture of them as 28 northern men, with cloth caps, concerned about the provision of clean, cheap, unadulterated food for the masses. But they were about so much more than that,\" said Monaghan. \"These were deeply radical, revolutionary individuals, and we want that side of the story to come through as well.\"</p> <p>The book, created by the graphic novelist Polyp, tells the history of the pioneers, and imagines a future in 2044 \u2013 after \"the Co-op Spring\" \u2013 with Rochdale's new pioneers launching a mission to Mars.</p> <p>In another section, it shows just how many co-operatives there are around the world: everything from the Green Bay Packers American football team, to Ocean Spray soft drinks to Barcelona football club.</p> <p>Monaghan said: \"It is a little known fact that there are more people who work in co-ops then there are who work in all the world's multinationals put together. There are almost 1 billion people who are members of co-ops, and they are an enormous part of the global economy.</p> <p>\"People, particularly at the moment, are open to the idea of co-operation and mutuality again like they never were before.\"</p> <p>Monaghan said the co-operative economy had increased by 20% since the financial crash of 2009. \"It is filling some of the gaps left by traditional capitalism.\"</p> <p>He said everyone involved in the project had been motivated by the \"passion and the creativity\" of the pioneers. \"It makes us feel humbled, that we've got to do our little bit.</p> <p>\"We will be looking at sending free copies to schools, primaries and secondaries. We want schools to teach the co-operative model because we think it has got so much to offer.\"</p> <p>Besides the graphic novel, a film has been made by the <a href=\"http://britishyouthfilmacademy.com/\" title=\"\">Co-operative British Youth Film Academy</a> that is due to be shown on Film4 later this year, and an exhibition of photographs telling the story of the pioneers and the movement opened in Birmingham last week.

  "<p>Vince Cable's pledge at the Liberal Democrats' autumn conference to work with allies to close down tax havens may not go down well with two of the party's most generous corporate donors.</p> <p>The business secretary told delegates he would crack down on those who used secretive, low tax jurisdictions: \"No one keeps their cash in tax havens for the quality of investment advice; these are sunny places for shady people,\" he said.</p> <p>Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will on Tuesday announce further measures that he claims will retrieve \u00a33bn hidden from the UK government in one European tax haven.</p> <p>Alpha Healthcare and its sister company C &amp; C Alpha Group, part of a venture capital group in the private health sector, have together donated \u00a3970,000 to the Lib Dems since 2004. Alpha's parent company, Harberry Investments, is based in a small office in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands \u2013 named as a tax haven by Congress in the US. Bhanu Choudhrie, a director in both donor companies, has also given a personal donation of \u00a335,000 to the party. His father, Sudhir Choudhrie, who was once involved as a director of companies in the Alpha group but has now stepped down, has given a further \u00a395,000 to the party since 2006.</p> <p>The Choudhrie family, originally from India, was first introduced to the party by Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem MP for Bermondsey in south London.</p> <p>Both Choudhries said in 2010 that they were domiciled outside Britain for tax purposes. If this is still the case they can, if they wish, avoid British tax on any income or gains from their overseas assets.</p> <p>Contacted on Monday, one of the company's directors, Dhruv Choudhrie, declined to comment on Cable's speech, saying he was abroad. A spokesman for the company did not respond to emails or telephone calls.</p> <p>Some senior Lib Dems have maintained close links to offshore havens. Lord Razzall, a former Lib Dem trade and industry spokesman, sits on the board at a firm called Ardel Holdings. The company is based in Guernsey and offers services including tax mitigation for clients, promising that \"income can be rolled up tax free\". Ardel helps with tax mitigation through \"fiduciary structuring\" for businesses and individuals. It also helps non-domiciled UK residents exploit non-taxable offshore funds.</p> <p>Its website says: \"The benefits and flexibility delivered by offshore companies make them a highly attractive option for clients.\"</p> <p>Razzall said: \"As an adviser to the owner of Ardel Holdings for the last 25 years I have always been satisfied that the business does not engage in activities of the type criticised by George Osborne.\"</p> <p>The former Liberal leader Lord Steel is a non-executive director of General Mediterranean Holdings, a Luxembourg-established company set up by Nadhmi Auchi, an Iraqi-born billionaire. Steel said the company's headquarters were in Luxembourg and it held most board meetings there.</p> <p>At the party's conference in Brighton Alexander will set out new resources to help tackle what he calls \"tax dodgers\". He will say: \"With that extra effort we can recover much more from those who think they can hide their money offshore. Up to three times more \u2013 \u00a33bn.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said: \"Liberal Democrats are committed to targeting companies and individuals who are using aggressive tax avoidance measures by hiding money off shore. In some cases, there are legitimate reasons for global companies to not base themselves in the UK, and even corporations such as the Guardian Media Group have on occasion used the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>Regarding the donations from Alpha and C &amp; C, he added: \"They are part of global groups which have UK based businesses, paying full UK tax and employing British workers.</p> <p>\"But as Vince Cable and Danny Alexander have made clear, Liberal Democrats will be cracking down on anyone using tax havens to solely avoid paying a fair share of tax in the UK.\"</p>",
  "<p>The future of one of Iran's great political survivors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, has been called into question after two of his children were taken to prison within three days of each other.</p> <p>The son and daughter of former Iranian president have been taken to Tehran's Evin prison and face separate anti-state allegations.</p> <p>Such a degree of pressure on a former president is unprecedented in the history of the Islamic republic, especially for Rafsanjani, who is believed to have played an instrumental role in the appointment of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the supreme leader after the death in 1989 of the Islamic revolution's founder, Ayatollah Khomeini.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's son, Mehdi Hashemi, was detained on Monday after returning to Iran from a self-imposed exile and spending three years of studying in the UK.</p> <p>Local agencies reported that he was summoned for questioning a day after arriving back in Tehran and was later taken into custody after a warrant for his arrest was issued. \"Mehdi Hashemi was told about the accusations against him and later taken to jail,\" reported the semi-official Ilna news agency.</p> <p>He is believed to be held on accusations of having links to Iran's opposition Green movement and the popular unrest in the aftermath of the country's 2009 disputed presidential election.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's daughter, Faezeh Hashemi, a political activist and former Iranian MP, was taken to Evin on Saturday to serve a six-month prison term after being found guilty of \"spreading propaganda against the regime\".</p> <p>In January, Tehran's revolutionary court sentenced her on a conviction that is believed to be the result of an interview she gave to an opposition website, <a href=\"http://www.roozonline.com/english.html\" title=\"\">Roozonline</a>, in which she blamed regime supporters for harassing her in public. The former MP infuriated hardliners by publicly supporting the opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009 and participating in post-election protests against the vote's results.</p> <p>While in the UK, her brother made headlines over separate allegations that he was studying a five-year DPhil on Iran's constitution at Oxford University without meeting the English language criteria. The university, which investigated the allegations, backed the student although Mehdi Hashemi never attempted to appear in public and demonstrate his language skills.</p> <p>Last year, a Canadian court found him liable in absentia for imprisoning and torturing a rival in the 1990s, allegations he has categorically denied.</p> <p>In March that year, his father, under pressure from opponents, abandoned his position as the head of a powerful clerical body charged with appointing and dismissing the supreme leader.</p> <p>Rafsanjani presides over Iran's expediency council which mediates between the parliament and the guardian council, a body that vets all legislation.</p> <p>In the past, the 78-year-old moderate politician used to enjoy a great deal of influence and was seen as crucial for the survival of the regime because of his mediatory power. But his authority has diminished since he lost the 2005 presidential election to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>Pressure on Rafsanjani's family has grown since then. His other son, Mohsen Hashemi, resigned under pressure from Ahmadinejad's government as the head of Tehran's metro organisation in 2011.</p> <p>Rafsanjani's reputation was also damaged in the past decade by widespread allegations by regime and opposition supporters that he and his family were financially corrupt.</p> <p>\"Despite all the setbacks, Rafsanjani still has relatively good influence among supporters of the regime albeit not necessarily with those in power,\" said an Iranian analyst based in London who asked not to be named. \"As a moderate figure, he still can be considered as Iran's way out of the current stalemate with the international community, and that's why he might rise to power in no time if Khamenei decides to rely on him for the survival of the regime.\"</p> <p>Rafsanjani is also a moderate supporter of Iran's opposition Green movement and its leaders Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who are currently held under house arrest.</p>",

  "<p>Spain's only A-list film festival has opened in frosty conditions. San Sebasti\u00e1n's gorgeous twin bays are still bathed in summery sunshine but the country's cinema business has been chilled like everything else by the national economic predicament. Ticket sales have been hit by a VAT increase, while <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/spanish-government-dramatically-cuts-budget-for-film-fund/5040103.article\" title=\"\">state spending on the industry has been slashed by 30%</a> and production has dropped by two-thirds.</p> <p>Still, the much-loved festival isn't letting any of that hold it back in its 60th anniversary year. Against the run of play, it's managed to keep its funding from Madrid untouched. The regional government actually increased its contribution by \u00a3200,000, such is the Basque country's enthusiasm for an event that brings it rare global attention.</p> <p>To retain that kind of support, San Sebasti\u00e1n must punch above its weight on the ever-more-competitive world festival scene. Like some of its European rivals, it's relying heavily on Hollywood stardust to pull off this feat.</p> <p>The proceedings are being graced by an impressive bag of Anglo-Saxon greats. They've been lured partly by an all-must-have-prizes approach to personal achievement awards, which are being bestowed this year on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/john-travolta\" title=\"\">John Travolta</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/oliver-stone\" title=\"\">Oliver Stone</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/tommyleejones\" title=\"\">Tommy Lee Jones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ewanmcgregor\" title=\"\">Ewan McGregor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/dustinhoffman\" title=\"\">Dustin Hoffman</a>. But the strategy also requires the deployment of big American films with attendant red-carpet screen idols.</p> <p>Unfortunately, when it comes to transatlantic world premieres, the rise of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/16/toronto-film-festival-review-2012\" title=\"\">Toronto</a> has queered San Sebasti\u00e1n's pitch. The most it can generally hope for now is the first European screening of an already-unveiled hot ticket. Hence, this year's opening gala feature was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145813/arbitrage\" title=\"\">Arbitrage</a>, the glossy thriller starring the oft-coupled Richard Gere and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/1999/nov/12/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank4\" title=\"\">Susan Sarandon</a> which was <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/arbitrage/\" title=\"\">well received</a> on its home turf first at Sundance and then on general release 10 days ago. Does it do the biz?</p> <p>Arbitrage depicts the comeuppance of a top-dog financier who cooks the books to save his skin. Understandably, it's therefore been seen by some as a parable about the much-desired fate of the 1%, who supposedly got us into this mess. However, Gere was eager to convince the press that this isn't at all the point of his movie. He's right about that. Arbitrage is no zeitgeisty take on why our world collapsed, in the manner of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/jan/16/margin-call-bankers-human-chandor\" title=\"\">Margin Call</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/oct/11/wall-street-greed-is-good\" title=\"\">Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</a>. It's a comfortingly old-fashioned retelling of the familiar saga of the alpha male high-achiever who overreaches himself and comes unstuck. Master of the universe Robert Miller's financial woes aren't even his biggest problem: it's the part he plays in the violent death of his sulky mistress that provides the nub of the drama.</p> <p>Gere said: \"When you play a character like this, you basically have two choices: you play the villain, with a capital V \u2026 or you play a human being.\" In fact, he plays Richard Gere, drenching the two-dimensional Miller in oodles of self-love, charm, ruthlessness and above all, the old razzle-dazzle. It's a job that with his experience Gere can pull off handsomely without breaking sweat.</p> <p>It's just as well that he does, since writer and first-time director Nicholas Jarecki's plot, though reasonably solid, is formulaic and not particularly clever. The dialogue is pedestrian, the moralism tedious and the humour absent. Nothing bears any relation to anything you're likely to encounter in the real world, though you'll recognise lots of bits from films you've seen before.</p> <p>Still, none of that matters too much. Gere's well-honed screen persona is enough to invest this humdrum piece of hokum with magic. You feel Miller's lusts, dread his impending reverses and will him to win even though he's such a bad chap, because the man playing him is a star. It's films like this that remind you how deservedly people like Gere earn their own place in the upper reaches of that 1%.</p> <p>Sarandon supports Gere in his vital work with almost comparable aplomb. Her role, as the wife impelled by female virtue to turn against her spouse, is as threadbare as his. She nonetheless delivers the goods efficiently, automatically and effectively. That would have been enough, but we get an extra dose of the right stuff from Tim Roth. He turns up as a grungy New York detective who, wouldn't you know it, is prepared to break the rules to bring down an otherwise untouchable fat cat. Again, you don't believe in him for a second, but you have to love the fruitiness of his act.</p> <p>On its opening weekend in the US 10 days ago, Arbitrage was accorded only a 197-theatre rollout and ended up at No 12 in the charts. Still, these days the rest of the world seems less weary of traditional Hollywood artifice than the domestic market. At the festival, the Spanish press loved the film, which augurs well for its performance when it opens in their country next month. Even more striking was the reception accorded to Gere and Sarandon. The throng awaiting their arrival for the gala was so dense that the streets around the red carpet were literally impenetrable. Hand in hand, the gilded couple royally delivered the required autographs and unstinting praise for an event which has in its time accorded each of them a lifetime achievement award.</p> <p>In so doing they've helped make San Sebasti\u00e1n's seventh decade is already assured, even if Spain leaves the euro. It may seem a pity that so much should turn on a glorified Tinseltown B-pic and its fading stars, rather than the Spanish and Latin American treasures to which this festival is also playing host.</p> <p>But that's showbiz.</p>",
  "<p>As factors from droughts to urbanisation add to the dire global water crisis, the ensuing misery falls even more on women and girls in the world's poorest countries. The statistics are staggering: around the world, women and girls expend a total of over 200m hours daily collecting and hauling water. In sub-Saharan Africa, 71% of the water fetched and gathered for household use falls under the responsibility of female family members.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/2012/08/gender-perspectives-on-water-and-food-security/\" title=\"\">Lakshmi Puri</a> of UN Women told an audience at last month's World Water Week in Stockholm, water scarcity leaves women particularly vulnerable. Subsistence agriculture in much of the developing world is dominated by women, and tenuous land rights can quickly lead to the loss of access to water and then more abject poverty and hunger. The precarious legal status of women in these countries exposes them to further risk. Add the burden of carrying water for household chores or to prepare food that women sell to help their families scrape by, and the daily struggle for water becomes a harsh barrier to women's equality and economic empowerment.</p> <p>Girls who must spend time carrying water instead of studying in class then find themselves caught in the same cycle of poverty as their mothers and grandmothers. Finally, policymakers often exclude women from local decisions that have an impact on women's rights to water, pushing them outside the margins of discussions over water usage when in fact, they should have a seat at the table and be at the centre.</p> <p>Companies that search for business opportunities in emerging markets now realise that water must be at the core of their long-term planning and strategy. But water remediation and conservation projects are not enough. Despite their untenable legal status in much of the developing world, women often make many of their family's purchasing decisions. So efforts to ensure women's access to clean water are not just about checking a box on a corporate responsibility to-do list: companies that implement such plans will improve the health and economic security for millions of women.</p> <p>Well-planned initiatives create a chance to lift women out of poverty and can avert social unrest should water shortages increase in the coming years. As <a href=\"http://www.bsr.org/reports/ BSR_Women_and_Sustainability_Economic_Empowerment2.pdf\" title=\"\">a Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) report</a> last year outlined, improving women's access to water can free up to hundreds of hours annually that they can instead devote to more lucrative economic activities. Families and communities will not only strengthen as they have access to adequate water supplies, but businesses will also eventually gain customers and engaged local stakeholders where they commit to a sustainable development plan with water at its core.</p> <p>Beverage companies have been among the most proactive in working with NGOs to improve women's rights to clean water. Understanding that they must partner with local communities to build trust and share diminishing water supplies in regions from Africa to south Asia, the makers of soft drinks and beer have the core competencies that can help solve some of the world's most pressing water problems.</p> <p>Coca-Cola, for example, is attempting to solve water and sanitation problems that adversely affect women and girls, in several African nations. The bottling company's <a href=\"http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/dynamic/press_center/2011/03/improving-lives- of-african-women-and-girls.html\" title=\"\">philanthropic arm</a> dedicated $6m to <a href=\"https://secure.thecoca-colaafricafoundation.org/africa-water-projects-rain.asp\" title=\"\">programmes</a> that they claim will benefit 250,000 girls and women, and in turn should provide a total of 2 million people with access to clean water by 2015.</p> <p>Water is the foundation for security and strong communities, so bolstering access to this precious resource is critical to enabling companies to take the next step and undertake initiatives that focus on skills and job training. Strangely, we live in a world where more people have <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-putting-global-mobile- in-context-2012-4? nr_email_referer=\" 1&amp;utm_source=\"Triggermail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=SAI%20C&quot;\" hart%20of%20the%20day&amp;utm_campaign=\"SAI_COTD_043012\" \" title=\"\">access to a mobile telephone</a> than safe drinking water. But without water, both health and wealth for women and girls are almost impossible to secure, and business must step in where local governments have failed girls and their mothers.</p> <p><em>Leon Kaye is founder and editor of </em><a href=\"http://greengopost.com/\" title=\"\"><em>GreenGoPost.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a tough act to follow and not just because he's a charismatic Italian daredevil. Over the past three entries in Ubisoft's sublime open-world adventure series, Assassin's Creed, gamers have watched the former Florentine noble flourish from a shallow, pugnacious Lothario into a wise, if slightly world weary, scholar of men.</p> <p>As his storyline closed out in last year's Assassin's Creed: Revelations, Ezio had learned the harsh lesson that pursing a lust for revenge isn't a substitute for living one's life. His story arc had come full circle; after uncovering the library of Altair, Ezio left for home with his new love by his side, content that he'd paid his dues in the war between the Templars and the Assassins. Ezio is easily one of the best characters created in the gaming medium in the last 10 or so years and (speaking as a fan of this franchise) he will be sorely missed.</p> <p>It's a pity the same can't be said about the series' other protagonist \u2013 Desmond Miles. He's unfortunately still an integral part of the Assassin's Creed storyline and most fans would be glad to see the back of him. Not only is he a plonkingly bland character, but over the last three games his story arc found itself parked up an uninteresting cul-de-sac. Most players don't care what happens to him and this is a problem for the developers because no matter what hooded figure glowers at punters from the box-art of every Assassin's Creed game, this series \u2013 in the end \u2013 is all about Desmond. His story needs an adrenaline shot and fast.</p> <p>Whether it's going to get one in Assassin's Creed III is unclear at this point. In my hands-on with the latest entry in the series I only caught sight of the boring bartender in a loading screen before the Animus \u2013 that nifty VR time exploration device \u2013 slotted his consciousness back to the late 1700s in British-controlled North America and into the boots of one Connor Kenway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396657122\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348491157501/Assassin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Assassin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the notes supplied by Ubisoft, Connor is a half-British, half-Native American warrior who joins the American revolutionary forces after the British attacked his village. As I join the story, Connor's in deep with the rebels, but not too busy to make sure that the woodlands surrounding a manor he's holed up in remain a place of peace and tranquility. After a brief exchange in which Connor is handed a nasty-looking weapon called a rope-dart, we're off into the forest to take down a bunch of poachers.</p> <p>Assassin's Creed veterans are in for a couple of teething problems as they get to grips with young Mr Kenway. First off, the environments he travels through bare scant resemblance to the cities that Altair and Ezio kicked about in. The rooftops of those cities were largely flat-topped and only interrupted occasionally by iconic landmarks. Crucially, the streets in them were narrow, meaning that the jump between roofs was quite easy to make \u2013 even if in Istanbul Ezio required the odd bit of assistance from his hook blade.</p> <p>After the Medieval Middle East and Renaissance Europe, the North American frontier takes a bit of getting used to. In the first half hour of my hands-on, I spent most of my time sprinting about, leaping over the odd rock or babbling brook, climbing nearby trees and then wondering how best to proceed. Due to the close-knit structure of the cities from earlier Assassin's Creed games, the Parkour pathways were always immediately apparent. This isn't the case in Assassin's Creed III and players are likely to spend a fair bit of time bungling about in the treetops, or just running along on the ground \u2013 at least at first.</p> <p>Then the penny drops. I wish I could point to a single moment or sequence in the game that marked the change in my navigational abilities, but truth be told, I didn't spot the changeover. At some point, as Connor sprinted through the forest, my visual reading of the environment suddenly went widescreen; one minute I was struggling to see the way forward and the next, I found myself running up a fallen tree, leaping off a rock formation and then moving swiftly through the tree tops as though a pathway had just intuitively opened up for me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396657123\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348491339354/Assassin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Assassin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn't long before I happened across Connor's poacher quarries, as moving through the trees is a lot speedier than running about on the ground. Furthermore, Connor has more attacking options open to him from an elevated position than he does on the ground. With the rope dart, for example, Connor can snag an enemy from where he's sitting on a branch, looping his weapon around their neck in a make-shift noose. Then, using his own body weight as ballast, he can swing off the branch he's perched on and use his momentum to string up his target and leave them choking their last as he walks away.</p> <p>On level pegging, he's still a force to be reckoned with; like Ezio, Connor has a concealed blade, which is perfect for surprise kills, but his go-to weapon of choice is a tomahawk, wielded in much the same way Ezio and Altair wielded their swords. Combat is a brutal and tactical affair; if players concentrate too much on hammering one specific opponent, they can be assured that any number of their target's compatriots will move swiftly to hit them from behind. The counter move in Assassin's Creed III gives players a brief window of slow motion to decide on the direction of their next attack \u2013 probably because most of Connor's foes in the game are armed with muskets.</p> <p>In any combative exchange, it's likely that some enemies will attempt to fire lead into Connor. Luckily, since all the action is set in the 1700's, there's a lengthy respite between gunfire exchanges as enemies go through the cumbersome process of reloading. In the instances they come across a party of foes carrying muskets, it's worth keeping mobile in order to make Connor a harder target to hit. Once the volley of gunfire sounds off, I recommend moving in swiftly with a tomahawk as the impromptu firing squad does their best to regroup.</p> <p>Once I'd mopped up the poachers and a couple of side-quests, I found Connor's environment growing in the direction of commerce. A young lady the poachers had shot down \u2013 and which I'd saved \u2013 decided to set up a trading post where Connor was able to sell the pelts of animals I'd skinned in the wild. It all smacked a bit of the mini-empire building that took place in the last three Assassin's Creed games, and while I wasn't able to see if Connor would be the focal point of a colonial business enterprise in the time allotted in my hands-on, it's a ton to a tenner that players will probably be able to set up a goods network in the American frontier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396657124\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348491583946/Assassin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Assassin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was also able to see how Connor handled in an urban environment, as the plot arc in the time I had at the controls, took me from the frontier to Boston. The environment here was as much of a far cry from the tightly knit cities from previous Assassin's Creed titles as the woodland frontier. The wide streets of newly-minted North America make progress over the rooftops slightly problematic at times. To combat this, the developers have positioned trees as waypoints on wide American streets and also allowed players the option of cutting through houses; crashing through a window and charging through an apartment to avoid capture is now an option.</p> <p>The only real bone of contention here is that Connor \u2013 after three hours of playing time \u2013 can't hold a candle to his predecessor. He is by no means as dull as Desmond, but in terms of charisma and likeability, Ezio leaves him the dust. He comes across as somewhat humourless, po-faced and oh-so-serious. That having been said, anyone who has ever played an Assassin's Creed title will tell you that three hours of play is barely scratching the surface. Here's hoping that Connor can lighten up occasionally; aside from his dour, dowdy demeanour, he and the game he inhabits are worthy successors to Ezio Auditore da Firenze and if you've played the last three Assassin's Creed entries, you know what a compliment that is.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Yule Catto</strong>, the chemicals company, was mentioned as a possible bid target at the end of last month but now traders believe one potential predator could have turned its attentions elsewhere.</p> <p>BASF is now said to be looking at Swiss chemicals and biotech group Lonza, but it may face a rival bid from Saudi Arabia's SABIC. Any offer was said to be worth around 65 Swiss francs a share, valuing the business at around \u00a32.2bn.</p> <p>Meanwhile Yule closed 4.4p lower at 167.2p.</p> <p>Renewed speculation surrounded <strong>J Sainsbury</strong>, up 2.9p at 347.8p, with talk that 26% shareholder and failed bidder the Qatar Investment Authority might be looking to buy the stake owned by the supermarket group's family investors. This would almost certainly trigger a bid for the whole group.</p> <p>With continuing worries about the eurozone, as the Greek debate of \u20ac11.5bn of cost savings dragged on and Spain faced a new budget and bank stress test results this week, investors were in cautious mood. The <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>finished 13.78 points lower at 5838.84.</p> <p>Mining shares were among the main fallers, as JP Morgan Cazenove suggested taking profits after recent rises in the wake of the US announcement of further quantitative easing. It said China was still key to the sector:</p> <blockquote> Until more clarity emerges around the Chinese growth picture and potential stimulus measures, which we suspect will not come until later in the year after the leadership changeover in mid-October, we suspect QE3 will provide a floor for the sector but not necessarily drive substantial forward momentum. </blockquote> <p><strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation </strong>lost 13.9p to 330.6p and <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> fell 30p to \u00a310.56. <strong>Anglo American</strong>, which dropped 50.5p to 1887.5p, was also hit by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch moving from buy to neutral. It said:</p> <p>We think Anglo shares present deep value. However, with ongoing union related labour unrest in South Africa, which particularly impacts the group's key platinum division, we do not see shares outperforming the broader sector or the market near term.</p> <p>But the biggest faller in the sector was <strong>Bumi</strong>, the coal miner co-founded by financial Nat Rothschild. It lost 25% to 147.6p after revealing allegations of potential financial and other irregularities in its Indonesian operations.</p> <p>On the other hand pharmaceutical and medical companies were in demand as investors sought defensive stocks amid the continued worries about the eurozone.</p> <p><strong>Shire</strong> led the FTSE 100 risers, up 31p to \u00a318.45, closely followed by <strong>Smith and Nephew</strong>, up 7p to 693p and <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>, adding 20.5p to 2962.5p.</p> <p>Cillit Bang maker <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> rose 39p to \u00a336.38 while <strong>United Utilities</strong>, the subject of renewed bid talk last week, added 5p to 727p.</p> <p>Among the midcaps, <strong>Qinetiq</strong>, the former ministry of defence research arm floated on the stock exchange in 2006, rose 11.1p to 182.9p after a better than expected first half trading update. The main boost came from its UK business and its global products division, with the delivery of two key orders for its Q-NetTM equipment - a kevlar web which protects vehicles from grenade attacks.</p> <p>But this was offset by the performance of its US business, with uncertainties over the country's defence budget leading to delays in awarding contracts.</p> <p><strong>AG Barr</strong>, the maker of Irn-Bru which is currently in talks about a \u00a31.4bn merger with <strong>Britvic</strong>, added 8.9p to 459.9p despite seeing its results hit by rising sugar prices.</p> <p>Half year profits fell from \u00a316.2m to \u00a314.9m, with raw material costs and the poor summer weather both having an impact. Barr said cash-conscious consumers were looking for cheap deals in supermarkets rather than buying a can from their local corner shop on impulse.</p> <p><strong>Petra Diamonds</strong> sparkled after a positive update, including a forecast for 30% growth in annual production. Its shares closed 8.3p higher at 118p.</p> <p>Housebuilder <strong>Redrow</strong> - which founder and chairman Steve Morgan plans to take private - edged up 1p to 154.4p after a leading investor opposed the proposal. Fidelity owns 10.5% of Redrow and believes Morgan's proposed offer of around 152p a share is opportunistic and undervalues the business - it reckons 220p is a fairer price. Morgan, who holds 40% of Redrow and is backed by 14% holder Toscafund, has until Friday to make a formal bid.</p>",

  "<p>Libya's new government has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/libyan-authorities-islamist-militia\" title=\"\">issued an ultimatum to its militias</a>: disband and disarm \u2013 or else. The drive to flush out the numerous militia groups that have operated with impunity since the fall of the Gaddafi regime follows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/chris-stevens-libya-brutal-death\" title=\"\">the killing of the US ambassador, Chris Stephens</a>, two weeks ago, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/22/unarmed-people-power-libya\" title=\"\">demonstrations over the weekend</a> that saw protesters seize control of several militia headquarters.</p> <p>On the face of it, these moves look promising. Libya's democratically elected rulers are beginning to take responsibility, backed up by a population that has become increasingly dissatisfied with the state's slow progress in establishing itself as the principal power since the upheaval last year.</p> <p>The post-conflict environment has brought ongoing clashes between rival militia groups, clashes between the state and militias, assassinations and turf wars over smuggling routes. Furthermore, the attack on the US diplomatic mission in Benghazi was the second of its kind since June \u2013 a month in which the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18401792\" title=\"\">British ambassador to Libya, Dominic Asquith, was also targeted</a>.</p> <p>However, there are still two principal obstacles to sidelining militia groups, including jihadist militias operating in Derna, Libya's Islamist stronghold.</p> <p>While Libyans and international commentators alike have been celebrating the weekend's events as a victory \u2013 in particular the storming of the headquarters of Ansar al-Sharia (the group blamed for the ambassador's killing) \u2013 the militias are simply being driven underground. They have abandoned their bases with their weapons and ammunition, rather than being detained or brought under government control.</p> <p>That will compound existing security problems because it means militias could switch to operating as small units, instead of larger groups that are more easily identified and targeted. The government could still try to eliminate militias in their new form, but it remains doubtful that the state army, usually suited to targeting larger military formations and identifiable headquarters, has the organisation, experience and effectiveness to combat smaller, dispersed units that might continue and even increase their hit-and-run operations.</p> <p>Moreover, this implies that the government is abandoning the idea of a reconciliatory process in favour of direct armed confrontation. That could be problematic in an unstable post-conflict environment that has yet to remedy differences between existing rulers and their predecessors. It could also be detrimental because of the links militias have with local regions and neighbourhoods. Some have extensive tribal, political and familial ties. The ramifications of this will be all the more severe because of the lack of state control and a functioning security force.</p> <p>The extent to which the government intends to see out its pledge to defeat militias remains to be seen \u2013 since it has yet to define the parameters of legal and illegal militias. That means certain groups will not be challenged because of their untouchable status. For example, militias of the Nafusa mountains in the western part of the country, especially those from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/02/libya-releases-icc-officials\" title=\"\">Zintan (who continue to hold Saif Gaddafi</a> despite the government's protests), will retain their autonomy.</p> <p>What this essentially means is that the government will really be able to tackle only the opportunistic militias that emerged after the downfall of the regime. These are groups of armed men that were formed locally to look after their neighbourhoods in the ensuing security vacuum and who may or may not engage in petty criminal activities. However, more robust and broader networks of militias, especially those that developed during the 2011 uprising, will operate as normal.</p> <p>Yet if certain groups are allowed to remain autonomous, that will not only prolong the precarious security environment (as well as tarnishing the political process because of the protection they are given) but also invite smaller groups to join their ranks, making the government's efforts a futile and tokenistic endeavour.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/14/libya-needs-more-than-elections\" title=\"\">a previous article</a> I argued that one realistic approach to security challenges in Libya would be to recognise that the most powerful militia forces will remain the primary force on the ground.</p> <p>It may be that the Libyan government is beginning to accept this reality. But it is imperative to do so as part of a regulated framework \u2013 making militias not just more accountable but also more effective and efficient as law enforcers working in partnership with a centralised state security force.</p>",

  "<p>Guess what proportion of the 370m or so PCs shipped this year will include an SSD (solid state device, or NAND Flash drive, if you prefer)? According to Samsung's senior team in its SSD division, the figure is between 5% and 10%. Next year, they expect it to hit 20% \u2013 and by 2016 to reach 50%.</p> <p>For anyone who has experienced the speed and silence that SSDs bring, that has to be a good thing. With SSD manufacturing capacity growing rapidly, HDDs \u2013 hard disk drives with rotating platters \u2013 are starting to be less competitive. Prices for SSDs are now below the magic \"$1 per GB\" level, at which price sensitivity drops away: you can now buy a 512GB SSD for less than $500 (and about \u00a3400 in the UK), which means that you can give an old PC an entirely new lease of speeded-up life by copying the data onto the new drive.</p> <p>And that is the market that Samsung is going after with the latest generation of its SSD range, the Samsung Pro 840 \u2013 following last year's 830 range. When the drive goes on sale in October, it will be targeted at users looking to update their machine rather than going to the expense of buying a new one. \"There's not a lot of money around in Europe,\" one Samsung manager told me, explaining why the company is presently going after the upgrade market \u2013 which is of course enormous, given the installed based of hundreds of millions of PCs. The forecast is that the number of SSDs bought for the \"aftermarket\", as it's called, will roughly treble or quadruple this year and next.</p> <p>I've had the chance to try out the Samsung 840 drive and to benchmark it. In the graphic below, which was first used for a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jan/24/ssd-test-samsung-crucial-plextor-kingston\">group SSD test in January</a>, it's been added as the last \u2013 and, as it turns out, usually longest \u2013 line in each group. (Longer is better: the figure represents the speed at which data is moved.) </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605163\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348491624033/all_ssds_compared.png\" alt=\"SSD group test\" width=\"460\" height=\"323\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">SSD group test: Samsung, Crucial, Toshiba, Kiingston SSDs, and Maxtor HDD. Longer bars are better.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What the benchmarks show is that the 840 beats everything else, in most cases pretty handily, except in the \"random 4K write\" test. (And that might have been a one-off artefact of the test.) The benchmark, carried out by XBench, doesn't particularly torture the drive, but it's a good enough facsimile of real life. </p> <p>The key message is that SSDs are now affordable, as has been becoming clear. Samsung, as the world's biggest memory maker, is making aggressive moves here \u2013 it's aiming to be the biggest in various markets (it's already second, it says, in the UK) and could drive down the price so that 1TB of SSD storage for your main machine is just an afterthought.</p> <p>One area though where SSD doesn't quite match up: use in high-end workstations, especially those used in work such as architecture which use colossal temporary files. SSDs perform poorly if they're used for repeated writing (because while it's extremely fast to read from them, writing requires the erasure of the memory location followed by the writing of the new data \u2013 unlike magnetic HDDs which simply write without erasing first). It may be a little time, executives admit, before they're quite ready for that sort of punishing environment \u2013 although the SSD 840 Pro range are touted as being for \"24-hour\" use.</p> <p>And what about the suggestions that SSDs fail catastrophically when they reach the end of their lives? That's not such a problem as it appears to be, says another Samsung executive. \"When you see the first few errors occur, you still have all the rest of the data there on the drive \u2013 you've only lost a little bit where it went wrong. But when a HDD dies, everything is lost.\" The latter might not be quite true, but SSDs are improving not only in speed but also in longevity \u2013 the idea that they're only good for a short life is now long past. Samsung is offering a five-year warranty on its SSDs \u2013 and by the time you reach the end of the warranty, any replacement drive with the same capacity is probably going to cost around one-sixteenth, or 6%, of what you paid originally. So that means that that 512GB drive will cost about \u00a324. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605164\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348491919812/samsung_2011_v_2012.png\" alt=\"Samsung SSD 2011 v 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"249\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samsung SSD 830 (2011) v SSD 840 Pro (2012) benchmark comparison.

In fact Samsung's engineers are already saying that the SATA interface isn't sufficient for future SSD; it's limited to 6 gigabits per second, which apparently isn't enough for the hardcore SSD makers \u2013 who are now looking to PCIe because it offers parallel throughput and is already an industry standard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605165\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348491992985/maxtor_v_ssd_-_speeds.png\" alt=\"Maxtor HDD v Samsung SSD\" width=\"460\" height=\"218\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maxtor HDD v Samsung SSD 840 benchmark comparison.

That means an operation \u2013 such as booting up \u2013 that would take 60 seconds with the HDD will take 3 seconds with the SSD. When you multiply those sorts of benefits across a day, the time saved \u2013 or added \u2013 is colossal. We keep saying it, but that's because it's true: SSDs are the future of computer storage. It's just a question of whether you get on board now or when you buy your next computer \u2013 in 2016, perhaps.</p> <p><em>Charles Arthur was one of a group of journalists who travelled to Seoul at the invitation of, and paid for by, Samsung</em></p>",
  "<h2>Torrey Smith is a remarkable man</h2> <p>Everybody reacts differently to grief. Whether in professional sports or any other walk of life, there will always be some people who find that work provides an outlet \u2013 a necessary channel for emotions and energies that would otherwise be overwhelming. Likewise, there will be others who find it impossible to even contemplate their jobs while coping with the loss of a loved one. Torrey Smith chose the former option on Sunday night, suiting up to play for Baltimore against New England less than 24 hours after discovering that his younger brother Tevin Jones had died in a motorcycle accident. \"It was tough. I didn't know until 4 o'clock if I was going to play,\" Smith said afterwards. \"I only had like an hour of sleep. Emotionally, I didn't know how I was going to hold up.\"</p> <p>In the event, he held up better than anyone could have imagined. Smith's performance was nothing short of remarkable, the receiver hauling in six catches for 127 yards and two touchdowns in a 31-30 win over the Patriots. <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000065306/Smith-25-yard-TD-catch\">The first score came at a time when his team desperately needed a kick-start</a>, trailing 13-0 in the second quarter. The second brought them to within two points with three-and-a-half minutes to play: setting up an eventual 31-30 win.<br> \"There's not a better guy on this team than Torrey Smith,\" said his team-mate, Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta. \"For him to come out and play the way he did today was unbelievable. I can't even begin to put myself in his shoes.\"</p> <h2>It may be time to take the Arizona Cardinals seriously</h2> <p>Three weeks into the NFL season, and just three teams remain unbeaten. The Houston Texans had never before started a season 3-0, yet neither their perfect start nor that of the Atlanta Falcons could be deemed as truly shocking. Each has recorded noteworthy wins, but both had been pegged before the season began as contenders in their respective conferences. </p> <p>The same could not be said for the Arizona Cardinals \u2013 a team widely predicted to finish in the bottom half of an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/sep/17/nfl-week-two-arizona-cardinals-tim-tebow\">NFC West division thought to be the worst in football.</a> Their schedule only rendered such a fast start all the more unthinkable. Week two brought a trip to New England: a team who had never lost a home opener at Foxboro. Week three saw them hosting Michael Vick and the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jQPAxiv1SKU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jQPAxiv1SKU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>And yet after three weeks there they are, having outlasted Tom Brady's bunch last week and now overwhelmed Philadelphia. Defensive co-ordinator Ray Horton's aggressive schemes flummoxed Mike Vick \u2013 hit four times on his first seven plays and 10 times in the first half \u2013 and allowed his team to restrict the Eagles' explosive offense to six points. The Cardinals defense also forced two fumbles from the quarterback, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQPAxiv1SKU\">one of which was returned 96 yards for a touchdown</a>. All this with the Cardinals' Pro Bowl safety Adrian Wilson sitting out with ankle and groin complaints.</p> <p>Sunday brought a hugely encouraging performance from the much-maligned quarterback Kevin Kolb, completing 17 of 24 for 222 yards and two touchdowns against his former team, but there is no question that the defense remains the strength of this team. Up front Darnell Dockett and Calais Campbell create constant disruption, allowing Horton to draw up his blitz schemes around them.</p> <p>\"No one respects our defense,\" said third-year linebacker O'Brien Schofield after Sunday's win. \"No one respects our team, and that's okay.\" But as much as the Cardinals might enjoy playing the underdog, people will now begin to take notice. Seventy-five per cent of teams who start 3-0 go to the playoffs. The Cardinals' next challenge will be showing they can live with raised expectations.</p> <h2>Christian Ponder is developing nicely</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest upset of the weekend arrived in Minnesota, where the Vikings defeated the heavily favoured San Francisco 49ers 24-13. The Vikes did a lot of things right throughout the game \u2013 from forcing Alex Smith's first interception in 249 throws to restricting Frank Gore on the ground, but the stand-out performance belonged to quarterback Christian Ponder.</p> <p>Against one of the best defences in the league \u2013 one that had bewildered Matthew Stafford and defeated Aaron Rodgers in the last two weeks \u2013 Ponder kept his composure and seized the opportunities presented to him. As well as throwing for two scores, he became the first player with a rushing touchdown against the 49ers this season when he weaved through the heart of their defence to dive in from 23 yards out midway through the second quarter.</p> <p>With so much focus on the rookie quarterbacks starting this season, it has been easy to forget about the second-year guys like Ponder and Tennessee's Jake Locker \u2013 who also had a big day in his team's 44-41 overtime win over the Lions. Ponder has completed more than 70% of his passes so far this season, throwing for four touchdowns, no picks and a passer rating of 104.9.</p> <p>He's a big part of why the unfancied Vikings are now 2-1: the same record as the 49er team they beat this weekend.</p> <h2>Parity is king</h2> <p>Even before this weekend there was evidence to suggest that this was an abnormally competitive year across the NFL. A league record 20 teams reached the end of week two having won one game and lost the other. Just six teams had unbeaten records:<a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000063482/article/nfl-sets-record-with-20-teams-at-11-including-patriots\"> the lowest such figure since the NFL expanded to 30 teams in 1995</a>.</p> <p>Week three, though, only served to reinforce the point, with a string of results that would have been deemed improbable just a few short days ago. The Vikings beating the Niners? The Raiders beating the Steelers? The Chiefs wiping out an 18-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Saints in their own dome?</p> <p>Perhaps the real lesson of week three is that we don't know nearly as much as we thought we did. When even the Patriots are below .500 anything seems possible. This is the first time New England has had a losing record at any stage of a season <a href=\"http://twitter.yfrog.com/0gksagj\">since week one of 2003</a>. </p> <h2>The replacement officials saga continues to slide into farce</h2> <p>We have established by now that many of the replacement referees, drafted in to replace the regular ones after the NFL failed to reach agreement with them on a new collective contract, are not up to scratch. Over the past three weeks <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/09/16/ike-taylor-pass-interference/70000475/1#.UFaQco1mR48\">they have blown calls</a>, awarded a team <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/09/09/cardinals-hang-on-after-referee-error-helps-seattle/\">additional time-outs</a>, and at different moments just given the general impression of not being fully in control. </p> <p>This has given rise to some dangerous trends. Players, believing the new officials to be either more lenient or simply not brave enough to throw flags have begun pushing their luck \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_21577933/some-nfl-players-take-advantage-replacement-officials\">making late hits and testing the boundaries of what is acceptable</a>. Coaches have also got carried away. After Baltimore's win over New England on Sunday, Bill Belichick ran over and <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/yahoo/carousel/embed_code.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=a9ef86f4e26849eebcd00e187fe1e641\">tried to grab one of the line judges</a> as he exited the field.</p> <p>Games have become chippier. On Sunday<a href=\"https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/Letter-from-Executive-Committee-to-Owners-on-Ref-Lockout/\"> the NFL Players Association wrote an open letter to the league</a> noting, among other things, the increased injury risk in such an environment.</p> <p>Of course there is also an element of speculation to all this. The Broncos defender Joe Mays might just as well have launched himself into <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/matt-schaub-loses-piece-ear-illegal-hit-013507090--nfl.html;_ylt=AvwcHCEEJz7YrQZ8zfMLAwtYYsp_;_ylu=X3oDMTFkYnNvcGJsBG1pdANCbG9ncyBJbmRleARwb3MDMTMEc2VjA01lZGlhQmxvZ0luZGV4VGVtcA--;_ylg=X3oDMTFpMm9iMzh1BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANibG9nBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3\">the helmet-to-helmet hit which cost Houston Texans quarterback Matt Schaub a small chunk of his ear</a> even with the most qualified officials had been in place. </p> <p>It seems rather less likely, though, that one of the regular referees would have casually thrown his hat into the path of a sprinting player, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUE3tyOZewc&amp;feature=player_embedded\">as one did during the Cowboys' win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday night</a>. Dallas wide receiver Kevin Ogletree was trying to get open in the end zone, when he lost his footing after stepping on the offending piece of headgear. </p> <p>Officials are supposed to drop their hats to the turf to signify that a player has stepped out of bounds while running a route \u2013 which would make them ineligible to catch a pass until they re-establish themselves in-bounds \u2013 but typically just beside their own feet, rather than into the path of a man running at full speed. Had Ogletree picked up a twist, sprain or worse while slipping, one can only imagine the fall-out.</p> <p>What we have also learned over the last few weeks, however, is that the NFL is unmoved by such concerns. Further talks took place between the two sides on Sunday, but<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-nfl-players-accuse-owners-of-greed-compromising-safety-20120923,0,1349648.story\"> broke off with the two sides reportedly still far apart</a>. The expectation is that we will have the replacements again for week four. Hopefully by then, someone will have had a word about the safe deployment of official headgear.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/standings\">NFL standings</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/schedules\">NFL scores and schedule</a></p>",
  "<p>Wild, wet weather has swept into the UK from the Atlantic bringing winds of up to 70mph and causing three deaths as roads turned treacherous and trees and branches were blown down.</p> <p>A woman from New Zealand was<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/24/woman-killed-by-branch-at-kew?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"> killed in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in south-west London</a> on Sunday when 30mph gusts dislodged a large branch. She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>The other fatalities were at Crimpelsham in Norfolk where a woman and a toddler, both eastern European nationals living locally, died when the BMW in which they were passengers left the road and hit a tree.</p> <p>Warnings were issued of fiercer winds and the chance of flooding in 88 areas of the south-west, midlands and north-east.</p> <p>For once, the rough conditions have played the UK an even hand with miserable weather expected almost everywhere as at least four different fronts jostle their way across the country. The Meteorological Office's second most urgent warning level \u2013 amber for 'be prepared' \u2013 forms four lozenges on an overall pattern of yellow \u2013 'be aware', which continues all day and into Tuesday.</p> <p>One front has moved from the south-west, which was given an \"absolute deluge\" overnight according to the Met Office, to Kent and Sussex where Liberal Democrat delegates at the party's conference are advised to use umbrellas \u2013 and the kind that won't be blown inside out. The other three 'be prepared' areas are moving from Wales into the Midlands, across the northern Pennines into North Yorkshire, Durham and Northumbria and from Northern Ireland across to Lancashire and Cumbria.</p> <p>Unsettled and often windy weather is expected to plague much of the country for the next fortnight before drier conditions return. Temperatures are predicted to be some consolation for all the wet, with little in the way of fierce cold and slightly warmer than average conditions expected by the second week in October.</p> <p>Tom Tobler, forecaster with MeteoGroup, predicted two-thirds of the average rainfall for the whole of September \u2013 80mm (3.14ins) \u2013 could fall over southern Scotland and northern England on Monday and early on Tuesday, after an unusually dry month so far.</p> <p>He said: \"It will be almost a month's rainfall in certain areas. It is certainly a lot of rain. There will be some flooding. I imagine the figure for total rainfall in the month will get up to the average tomorrow, if not above it.\"</p> <p>The Environment Agency's director of operations, David Jordan, said: \"We are expecting flooding across the country into Monday and Tuesday. We strongly urge people to sign up to flood warnings, keep a close eye on local weather forecasts and be prepared for the possibility of flooding. We also ask that people stay safe, by staying away from swollen rivers and not attempting to drive through floodwater.\"</p> <p>Commuter rail services in the south-west have been disrupted with trains to London cancelled as sections of track were hit by flooding near Exeter and Tiverton in Devon. The main A30 and A390 roads have been badly affected by the sheer quantity of rain that swept tons of clay and soil from fields on to the A390 at St Ive.</p> <p>Train travellers were stranded for two hours in the Bristol area between the Severn Tunnel and Bristol Parkway station because of flooding in a tunnel.</p> <p>Flooding also rendered the line between Exeter St Davids and Taunton impassable. Bus services were laid on but struggled to get through flooded roads. Further north, there were rail delays between Rhyl and Chester.</p> <p>Rail services were also being badly affected between Chester and Crewe, Hereford and Shrewsbury and the Central Wales line from Swansea and Shropshire.</p> <p>Several schools were closed in Shropshire while in Herefordshire firefighters in boats had to rescue stranded motorists from their cars. By lunchtime Avon fire and rescue service had received more than 200 calls relating to flooding.</p> <p>Police forces urged motorists to take care. A spokesperson for the Avon and Somerset force said drivers should only venture out if they really had to: \"We are warning motorists to take particular care as they travel today following heavy rainfall in the area,\" the spokesperson said.</p> <p>\"There have been reports of spray and surface water across Avon and Somerset. Please allow extra time for your journey and consider if you really need to travel this morning. If you do, motorists are reminded to avoid going through deep water \u2013 a small number of motorists have already become stranded in their vehicles.\"</p> <p>Other areas particularly badly hit included the low-lying Somerset Levels, parts of Herefordshire and Dorset.</p> <p>Roads in parts of south Wales were also badly affected. Fire crews were called to help pump out flood water in Monmouth.</p> <p>A lifeboat from Rye in Sussex went to the aid of a fishing boat that was swamped shortly after leaving the harbour on Monday morning. Other fishing crews helped the rescue and the boat was secured with no injuries. .</p> <p>On the east Yorkshire coast a survey has shown that annual erosion of 1.7 metres (5.5ft) each year has increased in the last six months to almost 7 metres (22ft) in places, probably because of the level of rainfall destabilising the soil.</p>",
  "<p>In 2009, CultureLabel published the eBook <a href=\"http://www.culturelabel.com/agency/\" title=\"\">Intelligent Naivety</a> about the emerging field of cultural entrepreneurship. Rather than focus on ideas, which hardly seemed in short supply for those we met in the cultural sector, we explored strategies designed to turn those ideas into reality for generating new commercial revenue within cultural organisations.</p> <p>At the heart of our thinking was the start-up mentality of creating something out of nothing: forming the structures, alliances and strategies to leverage the assets you already have, rather than being restricted by financial constraints. Three years on, in the midst of tough economic times, that advice stands as true as ever.</p> <p>Cultural entrepreneurship is a win-win scenario, developing new audiences as well as the opportunity for creating revenue to invest back into cultural content. Intelligent Naivety analysed a range of innovative organisations \u2013 from the corporate giants of the eighties to the dotcoms of the noughties \u2013 in an attempt to document their 'secret ingredients'.</p> <p>Our own cultural entrepreneurship niche at <a href=\"http://www.culturelabel.com\" title=\"\">CultureLabel</a> is retail. But we've witnessed a flood of other opportunities emerging for the aspiring cultural entrepreneur, as consumers are increasingly demanding what the cultural sector is well positioned to supply.</p> <p>Even in the midst of this economic downturn, demand for cultural content, brands and experiences is booming. In the UK, pop stars like Coldplay and Rihanna can barely compete with the 2011 blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/nov/07/leonardo-da-vinci-national-gallery\" title=\"\">Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition at the National Gallery</a>, with a total sell-out seeing tickets being resold for up to \u00a3400. In the same year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/04/tate-modern-10th-anniversary\" title=\"\">Tate Modern turned 10 years old</a> \u2013 a building designed for two million visitors now caters for close to six million annually; a new extension is already underway.</p> <p>Supplying this consumer demand is not just reserved for large organisations. Entrepreneurship means the playing field can be levelled. Take the experience economy, where consumers demand 'real' experiences, in part to counteract their increasingly digital worlds. The cultural sector has been quick to respond and drive this trend.</p> <p>Punchdrunk is pushing immersive theatre to new levels. Its New York based show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/25/punchdrunk-digital-innovation-sleep-no-more\" title=\"\">Sleep no More</a> has been running for more than a year with ticket prices of $75. Tate Modern has embraced performance art in the launch of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2012/jul/17/tate-modern-tanks-video-preview\" title=\"\">its new Tank spaces</a> and the live experience provided by the cultural sector generally, combined with its shiny new temples part-funded by the lottery, have proved a huge draw to the public. This should fill us with confidence \u2013 from the niche appeal of You Me Bum Bum Train to the blockbuster Frankenstein at the National Theatre.</p> <p>With nearly 50% of the global population in cities (about 3 billion people) 'citysumers', as they've been termed, tend to be more adventurous and ravenous for these experiences. Social media is allowing a new generation of thrill-seekers to zero in en masse on the next big thing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/05/secret-cinema-new-way-pull-audiences\" title=\"\">Secret Cinema's rapid growth</a> is a by-product of both of these trends and its commercial success is funding the artistic endeavours of <a href=\"http://www.futureshorts.com/\" title=\"\">parent company Future Shorts</a>. Its production of Lawrence of Arabia at Alexandra Palace saw 15,000 fans in Bedouin attire descending on the venue. As sponsors like Microsoft and Nokia create associations with the experience, Secret Cinema has moved into new releases. More people saw its version of Prometheus, transformed into the Alien universe at a huge warehouse near Euston, than did at the BFI IMAX per night. How much does it spend on conventional print marketing? Nothing. It cleverly uses its core community to drive word of mouth through social media.</p> <p>While we are by no means immune to economic pressures, cultural organisations should still have the confidence to think big and defy the downturn. The intersection between culture, technology and entrepreneurship is where some of the world's best ideas are emerging. The current levels of innovation in each of these sectors individually is fast-paced \u2013 but put these trends together, remix and match, and the opportunities become exhilarating.</p> <p>Whether it's the trend, or the counter-trend, we believe these could form the basis of some bright new entrepreneurial ideas within the culture industry. The opportunities afforded by embracing entrepreneurship are immense, but it's also worth considering the dangers of not doing so.</p> <p>It is hard to make change happen in an organisation if the model does not appear to be broken. Kodak were the inventors of the digital camera, yet its reluctance to fully recognise and embrace the digital revolution ultimately led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/19/kodak-why-moment-has-passed\" title=\"\">its market downfall</a>. Cultural organisations should always be asking themselves this question: if we did not already exist, would we build us again?</p> <p>Closer to the cultural sector, Amazon has now created the biggest library in the world by allowing millions of eBooks to be shared effectively free of charge for a limited period between users in the US. Five years ago, would you have believed eBooks would be the dominant sales format on Amazon?</p> <p>But how do we survive and thrive in an environment where change is the constant? How might a global network of institutions work together to roll out products rapidly by working together in ways not previously contemplated? In developing products and platforms with international potential, how do we create new structures that will allow us to compete? Who are our partners for these tasks?</p> <p>This is what our new eBook REMIX, produced in collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network\" title=\"\">Guardian Culture Professionals Network</a>, seeks to answer. As innovation in culture, entrepreneurship and technology becomes increasingly intertwined, we are about to witness the ascendancy of the cultural entrepreneur who is able to knit these diverse worlds together. There are certainly enough global, national and local opportunities and challenges that need a creative solution.</p> <p><em>The REMIX eBook will be sent exclusively to members of the </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Culture Professionals Network</em></a><em> \u2013 </em><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/culture-professionals\" title=\"\"><em>sign up here</em></a><em> to receive this and many other benefits</em></p> <p><em>Peter Tullin is co-founder of </em><a href=\"http://culturelabel.com\" title=\"\"><em>CultureLabel</em></a><em> \u2013 follow him and the company on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/petertullin\" title=\"\"><em>@PeterTullin</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/culturelabel\" title=\"\"><em>@culturelabel</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The US box-office slide continues. Studio executives could not have been happy when they scoured the numbers over their double espressos yesterday, but there is good and bad associated with all this. The bad news is that box office was down around 25-28% compared to last year, depending on whether you look at only the top 12 grosses or every movie in release. The good news is that well-made independent films (albeit movies that audiences may not always embrace) are breaking into the top 10 and mixing it up in a stomping ground traditionally dominated by the big six studios and the likes of Lionsgate, Summit (now owned by Lionsgate) and the Weinstein Company.</p> <p>Heading into Sunday evening, two films were neck-and-neck (on around $13m) for the coveted No 1 spot \u2013 and both hail from outside the studio system. One was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148734/end-of-watch\" title=\"\">End of Watch</a>, a fast-paced tale of gung-ho cops on patrol in south central Los Angeles, financed and produced by Exclusive Media Group and Emmett/Furla Films. The US distribution rights were sold to Open Road, a young distributor formed by the cinema chains AMC and Regal.</p> <p>The other contender was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149396/house-at-the-end-of-the-street\" title=\"\">House at the End of the Street</a>, starring <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/mar/23/the-hunger-games-video-review\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, star of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a>. FilmNation, an international sales agency that has been moving into production, made it with a smaller partner called A Bigger Boat, run by Peter Block, who oversaw production on the Saw franchise back in his Lionsgate days. Block's former colleague Tom Ortenberg worked there, too, and also served time at the Weinstein Company. Ortenberg now runs Open Road.</p> <p>This group of bright, highly experienced executives who are prepared to exploit opportunities in the market epitomises the new distribution landscape. As the studios contract their output to focus on 12-15 tentpole releases a year, new operators are rushing in to fill the space. Well-capitalised companies such as Relativity, Open Road and FilmDistrict, along with FilmNation and IM Global \u2013 neither of the last two is a distributor but both provide content \u2013 are able to provide studio-level movies with increasingly broad appeal.</p> <p>End of Watch and House didn't deliver huge opening weekend numbers, but the companies behind them have the clout to fund marketing campaigns and make a splash of sorts. After all, no studio movie ranked higher than them this weekend, and you can be sure both will enjoy a healthy future in the ancillary markets of DVD, VoD and digital.</p> <p>IM Global and its Indian parent company, Reliance, financed and produced <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149147/dredd\" title=\"\">Dredd</a>, the generally well-reviewed Judge Dredd remake starring Karl Urban. This one previewed at Comic-Con last July and premiered in Toronto, but fell short of expectations in the harsh proving grounds of theatrical release. It debuted in sixth place on $6.3m. Decent word of mouth may help Dredd stick around and it, too, will prosper on ancillary platforms.</p> <p>Clint Eastwood rarely appears in a movie these days unless he's directing \u2013 you have to go back to 1993 and Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire \u2013 but the old warhorse took the plunge on Warner Bros' gentle father-daughter drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149498/trouble-with-the-curve\">Trouble With the Curve</a>, from Robert Lorenz. It opened in third place on $12.7m. Earlier in the year, Warner Bros harboured hopes the movie might merit an awards campaign, but the mediocre response from critics and audiences seems to have put the kibosh on that.</p> <p>On the other hand, an illustrious awards career surely awaits Paul Thomas Anderson's latest work, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146341/master\" title=\"\">The Master</a>. The movie may have the commercial chops to match its artistic pedigree and climbed 12 places to No 7 this weekend for a $5m gross. The running total is $6.1m after two weekends. The distributor is Harvey Weinstein. The 85th Academy Awards takes place on 24 February 2013. I'm just saying.</p> <h2>North American top 10, 21-23 September 2012</h2> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148734/end-of-watch\" title=\"\">End of Watch</a>, $13m</p> <p>2. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149396/house-at-the-end-of-the-street\" title=\"\">House at the End of the Street</a>, $13m</p> <p>3. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149498/trouble-with-the-curve\">Trouble With the Curve</a>, $12.7m</p> <p>4. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/95989/finding.nemo\" title=\"\">Finding Nemo 3D</a>, $9.4m.

  "<p>The 80 million-strong Communist party of China is famously contradictory \u2013 impressively unified in its ability to maintain power, but riven with internal divisions about issues like the role of the market in China, or the function of non-state companies. A botched leadership change this autumn would cause the sort of vicious infighting that led to the collapse of other one-party systems elsewhere.</p> <p>For this reason, the current Chinese leadership, led by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao have been planning this tricky succession for many years. All looked smooth at the end of last year, but as the all-important party congress nears, the process looks increasingly shaky. The fall of key contender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bo-xilai\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai</a> after his wife was accused of murder and he of corruption in the spring was the start of it. The fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>, heir apparent to Hu, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/15/chinese-leader-xi-jinping-appears-public\" title=\"\">disappeared from view </a>for two weeks in September further raised the temperature. In a political system as opaque and controlling as the current Chinese one, speculation becomes the sole recourse for a population \u2013 inside and outside China \u2013 which has never been hungrier for information.</p> <p>The Hu-Wen period leaves one major legacy to successors: immense growth. China's economy is now four times the size it was in 2002 when they came to power, rising from sixth to second place in global rankings, with the greatest amount of foreign reserves, and the largest levels of exports and second largest imports.</p> <p>Growth has created a number of problems however \u2013 greater inequality, environmental and energy supply problems, and a rise in visible tension in society as elites and other interest groups clash, using newly available social media or other legal means to press their case. The eruption of anger over pensions, lack of property rights, and legal redress over official malfeasance is expensive to keep under control. China now spends more on internal security than on national defence. The headache for the new leaders will be how to balance the continuing need for growth against other sociopolitical reforms that will be politically risky, but are the only way to try to create stability and balance in a society which is becoming wealthier, freer and more unruly.</p> <p>The life of elite leaders is not made any easier by the fact that China is now in an era when the tension between the officials and those they are meant to be ruling has reached fever pitch. Surveys show that central leaders just about maintain some moral credibility in society \u2013 but local leaders are regarded with large amounts of loathing. Levels of cynicism about politics in China are on a par with, or even in excess, of those in the west. Most regarded the treatment of Bo Xilai as crude political theatre, created to manoeuvre a clever communicator and a potentially threatening popular leader out of the way. The only given in the current situation is that levels of suspicion against official discourse is high, and the default of most people is disbelief. This is not a good context in which to try to undertake radical reforms.</p> <p>The new leaders have their hands tied because their macroeconomic policy is already set out in the five-year programme from 2011 to 2015. Only catastrophe would make them change this important statement of consensus. They will also be curtailed by questions about the legitimacy of how they were appointed \u2013 this is a process which has never been tried before in this way in China, and many could question it, inside and outside the party \u2013 and by the need to keep on board \"retired\" leaders who are likely to remain active behind the scenes. Their political capital will be low at the start, and it will be a hard slog trying to find easy ways to acquire it quickly.</p> <p>The post Hu and Wen leadership will have, in addition to the ally of growth, one other great helper. There is, at the moment, no alternative to the party \u2013 all effective opposition has been crushed. The party is able to present itself, under whatever leadership, as the great stabilising force, and it can wave horrifying visions of the debilitating effects of instability and disunity before a population that, for the most part, shows strong interest in getting richer and little in pushing for risky political change.</p> <p>So far, this social contract seems to be holding up. The party rules, and the people get more prosperous. But the question of how long that can continue \u2013 of what happens if the growth rate falls, or the wealth gap continues to increase \u2013 is a real and pressing one.</p> <p>For Hu and Wen, China had to grow rich and strong. For the next generation, Chinese society must grow more balanced, more just and more predictable. Achieving that will be a hard task, especially if it also involves maintaining the Communist party's utterly unique place in society.</p>",

  "<p>Cassandra keeps calling to me. Cassandra, given the gift of prophecy by Apollo, but then punished with a curse ensuring no one would ever believe her once she rebuffed his sexual advances. Cassandra, a metaphor for our times.</p> <p>Think of the alarms raised about the impact of violence against women and girls during the past 15 years, since we launched V-Day to raise awareness about the horror.</p> <p>Recently, 46 activists at the first <a href=\"http://www.vday.org/node/2951\" title=\"\">V-Day Africa Summit</a> in Nairobi found themselves in a room of Cassandras, some recently out of jail for protesting against female genital mutilation, some unable to show their faces for fear of retribution, some with missing body parts following a rape, some challenging their governments and religious institutions with radical performances, some running for office.</p> <p>Think of how, when I have spoken out about the women and girls who have been raped in Congo's 13-year war for minerals to parliaments around the world, I have often been cautioned that my language is inflammatory or extreme, when in fact I have not come close to finding the words with which to express the horrors I have heard and witnessed.</p> <p>Think of Dr <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0skN_g4Veo\">Denis Mukwege of Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, Congo</a>, on the front lines of the war calling out to international leaders, only to be told he is exaggerating or inventing stories while everyday he sees bloody, mutilated vaginas and destroyed uteruses as he attempts to repair them. I think of how my own father spent so much of his life tarnishing my character, defining me as a liar, building a shield that would later protect him from my <a href=\"http://www.csun.edu/~sm60012/WS_300/OLD%20Group%20Projects/Eve%20Ensler%20webpage.htm\" title=\"\">adult accusations</a>. Discount Cassandra, delegitimise Cassandra, and you discount her story. Perhaps Cassandra is the metaphor of denial. Every day, my inbox is crammed with reports of atrocities and grotesque acts committed on women's bodies. I have learned that I must be judicious and mannered when I tell these stories, meting them out temperately so as not to overwhelm or disturb or frighten the listener, even though the stories I tell have destroyed their victims. I have learned how to pull back and maintain my distance because that is where legitimacy resides. But what of the 10-year-old girl in Texas raped and filmed by 20 men? What of Jeanne, tied to a tree for a month, now incontinent from gang rape? What of the women with missing hands, breasts, vaginas, legs and clitorises, the women with scars and holes inside them? What of elected officials who claim legitimate rape doesn't make you pregnant or parents who are convicted for so-called \"honour\" killing their own daughters for marrying the man of her choice? What of the 75,000 raped women every year in France, the two million who suffer female genital mutilation every year, or the 200 million girls missing a year in South Asia or the one in three women raped in the US military?</p> <p>Right now one out of every three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in her lifetime. That is a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/women/endviolence/pdf/pressmaterials/unite_the_situation_en.pdf\" title=\"\">UN statistic</a>. That is equivalent to one billion women and girls.</p> <p>There are two possible futures.</p> <p>One is a future without women, where rape is so prevalent that it kills love and tenderness and intimacy and connection. Right now, for example, in Congo and other war zones, there are thousands of children who are the product of rape, exiled and rejected like a foreign species.</p> <p>Then there is the other future. It begins on 14 February, 2013. It begins as we prepare for <a href=\"http://onebillionrising.org/\" title=\"\">One Billion Rising</a>, a call to the billion women who have been violated and the men who love them, to the women who have been beaten and raped and mutilated and burned and sold and who know the destruction of the female species heralds the end of human kind. A call to walk out of your homes, your jobs, your schools and find your friends, your group, your place and music and dance. A global dance action, our feet on the earth. And in these months leading to One Billion Rising we will link our issues and stories and villages and cities to the dancing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gl2AO-7Vlzk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gl2AO-7Vlzk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>reading this on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gl2AO-7Vlzk\">Click here to view</a><br>How do you break a curse?

We will come to see that it is not a local issue or particular to any culture or religion or village or age. We will come to see what is possible. Already people from 161 countries and rising have signed up.</p> <p>Thousands of organisations including Amnesty International USA, International Rescue Committee Global Green, NOW, Planned Parenthood, Women Thrive Worldwide and many others are joining us, including unions that reach a combined total of more than 24.7 million members. In the UK, we've already received support from Unite.</p> <p>Stella Creasy MP is taking the campaign to parliament and members of the European Parliament even performed The Vagina Monologues as a cross-party call to action.</p> <p>Churches are stepping up. In the US, St John the Divine Cathedral in New York and Grace Cathedral in San Francisco have opened their spaces for dancing. Aboriginal women in Queensland, Australia are taking over a stadium there.</p> <p>Short films with Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Rosario Dawson, Ruby Wax, Nicola Adams, and chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Fatou Bensouda, and Jane, a survivor and activist from Congo will help launch the campaign in the Guardian this week and online at onebillionrising.org. Dancing insists we take up space. It breaks the rules. It can happen anywhere at any time with anyone and everyone. It's free. It's contagious and it spreads quickly.</p> <p>Imagine, something we have only seen in our Cassandra dreams: our bodies dancing and moving and shaking the way we were always meant to move and dance and shake. Dancing, drumming feet, stomping hips, moving \u2013 more thunderous then Apollo's intimidation, shaking free his curse.</p> <p>Then we will finally believe Cassandra, that voice inside us, that voice that knows the truth and the way. One billion Cassandras and more, freed and rising.</p>",
  "<p>The president of one of the most impoverished, corrupt and mineral-rich countries on Earth has insisted he can turn it into a stable democracy and economic powerhouse, declaring: \"I will be both the Mandela and the Obama of Guinea.\"</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Alpha Cond\u00e9 said Guinea had left behind half a century of military coups and despotic regimes and was on an \"irreversible\" march to democracy.

More than half of Guinea's population lives in poverty and 70% are illiterate. It ranks near the bottom of global corruption, development and governance indices.</p> <p>Last year, Cond\u00e9 himself was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/19/guinea-president-survives-assassination-attempt\" title=\"\">targeted by assassins</a> who fired a rocket-propelled grenade into his compound, killing a bodyguard and raising questions over whether civilian rule could last. \"It's been 50 years so change will require some time,\" he said. \"We believe it is irreversible but it will require time.</p> <p>\"One must understand that changing mentalities and changing mindsets are very difficult. The challenges are many and there are many obstacles to change: there were many who benefited from the former system and will therefore resist the change process that we believe is irreversible because the youth wants it. We are looking to the youth.\"</p> <p>The prospect of an end to the chaos has triggered a scramble for Guinea's vast mineral reserves. It is the world's largest producer of bauxite, used to make aluminium, and boasts vast iron ore deposits as well as diamonds, gold and uranium. Rio Tinto, Vale and the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) are among the mining giants competing fiercely.</p> <p>How to carve up the cake, and learn lessons from the past by ducking the \"resource curse\" that has wreaked poverty and conflict on many countries, was the central theme of the recent Guinea economic forum that included ministers, investors, the British ambassador, the World Bank, the IMF, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford University economist Paul Collier. The Guardian's attendance was funded by the UNDP.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE72100X20110302?sp=true\" title=\"\">turned to the billionaire investor Soros</a> to help draw up a mining code that would reduce corruption and increase the government's stake from 15% to 35%.</p> <p>He said the World Bank had granted Guinea $20m (\u00a312.3m) to hire banks and lawyers and set up technical and strategic committees to oversee the process. \"We need to start engaging on an even footing with the mining companies. We still have much to do in terms of anti-corruption but we feel we have reached some important milestones already.\"</p> <p>The president is also receiving support from Blair, whose charity the <a href=\"http://www.africagovernance.org\" title=\"\">Africa Governance Initiative</a> has deployed advisers to Conakry to help instil sound leadership and attract foreign investment. Blair's office has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/9136126/Tony-Blair-expands-his-African-empire-into-mineral-rich-Guinea.html\" title=\"\">denied that he has any commercial interest in Guinea</a>.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 said: \"Mr Blair is helping the country in capacity building. We are the first francophone country he has come into. He has learned from his experience at Downing Street that it is not enough for a leader to have a vision; the centre of power should also be concentrated around the leader so he can empower himself to bring about his vision.\"</p> <p>The president's vision is under scrutiny, however. A year ago three protesters were killed during clashes between police and demonstrators at a banned opposition rally. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/guinea-urged-investigate-opposition-protest-deaths-2011-09-28\" title=\"\">Amnesty International warned</a>: \"It's deeply alarming that President Alpha Cond\u00e9 is resorting to exactly the same brutal methods as his predecessors.\"</p> <p>In July, Cond\u00e9's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/08/us-guinea-mine-protest-idUSBRE8770VV20120808\" title=\"\">security forces clashed with villagers</a> demanding jobs in the village of Zogota, where Vale and the Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz's BSG Resources are jointly seeking to develop an iron ore mine. Local rights groups claimed five protesters were killed, while the government has launched an investigation.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9, who is bound by the constitution to serve no more than two terms, denies that he will join the African hall of infamy as a liberator turned tyrant. \"Maybe, unlike others, I took 50 years to get to power,\" he said. \"I'm not a young man any more, or a 30-year-old, so I've reached a stage of maturity.</p> <p>\"When I was in prison, tremendous support arose throughout Africa and I feel I have a challenge to show the youth who believed in me then that I can bring about a new leadership for Africa \u2013 a leadership based on good governance, the respect of democratic freedom. It's very important for me to live up to that expectation.\"</p> <p>Political opponents, however, accuse Cond\u00e9 of stoking ethnic tensions and excluding them from the new Guinea. Parliamentary elections have been delayed by wrangling.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9's centralisation of power has raised eyebrows abroad. <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/ousmane-diagana\" title=\"\">Ousmane Diagana</a>, the World Bank's country director, said: \"He delivered on economic reforms but I think on the political aspect he is relatively slow when we take into consideration the type of new consensus that needs to be built around governance based on stronger political institutions.</p> <p>\"I think they need to have a frank debate. Guineans need to be around the same table to discuss the political agenda and how it can actually support the economic transformation.\"</p> <p>Diagana added: \"We're hoping the president is the right person to do that given his background and trajectory, but the fact this conversation is not taking place between the opposition and the government in charge is worrying.\"</p> <p>The scale of the challenge facing Cond\u00e9, and Guinea, just two years into democracy is daunting. There was a timely reality check from Donald Kaberuka, the president of the <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org\" title=\"\">African Development Bank</a>. \"Guinea has wasted too much time,\" he told the forum. \"At the time when the rest of Africa is moving on, this is time for Guinea and Guineans to come together through strong political institutions, to come together through transparent economic governance. The hard work begins now.\"</p>",

She writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What's happening in Brighton is clear enough. The Lib Dems think of themselves as essentially a centre-left party, and are wallowing in the fantasy of presenting themselves as progressive politicians, ready to squeeze the rich and green the nation. The trouble is, in a few days' time, they make the short journey back north to Westminster \u2013 where they return to a centre-right government run by people who share none of these views.<br>The Lib Dem fantasy is to concentrate on the one-day, might-be coalition with Labour they'd prefer, and policies they'd follow then. Who knows? It could happen. But meanwhile, by far the likeliest outcome of this posturing is that Clegg's new red lines on tax will simply mean minimal planning by the government on fiscal policy generally. He can stop Osborne making deeper welfare cuts \u2013 that's useful, and worth it \u2013 while Osborne can end his hopes of further taxes on the rich. It will be economic stalemate, very like the constitutional stalemate that followed the frustrating of Lords reform and boundary changes.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Andrew Sparrow's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/lib-dem-conference-cable-clegg-live\">politics live blog</a> will be covering all the day's events, and you can see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-democrat-conference-2012\">the Guardian's full conference coverage here</a></p> <p>\u2022 More evidence of the distress being caused by the government's <strong>welfare reforms</strong>.

He writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... borrowing, amongst other things, brought the Labour government down. The Tories said we had to stop it because it was putting a millstone round the neck of future generations. They have used it as an excuse to cut public services, privatise the NHS, place a debt burden on all students for generations to come by massively increasing student fees and so loans (even though they claim that this is a disaster if applied to the country as a whole) and to slash beenfits and pensions. And the process has only just begun: 80% of the cuts have yet to happen.<br>They said they had to do this to keep the markets happy. They said interest rates would sky-rocket if they did not cut. They said we'd be like Greece. They said our economy would collapse. Well, we might be in recession but none of those things have happened.

  "<p>The giant <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operative Group</a> and several <a href=\"https://socialenterprise.guardian.co.uk/en/articles/social-enterprise-network/2012/jun/29/different-brands-british-co-operatives\" title=\"\">regional co-operative societies</a> have been hard at work in recent years rebadging their businesses to reflect \"The Co-operative\" brand. But, until now, the brand has gone no further than the long-established and traditional wing of the consumer co-operative movement. Now it is being stretched further, to embrace an independent co-operative offering telecoms services.</p> <p>The decision by the <a href=\"http://thephone.coop/\" title=\"\">Phone Co-op</a> to take up the brand is significant, both for its own future and, arguably, for the co-operative movement more widely. The Phone Co-op is a relative youngster co-operatively speaking, having been set up in 1998 by its managing director Vivian Woodell, who felt there should be a co-op presence in the rapidly liberalising world of telecoms provision. Its 9,000 members have enthusiastically demonstrated that the nineteenth century idea of consumer co-operatives still works well today. The annual elections for board members are usually very strongly contested and, with broadly a quarter of the membership voting in elections, the Phone Co-op has the sort of active democracy larger co-operative societies dream of.</p> <p>Its members are loyal, too, in an industry where customer churn is commonplace. Helped by some recent acquisitions (most notably the purchase of Saga's phone business), turnover has passed \u00a310m. But, as Vivian Woodell explains, growing a telecoms business remains challenging. \"The cost in the industry of acquiring customers is going up and up, and is becoming a very significant part of what people are paying,\" he says.</p> <p>The Phone Co-op has successfully gained customers through affinity schemes with a host of campaigns and charities, including the <a href=\"http://www.greenparty.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Green Party</a>, <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/\" title=\"\">the Soil Association</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WWF</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cpre.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a> and it is about to launch a new tie-up with <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Amnesty International</a>. Nevertheless, there is a sense that this pool of potential customers is becoming exhausted. \"The [Co-operative] brand gives us an opportunity to get in front of a lot more people,\" Woodell says.</p> <p>He says that the decision followed focus group work by the Phone Co-op, which suggested an encouraging level of recognition of the standard Co-operative brand. \"People talked about ethics and fair trade, and knew what a co-operative was,\" he says. \"Using the Co-operative brand is in a sense a shortcut for us in demonstrating what we stand for.\"</p> <p>The Co-operative brand is looked after by the Co-operative Group and by representatives of those regional societies which have adopted it, and their acceptance of the Phone Co-op as a participant is a clear signal of Woodell's success in creating a credible new co-operative society. The Phone Co-op is now marketing itself to individual customers as \"The Co-operative Phone and Broadband\" and \"The Co-operative Mobile\", and to business clients as \"The Co-operative Business Telecoms\".</p> <p>If there has been a criticism within the movement of the brand, however, it is that the general public may not understand that some of the businesses using it are independent co-operatives and not part of the dominant Co-operative Group. It was this inability to flag up their own autonomy which has prevented the <a href=\"http://lincolnshire.coop/\" title=\"\">Lincolnshire Co-operative</a>, for example, from joining the national brand.</p> <p>Woodell readily agrees that this is an issue which his co-operative considered carefully. The Phone Co-op has previously tried to bring as many of its customers as possible into membership (currently about a third of its customers are members), but the risk is there, that new customers who are already members of other co-ops may not understand the need to pay a further \u00a31 to join the Phone Co-op. \"We are adapting our communications to get the message across that the services are being brought by the Phone Co-op. In all our member communications, we're going to be very clear about that,\" Woodell explains. He points out that <a href=\"http://www.midcounties.coop/\" title=\"\">Midcounties</a> co-operative society already uses the brand and still attracts a relatively strong level of member engagement.</p> <p>Just possibly, the Phone Co-op's adoption of the brand may have a spin-off in helping raise public awareness more generally about the organisation of Britain's complicated consumer co-operative movement. Matt Lane, the Phone Co-op's marketing and partnerships manager, certainly sees an opportunity . \"We feel we have a responsibility to educate people about the movement,\" he says, arguing that more people may begin to understand that the brand is a collective venture by several co-operative societies. The brand has been adopted by Midcounties, <a href=\"http://www.angliacooperative.co.uk/food/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Anglia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.midlands.coop/\" title=\"\">Midlands</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thesouthernco-operative.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Southern</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chelmsfordstar.coop/\" title=\"\">Chelmsford Star</a>, <a href=\"http://www.21stcentury.coop/\" title=\"\">Heart of England</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tamworth.coop/\" title=\"\">Tamworth</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.radstock-co-op.com/\" title=\"\">Radstock societies</a>, as well as by the Co-operative Group itself.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Phone Co-op itself may not necessarily always stick just to the relatively low-margin business of telecoms re-selling. It is known to have previously looked into electricity and gas re-selling, and has recently dipped a toe into micro-generation, particularly the solar panel business. It has also been exploring possible partnership arrangements with like-minded business organisations in continental Europe. Woodell says that he remains alert for possible acquisitions: \"In the current market, in a rapidly consolidating industry it's very hard not to be in the market to do acquisitions,\" he says. As well as the Saga deal, the Phone Co-op recently took over a small venture, Transcend Communications.</p> <p>The prognosis looks promising. After three years of limited growth, the Phone Co-op has, according to Woodell, just completed a much more profitable trading year. The level of dividends to be paid to members is something which legally the members themselves will vote on at the AGM early next year, but the prospects for an increase on last year's 1% dividend must be looking encouraging.</p> <p><em>Andrew Bibby is a professional writer and journalist</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>They didn't break the record by any means, but a good, if chilly, time was had by all.

Here's her take:</p> <blockquote> <p>It was a liberating experience. It was very cold to start with, but then I kind of went numb. Once I warmed up, I felt as though my body was burning.

  "<h2>Cluing coincidence</h2> <p>Two misleading methods for meteorologists this week. <a href=\"https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/30a26c963542eb0a01398bfe9a4802d2/print_solution/3\">Friday's Times</a> put the word \"Met\" at the start of the clue to draw attention from its capital...</p> <blockquote> <p>27ac <strong>Met fellow</strong> <em>installing</em> a heating unit <em>in</em> a new <em>complex</em> (10)</p> </blockquote> <p>...which via the Met Office gives us WEATHERMAN, while <a href=\"http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=17726\">the previous day's Telegraph</a> pulled a similar trick...</p> <blockquote> <p>5d <strong>Fish, perhaps?</strong> Then raw meat <em>cooked</em> <em>with time running out</em> (10)</p> </blockquote> <p>...with Michael Fish en route to the same destination: WEATHERMAN. However you clue him, though, the weatherman has changed his vocabulary over the weekend: less of the \"balmy\"s and \"clement\"s and more of the \"blirty\"s, \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18461189\">plothering</a>\"s and \"squally\"s.</p> <p>Oxford tells us that SQUALL used to be used as a term of abuse for a small or insignificant person, but the wet kind is another of those nautical terms we enjoy at this blog, as usual with an obscure origin. It probably comes from an earlier, imitative sense - a violent scream; the adjectival form is seldom now used to describe children and is most often heard on the Shipping Forecast - so, reader, it's another Q: how would you clue SQUALLY SHOWERS?</p> <h2>Themes and tricks</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/dec/01/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-tramp\">Tramp</a> gave us <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25744\">the latest of his themed puzzles</a>, starring WOODY, BARBIE, SLINKY DOG, MR POTATO HEAD and BUZZ LIGHTYEAR.

In Thursday's Independent Anax set a puzzle containing a clue...</p> <blockquote> <p>16ac <strong>At this milestone</strong> newspaper<em>'s opened</em> for yes - daily <em>cryptic</em> (5,5,3)</p> </blockquote> <p>...for FIFTY YEARS OLD but, the setter being a gent, the dedicatee was of course not himself, but, hidden in the non-crossing squares, his Independent colleague KLINGSOR, whose FT pseudonym ALBERICH was also squirreled away. Happy birthday, Klingsor.</p> <p>Meanwhile, two setters have been poking some gentle fun at a venerable volume. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/sep/22/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-paul\">Punk</a> in Tuesday's Independent appeared to be dissing the dictionary...</p> <blockquote> <p>12ac <strong>Chambers</strong> isn't clever - <em>it's stupid!</em> (10)</p> </blockquote> <p>...but was in fact looking for some lower-case chambers, the VENTRICLES, while the mysterious Triple themed a <a href=\"http://www.listenercrossword.com/\">Listener</a> around a specific definition, asking the solver to write below the grid \"THE CHAMBERS REF OF CIRCULAR GOES...\", because:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The <em>Chambers</em> entry for 'circular' is circular in that it includes 'in the form of a circle', while a circle is defined as 'a circular object'. Letters not indicated by wordplay in the cryptic clues give ROUND AND, located in circular fashion in the grid, so that it can be read thematically <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a user of the Crossword Centre's Message Board noted: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although I admire the refreshing iconoclasm involved in this little dig at Chambers, it seems very pedantic to pick out one definition from the several supplied for each of two words and draw attention to their reliance on each other (especially as the entry for 'circle' begins with a proper mathematical-like definition anyway).</p> </blockquote> <h2>Culture clue</h2> <p>Friday's Telegraph had a double dose of Beatlemania, with <a href=\"http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=17728\">the cryptic</a> visiting...</p> <blockquote> <p>11ac Beware of sailors en masse in <strong>old Liverpool club</strong>!

Paul's original name for the spinster, Miss Daisy Hawkins, wouldn't have allowed the anagram of his bandmate, one of many reasons to be glad he changed it.</p> <h2>Cluing competition</h2> <p>Thanks for your clues for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/sep/17/1?commentpage=all\">SQUEEGEE MERCHANT</a>.

  "<p>The Yemeni government is desperately hoping the Friends of Yemen group of international donors meeting on 27 September will result in more promises of aid alongside the $6.4bn already <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/06/money-yemen-humanitarian-crisis\" title=\"\">pledged by donors</a> to counter Yemen's growing humanitarian crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/cap/appeals/mid-year-review-humanitarian-response-plan-yemen-2012\" title=\"\">Ten million Yemenis</a>, about 45% of the population, are going hungry in the Arab world's poorest state. Unemployment is at a disastrous 70% and, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2b1da2de-f6ac-11e1-827f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz273s4zdZS\" title=\"\">according to the IMF</a>, in 2011 the economy contracted by 10.5%, while inflation hit 17.6%.</p> <p>Mohammed al-Saadi, Yemen's planning and international co-operation minister, told delegates at the last Friends of Yemen meeting, in Riyadh on 4 September, that Yemen needed \"$11.9bn in the short term\". So far, the major donors responding to his call have been Saudi Arabia, the US and several EU states, including Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.</p> <p>The Yemeni government, and the international community, seem to view aid as essential to Yemen's future development. Yet there is an ongoing debate among Yemenis about just how beneficial aid is proving to be. The debate is pitched in familiar terms \u2013 is aid good for the country in the long-term? How can aid organisations overcome the problems posed by corrupt institutions and inefficient bureaucracies?</p> <p>Young Yemenis, many politicised by the uprising against former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011, are split. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2D8qFkYwWc\" title=\"\">A debate was held</a> in May at the Spanish embassy in Sana'a and, perhaps surprisingly, 60% of the attendees voted in favour of the motion: \"Foreign aid to Yemen causes more harm than good.\"</p> <p>Atiaf al-Wazir, a researcher and blogger, spoke for the motion in Sana'a, and still supports it: \"We have a corrupt government that lacks the capacity to handle large amounts of aid. Before we keep pumping aid, we should build the capacity of the government and make sure it is more transparent so that the money can actually reach the people it is intended for.\"</p> <p>Aid to Yemen is inevitably tied up with the politics of the country. The organisations that foreign NGOs choose to deal with can often be seen as giving tacit approval to certain groups or factions. This then affects what Yemeni NGOs can and cannot do. Wazir says: \"Development aid has made some NGOs silent on other issues for fear that their opinion might cost them their funding.\"</p> <p>Yemenis like Wazir instead call for donor organisations to invest in the future of Yemen, with funds for educational institutes and vocational training, as well as increased job opportunities in the country and in the wider region. Baraa Shaiban, a youth activist, supports this approach: \"Short-term solutions might be needed in certain places, but it won't solve things in the long term. We need investment. Aid on its own won't solve the issue.\"</p> <p>Proponents of aid accept there have been problems in the past, but say aid is vital for the future of the country. Awssan Kamal, a member of the <a href=\"http://yrdf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Yemen Relief and Development Forum</a>, an umbrella charity set up by the Yemeni diaspora in the UK, says the forum is not simply looking at short-term solutions. \"The YRDF is looking forward to building development plans and not just short-term emergency responses, but these need to work in tandem,\" he says. \"How can you rebuild a country where people can't even feed themselves?\"</p> <p>Many Yemenis complain they have not benefited much from international aid, a view reflected by the human rights minister, Hooria Mashoor. \"Many [Yemenis] are not satisfied about international aid because they don't feel it,\" Mashoor says. \"It does not touch their life at all. Their life conditions are not improving.\"</p> <p>The forum aims to avoid the problems affecting other aid organisations working in Yemen that have tried to change Yemeni opinion on aid. The YRDF will only work with local NGOs that provide reports on where the money being sent to them is going, in an attempt to stamp out corruption.</p> <p>The group also aims to use the power of the 80,000-strong Yemeni diaspora in the UK to help Yemen to move forward. The community has already helped to raise \u00a3250,000 for aid. The sum is a drop in the ocean compared to the $6.4bn pledged by the international community, but British Yemenis view it as an important start and an effective means by which to lobby the UK government to carry on helping Yemen.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Yemen is worsening. Both pro- and anti-foreign aid advocates are desperately seeking ways to get the country out of the quagmire it is in. For now, the response of the international community is the same as ever: pump in more money.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mrh21\" title=\"\">New BBC Radio 1 breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw</a> said his first song in the job was \"not a big deal\". Except there could not have been a clearer statement of intent than his choice when he succeeded Chris Moyles on Monday morning: Niggas in Paris by Jay-Z and Kanye West.</p> <p>Grimshaw said he chose the Jay-Z and Kanye West song, which he called \"Paris\", thereby avoiding the difficult issue of its full title, because it was a great pop song.</p> <p>He said the tune was \"a little bit of what I want this show to be like music wise \u2013 big pop songs which are good\".</p> <p>\"We started the show with Jay-Z and Kanye West, Paris, radio edit, of course. Fingers crossed. That would have been an amazing way to fail \u2013 a real graphic sweary song as your first one. The world's shortest stint on the Radio 1 breakfast show \u2013 three and a half minutes,\" said the DJ.</p> <p>\"Everyone was making a big deal of what the first song should be. I thought, is it that big a deal? Obviously the job's a big deal, the show's a big deal, but the first song? I'm probably not going to be listening to it in the studio because I'll be having a panic attack and running around. Also is anyone up at 6.30am and going to remember that? It will probably be useful in a pub quiz one day.\"</p> <p>Explaining his choice, Grimshaw listed some of the first songs played by his predecessors, including Moyles (Pink's God Is A DJ) and Sara Cox (Robbie Williams's Let Me Entertain You).</p> <p>\"There was nothing really in the playlist that suited, nothing with a message, so I thought we'd go with Jay-Z and Kanye because we like that song and it's kind of a little bit of what I want this show to be like music wise \u2013 big pop songs which are good,\" said Grimshaw. \"There's awful pop music and then there's wonderful pop music like Jay-Z and Kanye, so there was a message but that was an afterthought.\"</p> <p>Grimshaw's brief is to bring a younger audience to the breakfast show than his 38-year-old predecessor Moyles, who fronted the slot for a record-breaking eight and a half years. It will in all likelihood be a smaller audience, which station controller Ben Cooper won't mind, just so long as it's not too much smaller.</p> <p>\"One listener, wicked,\" said Grimshaw as he read out a text message early into his first show. \"Just 7 million and a bit to go.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I am going to be here until I don't know how long, just until the country uprises and I get thrown back into night time.\"</p> <p>It wasn't just that Grimshaw was playing a different sort of music to Moyles \u2013 he also featured Your Drums, Your Love by AlunaGeorge (\"I play this a lot on my evening show,\" he explained) \u2013 but that he was playing much music at all.</p> <p>Brand new Grimshaw features included a \"wakeup\" song at 7am, \"Showquizness\" in which he takes part in a quiz with a listener, and \"Wheel of Four Tunes\" in which a tune is picked at random from a choice of four.</p> <p>Grimshaw was unrelentingly apologetic about all of them. \"I feel like it's gone OK, there's been a few shoddy features but it's day one,\" he told listeners.</p> <p>There was no shortage of big-name guests including Justin Bieber (pre-recorded), One Direction's Harry Styles (a man of few words, it turns out) and Doctor Who star Matt Smith, who had the misfortune to be the first guest to play the \"Wheel of Four Tunes\".</p> <p>Grimshaw said he had been \"dreaming of this since I was a little kid. I'm nervous, excited, happy, more than anything desperate to get on with it.\"</p> <p>Listeners expecting a Moyles-style \"zoo\" show would have been disappointed. Grimshaw introduced Ian, Fiona and his producer Matt Fincham, although we only really heard from \"Finchy\" Fincham.</p> <p>The Radio 1 head of programmes, Rhys Hughes, speaking before Monday's broadcast, said Grimshaw would aim to play between eight and 10 records an hour, roughly double what Moyles was playing.</p> <p>The more music-orientated show is now closer to commercial rivals such as Global Radio's Capital and Heart, and Bauer's Kiss.</p> <p>But Hughes said Radio 1's music policy wold put \"clear blue water\" between Grimshaw and the commercial stations. \"We play Skrillex, dubstep, hip-hop,\" he said. And Niggas in Paris. Just after 6.30am in the morning.</p> <p>Hughes said he expected some \"natural churn\" in the breakfast show's audience. \"Whenever you replace a presenter, particularly on the breakfast show, you get a natural audience churn. The fact Chris was here for eight and a half years, some listeners may go elsewhere, we will bring in new listeners as well.\"</p> <p>He added that he wanted the show to be \"funny, intelligent, and to prick the pomposity of celebrity culture. Nick is quite good at that. Some would argue that he is already in that celebrity world, but he is quite good at stepping outside of it and taking the mickey.\"</p> <p>The show will also feature lots more social media, which on Monday involved the launch of the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/R1Breakfast\" title=\"\">Radio 1 breakfast account on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>\"Social media will be integral to the whole programme,\" said Hughes. \"We are going to dial down the zoo format, but it's not to say the production team won't be on air.</p> <p>\"We want the audience to become almost the co-hosts of the show, we are going to have a lot more callers on air.\" We can only hope they have more to say than Styles.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Three months ago, it said that banks could temporarily run down some of the short-term cash set aside for future market shocks in a bid to stimulate lending and growth in the economy, but also recommended that banks should restrain payouts to shareholders and bonuses so they can build up cash reserves.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street is worried that UK banks are still sitting on huge losses from loans to businesses and mortgage holders dating back to the Lehman Brothers crash that have yet to be fully written down on their balance sheets.</p> <p>The FPC, which will publish minutes of its September meeting on Thursday, was formed as part of a wider shakeup of the UK regulatory system and is currently operating in an interim capacity.</p>",
  "<p>\"If we can't get the consumer involved, we will always be behind the curve.\" That's what M&amp;S CEO Marc Bolland said at the recent Plan A stakeholder consultation.</p> <p>The logic is compelling. It's a natural part of the journey to long-term success. Here are three steps to realising the need for action on consumer behaviour:</p> <h2><strong>Step one</strong><br></h2> <p>Look ahead 10, 20 or 30 years and identify the trends that would favour a strong future operating environment. This forces companies to look externally and identify the range of global issues that could prevent future success. They usually include issues such as energy, water and resource shortages.</p> <h2><strong>Step two</strong><br></h2> <p>Define your preferred future. That usually leads to identifying transformational programmes including projects that address the global issues found in step one. Smart companies can turn risks into opportunities as General Electric, GSK and IBM have done.</p> <p>At this point, the company is probably looking through what Marc Bolland describes as the \"industry lens\" and it may begin to make the changes required within the business and through the supply chain. After all, that's within its control.</p> <h2><strong>Step three</strong> <br></h2> <p>Companies then realise the critical importance of consumer behaviour change and the compelling case for change at scale comes into focus. For example, at Unilever the fact that consumer use of their products accounts for 68% of the company's greenhouse gas emissions is a strong reason for action.</p> <p><strong>But how do we persuade consumers to act?</strong></p> <p>The first option is to explore generic insight into behaviour change. Unilever, for example, has defined <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/images/Unilevers-Five-Levers-for-Change_tcm13-276805.pdf\" title=\"\">five levers for sustainable living</a> or tips to persuade consumers to act:</p> <p>\u2022 Make it understood (what you want people to do)</p> <p>\u2022 Make it easy (to act)</p> <p>\u2022 Make it desirable (to confirm customer's image of themselves)</p> <p>\u2022 Make it rewarding (demonstrate the benefit)</p> <p>\u2022 Make it a habit (remind people at the point of relevance)</p> <p>This approach is helpful. It benefits from insight into behavioural change including practical nudges such as social proof (if other people like me are doing it, it's increasingly likely that I will), choice editing (have people opt out rather than opt in), framing (frame the suggestion based on a knowledge of what will motivate them to act) and prompts (reminders at the point of relevance in space and time; much like the use of the green man for crossing the road).</p> <p>The kinds of examples here are recycling icons on Coke cans so it is easy to check if something can be recycled (prompt), editing out harmful ingredients from foods (choice editing), the introduction of \"me-size\" ready-made food portions, reminding people in car parks not to forget their bag for life (prompt), telling people in hotels the percentage of people who have re-used their towel in their hotel room (social proof, framing) or providing apps that make sustainable behaviours fun.</p> <p>However, nudges are not enough. Imagine I am a private sector utility and I want to reduce sewer blockages. Using the \"industry lens\" I focus on engineering solutions. Using the \"consumer lens\" for the first time I want to change customer behaviour and stop people putting the wrong stuff down sinks and loos.</p> <p>Traditional methods have always been ineffective even if they use behavioural insight. I don't just want to increase generic awareness of an issue and make it easy to act. I want to have a measurable outcome \u2013 fewer blockages. To achieve that I need a much deeper understanding of what material streams are causing blockages, what customer segments are putting these things down sinks and loos and a deep understanding of what would persuade people to act.</p> <p>That's what Anglian Water did with their <a href=\"http://keep-it-clear.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Keep It Clear</a> programme and within weeks achieved a measurable reduction in blockages.</p> <p>The difference is this. Nudges are usually informed tactics. To achieve real change at scale with a very high probability of success, you need to see customer behaviour change as a discipline and begin using the same professional standards as traditional marketing \u2013 except you are marketing behaviours, not products. You change one behaviour one audience at a time.</p> <p>The good news is that the discipline exists. It's called social marketing and it takes customer behaviour change beyond nudge tactics and into the world of customer behaviour change strategies that can persuade millions.</p> <p>This is a world in which you understand the six steps in a process to achieve real change, you understand the 10 major strategies to use to achieve change and you understand the 14 principle motivators that persuade people to act. It is a world of segmentation, of research, of behaviour and motivation analysis and of interventions \u2013 the points in the consumer journey where we touch their lives.</p> <p>It is a profession not just an understanding of current thinking on psychology, neuroscience and behavioural economics.</p> <p>It's a relatively new discipline and it works beyond the obvious behaviours. Sure, it can be used to help customers recycle more, save energy, save water, use bags for life or eat well. This is the discipline <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WRAP</a> used in the UK to dramatically increase home recycling. But the same approach can also be used to grow existing markets or create new markets.</p> <p>For example, banks could use it to persuade the 50% of people not currently saving for their long-term future to do so, which helps address a major social issue and grow their markets at the same time. And car manufacturers such as Nissan who are putting their weight behind electric cars could use it to create the market in electric vehicles. This change is not just about product purchase, it is a change in lifestyle. Simply making products available will not work on its own. There is a need to change what people think, feel, believe and do.</p> <p>Leaders are already using this approach as a discipline. In the next few years it will become a marketing norm. Sustainable business plans will feel more like long-term marketing plans. Skills in behaviour change, psychology and neuroscience will become core skills for all professional marketeers. And whatever it's called \u2013 social marketing, customer behaviour change or sustainable behaviour change, it's the next big thing. That's more than a prediction. It's a promise.</p> <p><em>John Drummond is chairman of </em><a href=\"http://www.corporateculture.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Corporate Culture</em></a><em>, a leading sustainable behaviour change agency</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Brands must set out with a credible purpose and assume a role that makes sense to their customers' day to day lives, says Jonny Bauer, chief strategy officer at award-winning creative agency Droga5.</p> <p>Having been inducted into the American Advertising Federation Hall of Achievement for his recent work with PUMA, LVMH, the New York City department of education, Prudential, Microsoft, Axe, Johnnie Walker and Dyson, Bauer will speak at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/advertisingsummit\" title=\"\">Guardian Changing Advertising Summit</a> to address delegates about the evolution of brand strategies in the digital space.</p> <h2>Competition</h2> <p>Kicking off the interview, Bauer reflected briefly on the marketing bonanza that took place this summer, in particular, with the Olympic Games. Were clients PUMA as ambitious as Nike were in getting attention during the Olympics? \"They tend to go really big at these kinds of events, so we were realistic in terms of understanding that we had one twentieth of Nike's marketing spend to play with. We definitely don't try to outspend Nike, we try to outsmart them.\"</p> <p>\"PUMA's purpose is to make sport fun again. Kids are taking sport a little too seriously, they're not willing to play if they're not good enough to win so what we're trying to do is to change that and to say you don't have to be a speed athlete to enjoy sport.</p> <p>\"The competition seems to be saying 'win at all costs, get up at five in the morning, achieve the impossible', so we though PUMA's purpose should be to bring back the joy of sport.</p> <p>\"Our secret weapon during the Olympics was Usain Bolt, and you can't get better advertising for the brand than having the whole world focus on the fastest man alive who's having fun and living the brand position that was set up for PUMA. It was a really smart move for them to sign him up so early as they did.\"</p> <h2>Purpose and credibility</h2> <p>Moving on to the theme of the Changing Advertising Summit, which addresses the prevailing trend in the digital advertising business whereby advertising is becoming increasingly targeted and personalised, Bauer tackled the issue of how to manage an appetite to pore over analytics and make media spend accountable, versus the need to trust one's instinct and decide what will connect at an emotional level. How do you match the sea of data and what we understand about the consumer with the smart idea?</p> <p>\"It's an interesting topic and fits with how we're evolving our thinking around what brands can do in the world today and what's a credible role for them to take on with the landscape around them changing so quickly.</p> <p>\"There are definitely truths in the ideas set out and what's actually happening out there in terms of contextual information and data; I don't know if I necessarily agree with the hypothesis set out here, so I'll talk to you how we continue to think about what good work is.</p> <p>\"Advertising is becoming more scientific especially when it comes to testing what's working and why, where audiences are coming from and how we can evolve the idea. We're investing heavily in the science but it's all focused around the good idea. We are of course getting much more analytical about where we point our creativity at, but if it doesn't have a great idea behind it \u2026 \"</p> <p>Credibility and purpose are two elements of brand positioning that Bauer is keen to stress: \"The way we think about brands is around the idea of their purpose. It's less about the brand idea \u2013 five years ago advertisers were always asking 'what's the big idea?', whereas we like to ask 'what's the purpose?' and 'what's the brand actually there to do?'</p> <p>\"There seems to be a large opportunity for brands to make themselves really useful to people, especially given the knowledge we have about people and what they're doing, where they're doing it and what they need. What can the brand do for people and what role does the product have in achieving that purpose?</p> <p>\"It's about find a purpose which results in actions that the brand can take and it's about ensuring that there's real credibility in the purpose within the context of the consumer and their category because today there's so many things that you can do with the technology, but it doesn't mean you should do them or that it's credible for your brand to do them? Finding that intersection of a credible ask \u2013 what are we asking the consumer to do? Does it make sense for your toilet brand to become your psychologist?\"</p> <p>Despite the inevitable hype around the coolest new site or social network, it might not make sense for brands to dive head first into every new social platform: \"Once we've found a purpose that fits then it's about deploying it around behaviours that really exist and not trying to create behaviours that don't \u2013 we're not going to ask people to make videos if they're not video makers, it's just not credible. It's important to ask what people will really do and ask if people really want that brand to do that task or meet that goal for them.\"</p> <p>Speaking more broadly about the role advertising has to play in the world, when the likes of Bill Clinton and the Gates Foundation address the advertising industry and <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/bill-clinton-urges-ad-industry-lead-global-change-through-creativity-14129\" title=\"\">ask them to change the world</a>, is that a trend that the industry will really get behind or is it something that we'll simply pay lip service to?</p> <p>\"Yes and no \u2013 not everything needs to be 'do gooding' but I think that brands are some of the only things that can solve some of our pressing problems. If you look at the sheer reach of Coca-Cola for example, they are able to get to places that no one else can reach. So brands are looking for and understand that doing good is good business.</p> <p>\"CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) programmes are becoming an increasingly important part of the mix. As an agency we passionately believe that every year we should leave the world better off than how we found it. So whether that's something for the Department of Education or Water and our work with the UN, we believe it's our responsibility to channel our creativity to help make the world a little bit better.\"</p> <p>\"This also helps us recruit the kind of people we want in the agency \u2013 so that when we talk about a purpose for something like a Coke Zero or a Hennessy, or PUMA, it's about establishing a credible role of that brand to have for that consumer within that category.</p> <p>\"It's about adding value as a brand and not clutter because we know there are no clean spaces to advertise as a brand, so if we're creating new spaces we need to add value, be that by entertaining someone, helping someone find a deal on a great cup of coffee or helping someone find a friend in a crowd of football hooligans.</p> <p>\"It's all about what makes senses for this brand in helping this consumer in a way that they'll welcome so there's no waste. That's the filter we use from everything from strategy down to deployment.\"</p> <p>With the myriad of new platforms and technologies for brands to experiment with, Bauer reiterates the need for brands to play a credible role in their customers' lives: \"A lot of new shiny toys come out which require significant behaviour change and we don't always believe that brands can necessarily adopt them credibly, on a large scale and quickly. Advertising is about understanding how people behave, understanding how people spend their time and understanding their path to purchase and understanding the media.\"</p> <p>\"With the Tap project, for example, we wanted people to give money to solve the water crisis but we know that people aren't really into signing up on their credit card and giving money every month. They do enjoy free water when they go to restaurants and their wallets are actually open when they go to a restaurant, so we made it as easy as possible for people to act on their good intentions.\"</p> <p><em>The Changing Advertising Summit takes place 24 October 2012 - for more information and to book your place, visit </em><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/advertisingsummit\" title=\"\"><em>theguardian.com/advertisingsummit</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A French exchange might once have been the pinnacle of collaboration between schools in different countries. But no longer. Senior leadership teams are now taking the idea of international partnerships far more seriously, and bundling a group of excited year 10s off on a coach to practice their French for a week with a teenager they've never met simply doesn't cut it anymore.</p> <p>At some schools, international collaboration is now deeply embedded into how the curriculum is interpreted and how teachers develop their professional skills. But it takes time, effort and drive to foster and sustain these relationships with schools far from home: given stretched resources, why do headteachers think it's worth making that investment?</p> <p>\"We keep being told that everything's changing but actually we're always going to need <em>good</em> people, who understand about rights and respecting each other and about empathy,\" says Anne Winstrom, head of Whitchurch First School in Harrow.</p> <p>\"It's not enough just to teach children phonics. That's half the story - the rest is what do you put into the curriculum to make it sing.\"</p> <p>Winstrom's pupils are aged just three to seven years old, but she's adamant that there's no reason why even the youngest children shouldn't benefit from understanding more about other cultures.</p> <p>Her school has a longstanding relationship with a primary in Uganda; there have been reciprocal staff visits over a number of years, and using the <a href=\"http://www.greatlearning.com/ipc/\">International Primary Curriculum</a> to support the National Curriculum, Winstrom says that her young charges have started to develop a nuanced understanding of how their counterparts live in rural Uganda.</p> <p>\"I think it's very deep learning - it's not like going on the internet,\" she says. \"We take lots of video when we go, and so they see, for instance, that the children there don't wear shoes to go to school, and at first they think it's just because they're poor. But then we say, 'but why do you think they don't wear shoes?' And they look at the terrain, and see it's completely waterlogged, and see that shoes would be impractical.\"</p> <p>Though she says that this collaboration with an under-resourced rural primary in Uganda of course means her pupils \"gain an understanding of what it's like to be without the stuff they have,\" she's also clear that learning more about the detail of their fellow pupils' lives means they'll learn to question stereotypes that might, in this case, have lead them automatically to assume that a lack of shoes equalled poverty, rather than being a practical response to the surrounding environment.</p> <p>Contact with people from other countries can bring some very stark realities, and make a lesson more vividly understood than any book or teacher could manage, says Sandra Underwood, school link co-ordinator at Lytham High in Lancashire.</p> <p>\"It connects the curriculum and the learning they're doing to the real world. In geography, for instance, we had a Sri Lankan visitor come and talk to us about conflict. It brings it to life.\"</p> <p>At Kirkhill Primary in Aberdeen, pupils don't just learn about other countries - they visit them. The 10 and 11-year olds have travelled to Latvia, Spain and Norway: for head teacher Lorna Napier, the opportunity to visit pupils in other countries \"breaks down barriers, because we see the similarities running through the differences in how we live. I don't think anything can replace that.\"</p> <p>She says the results of the visits, and the collaborative project work that takes place between classrooms in each country before and after each trip, are evident in her pupils' increased independence, confidence and motivation to learn.</p> <p>That boost to motivation raises standards: \"I don't believe the children would be as engaged in finding out about other countries, and it's not just the children who go [who benefit], the whole school takes part,\" she says.</p> <p>Importantly, too, Napier notes, as children start to become aware of how other people live, they tend to reflect upon the way their own society is organised.</p> <p>\"It helps to understand your own community, gets children to consider what we are like and to compare, so we're not so insular, because it's easy to be insular.\"</p> <p>Staff development is another major reason that leaders believe international collaboration benefits their school.</p> <p>\"Working collaboratively with another teacher can really boost your confidence: you can compare systems, see what the negatives are we both have and improve on them,\" says Sandra Underwood.</p> <p>Nurturing the enthusiasm of even just a few teachers who are passionate about international partnerships is crucial at the start of building these collaborations however, as Underwood also observes that \"sometimes it's not working with the other school that's the challenge, it's working in your own school, because teachers can feel so stretched and don't want to take any more on.\"</p> <p>Winstrom aims to make a trip to their partner primary in Uganda part of all her teaching staff's professional development, and says that experience is invaluable. \"To be honest, I think we gain far more from them than they do from us,\" she says. \"People are so much more motivated when they come back - they are completely fired up.\"</p> <p>She is however keen to note that these trips are all done in teachers' holiday time, and repay far more than the price of the plane ticket.</p> <p>\"It costs more to send a teacher on a three-day course in London than it does to send them to Uganda for a week,\" she notes, \"and what you get back is ten-fold what you get off a course.\"</p> <p>It's not just classroom staff who have something to learn: Napier says that she often spends time on overseas trips with the headteacher of the school she's visiting, looking at how they organise their classes, the benefits and drawbacks of later school starting ages, and different ways of teaching the curriculum.</p> <p>\"In Norway, they have specialist teachers at primary level, in maths for example, coming in and out of school,\" she explains. \"It makes you look at the research, and it also makes you think, are we always doing the right thing and ask could you do something else and get a better result.\"</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p><strong>Qinetiq</strong> was widely believed to be the inspiration for James Bond's Q, and the former ministry of defence research arm's latest trick is to buck a falling market.</p> <p>The company, floated on the stock exchange in 2006, has jumped nearly 6% - up 9.4p to 181.2p - after a better than expected first half trading update. The main boost came from its UK business and its global products division, with the delivery of two key orders for its Q-NetTM equipment - a kevlar web which protects vehicles from grenade attacks.</p> <p>But this was offset by the performance of its US business, with uncertainties over the country's defence budget leading to delays in awarding contracts. With the UK government's austerity drive, the issue of budgets is also a live one in this country too. The company said:</p> <blockquote> The degree of political and economic uncertainty in both our major markets means that forward visibility for the next six months is much lower than usual, particularly in the US. <br> However the strong performance in the first half gives the board confidence the group should at least meet its expectations for the current year, absent any material change in customer requirements. The board's view of the outlook beyond the current year remains unchanged. </blockquote> <p>Liberum Capital issued a hold recommendation following the figures and ahead of an investor at Farnborough this week:</p> <blockquote> A stronger than expected first half (notably in global products) causes us to increase our 2013 earnings per share estimate by 17% (we expect consensus to increase by around 10%). Visibility remains extremely limited but Qinetiq continues to perform well. We expect Wednesday's investor day to highlight the opportunities but note that the shares have already moved up significantly and now trade on a 10% premium to UK peers. <br> Qinetiq has a portfolio of products which could create significant value in the future, most notably OptaSense. There is lots of work going on behind the scenes but nothing new at this stage. We expect to hear more on Wednesday. </blockquote> <p>But Investec kept its sell rating on the shares:</p> <blockquote> Visibility beyond the second half remains poor and hence we do not anticipate materially changing our estimates thereafter. We raise our price target to 150p (from 130p) to reflect [a 10% earnings upgrade] and slight sector re-rating. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 26.03 points at 5826.59, ahead of another week of worry in the eurozone, with Spain expected to unveil more cutbacks ahead of a possible bailout request and signs of more disagreements between key players such as France and Germany. Simon Denham, managing director at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> This morning a little negativity is creeping into the European indices following a poor session in Asia overnight. It would seem that the euphoria over the central bank interventions from earlier in the month has fizzled out now, but so far in this session the index has done very well from the very outset. We had been calling the FTSE to open lower by 50 odd points or so at 5800, but the support is still there preventing a substantial sell off for now. </blockquote> <p>Mining shares are among the leading fallers, as JP Morgan Cazenove suggested taking profits after recent rises in the wake of the US announcement of further quantitative easing. It said China was still key to the sector:</p> <blockquote> Until more clarity emerges around the Chinese growth picture and potential stimulus measures, which we suspect will not come until later in the year after the leadership changeover in mid-October, we suspect QE3 will provide a floor for the sector but not necessarily drive substantial forward momentum. </blockquote> <p>So <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> is down 14.1p at 330.4p and <strong>Anglo American</strong> has fallen 60p to \u00a318.78. Anglo was also hit by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch moving from buy to neutral. Eight out of the top ten fallers are currently commodity companies.</p> <p>But the biggest faller in the sector is <strong>Bumi</strong>, the coal miner co-founded by financial Nat Rothschild. It has dropped 33% to 131.5p after revealing allegations of potential financial and other irregularities in its Indonesian operations.</p>",
  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p></p> <h2>Nigellissima<br>8.30pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Not a word, as such, but Nigellissima is smouldering telly cook Nigella Lawson's love letter to Italy \u2013 her \"spiritual home\", she reckons. It's filmed in a specially constructed replica of her own kitchen, rather than her actual one, a move which seems about as extravagant as some of the recipes she's peddling here. These include a calorific hazelnut chocolate cheesecake, and the \"meat-zza\". Yes, that's a meat-pizza, which jettisons bread in favour of purest mince. Fans will be pleased to note that lingering camera shots and effusive food descriptions prevail. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Masters of Money<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Stephanie Flanders's timely three-part series on the legacies of influential economic thinkers continues. This week, it's the turn of the ascetic free-market fundamentalist Friedrich Hayek, whose book The Road To Serfdom argued that governmental tampering with the economy was, however well-meaning, a sure route to tyranny. A host of panjandrums, including Mervyn King, Paul Krugman and Ron Paul, gather to discuss Hayek's theories, with varying degrees of scepticism. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Leaving<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>The final part of Tony Marchant's intergenerational love story picks up after the very public scene in the hotel breakfast room, where Michael accused Julie of having an affair. Julie now has to deal with her boss, who wants to see her leave, and her family, who don't want to listen to her explanations. Then there's the issue of her lover, Aaron, who has left his family home and his job; is it possible for the two of them, despite the age difference, lack of employment and the mess that their affair has created, to make it work? <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Tourettes: Let Me Entertain You<br>9pm, BBC3</h2> <p>It's showtime: after three months of preparation, our brave half-dozen are ready to sing like canaries before a live audience. As DJ and host Reggie Yates says: \"There's no medical explanation why they don't tic during their performance,\" but it's a phenomenon that has been noted elsewhere; tics often recede when focus is directed so completely on something else. What focus they have, too: \"Talent over Tourettes,\" as Yates puts it, with uniformly fantastic turns all round. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Health Before The NHS: The Road To Recovery<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>How did people access medical treatment before the creation of the NHS ushered in cradle-to-grave healthcare? Often in an ad-hoc fashion, if at all, according to the first of this two-part documentary looking back at the early part of the 20th century. The statistics are shocking: in 1900 it was reckoned 150 of every 1,000 babies died before celebrating their first birthday. Intentionally or not, this is a riposte to the fuzzy nostalgia that often surrounds talk of localism and the big society, and worth watching just for the section on the \"Peckham Experiment\", which pre-empted universal free healthcare. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Revenge<br>9pm, E4</h2> <p>It's not hard to see why Revenge has been among the biggest TV Stateside hits since Lost: the ongoing saga of treachery, murder and deceit among the photogenic rich folks of the Hamptons has a lurid, sultry, suspenseful and at times camp appeal, with Madeleine Stowe splendid as the icy matriarch Victoria. Tonight, we see what befalls one of her henchmen when he outlives his usefulness as Emily discovers who actually murdered her father, while Charlotte uses her tentacles and wiles to influence Declan's testimony on the witness stand. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396709625\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348238998962/The-Paradise-BBC1s-new-de-010.jpg\" alt=\"The Paradise, BBC1's new department-store drama.

Local astrologer Mystic Mags (Maureen Lipman) claims that events around any eclipse are too chaotic to unravel, while some claim Harper was the latest victim of the infamous Moonstone Curse. Barnaby and Jones soon discover more intrigue, sexual tension and academic rivalry than you could shake Patrick Moore's xylophone at. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>The Paradise<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Adapted from a Zola novel, here we enter the world of \"England's first department store\" and its proprietor, Mr Moray. Moray is famed for his looks and oily charm, and his store has its plus points; it is no respecter of class barriers. But for all his twinkly eyes and high-street fabulism, Moray is by no means the good guy, delighting in the way his \"stack it high and sell it cheap\" philosophy will stamp out the little man. Oh, and then there's the issue of how his first wife met her mysterious end. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>The Boy Who Can't Forget<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Many of us can barely remember what we were doing last Tuesday, let alone during any given day 10 years ago. Yet 20-year-old Aurelien can give you an account of pretty much any 24-hour period you care to chuck at him. He's not the only one, either: psychologists are investigating a handful of people who claim the same gift, although for living Filofax Jill Price, tormented by decade-old slights, it's more of a curse: \"Everyone has baggage; I got a freaking steamer truck I'm dragging along.\" <em>AC</em></p> <h2>New Girl<br>9pm, E4</h2> <p>It's the season finale, and when Nick announces he's decided to move in with Caroline it could spell the end of the dysfunctional flatshare. But wait: there's an adventure in the desert to survive as a panic attack leads Nick to drive that removal van until he can drive no more. Just as well that Jess and Cece, the two characters least equipped to enjoy a face-off with a coyote in the desert, are there to rescue him. There's more dramatic fun to come as Schmidt and Cece reach breaking point, and Winston battles his biggest fear. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Cuckoo<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>New sitcom starring giant actor Greg Davies as patriarch Ken who is introduced to his new son-in-law Cuckoo for the first time in the arrivals lounge on his daughter Rachel's return from her gap year in Thailand. It's an understandable shock, particularly as Cuckoo is a colossal bellend. This travelling hippy (Andy Samberg) has spiritual psychobabble up the wazoo and hopes to loaf around his new family home while he writes a book. All but Ken and his son Dylan (Tyger Drew-Honey) are taken in by his cod philosophy, even his wife Lorna (Helen Baxendale); it's a pretty promising start. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>The Valleys<br>10pm, MTV</h2> <p>There aren't going to be many regions left to shrink with shame under the scrutiny of the reality TV camera at this rate. In the wake of the appalling Geordie Shore it's now the turn of a group of \"wannabes\" from Wales with pneumatic chests (and that's just the men) to celebrate their loss of dignity as they move from the countryside to a plush pad in Cardiff. What it is they \"wannabe\" is not quite crystal clear, but if it's to be the subject of merciless mockery from celebrity magazines, they're probably going the right way about it. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396709626\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/3/1346679103191/Patrick-Duffy-and-Josh-He-006.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Duffy and Josh Henderson in the new-look Dallas.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Duffy and Josh Henderson in the new-look Dallas. Photograph: Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dallas<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>Having so many of the original cast around for the remake is something of a blessing here: it's still thrilling to see Sue Ellen openly defying JR and running off for a meeting with Cliff Barnes. That's what Dallas is all about, conflict delivered with lip-quivering high camp. Yet, the lesser Ewings getting mired in a mess of changing loyalties is in danger of taking over, as Rebecca's growing feelings for Christopher threaten to scupper the con trick she's working with her brother. This show needs to get more ridiculous, fast. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>JK Rowling \u2013 Writing for Grown-Ups: A Culture Show Special<br>10pm, BBC2</h2> <p>JK Rowling's publisher tried to convince us that her tales of wizards and magic were suitable for adults, going so far as to produce editions with smart covers that grown ups wouldn't mind reading in public. Still, her new novel, The Casual Vacancy, is being proffered as her first effort at proper adult fiction. A blackly comic story of the small town of Pagford and the consequences of a parish councillor's death, it's an obvious departure for Rowling. Here, she discusses the book, her inspirations, and the challenges of taking on a post-Potter literary project. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>With concern from scientists that the Class A classification of MDMA is harming research on potential benefits for depression sufferers, Jon Snow and Christian Jessen present a study into the drug's effect on the brain. As part of the study, six volunteers including author Lionel Shriver and actor Keith Allen take MDMA \u2013 ecstasy in its pure form \u2013 and undergo a series of tests, while scientists David Nutt and Val Curren look at the short- and long-term effects for users. Concludes tomorrow. <em>MJ</em></p> <h2>Vincent: The Untold Story <br>7pm, SkyArts</h2> <p>Australian artists John and Di Koenders discovered they were distant relations of Vincent van Gogh in 2006 and set about researching his life in detail. They claim to give a \"rare insight\" into his life, particularly throwing light on his mysterious death. The narration questions his motives for suicide \"when he was just starting to gain recognition\" for his art. It's like Alan Partridge talking about the death of Kurt Cobain. A lot of biographical information, badly presented, reminiscent of one of those onboard films you get on hydrofoils. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Room at the Top<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>In a world where there exists a fast track from Eton to high office, an angry-young-man drama such as Room at the Top is probably timely. This two-parter adapts John Braine's novel about the rise of working-class Joe Lampton, a kind of Don Draper of his era. Trained as an accountant in a prisoner of war camp, Joe gets a job in the town hall of an affluent town, and sets about trying to have sex with every woman he meets. Matthew McNulty is good at bringing out Joe's cheek and chippiness, while Maxine Peake excels as Alice, the married woman with whom he \"takes up\". <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Girlfri3nds<br>9pm, ITV2</h2> <p>Three girls, 100 men and a whole load of hair flicking: this is dating, ITV2-style. Emma Willis presides over the action as air hostess Amy, single mum Sarah, and \"career girl\" Laura while they search for love. The rivals are supportive, refusing to step on each other's carefully painted toes as they become increasingly excited over the men on offer. \"You won the Lottery!\", \"You speak French!\", \"Your name's Ken!\" etc. Sweet though the girls are, watching them flirt, giggle and make rubbish jokes in front of 50 men might just make you lose heart by the end of the first episode. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396709627\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347454365473/Wartime-Farm-tractor-008.jpg\" alt=\"Wartime Farm tractor\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everyday tale of rural folk \u2026 Wartime Farm.

The overdramatic narration reminds us that Britain began that year facing the nazis alone and the government was getting serious about food production, appointing agricultural inspectors. These \"War Ags\" had sweeping powers, removing some 2,000 people from their farms for underperforming. Meanwhile, on Manor Farm itself, the team are making use of a state-of-the-art tractor, as well as setting up the milking facilities for production. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Homefront<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>This new six-part series about the wives, partners \u2013 and one remarkably hardened mother \u2013 of soldiers serving in Afghanistan looks rather promising on the strength of the opener. It's a far cry from the buttoned-up anxiety of Mrs Bader in Reach for the Sky; these women strip for their partners on Skype and get merry on spirits they've sneaked into a nightclub. The pain of separation is palpable however, as is the sense of class division reflecting the military ranks. Outnumbered's Claire Skinner stars in a quality cast. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Making Faces<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The subject of facial reconstruction has long been fascinating to the public imagination, and this fine documentary series, focusing on the prosthetics experts and patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, couldn't be less prurient and more commendable if it tried. Cancer has left Diana with a hole in her face, but she hopes an artificial eye will do less to \"frighten the horses\" when she leaves the house. There's a new eye, too, for 16-year-old Holly. They're already heroic beyond words. <em>AC</em></p> <h2>Stephen Hawking's Grand Design<br>9pm, Discovery</h2> <p>Final part of the professor's superb new series. Tonight the world's most famous physicist asks, did God create the universe? No \u2026 but he does give his own crystal clear appraisal of man's interpretation of the universe through history. And he includes the compelling argument that, according to the laws of physics, the universe could just have popped into being one day with literally nothing there before it. Blow your mind, why don't you? <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Celebrity Ghost Stories<br>9pm, Bio</h2> <p>Return of a programme that inspires awestruck contemplation of the mysteries of the universe, though perhaps not quite in the manner intended by its producers. This is the first episode of the fourth series, suggesting that it is possible to attract a measurable audience simply by asking the vaguely famous to relate their self-evidently nonsensical testimonies of encounters with the paranormal. Tonight, Cindy Williams of Laverne &amp; Shirley, Joan Van Ark from Dallas and reality starlet Audrina Patridge are among those doing little to deflate the regrettably popular stereotype of actors as credulous moonbats. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Wilfred<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>Just when you think you've got a handle on this show it takes a few more unexpected turns, taking it further away from a cute yarn about a talking dog and into a disturbing tale of mental illness and obsessive relationships. A hilarious musical montage is added to the mix as Ryan and Wilfred take \"Doggie Dancing\" classes. While this gives opportunities for some spirited slapstick, the show dumps salt onto its sweetness by having the pair discuss their first sexual experiences. Who knew something as joyful as dancing with a dog could be so dark and unwholesome? <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396709628\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347538220731/Moone-Boy-Series-1-008.jpg\" alt=\"Moone Boy; Series 1\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Rawle with imaginary friend Chris O\u2019Dowd in Moone Boy.

Princess Elizabeth Hospital serves the island's 66,000 residents, and its staff provide the focus for this documentary series, now into its third episode. Tonight's action, such as it is, sees surgeon Suzy Dorey helping out at Saumarez Park to prepare for a royal visit, two paramedics rescuing a bowls champion, and lawyer Adrian Sarchet's bid to swim the Channel scuppered by a shoulder injury. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Servants: The True Story Of Life Below Stairs<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Go back a century and 1.5 million people worked as servants. As social historian Dr Pamela Cox explores in this new series, their lives didn't involve Downton-like familiarity with employers. Instead, this was a world of hard graft and harder class demarcations, with some bosses giving generic names to those occupying specific jobs, to save the bother of remembering real names. Despite this, Cox still finds traces of specific individuals, such as servant William Tayler, whose revealing diary bemoans a lack of \"liberty\". <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Being Liverpool<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>Watching this fly-on-the-waller \u2013 filmed over the summer \u2013 in concert with Liverpool's undercooked start to the league season makes for an odd experience, the optimism and jollity of a pre-season under new manager Brendan Rodgers jarring uncomfortably with a record that currently reads: played four, won zero. This week's episode sees Rodgers oversee the club's first fixtures on their tour of the States. Meanwhile, back in the present, Liverpool face a tricky-looking fixture away at Norwich. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2>Live Ryder Cup Golf<br>12.30pm, Sky Sports 1</h2> <p>The 39th Ryder Cup once again affords sports fans the chance to feel patriotic about their continent as Europe looks to retain the trophy on US turf, since the tournament takes place at the Medinah Country Club in Illinois. Europe's captain, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, has selected Ian Poulter and rookie Nicolas Colsaerts as his wildcards to join Rory McIlroy and Lee Westwood, among others, while the US line-up includes Bubba Watson, Jason Dufner, and, of course, Mr T Woods. Sky's coverage is available in both HD and 3D. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Moone Boy<br>9.30pm, Sky1</h2> <p>Gently does it, as Chris O'Dowd's imaginary friend helps cute little Martin Moone through more childhood challenges in this cockle-warming tale. This week, there's a trouser incident after wide-eyed Martin watches one too many TV shows involving \"grunty Argentinian tennis ladies\". Sean (O'Dowd) is too busy enjoying a night at the pub with fellow fantasy figures including the legendary wrestler Crunchy Haystacks (Johnny Vegas) to offer Martin much-needed advice. Luckily, Uncle Danny the busker arrives home with wise words and tales of hanging out with U2. Subtle laughs all round. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Sea of Death<br>10pm, Yesterday</h2> <p>In early 1945, as the Soviet army pushed west, millions of German refugees \u2013 both troops and civilians \u2013 fled from the onslaught. But the journey through the Baltic was perilous, due to Russian submarines targeting ships such as the Wilhelm Gustloff. When that liner was torpedoed, 9,400 souls perished, the largest loss of life from a single ship in naval history. This marine archaeology documentary rather lacks a central narrative, but it's worth watching for eerie underwater footage of the Gustloff and two other wrecks, the Steuben and the Goya. <em>JW</em></p>",

In terms of fish catch, they are supposed to lose over 50% of their fisheries,\" said Matt Huelsenbeck, an Oceana marine scientist and author of the report.</p> <p>The report put Iran, Libya, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates among the top 10 countries most at risk because of the decline in fish stocks due to climate change.</p> <p>\"There are definitely tens of thousands of artisanal fishermen operating in the Persian Gulf and they will be hardest hit by the impacts,\" he said.</p> <p>The United States is expected to lose about 12% of its catch potential by the middle of the century, the report said.</p> <p>The study used climate models created by the University of British Columbia to rank countries' exposure to degradation of the oceans due to climate change and ocean acidification.</p> <p>Low-income countries, with high levels of malnutrition and rapid population growth, such as Pakistan, were viewed as high risk. So were small island states that depend heavily on coral reef fisheries and on conches, oysters, clams and other shellfish.</p> <p>About 1 billion people depend on seafood as their main source of protein. But some of those countries most dependent on fishing are expected to lose up to 40% of their fish catch by the middle of the century.</p> <p>The changes in ocean chemistry, when sea water absorbs rising levels of carbon dioxide, have upset the balance of marine life. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/10/caribbean-coral-reefs-collapse-environment\" title=\"\">Coral reefs in the Caribbean are on the verge of collapse</a>. Oysters and clams are unable to produce their hard protective shells.</p> <p>Meanwhile, rising temperatures are driving fish species from the tropics towards deeper and colder waters.</p> <p>The study looked at potential impacts in mid-century. But the first effects of climate change and the changing ocean chemistry are already evident, however, in Kenya, where the loss of coral reefs is pushing down fish stocks, and on the US Pacific coast, where oyster beds have died off in Oregon.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended to remove references to the \"Persian\" Gulf in accordance with the Guardian and Observer style guide, which specifies that the region should be termed \"the Gulf, not the Persian or Arabian Gulf\".</p>",
  "<p>We may not have heard live lions, elephants or wolves in the wild but thanks to audio recordings we recognise their calls. But how many of us have heard a pristine coral reef? Or know the difference between the sound of the waves on a beach in Norfolk UK and Norfolk, Virginia? Or can identify the different sounds in a central African forest, or indeed have really listened to the whisper of the leaves in a British garden before a storm?</p> <p>The sound of natural as opposed to man-made habitats, says musician and naturalist Bernie Krause, mostly escapes us. That's partly because until about 40 years ago, academics and broadcasters wanted acoustic snapshots of single species of birds and mammals - what he calls \"narrow, decontextualised models\" that give an incomplete perspective of living landscapes.</p> <p>Krause, who with his colleague and musical partner Paul Beaver produced five albums in the mid-1970s, studied with German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, and played with the Doors, the Monkees and nearly everyone else from Tamla to Hollywood. He turned to recording nature in the mid 1970s, and has since recorded 4,500 pristine habitats, as well as around 15,000 species.</p> <p>Now he records mainly \"soundscapes\", like the vibrations of twigs as snowflakes fall, the ground moving in an earthquake, storms on land and at sea, or the sound of a forest waking up.</p> <p>No terrestrial habitats are more diverse, or make more sound, than equatorial areas, he says. The soundscapes of central African forests are some of the most exhilarating, he says.</p> <p>\"They are dazzling and blissful. Lowland gorillas strike rhythms on their chests that are surprising and intricate. Forest elephants forage in marshy open meadows, bellowing low raspy growls that reverberate over great distances. Black and white hornbills sail over the canopy, goliath beetles hum and buzz, a wide variety of insects and frogs add a constant counterpoint to the acoustic fabric\".</p> <p>Krause traces the origins of human folk music back to the sounds of a place. The Baka in Cameroon, the Sami in northern Finland, some Inuit groups in Canada, and many others simulate the sound of the forest, the wind, the sea or whatever natural surroundings are dominant to their own habitat.</p> <p>\"For the Yanomami (in Brazil) the rhythms and melodies of rain striking vegetation and the surface of puddles are strong features of their traditional music, as they are for the Jivaro. The Yanomami use rainsticks, their soundscapes include the sound that the thickest leaves in the forest canopy make as they strike one another \u2026 oscillating in breezes that precede afternoon thunderstorms.\"</p> <p>Soundscapes, he says, are the most accurate way to understand the health of a whole habitat. He says he can tell how healthy a place is from a 10-second recording. Conservationists, he says, could learn how to assess ecological health from sound recordings. \"It's easy to do. It's cheap. I don't know why they don't,\" he says.</p> <p>The evolution of natural sound, he says, seems to follow Darwinian evolution. Like an orchestra tuning up, a forest may wake up with the insects at around 2am, after which come the reptiles, the amphibians, the birds and lastly the mammals. Every animal has its niche, or its place in the animal orchestra, he says.</p> <p>\"Animal voices in many habitats have evolved so that they can stay off the acoustic turf of others. When that partitioning occurs, individual voices can be clearly differentiated from one another. Non-human voices have evolved so that each can be heard \u2026 without interference.\"</p> <p>Mechanical, or industrial sound, he says, disrupts natural sound profoundly. Of the 4,500 soundscapes he has recorded, nearly half have been lost because of habitat destruction or because they have been contaminated by human noise. It is now next to impossible in most western countries to record uninterrupted natural sound. Instead, planes, snowmobiles, traffic, chainsaws, mowers and human \"music\" pervade all habitats.</p> <p>The damage this is having on animals is immense, he says. Some animals may adapt successfully to humanity, but the vast majority cannot, and run away. Noise may weaken immune systems in mammal and fish and compromise resistance to disease, he says, just as elks and wolves suffer from exposure to snowmobile noise. Increasing evidence finds that whales and cetaceans are profoundly affected by the sound of boats and underwater mechanical noise. \"When the noise signal is loud enough, it may cause physical damage or death,\" he says.</p> <p>The noise of humans is not just affecting animals, he says. Humans, too, are increasingly affected. A US noise survey estimates that the level of urban noise increased 12% from 1996 to 2005. More than one-third of all Americans complain of noise, and, according to some surveys, more than 40% say it is so bad they would like to change where they live.</p> <p>\"Hearing has become a blur. We are on our way to a global age of the machine and all the noise it generates.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Bernie Krause's book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Great-Animal-Orchestra-Finding/dp/0316086878\" title=\"\">Great Animal Orchestra</a> is out now, published by Profile</p>"
