  "<p>Here's the news from Spain last week, in case anybody missed it: huge cuts in government spending; higher taxes; biting austerity; unemployment higher than in Greece; big and growing demonstrations in Madrid; violent clashes with police; and in Catalonia, a rising clamour for secession. The only hope on the horizon takes the ambiguous form of an expected financial rescue package, with still more austerity strings attached, from the richer countries of the north.</p> <p>Such help, however, will offer no more than temporary relief unless Spain addresses a deeper problem that it can only sort out on its own. It's a problem that has a decisive impact on the country's capacity to remain a competitive global player and that will be terribly difficult to solve because it is embedded in the national DNA.</p> <p>During the 14 years I've lived in the country, I've talked with many Spaniards about this. But the most forthright and revealing group has been those who work abroad \u2013 in London, Holland, Germany, the US. They all miss the sunshine, the food, the strong family bonds, the warm, easy Spanish way of living. They also share \u2013 and here is the thing \u2013 an exasperation with the Spanish way of work.</p> <p>I'm thinking, say, of two young men, in their early 30s, who moved to London six years ago, before the economic crash. They've done well. One, who started out as a waiter, is now the operations manager of a successful restaurant chain. \"To have got ahead the way I have in London I'd need an uncle with good connections. I didn't, so I left.\"</p> <p>The other works in the digital video industry. He had entered some work for a prize, but a number of prestigious British companies were running against him so he had no expectation of winning. Yet win he did. On pure merit. The notion of an unconnected unknown like him winning an equivalent prize in Spain was, he said, unthinkable.</p> <p>The lessons from these two stories, entirely typical of Spaniards abroad, are clear: the Spanish are not inherently idle; the labour market in Spain does not sufficiently reward talent and hard work. The Spanish disease that both these young men said they had fled was \"amiguismo\" \u2013\"friendism\" \u2013 a system where one gets ahead by who one knows.</p> <p>Reams of opinion columns in the Spanish press in recent months have pointed to amiguismo in the political classes. Which is no doubt largely true but fails to acknowledge that corrupt or lazy or incompetent politicians do not inhabit a closed ecosystem but behave in a manner in keeping with the way society operates at large.</p> <p>It is true that Spain had enjoyed a sustained economic boom for the best part of two decades. The usual explanation is that the country benefited from fluid access to cheap northern European credit. But there is a little more to it than that. There are also some mightily well-run and successful Spanish companies, such as the multinational retail clothing colossus Inditex, which owns Zara, or, like it or hate it, the Banco Santander. Yet I am afraid that these are the exceptions and not the rule.</p> <p>I recently asked a boss at a well-known Spanish company what percentage of the 300 or so middle-class staff under him did their jobs to the best of their abilities. Despondent, he replied: \"The number is low.\" The deeper sin lies in an institutionalised Spanish system where both the financial and moral incentives to work well are undercut by the perception that if you do not know the right people there is little point in giving the best of yourself at work.</p> <p>Where does all this come from? It might be tempting to dwell on the peculiarly closed-minded, our-fate-is-in-God's-hands brand of Catholicism that reigned in Spain for half a millennium but I think I'll stick for now to the prevailing educational system. Going to school in Spain is a pretty deadly business. The emphasis is all on learning by rote. Creativity and curiosity are not part of the package. School is not, remotely, fun. Work, the idea is instilled ominously early on, cannot be much fun either.</p> <p>I have a large Spanish family, with 25 first cousins on my Madrile\u00f1a mother's side alone. About 15 years ago, when the Spanish economy was buzzing, a male cousin came to visit me in Washington, where I then worked. I told him one night at a bar that I enjoyed my job. He said nothing in reply but, as I discovered two days later, he'd been mulling over what I said, deeply troubled. \"What you told me the other night,\" he said, \"about enjoying your job\u2026 you weren't serious, were you?\"</p> <p>Here was an employed, friendly, middle-class 36-year-old Spaniard and he had never, ever had wind of the notion that someone might feel enthusiasm for what he did for a living. For my cousin, as for so many Spaniards, work is a necessary evil, a nuisance to be dispensed with as briskly as possible before turning to the serious business of life \u2013 drinking, nibbling tapas, hanging out with friends until the small hours.</p> <p>This is all very well, even admirable from a certain philosophical point of view. Nor did it seem to matter very much while the Spanish bubble grew. But it is dangerously infantile in the present circumstances. Now that the bubble has burst, people's approach to work matters a great deal. The brightest, the boldest or the most restless young people go abroad for money and fulfilment; the rest, half of whom are unemployed, stay at home \u2013 baffled, desperate, increasingly angry, kicking out at government and being kicked back.</p> <p>The government does carry its share of the blame. But it is a symptom \u2013 a big, glaring symptom, for sure \u2013 and not the root cause. What's needed if Spain is not to sink gradually back into a sort of bucolic, early 20th-century Mediterranean poverty is a revolution across the board in attitudes to work. Like it or not, the system has to be overhauled and replaced by one where the rules are fair and merit is rewarded. Everywhere.</p> <p>Catalonia is a much more productive region than Andaluc\u00eda, as the independentists will never cease to remind you, but the difference as far as amiguismo goes is only one of degree. There is much talk now of a huge financial rescue plan from the north. Good. It will bring much-needed relief. But it will be no more than a passing cure so long as the corruption of amiguismo continues to stain Spain's otherwise warm and delightful soul, hampering the country's capacity to compete in the grown-up world.</p>",
  "<p>The motley gaggle of miscreants shuffles into the court, lining up silently in three rows on the benches. There are some 20 of them, men and women of all ages, most with long records of theft, violence and weapons misuse, and all with hardcore drug problems. I am passed their court biographies; the top one describes a man who has spent 12 years in jail, has 26 convictions over two decades and lists his \"drugs of choice\" as cocaine and heroin.</p> <p>While Felin Bell's fellow convicts look like they have walked straight off the set of a Hollywood crime caper, he is a portly man in a smart check shirt who could pass as a middle manager. Almost before he has sat down, he is picked out by the judge as the week's shining star, commended for his positive attitude and sent home as a reward. \"You look surprised \u2013 you shouldn't be,\" he is told.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1186478/1186478_2012-09-28-231518.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"283\" id=\"cf56cf1oi\" name=\"cf56cf1on\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><embed width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1186478/1186478_2012-09-28-231518.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cf56cf1ei\" name=\"cf56cf1en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>Already it is clear this Dallas court for drug offenders is no normal court. As proceedings unfold, it seems like therapy crossed with a reality television show. The judge doesn't wear a robe, seldom sits on the bench and swears a lot. His name is Robert Francis, a fast-talking 52-year-old Republican, a rock fan and a keen hunter who proudly showed me, in his office before proceedings started, the heads of huge hogs he has shot.</p> <p>As the offenders troop in, he warns if anyone lies or bullshits he will go \"fucking ballistic\". Then he discusses the difficulties of staying straight as he dissects their jobs, their families, their desires for the future. He responds to their comments with bawdy jokes, short homilies or sharp threats. \"Stay positive, brother,\" one man is told, while another is warned: \"You might think I'm crazy but I'm the crazy bastard who can put you back in jail.\"</p> <p>There are outbursts of applause, then cheers for a young man who looks embarrassed as he reveals he got married two days earlier. The judge tells a woman who has started helping her mother around the home that she makes him proud. \"You gotta be proud, too,\" he says.</p> <p>Until recently, these people would have been discarded in overcrowded prisons. After all they were caught in Texas \u2013 the toughest state of a nation that locks up more offenders than any other in the world, with more than one in every 100 adults behind bars. Instead they receive counselling and assistance with housing and employment, although they can be sent back to jail if they fail drug tests, abscond or reoffend. One woman, a crystal meth addict, tells me the sessions in court are like walking on eggshells. But there are small incentives for those doing well, such as $10 gift vouchers or \u2013 on the day I visited \u2013 barbecue lunch out with Francis. \"These people have to believe we care and want them to succeed,\" he tells me later. \"Once they believe in me they can start to change.\"</p> <p>They are beneficiaries of a revolution in justice sweeping the United States, one with illuminating lessons for Britain. It is a revolt led by hardline conservatives who have declared prison a sign of state failure. They say it is an inefficient use of taxpayers' money when the same people, often damaged by drink, drugs, mental health problems or chaotic backgrounds, return there again and again.</p> <p>Remarkably, this revolution was unleashed in \"hang 'em high\" Texas, which prides itself on its toughness and still holds more executions than other states. But instead of building more prisons and jailing ever more people, Texas is now diverting funds to sophisticated rehabilitation programmes to reduce recidivism. Money has been poured into probation, parole and specialist services for addicts, the mentally ill, women and veterans. And it has worked: figures show even violent crime dropping at more than twice the national average, while cutting costs and reducing prison populations.</p> <p>In the process, right-wingers have allied with liberals who long advocated such an approach, detoxifying one of the most poisonous political debates at a time when US party divisions have never been sharper. \"This used to be one of the most emotive and ideologically divisive issues in the country,\" says Adam Gelb of the Pew Center on the States, a social-policy research charity which is backing the initiative. \"We are starting to see the triumph of sound science over soundbites.</p> <p>\"There is not agreement on the causes of crime or even the purpose of punishment,\" Gelb continues, \"but there is agreement on the solutions. Liberals and conservatives are getting to the same destination from very different routes.\" Now the Texan tactics are being adopted in other \"deep red\" republican states such as Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and South Carolina, while well-known conservatives flock to promote the cause, including Newt Gingrich, Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal and Grover Norquist. It is a Nixon in China moment. \"The fact that it began in Texas has resonated around the country,\" says Gelb. \"We hear again and again that if Texas can do it, then it cannot be soft on crime.\"</p> <p>Just as in BRITAIN, it has been an iron rule in US politics that candidates win elections by talking tough on crime. The result has been a wave of stiff sentencing laws which, combined with the backfiring \"war on drugs\", mean that the prison population is currently growing 13 times more quickly than the general population. As a result, a nation with 5% of the global population accounts for 25% of prisoners worldwide \u2013 and is spending \u00a343bn a year keeping them there. The criminal justice system also stands accused of worsening racial inequality, with Hispanic men three times as likely to be locked up as white men and black men nearly seven times more likely. According to a landmark Pew report, one in nine black men between the ages of 20 and 34 is behind bars.</p> <p>Texas typified the trend. Just eight years ago, it had the highest incarceration rate in the world, with one in 20 adults in prison, on parole or on probation. The biggest deficit in state history had led to cuts in probation, giving judges little alternative but to increase prison admissions.</p> <p>In 2006, however, a political earthquake started to shake conventional wisdoms. It began when the state budget highlighted the need for $2bn for seven new prisons to accommodate a predicted 17,700 extra inmates by 2012. When Republican stalwart Jerry Madden was appointed chairman of the house corrections committee, the part of the state government responsible for criminal justice, jail and parole, he was asked to avoid building more prisons since they were too expensive.</p> <p>The white-haired Madden is an unlikely hero of prison reform. A fan of George W Bush and sympathetic to the Tea Party, he happily describes himself as \"a typical Texan Republican \u2013 which makes me very conservative when viewed nationally\". He admits that when he took over the committee, he knew nothing about the subject and had no interest in what has since become his life's mission. But he was trained as an engineer and, with an open mind, set about working out solutions. Perhaps it helps that he is at the end of his political career \u2013 when we meet, he is packing up his office in Austin, having announced his retirement. \"I'm not interested in the feel-good stuff, I'm interested in what works,\" he says. \"And since my job was not to build more prisons, I had to investigate the alternatives.\"</p> <p>Madden turned to Tony Fabelo, a former adviser to both Democrat and Republic governors, for evidence to defeat the \"lock 'em up and throw away the key\" lobby. Fabelo's figures were frightening: in just two decades incarceration rates in Texas had risen from 226 people to 691 people per 100,000 residents, yet other states with slower growth rates saw faster falls in crime. Meanwhile, one in three Texan inmates was back behind bars within three years. \"They had created a totally broken system,\" says Madden.</p> <p>Fabelo told Madden to focus on short-term facilities to tackle the underlying problems of repeat offenders, such as substance abuse and mental health problems. He suggested spending $240m on these services \u2013 under half the amount earmarked for new prisons that year \u2013 and pointed out that every dollar spent in this way saved at least $2 in the long run. Each prisoner, after all, costs $50 a day.</p> <p>Madden looked at the numbers and took a&#xa0;leap of faith. He went on the attack, using traditional right-wing arguments to subvert those seeking hardline penal policies. \"We moved the issue from one of being soft on criminals to one of being smart over the use of money. If you are keeping people in prison who do not need to be there, then that is a waste of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>\"We call it the department of corrections, so we should try our best to correct people, not just incarcerate them,\" Madden continues. \"Some people deserve to be in prison until they die, but you don't fill up prisons with people we are mad at who have done dumb things in their lives. You try to change their behaviour.\"</p> <p>Few typify this better than Jose Barajas. As this bulky 31-year-old man told me his life story a shy smile flashed occasionally across his face; when it did so he looked almost like the sweet kid whose father was taken into the desert and shot dead by rival gangsters. Jose was just 11 then.</p> <p>In subsequent years Jose drank hard, took lots of drugs and was determined no one would get the chance to take advantage of him like the men who murdered his father or abused his mother. \"Me and my pistol was enough,\" he tells me. \"I felt like a cowboy in the Wild West. I did a lot of robberies, a lot of carjackings, all sort of other things.\"</p> <p>Barajas was furious at a world that seemed unforgiving. One night, off his head at a party, he decided to die in a blaze of glory. \"I wanted to go out with a suicide by cop, get them to shoot me down,\" he said. \"So when the police came I started shouting at them, taunting them, but they refused to shoot me. I was so angry I did not die. Now I realise how selfish that would have been to my family and kids.\"</p> <p>Given his record, Barajas was looking at a long stretch in prison when he was arrested. Instead he is working as a roofer, trying to be a good dad and nursing ambitions to open his own tyre shop. \"I always thought I was on my own and never understood all my anger,\" he says. \"I'm not saying I don't have bad days and bad experiences, because of course I do, but I&#xa0;am confident I am going to make it.\"</p> <p>There are only two ways to cut prison populations: slow down the flow of people entering the system or speed up the numbers being released. Texas did both. Figures reveal that crime rates fell 8.3% in 2011, far outpacing national falls, with murder and robbery rates down about 15%. Property crime fell 10 times faster than in the rest of the country. Meanwhile, despite the soaring state population, prisoner numbers dropped by 2,500 last year.</p> <p>Probation services used to rely on little more than gut feelings to determine if inmates might get into trouble again. Now they use sophisticated risk-analysis tools that have cut the number of low-risk offenders who reoffend within a year from 26% to under 1%. \"We kept asking politicians to listen to us,\" says Geraldine Nagy, head of probation in Travis County. \"But I thought the idea that prison was the only option was so ingrained in the minds of so many people we would never get this shift.\"</p> <p>At the root of the reforms is an idea alien to many on the right: to understand more and condemn less. \"The people we are dealing with are not like you and me,\" Judge Francis told me. \"I&#xa0;found this a shock. I grew up in a&#xa0;house with married parents, both of whom had college degrees. I thought this was normal, but now I know it isn't.\"</p> <p>The vast majority of people parading through his court come from broken homes, failed to graduate from school, began using drugs in their teens and had children before they were 20. \"These people are preconceived to have a harder path through life than the likes of us,\" he said. \"I don't even say we offer rehabilitation. We are trying to provide 18 years of parenting in one year of drug court.\"</p> <p>Francis's 15-strong team deals every year with about 320 offenders, who typically spend six months in special treatment units in prison, then a year attending court several times a week with regular drug testing, followed by a decade on probation. Recent graduates include Lavoris Neal, a smartly dressed 33-year-old who grins as he tells me his check shirt, chinos and shiny black shoes cost $12 from a thrift store. He never knew his father, had an illiterate mother, was drinking by the age of eight, delivering drugs by 12 and using them the next year. \"I thought this was normal,\" he said. \"No one told me I was raised wrong, and when they did I was in tears. But I was a kid and did what I was told.\"</p> <p>Soon he was armed and dangerous and using PCP \u2013 a hallucinogen that leads to paranoia. He stole, shot at people, went on the run from police for months. When I ask what was the worst thing he did, he smiles. \"I've not been caught for some things.\" Then he pulls out some documents from a folder. \"Look at this,\" he says. \"I've never had insurance for a car before.\"</p> <p>Now this energetic character works as a business consultant, has twins on the way with a new partner and spends his leisure time devouring political biographies at the local library. \"I never want to know that person I was again,\" says Neal. \"This was the best thing that could have happened to me. I feel like I am starting life completely afresh.\"</p> <p>The revolution that began in Texas and is sweeping conservative America remains in its infancy; the hope is it will also reach this country, which locks up more prisoners than anywhere else in Europe and where debate is stagnant. Whatever populist politicians say, it is far tougher to force people to change errant behaviour than it is to simply slam them behind bars. Yet all the evidence shows this approach cuts both crime and the costs of incarceration. As Judge Francis says: \"What I am doing here is the most conservative thing possible. I am getting the biggest bang possible for the bucks of taxpayers and achieving something positive for society at the same time.\"</p> <p><em>The author travelled to Texas on a grant from Make Justice Work (</em><a href=\"http://www.makejusticework.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>makejusticework.org.uk</em></a><em>)</em></p>",
  "<p>Kim Jones's fourth-floor office at the Paris headquarters of Louis Vuitton, on rue de Pont Neuf, is crammed with organised clutter. Neat piles of stuff cover the floor and every surface: framed pictures \u2013 a formal portrait of an African family uppermost \u2013 are stacked against a wall, pristine white trainers line up on the parquet floor amid shoe boxes and carrier bags, intricate tribal masks hang from the full wooden bookshelves, artwork and brochures for advertising campaigns compete for space on the desk with travel books, a rucksack is hooked over a chair arm next to a printout detailing the bag's technical specifications. It's an enticing room. It feels like somewhere you'd like an hour or two alone to rummage round. It's pleasing that Jones's office is as full of ideas and beautiful objects as the collections he creates as style director of Louis Vuitton menswear.</p> <p>Not too long ago, after all, luxury menswear displayed little thought or beauty, consisting, as it mainly did, of suits, suits, suits and the odd blazer. But it's an area of fashion undergoing major reinvention, and Jones's instalment at LV is an important part of that. Recent figures show that menswear makes up 40% of the global fashion market; men now spend \u00a3155bn a year on high-end clothes and accessories. You can't spend that much on tweed and brogues alone, and this increase has coincided with a flurry of creativity in luxury menswear.</p> <p>Ever since Marc Jacobs was installed as artistic director in 1997, Louis Vuitton's reinvention from makers of fusty handbags to the world's most valuable luxury brand has been phenomenal. It is currently valued at $25.9bn. Kim Jones has basically been put in charge of one of the strongest growth areas for one of the biggest fashion brands in the world. A position by which the 35-year-old British designer, sitting in his office dressed in grey sweatshirt, chinos and trainers, seems cheerfully unfazed.</p> <p>\"I started buying the brand in 2002,\" says Jones. \"If I'd worked and saved up a bit of money, I'd buy something by Louis Vuitton. No one else really had it, even though it's a big brand, because everything's made in limited qualities. So if you want something different, it's actually a good place to go.\"</p> <p>Ten years ago no one would have imagined Jones would end up as creative director of the brand he saved his pennies for. Not because he wasn't talented, it's just that his reputation was established, straight off his Central Saint Martins MA in menswear, in casual clothing. Jones's name was made by his skill for subverting tailoring. He took traditional cuts and reinvented them as streetwear for the fashion-conscious.</p> <p>\"I was thinking about college the other day,\" he says. \"Someone asked me how I got into fashion, and I suddenly remembered that John Galliano bought half my graduate collection. It was a big deal, I guess, but I didn't realise at the time. I was just upset because I wanted one of the jackets he bought for myself; it was hard to make and I didn't get to keep it.\"</p> <p>Jones launched his own menswear label in 2002 \u2013 which found a loyal following, particularly in Japan \u2013 but unlike other young designers keen to make their name, he concentrated on collaborating with established brands instead. The list seems almost random \u2013 everyone from Topshop to Alexander McQueen, Umbro to Mulberry. He worked on Pastelle, a label for Kanye West (who's a friend of his). He dabbled in art direction for magazines such as <em>Dazed &amp; Confused </em>and <em>Arena Homme +</em>.</p> <p>\"I like working with people,\" is his simple explanation, \"getting a team together of different people working in different capacities. Designing clothes is just the job I do. I'm not in this to be famous or for my name to be recognised \u2013 I don't want that. I've lived with people who are famous and it's not nice to go out the front door and have your photo taken. I like to be able to toddle down to the corner shop.\"</p> <p>So he worked on projects that interested him. He made imaginative clothes for British football casuals and Japanese fashion addicts and anyone who shopped on the high street. He went out, had a lot of fun. He had been part of the straight-edge hardcore-punk scene when he studied graphic design in Brighton; when he moved to London it was the club scene in Hoxton, a passion he paid homage to in his 2004 collection called Subtle Rave. Then in 2008 he surprised the fashion world when he joined Dunhill, one of the stuffier heritage brands, but the combination worked: he won the British Fashion Council's menswear designer of 2009. By the time his appointment at Louis Vuitton was announced in 2011, the mix of Jones's imagination and the luxury market seemed an excellent idea. He won the menswear designer award again in 2011 and he's been nominated this year, too.</p> <p>When Jones was interviewed in 2008 about the Dunhill job, he used a nice turn of phrase for the state of many luxury brands at the time. He said they were \"important in duty-free\". It's a good way to describe those expensive labels that are kind of nice, but you only really buy them when they're discounted and you're bored, waiting to be somewhere else. Travel preoccupies Kim Jones, and at Louis Vuitton it's his theme. Not kicking-your-heels-in-the-departure-lounge tedium, but transcontinental, international culture.</p> <p>\"Louis Vuitton is about deep-seated, proper luxury. In every old romantic movie they have Vuitton luggage. Look at Liz Taylor's collection, the Duke of Windsor's. I think it still maintains that ethos.\" His first three collections have been inspired by different countries and their art and lifestyle. It's a concept that works for a brand that needs to feel cosmopolitan. \"When I first talked to LVMH, my presentation was all about travel and explorers. After all, it's a travel brand that started with a trunk.\"</p> <p>His debut for spring/summer 2012 was about Africa, where he spent his childhood, and the influence of 1970s fashion and wildlife photographer Peter Beard meant that club ties and suits appeared alongside scarves inspired by Masai blankets on the catwalk. Autumn/winter 2012 looked at Paris and Tokyo, examining the 19th-century European craze for Japonisme \u2013 something which influenced the LV logo \u2013 and the work of fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez, who lived in Tokyo in the 1980s. Elegant double-breasted suits featured traditional kimono silks. Lopez's feather-and-arrow motif appeared on bags and as pins. Next summer's collection (which showed in June) is all about water and boating, specifically yachting as enjoyed by Yves Carcelle \u2013 the CEO of Louis Vuitton who is cited as an influence in the show notes. Jones reworked the clich\u00e9 of the nautical theme with rubber-duck yellow anoraks, outsized rucksacks that looked like lifebuoys and dapper yachting blazers. All three collections show wit and skill and a voracious interest and insight not just in fabric and fit, but also in the art and cultures that informed Jones's work.</p> <p>\"I wanted to inject fun into the brand,\" he says. \"It has an optimism. Like with the last collection, it's the idea of a really rich guy on his yacht \u2013 having it.\"</p> <p>The idea of travel and moving between worlds comes easily to Jones. It's what he's done his whole life. His English father met his Danish mother in the Canary Islands, and though he was born in London in 1979, the family moved to Ecuador when he was three months old. He spent his childhood in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana and the Caribbean, moving on as his father's job as a hydro-geologist demanded. (His uncle is Colin Jones, incidentally, a photographer for the<em> Observer </em>in the 1960s who also worked for <em>National Geographic</em> and <em>Life</em> magazine.) \"It's amazing when you're a kid to have a great time out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by animals, to see how big and beautiful the world is and be excited by that.\"</p> <p>His first memory of clothing is of his favourite T-shirt when he was five in Botswana. It had to be washed each night so he could wear it every day. It was emblazoned with a&#xa0;lion and the word \"lion\" was spelt out between the beast's legs, which he thought was very clever. The Africa years gave him a life-long love of animals; his hero is David Attenborough. Even though he's \"the coolest man on the planet\", the naturalist will, sadly, never inspire a collection because he only wears blue shirts and chinos. To replicate that on the catwalk would be too conceptual.</p> <p>His big sister Nadia lived in England (their parents split when he was five) and he stayed with her as a teenager. Nadia was creative director for high-street brand Oasis for 14 years, then worked with Lily Allen on her Lucy in Disguise clothing line. She encouraged him to go into fashion, giving him her collection of <em>The Face</em> and<em> i-D</em> magazines when he was 14. \"I loved looking at the people in them, how cool they were. Now I know most of them.\" Emma Hill, head of Mulberry, is his sister's friend and she used to babysit Kim when he was a kid. \"It's funny, this little world of fashion.\"</p> <p>When we met in July he was heading off on holiday the next day. \"One of the nice things about working at Louis Vuitton is that you get five weeks off in the summer, just like school.\" He's heading to Nepal, Kenya, Tanzania, Zanzibar then Suffolk. Will he miss Paris? He thinks for a bit. \"I have a lovely place and the team at work is brilliant. And now I know where I can buy <em>Heat</em> every week, and I've found Marks &amp;&#xa0;Spencer for food \u2013 that's made a difference.\"</p> <p>He may like his British comforts, but it sounds as if Jones will be in Paris for some time. \"I can't say often enough how great this job is,\" he reminds me. \"It's my dream job, and I've got it just 10 years after I left college.\" When you get what you want so quickly, don't you have to wonder what's going to come next? Jones doesn't think so. He's got enough to keep him busy here. \"When travel is your resource, you can do anything. How many countries are there? About 200? Well, that's 200 collections, right there. I&#xa0;can go anywhere in the world from here.\"</p>",
  "<p>Isabella Rossellini \u2013 actor, muse, style icon \u2013 sits on the ground, legs splayed. She's not in a good way: she has a pair of black eyes, her yellow and black tunic is rumpled, her antennae are bent all out of shape. Most alarmingly, her penis has snapped off and blood is seeping from her midriff.</p> <p>An old man, who looks very much like Rossellini but with a lush beard made from shredded newspaper, leans forward, concerned. \"What happened to you? You are severely wounded,\" he points out.</p> <p>\"I had sex,\" she replies matter-of-factly.</p> <p>\"What kind of sex?\"</p> <p>he asks.</p> <p>\"Regular bee sex.\"</p> <p>If you have been following Rossellini's career lately, this is a routine, unexceptional exchange; if you haven't, it might come as a shock. The daughter of director Roberto Rossellini and actor Ingrid Bergman, she started out as a&#xa0;model \u2013 most visibly as the face of Lanc\u00f4me for many years. She then became an enigmatic screen beauty with a quirky edge, unforgettably in David Lynch's <em>Blue Velvet </em>and <em>Wild at Heart</em>. More recently Rossellini has made eye-catching guest-turns on <em>Friends</em> and as Jack Donaghy's estranged wife on <em>30 Rock</em>.</p> <p>Who knew, however, that the roles she was really born to play were animals and bugs: a sinister praying mantis, a voracious bed bug, a kinky dolphin? In 2008, when she was in her mid-50s, Rossellini unveiled a bizarre, provocative and often hilarious set of short films called <em>Green Porno</em>, made for Robert Redford's Sundance Channel. They are a scientific, X-rated look at the sexual proclivities of various creatures, told with a homespun, PG-13 aesthetic of handcrafted costumes and origami backgrounds. Rossellini wrote the scripts, performed and directed the action. She won awards, too, including a Webby \u2013 an Oscar of the online world. She followed it up with two companion series on mating rituals called <em>Seduce Me</em>.</p> <p>Rossellini's new films focus on honey bees. Made with the cosmetics company Burt's Bees, the three two-minute vignettes detail different aspects of life in a colony. They show an imagined conversation between Burt Shavitz, veteran beekeeper and eccentric founder of Burt's Bees, played by Rossellini in drag, with the three types of bee in the hive: the queen, the workers and a drone. As with <em>Green Porno </em>and <em>Seduce Me</em>, they are crammed with odd facts and salacious details about sex (the drone suicidally leaves its penis inside the queen in a bid to guarantee paternity, the tragic injury alluded to earlier).</p> <p>Accuracy has always been important to Rossellini \u2013 she took biology classes at New York University to research her films \u2013 but her latest work has a more explicit environmental message than before. Colony collapse disorder (CCD) has seen bee populations plummet by around 30% a year over the past decade, with the effects particularly heavily felt in the United States and Europe. A solution is desperately sought, and there are fearful predictions of what might happen. Not that Rossellini is getting all serious on us just yet. \"I ask a lot of questions before I start, but I hope none of the depth remains in the films,\" she says. \"I want them to be comical.\"</p> <p>It's half an hour before the premiere of the films and we are sitting on a rooftop in downtown Manhattan, the sunset dipping behind the skyscrapers, drinking elderflower, honey and vodka cocktails (better, and stronger, than they sound). All of the drinks and canap\u00e9s have been created to show off ingredients that would be in peril if bees ceased to exist. Extinction would mean no honey, obviously, but also none of the plants that worker bees are responsible for pollinating: apples, strawberries, almonds, cocoa and coffee, among something like 70 crops. That's one in every third bite \u2013 and most of the fun ones \u2013 in the developed world.</p> <p>Rossellini is dressed down in a black trouser suit, but she is still a striking presence, with a&#xa0;natural, unfussy elegance. On the way to the event I stopped at a newsagent and noticed her smiling face on the June issue of Italian<em> Vogue</em>, photographed by Steven Meisel. It is her 24th <em>Vogue</em> cover and this time she's the face of the magazine's new global Health Initiative, encouraging a healthier approach to body image. It's a satisfying compliment for a woman who has just turned 60, but this world is not a big part of Rossellini's life now.</p> <p>\"I'd like this to become my principal activity: to make films about animals,\" she says. \"Of course it's always interesting to model, but it depends who you are working with. I will continue to make acting, too, but I'm old \u2013 I'm getting tired of it. And at 60 you don't get many big roles \u2013 you have supporting roles most of the time \u2013 so there is time to evolve and do other things. That's how my films came about. I had more time, so I thought: 'OK, I'll go back to school; I'll study what I'm interested in.' So I'd like to follow what has been my hobby.\"</p> <p>Rossellini points out that hers is hardly a&#xa0;high-fashion existence any more. She lives on a farm in Long Island, an hour or so outside New York, where she is surrounded by a&#xa0;menagerie of creatures. She keeps chickens and has a&#xa0;couple of pigs, and trains labradors and golden retrievers from birth for the Guide Dog Foundation. She is also a member of the local farming co-operative and is responsible for tending the beehives.</p> <p>\"I grew up in Italy and our country is a country of great agriculture and food produce,\" she explains. \"It wasn't like I was urban and only knew about high-heeled shoes and purses and never knew where my eggs came from. When I grew up we always had our chickens and we ate our eggs and we ate our chickens. The family always had a pig and we would kill it at Christmas and eat it for three or four months afterwards. The only part I've lost is eating the one I know. That is New York. Many years in New York has made me urban, and I won't eat my chicken because I met him personally!\"</p> <p>Bees, in this sense, are perfect. \"They have been domesticated to produce more honey, but still they are wild,\" she says. \"So we can use them without killing them.\"</p> <p>At the premiere, the shorts are well-received by the bee campaigners and aficionados, as are the chocolate-dipped strawberries that follow them. \"The films anthropomorphise the situation a bit, they exaggerate a little, they use some artistic license but what they do is they get you curious,\" says Laurie Adams, executive director of the Pollinator Partnership, an influential bug-friendly charity. \"And it allows people to see that they can play a role in helping to protect them.\"</p> <p>\"Isabella's really accurate with what goes on with bees,\" agrees Dr Christina Grozinger, an associate professor of entomology at Penn State University and one of America's foremost bee experts. \"The films actually touch on a lot of points that scientists have been confused about for years. Like the fact that the queen mates up to 16 times; we are probably all surprised by how promiscuous she is. But recently it's become clear that colonies that are more genetically diverse are more resistant to diseases and they are also more productive.\"</p> <p>No one, though, is becoming too carried away and the fact that bees keep disappearing \u2013 often overnight, without trace, like an alien abduction \u2013 creates a sombre undercurrent to the evening. Colony Collapse Disorder has been linked to parasites, pathogens and pesticides; one recent study was particularly suspicious of a pesticide called neonicotinoids, or neonics, which are widely used to grow genetically engineered corn and seem to make bees become disorientated. Grozinger and others, meanwhile, believe the strongest link is with habitat loss. The situation is further confused by the fact that the cases of CCD significantly decreased last winter, and yet still the overall numbers of bees lost remained around 30%. \"We can say that bees that are in environments that have lots of plants seem to be doing better,\" says Grozinger. \"Everyone hopes there's a silver bullet, but essentially it's like cancer, there's multiple causes. Each individual colony that dies may be dying from something entirely different. So at this point it's thought that it's multiple factors probably acting in synergy.\"</p> <p>The situation in the UK is worryingly similar. There are around 30,000 beekeepers here and the honey bee is particularly valuable as a pollinator because it is smaller than our bumble bees, so can access more plants, and also travels more widely, up to three miles from the hive. Honey bees also put in a longer shift than other pollinators, starting in February and only clocking off in November. It's estimated that one colony, which will typically contain around 30,000 bees, can pollinate up to 300 million flowers in one day. As numbers dwindle, their absence is sure to have an impact on the environment around us.</p> <p>\"Within the next 20 years we will either see beekeeping surviving as an activity or we won't and the numbers will drop to 10,000 beekeepers in favoured parts of the country,\" says Robin Dartington, who runs the bee sanctuary Buzz Works in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. \"We will certainly notice the effect environmentally. There are a number of trees that flower early and go on to produce berries that feed birds. Trees that require early pollination will fade and the countryside will shift to favouring plants that flower later, when there are other pollinators around. It's not to be taken for granted.\"</p> <p>We can't necessarily rely on scientists to bail us out, either. Dartington has noticed a drop-off in research in recent years and now much of the funding is being left to interested parties, such as the almond and blueberry industries in the States and Burt's Bees, which uses bee and plant extracts in almost all of their products.</p> <p>Rossellini hopes her films will help bring the subject to a wider audience and, once they have stopped tittering, they will do something to help the bees in the their area, starting with buying honey from local beekeepers. She has tried to do her bit, too: for her 60th birthday in June, she asked all the guests at her party to buy her bulbs, which she will plant in her garden next year for her bees to forage. \"It will be great, because in spring I will see all my friends coming up,\" she says.</p> <p>Momentarily she turns serious. \"If you learn about nature you become fascinated by it and it's natural you want to protect it. If you know they do suffer, they do disappear, they do get killed, you start to take a responsibility. But I'm optimistic for the bees: I think people want to care for bees because of the honey. People like dessert.\"</p> <p><em>To see the films, visit </em><a href=\"http://www.burtsbees.co.uk/\" title=\"\">burtsbees.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Claire Danes is glowering at me through a subway window with a look in her eyes that makes me want to confess to crimes I never committed. That face \u2013 the surly set jaw and stony scowl \u2013 is all over New York's subway walls right now. And below it, in big letters, the words \"IT HITS HOME\" and \"9/30\". This is the date that <em>Homeland</em>, the drama threatening to trump <em>The Wire</em> as the crowning show of this television \"golden age\", returns with a second series. It's the kind of TV that makes for a wipe-your-weekend-plans box set: the ending of every crack-fix of an episode had me twitchily reaching for the remote to a&nbsp;muttered internal monologue of: \"Next one, next one, now, now\u2026\"</p> <p>Danes carries the series as the bipolar CIA agent Carrie Mathison, whose furious vigilance is hard to distinguish from pathological mania as she investigates, and ultimately falls for, Sergeant Brody (Damian Lewis), a Marine who may or may not be a terrorist after eight years held captive by al-Qaida. The plotting, which tips viewers back and forth between suspicion and conviction, is virtuosic.</p> <p>We've arranged to meet in the poolside bar of the Trump SoHo, where women in very short dresses and very high heels are shouting in each other's ears and failing to hear anything over brain-pulverisingly loud Ibiza beats. Danes appears \u2013 not unhinged-savante CIA agent, nor radiant red carpet celebrity but just an unmistakably pregnant lady in jeans, cardigan and a red T-shirt stretched taut by a neatly swelling belly. She slopes in, stops, and takes in the scene wearily. \"Well, this,\" she says, \"is not going to work.\"</p> <p>We end up taking refuge in a corner of the half-renovated, closed-off library, which, a member of staff anxiously explains, \"hasn't been Trumpified yet\". I look at Danes and can't imagine anyone caring less. Her characters have always had an edge of unease to them, and that seems true, too, of her own sense of herself in the world: the oddness of this half-built corner seems appropriate.</p> <p>The creators had Danes in mind when they were writing the <em>Homeland</em> pilot, so much so that in the original scripts the character is called Claire. \"So that was very flattering and a little surprising,\" she says. \"And a little alarming, actually \u2013 that it was a role tailor-made for me. I mean, I didn't see myself in that particular light. When I talked to my agent, she said: 'Well, ya know, you'll have a lot to <em>do</em>' \u2013 which was a bit of an understatement.\"</p> <p>Towards the end of the series her character experiences a manic episode \u2013 a difficult state to portray without risking cartoonishness. But Danes is electrifying, weather fronts of expression rushing over her malleable face. \"I think it's important to never play 'crazy' \u2013 you have to know what kind of crazy you're playing. There are very few opportunities to play characters that are this rich, this active. It's a filet mignon of a role.\"</p> <p>She's signed up for seven years of it and already garnered a Television Critics Association award; she has also won best actress for the role at both the Golden Globes and last week's Emmys. Mandy Patinkin, who plays her mentor Saul, has talked about her talent in words extravagant even for the realms of luvvie hyperbole. He recently told the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> that he would die for her. \"She is one of our great gifts as an artist... and I am one of the privileged people to get to be with her and learn from her every day.\"</p> <p>The show's biggest endorsement, though, has been from Barack Obama, who reportedly requested four copies of the season finale. When the president sat next to Danes's co-star Damian Lewis at a recent state dinner, he told him: \"While Michelle and the two girls go play tennis on Saturday afternoons, I go in the Oval Office, pretend I'm going to work, and then I switch on <em>Homeland</em>.\"</p> <p>I wonder what goes through his head as he watches. There's one episode in which the vice president attempts to conceal his government's drone strike on an Iraqi school by claiming terrorists have faked the images of maimed and killed children.</p> <p>\"It's very provocative,\" she agrees. Before accepting the role, \"I certainly had questions, if not reservations, because it is so immediately relevant to what's happening in the world. I&nbsp;was concerned that it might become exploitative in some way. But I'm so impressed with how the writers have managed to tell a very volatile story without being reckless.</p> <p>\"The first time I realised I was patriotic was after September 11th,\" she says. She was living in Sydney. \"I couldn't have been farther away, physically, from the event, but I&nbsp;grew up in downtown New York, not even a mile away from the towers. One of my friends wanted to have a debate about it, and when she was pressing me to take an intellectual position I&nbsp;just kind of barked: 'My house is on fire!' That's how it felt; it just felt personal and visceral. Growing up in New York with artist parents \u2013 a very liberal environment, where we were always encouraged to challenge the status quo \u2013 I think for a long time I confused jingoism with patriotism. And that is a mistake.\"</p> <p>Danes spent a day with an officer at Langley, the CIA's headquarters in Virginia, and that seems to have fortified her patriotism, too. \"They were very earnest in their devotion to the United States of America. I was very touched by that.\"</p> <p>And then she switches from serious citizen to excited kid as she starts talking about what the real-life CIA agents do. \"I was just struck by the fact that these spies do really spy-y things! They'll get into a car crash with somebody \u2013 they'll literally bump into somebody to initiate and then cultivate a relationship. I mean, in some ways \u2013 this seems a little presumptuous and it's not entirely accurate \u2013 but actors and CIA agents are [both] migratory and assume different roles. It's very hard to maintain relationships when you are having to conceal so much. They often marry each other \u2013 kind of like actors. I mean, who else is gonna get it?\"</p> <p>She speaks from experience: Danes met British actor Hugh Dancy in 2007 on the set of romantic drama <em>Evening</em>, and they married two years later. The couple is about to move into a new Manhattan apartment, and from her hotel room she can see both this new place and the building she's lived in since she was 18. A new address must seem like a minor change compared to impending motherhood.</p> <p>\"I've been fantasising about this for a long time. I want to know: who is this person?\" She addresses her belly. \"I just want to meet this little nugget! Who's this \u2013 she, he \u2013 gonna be?\"</p> <p>When I ask her about the films she loved as a teenager, she responds: \"Oh god \u2013 <em>Molly Ringwald</em>! Those John Hughes movies. Oh my god did I love her.\" People talk the same way about Angela Chase, the sardonic and sentimental heroine of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/09/my-so-called-life\" title=\"\"><em>My So-Called Life</em></a>, the teen TV series that began Danes's career in 1994. Thanks to its appearance on Netflix, the show has been granted a new cultural currency by a generation of teenagers hungry for the borrowed nostalgia of oversized plaid shirts and velvet scrunchies.</p> <p>\"There was that whole resurgence of grunge, that 90s revival,\" she smiles. \"It was a good era \u2013 there was <em>Sassy</em> magazine, <em>Daria</em> \u2013 this whole crop of droll, knowing, wonderfully off girls. Now we've got very 'off' women.\"</p> <p>Was she a very serious 15-year-old? \"I was, but so many teenagers are serious, that's why they're so hilarious. For a long time I was playing at being a grown-up and it was a slightly confused idea of what that meant. I&nbsp;was all,\" she frowns and balls her fists, \"serious face and phoney moustache. Now I kind of realise that the grown- ups never really knew what they were doing, and that's OK.\"</p> <p>The irony of being a teen star synonymous with the angst of high-school life is that you never get to experience that life yourself. \"I lived my adolescence on that set, with styrofoam lockers, in some abstracted version of a high school, so I don't really know who I&nbsp;would have been in high school. I didn't have a peer group to figure that out within; it was all sort of suspended.\"</p> <p>It sounds like she had a truly terrible time at school. \"I was busy being misanthropic and miserable, as most 13-year-olds are. Wuh,\" she exhales. \"God. Yes, that was not a great time. Girls at 12 are horrid. There were so many intricate social rules that I just could not be bothered to observe. I&nbsp;didn't know that you were supposed to dumb down. But I learned it fast when I made myself so vulnerable to ridicule.\" After a certain point she just ran away from it to act. \"It was such a&nbsp;relief, because I was so ready to borrow Winnie's [Holzman, the creator of <em>My So-Called Life</em>] perfect words and just scream them out: 'Fuck. Y'all.'\"</p> <p>She won her first Golden Globe for the series, and YouTube obliges with footage of 15-year-old Danes hunched behind the podium in her spaghetti-strap dress and making an endearingly gauche speech. A year after this, in 1996, she played Juliet to Leonardo DiCaprio's Romeo in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/baz-luhrmann\" title=\"\">Baz Luhrmann</a>'s blockbuster. Soon after, she turned down the role of Rose in <em>Titanic</em>. Chasing stardom never seems to have been her priority.</p> <p>\"I've always wanted to play a woman who drives the story forward, [who] doesn't just facilitate somebody else's story. And you have to be an actor-protagonist in order to do that,\" she says. \"I mean, I also like playing supporting roles, but they have to have some course to take, not just be insipid and attractive.\"</p> <p>By 1998 the extent of her celebrity was confirmed with a <em>Vogue</em> cover. \"Ivy League Star\" ran the strapline: this was also the year that she enrolled as an undergraduate at Yale University. Her two years there seem to have satisfied more of a social than an intellectual need. \"I was so relieved at college to discover that people became much less awful \u2013 they stopped being assholes after a certain point.\"</p> <p>She majored in psychology and says that if she weren't an actor she'd be a therapist. \"Psychology and acting are very closely linked. It's just about studying people and how they work. It can be an incredible discipline and exercise. I haven't been in a while \u2013 I haven't really needed to \u2013 but I'm glad it's there if I ever do.\"</p> <p>She first went to therapy when she was six. A fact which, she protests, has been overstated. \"I &nbsp;had these imaginary friends who followed me around and made me do things,\" she says dismissively. \"I don't know \u2013 I was a little OCD. But it's not that relevant, not that big a deal.\"</p> <p>Acting doesn't seem like that big a deal to her either. \"It's not where I experience my personal catharsis,\" she says. \"It's ridiculous what we do, and I find it endlessly amusing. As a young performer I didn't know that you can have a great time playing someone in terrible crisis. The more you know it's not real, the deeper you can go in to it. And the easier it is to let it go when it's done. It means,\" she shrugs, \"you feel much more entitled to your happiness.\"</p> <p>Homeland<em> season 2 starts on Channel 4 on Sunday 7 October at 9pm</em></p>",
  "<p>\"Those who would meanly and coldly forget their old mother could not be expected to be faithful to their young bride.\" So Senator Carl Schurz, as the first German-born American elected to the US Senate, defended his multiple identities in 1872. What was more, he had a clear response to the canard of \"my country, right or wrong\": \"if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right.\"</p> <p>Such questions of identity, affiliation and assimilation are behind <a href=\"http://www.soutphommasane.com.au/\" title=\"\">Tim Soutphommasane's</a> intriguing treatise, which urges liberals to support a conception of citizenship in which strangers \"share a commitment to and special concern for their country and fellow compatriots\". Forget cosmopolitanism; embrace patriotism.</p> <p>The work adds to a growing literature addressing the conundrum of how to foster national identity in an age of mass migration \u2013 the challenge of which is only heightened by radical Islam and the \"war on terror\". President Sarkozy responded to the threat of multiculturalism by banning the niqab; Australia witnessed the birth of Pauline Hanson's nativist One Nation party; and the UK has had its perpetual symposium on Britishness.</p> <p>Soutphommasane's book begins with a familiar demand for the left to engage with the virtues of patriotism. George Orwell is invoked, and Soutphommasane then aligns himself with the school of liberal nationalism. For years now, the likes of Michael Lind and David Miller have argued that \"liberal goals cannot reliably be achieved except in societies whose members share a common national identity\". And that identity is not simply inherited, but rather shaped and reshaped by a process of inclusive, interpretative debate.</p> <p>However, where Soutphommasane thinks the liberal nationalists have gone wrong is in failing to frame their argument in the language of patriotism and civic virtue. Mind you, not any old patriotism. Soutphommasane is not interested in \"constitutional patriotism\", which is too transactional in terms of citizenship rights. Nor does he want \"republican patriotism\", which can elide into blood and soil nationalism.</p> <p>Instead, he argues for a turn to what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/billy-bragg?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Billy Bragg</a> would call progressive patriotism. This conscious celebration of a more cohesive narrative of cultural identity would take place in parliaments, schools, civil bodies and the media. In policy terms, Soutphommasane suggests a hearty focus on the teaching of national history in schools \u2013 although this should be carried out in a&#xa0;reasonable rather than emotional way, giving full expression to \"emotional generosity\" (good luck with that on a Thursday afternoon with Year 10). And when it comes to managed migration, he rightly argues for a policy of acculturation to national culture alongside the accommodation of minority perspectives in public institutions and practices.</p> <p>It is all sensible stuff. But liberal nationalism with a culturalist turn demands some heavy lifting \u2013 a lot of critical dialogues, minimising moral disagreements, and searching for common ground. This patriotism cannot rely on instinct or emotion. And the book itself is not without its challenges. Here is Orwell describing Englishness: \"It is somehow bound up with solid breakfasts and gloomy Sundays, smoky towns and winding roads, green fields and red pillar boxes. Moreover it is continuous, it stretches into the future and the past, there is something in it that persists, as in a living creature.\" Soutphommasane writes: \"By replacing 'unconditional' modes of national identification with 'post-conventional' processes of identity-formation, constitutional patriotism brings about the 'rationalisation of collective identities'.\"</p> <p>Perhaps an unfair comparison, but it does highlight two criticisms. The first is the lack of particularity: for a thesis so rightly concerned with the intimacies of national identity, this is a broad-brushed work of political science that seeks to impose the policy solutions of Canada and Australia on Britain. In particular, it fails to deal with the issue of welfare and identity in the context of mass migration \u2013 the question of migrant need versus indigenous contribution, of&#xa0;diversity versus solidarity.</p> <p>Secondly, Soutphommasane overlooks the current state of the United Kingdom. Orwell spoke of Englishness as distinct from Britishness. And any question of cultural patriotism needs to be interwoven within our debate about Scottish independence.</p> <p>That said, this is a worthy contribution to current thinking on liberal nationalism, identity and migration. It marks another welcome rejection of the \"community of communities\" multiculturalism of the late 1990s, as we rediscover the ties that bind in a liberal polity. And it's encouraging to see that Labour party policy supremo <a href=\"http://www.joncruddas.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Jon Cruddas</a> has been drawing on Soutphommasane's work in his own meditations on national identity. But Dr Soutphommasane could really do with making his case as punchily as Senator Schurz.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tristramhunt.com/web/\" title=\"\"><em>Tristram Hunt</em></a><em> is MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central</em></p>",
  "<p>Beware sequels. Neil MacGregor's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/\" title=\"\">radio series</a> and accompanying book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/art/9781846144134/a-history-of-the-world-in-objects\" title=\"\"><em>A History of the World in 100 Objects</em></a>, inspired by his stewardship of the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">British Museum</a>, was acclaimed for its imaginative daring. What to do for an encore? You can almost hear the cogs of the commissioning process grinding: world history \u2013 world literature \u2013 global audience \u2013 global literary brand\u2026 ? Shakespeare. Bingo!</p> <p>MacGregor had already proved himself a brilliant \"snapper-up of unconsidered trifles\", Shakespeare's description of light-fingered Autolycus in <em>The Winter's Tale</em>. Why not let him <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/shakespeares-restless-world/\" title=\"\">choose 20 secular relics</a> from around 1600, attach the Bard's name to the project, sit back and watch the ratings&#xa0;come home to roost?</p> <p>This beautifully produced souvenir volume, a collaboration between the BM, Radio 4 and the publishers, works nicely enough as popular history for middle England. MacGregor, who confesses great reverence for what he calls \"the charisma of things\", has made some provocative picks from the national collection: a tiny model of a Scottish ship, said to propitiate witches; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/shakespeares-restless-world/programmes/newscienceoldmagic/#drdeesmagicalmirror\" title=\"\">John Dee's magic mirror</a>; the fighting kit of Henry V; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao2DXVK7mH8&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">a \"German\" clock</a>; the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/shakespeares-restless-world/programmes/theatresofcruelty/\" title=\"\">preserved \"eye\"</a> of the martyred Edward Oldcorne; the \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/shakespeares-restless-world/programmes/shakespearegoesglobal/#completeworks\" title=\"\">Robben Island Bible</a>\" (a collected Shakespeare) inscribed by Nelson Mandela during his long incarceration.</p> <p>This last is a bit of a giveaway. Mandela is no Tudor or Jacobean superhero. One flaw of this book \u2013 presumably not a problem in the more immediate medium of radio \u2013 is that MacGregor wants to have it both ways. As a museum mole he is eager to drill down into the forgotten, Elizabethan detail of his chosen artefacts. At the same time he wants to suggest that Shakespeare's \"restless world\" is a mirror to our own.</p> <p>This pardonable delusion is often held by those who believe that not much is known about the author of <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>The Tempest</em> and the Sonnets. A sentimental attachment to the \"mystery\" of Shakespeare goes hand in hand with the idea that he and his works are a sublime mirror to our contemporary predicament. But the truth is that we know a surprising amount about Shakespeare, especially as a man of property and an enthusiastic litigant. Moreover, those universal themes are a sleight of hand. His late Tudor, early Jacobean world is strikingly different from our own \u2013 in faith, in science, in culture, politics and economics.</p> <p>Never mind. MacGregor describes Shakespeare's England as \"going global\" with Francis Drake. London becomes the setting for <em>Sex and the City</em>. (What city does not have sex?) Ireland is the scene for \"failing in the present\". There's even a topical reference to the intractable politics of the union, \"the flag that failed\", in which MacGregor is forced to concede that the playwright \"on the whole evades the question of Britain\". (It's not obvious he ever cared enough about this question to \"evade\" it.)</p> <p>You don't have to have an arts diploma to see that this is history as advertising. Francis Drake was never an astronaut. It does not help to&#xa0;compare Puck putting \"a girdle round the earth in forty minutes\" to a modern satellite. Venice's red-light district may have been \"another dimension of Venetian freedom\", but it was never Manhattan. MacGregor's claim that <em>Othello</em> and <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> \"would not have worked, could not have been imagined, if they had been set in London\" is a line that plays better in the studio than&#xa0;on the page.</p> <p>These are blemishes, not flaws. When MacGregor the museum curator sticks to what he knows \u2013 museum objects \u2013 he can be a revelation. Keyed into gobbets of text, his choice of clocks, mirrors and swords etc opens a door on to the lost world of London's theatregoers in and around 1600.</p> <p>MacGregor calls it \"restless\", but \"terrifying\" might be more accurate. Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in the shadow of the scaffold, the gallows and the plague. The fear of violent death was the mundane psychological backdrop to everyday existence. One of the most effective chapters here explores the phenomenon of plague through London's bills of mortality. Indeed, the bad weather of the 1590s, which kept the plague at bay and the theatres booming, may have given Shakespeare just the opportunity he needed to get started.</p> <p>But, <em>pace</em> MacGregor, this is not \"a three-way conversation between the objects themselves, the people who used or looked at them and the words of the playwright\u2026\" At best, the interrogation of these objects yields a sequence of fascinating footnotes to Shakespeare's timeless poetry. If you want a \"three-way conversation\" between Shakespeare, his work and the&#xa0;present day, read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/stephen-greenblatt\" title=\"\">Stephen Greenblatt</a>, a Shakespeare scholar unaccountably not cited here.</p> <p>Almost as a kind of afterthought, one&#xa0;of MacGregor's concluding \"objects\" is a copy of the First Folio. Here, finally, he asks the question that lets light into the eternal conundrum of these plays: \"How has this supremely public writer become the private companion of so many, his words the stuff that their hopes, fears and dreams are made on?\"</p> <p>The answer, to which MacGregor's inventory is a picturesque complement,&#xa0;is through the subtle interplay of character, language and plot. As Simon Russell Beale put it in his 2009 Ernest Jones lecture, acting Shakespeare is \"three-dimensional literary criticism\". But that's about words and ideas, not things.</p>",
  "<p>Water defines our world. When viewed from space, the blue seas that cover 70% of the surface of our planet form its most striking feature. As Arthur C Clarke once observed: \"How inappropriate to call this planet Earth when it is quite clearly Ocean.\"</p> <p>Water has also played an extraordinarily important role in the development of our species. All animals are essentially bundles of cells made mostly of water. But in the case of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, water has displayed an extra importance. In learning how to travel across the swaths of water that cover our world \u2013 a task we were tackling more than 50,000 years ago \u2013 we discovered great stretches of real estate that had been denied to our land-bound hominid predecessors. Our conquest of the seas brought us new homes and made possible our survival as a global species.</p> <p>Later, when we learned how to store and distribute water in our new homelands, we gained another evolutionary boost by providing ourselves with the means to farm crops and maintain herds of animals in a reliable manner. Irrigation meant assured food production, and human numbers have risen ever since. As the Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi put it: \"Water is life's mater and matrix, mother and medium. There is no life without water.\"</p> <p>The publication of these two books, which provide intriguing insights into humanity's exploitation of water, is timely. After all, we now live in a world that is starting to run out of the matrix of life. As Earth's population heads inexorably towards the 10 billion level, our capacity to provide fresh water for ourselves is being pushed to the limit. We are beginning to parch. Similarly, our exploitation of the seas \u2013 as we harvest fish and seafood on an industrial scale \u2013 is now stripping them of all life, turning the oceans that nurtured us into dead zones.</p> <p>In <strong>Beyond the Blue Horizon</strong>, Brian Fagan \u2013 an anthropologist from Santa Barbara and an experienced sailor \u2013 focuses on humanity's conquest of the seas and presents a vivid picture of the nautical experiences that must have been endured by the first sailors. In tiny canoes or rafts, these people were crossing substantial chunks of sea more than 50,000 years ago. At this point, <em>H&#xa0;sapiens </em>\u2013 having embarked on the great exodus from its African homelands 20,000 years earlier \u2013 had reached the south-east tip of Asia and were only a couple of short ocean journeys from New Guinea and Australia. The fact that the latter two landmasses were populated around this time indicates that humans must have made those voyages. Australia could not have been conquered any other way. \"No canoes survive from these early voyages, nor do we know much about the people who paddled them,\" adds Fagan. \"Their history, shared through the generations by word of mouth, has long since vanished in the passing of more than 50,000&#xa0;years.\"</p> <p>This lack of evidence has led many archaeologists to suggest that those first great journeys may have been accidents. A family on a canoe in coastal waters may simply have been swept out to sea by a sudden squall and ended up dozens of miles away in Australia. Fagan, however, argues that they were expert sailors. They had mastered the business of sailing in coastal waters, a far harder task than taking a boat on the open seas, and they would have known that the winds which would blow them towards the open ocean would reverse as seasons changed and would allow them to return. \"They must have also known from tell-tale signs that land was out there, over the horizon \u2013 great pillars of dark smoke from natural bushfires started by lightning strikes and distinctive cloud formations that mass over higher ground,\" adds Fagan.</p> <p>Thus humans knew exactly what they were doing when they turned their craft to the oceans. To dismiss their nautical prowess, and maintain that their epic journeys were down to chance, is temporal chauvinism. As Fagan's authoritative account makes clear, the human species has a remarkably long history when it comes to mastering ocean travel.</p> <p>By contrast, Steven Mithen's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780297864790/thirst-water-and-power-in-the-ancient-world\" title=\"\"><strong>Thirst</strong></a> \u2013 an investigation into the human exploitation of water for agricultural and industrial purposes \u2013 is concerned with more recent affairs in the tides of men, although the end result is every bit as compelling. Mithen, an archaeologist based at Reading University, believes that water, when viewed from a historical perspective, turns out to have been a powerful tool for maintaining political control: from the aqueducts of the Romans and Incas to the canal systems of the ancient Chinese \u2013 even to the first flushing toilets of the Minoans of Crete, whose temples were fitted with sewage and drainage systems of stunning sophistication.</p> <p>The key point is that the ability to store and deliver water has been the cornerstone of civilisation. \"Ever since the Neolithic, the world has had an unquenchable thirst for water,\" says Mithen. \"Meeting that need was a key driver of social, economic and political change within the ancient world, one that played a fundamental role in both the rise and then fall of ancient civilisations.\"</p> <p>Crucially, Mithen adds, this unquenchable thirst continues today, though it is \"perhaps more desperate than it has even been before\". In this respect, he is almost certainly correct. We take the matrix of life for granted today. In the overheated, over-populated future that lies before us, we may no longer have that luxury.</p>",
  "<p>The seasons are turning. In Britain, with an oceanic climate and the mellowing influence of the Gulf Stream, the days become progressively cooler, early morning frosts soon thaw in the autumn sunshine, and the descent into winter is a gradual affair. I have just returned from a trip to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, where summer was just about to become winter, with an abruptness that still surprises even a well-travelled Briton. But humans in the central United States and Britain generally respond to the onset of the cold with similar changes in behaviour, spending more time indoors and digging out woolly jumpers from the bottom drawer. Other animals react by finding a suitable den in which to slumber through the months of cold.</p> <p>The taxi driver who took me to Jackson Hole Airport told me that it would be snowing within two weeks. The grizzly bears of Grand Teton would already be looking for somewhere to hibernate. Many birds, being among the most mobile of vertebrates, take to the wing and fly south to find warmth. Some North American and northern European humans do the same, overwintering in Mediterranean refugia.</p> <p>We're enjoying a relatively long and stable period of pleasant weather at the moment. And by that, I don't mean the past few years or decades. I mean the past 12,000 years or so. For around 2.6m years, the Earth has experienced a fluctuating climate, swinging between icy glaciations and warm interglacials. It's an uneven division, with glaciations lasting around 100,000 years, and interglacials just 10,000 to 15,000. So just imagine the impact on plants and animals of these switches from long, wintry glaciations to brief, summery interglacials. The differences in climate are extreme. At the peak of the last ice age, just 20,000 years ago, vast ice sheets descended over the northern parts of Europe and North America. For any animals adapted to a temperate climate, glaciations posed something of a challenge. Hibernation and woolly jumpers would not be enough to ride out 100,000 years of winter. Those warm-loving animals (and humans) cleared out of the north and sought refuge in the south.</p> <p>But don't imagine bands, packs and herds streaming southwards. Most populations simply went extinct in northern latitudes, leaving their southern cousins to carry the torch for their species. Pollen records show the same thing happening to plants: many types of tree simply became extinct in northern Europe in the run-up to the peak of the last ice age.</p> <p>Even for those populations of plants or animals living in a habitable area \u2013 or refugium \u2013 in the south, survival right through a glaciation is far from guaranteed. The refugium may just be too small to support a viable population, especially for large-bodied animals or carnivores. Often the last glimpse of extinct ice-age species in the fossil record comes from relict populations clinging on in southern refugia, just before their species light is extinguished. Neanderthals are often thought of as being \"cold-adapted\". They might have been a bit stockier than us, but they're not by any means an Arctic species. They existed in Europe for some 200,000 years, but like all the other temperate-adapted animals, they cleared out of northern Europe during glaciations and hunkered down in southern refugia. We see them for the last time in the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula, living in caves on the Rock of Gibraltar, around 28,000 years ago. And then they're gone.</p> <p><a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/10/22/rspb.2009.1272\" title=\"\">Refugia are not just places where extinction is more likely, though.</a> They are also places where new species are born. Fragmented, isolated populations are likely to evolve in different directions. For warm-loving species, the south may provide an important refugium during a glaciation, but a few small populations may also be able to hang on in pockets of suitable habitat in the north. Some time in the past 300,000 years, a population of brown bears clung on through a long glaciation in an isolated northern refugium \u2013 perhaps in Ireland. Those bears gradually adapted to the icy north. They became a new species \u2013 of&#xa0;white, polar bears.</p> <p>Our own species may have appeared&#xa0;in a similar way, in a glacial refugium. It's thought that modern humans (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) and Neanderthals (<em>Homo neanderthalensis</em>) evolved from the same ancestral species: <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>. It's likely that these ancient humans spread across Africa, Europe and Asia during an interglacial, then the population became fragmented during&#xa0;a glaciation.<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6074/1317.abstract\" title=\"\">Each isolated group of ancestors evolved in a different direction: in the European refugium, they became Neanderthals; in Africa, they became modern humans.</a> A later interglacial provided modern humans with the opportunity to expand out of Africa and across the&#xa0;globe. At the peak of the last glaciation, the modern human population was hit hard, but we&#xa0;survived.</p> <p>So here we are, in an interglacial. It's sobering to remember that this is just a brief interlude. Some time fairly soon, we'll probably begin the descent into a long glacial winter again. When that happens, all the temperate-adapted animals that currently range widely across the northern hemisphere will clear out of the far north. Ice sheets will grow down over North America and northern Europe again. Our civilisations have grown up in this unseasonably stable (and already overlong) warm interglacial. We've grown a huge global population in this favourable climate. It will be even more difficult to support such a massive number of people when the world becomes colder and drier again.</p> <p>But for those cold-adapted animals that are currently hanging out in Arctic refugia, things will look up. If polar bears manage to cling on, there'll be much more room for them in the next&#xa0;glaciation.</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago, Nat Rothschild received an important telephone call. On the other end of the line that day in October 2010, hawking a deal, was Ian Hannam, the JP Morgan banker and a former territorial in the SAS.</p> <p>Hannam had identified a pair of coal mining firms in Indonesia he believed would make decent targets for Rothschild's newly floated \u00a3700m cash shell, Vallar \u2013 including PT Bumi Resources, a highly indebted miner controlled by the Bakrie family. After just two meetings and three weeks, the scion of the famous banking family took the bait. \"One has to be decisive when opportunities present themselves,\" he said afterwards.</p> <p>At the time there were many concerned City observers who, given the Bakries' already controversial reputation, described the financier's decision to buy a 29% stake in the miner in less positive terms. But scepticism about the deal in the Square Mile is now almost universal after last week's news that Rothschild's vehicle had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/24/rothschild-mining-bumi-investigation-indonesia\" title=\"\">launched an investigation into allegations of financial dishonesty at the Indonesian firm</a>. The London-listed shares that Rothschild had floated as Vallar, and had since been renamed Bumi plc, slumped by 40% in two days.</p> <p>Worse still, Rothschild's Vallar investors have now lost 85% of their stakes since the 2010 flotation \u2013 and when viewed alongside the 22% drop in the value of Rothschild's oil investment vehicle, Genel, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/sep/18/volex-apple-iphone-component\" title=\"\">profit warning earlier this month at the electrical components maker Volex</a>, where Rothschild holds almost a quarter of the shares, some are beginning to question what the financier's future might hold.</p> <p>\"[The Bumi revelations] are disastrous for the Rothschild name,\" says John Meyer, an analyst at Fairfax IS. \"It has wiped a huge proportion off the value of the fund and will limit his future ability to raise funds in the City. There may well now be a number of investors who will look to short the other vehicle [Genel].\"</p> <p>There is not much evidence of anybody shorting Genel shares, at least not yet. But, even so, the Rothschild story was not meant to turn out like this.</p> <p>Having worried his family with his exploits during his school and university days at Eton and Oxford, the playboy partygoer transformed his image into that of a workaholic, jet-setting financier who drank cola instead of cocktails and would fly anywhere on his private jet to seal a deal.</p> <p>While he clearly started with considerable advantages in life, he managed to earn respect in financial circles by being seen to have made money by using his wits, work ethic and family name, and not simply by exploiting the vast fortune generated by his forebears.</p> <p>Still, Rothschild is thought to have initially attempted to rope his father, Lord (Jacob) Rothschild, into the Vallar deal via his $2bn investment trust RIT Capital Partners. When Rothschild <em>p\u00e8re</em> declined, the son decided to take somebody else's idea and run with it himself.</p> <p>In February 2010 the British entrepreneur Hugh Osmond had raised \u00a3400m by floating a cash shell called Horizon in order to acquire indebted companies and restructure them. Rothschild called Osmond's bankers at Credit Suisse to ask if they might do the same for him. They agreed.</p> <p>The result was Vallar and at the time few questioned Rothschild's credentials, with some suggesting that he might become the richest Rothschild ever. One source close to the float said: \"Nat Rothschild had made a lot of money for himself and other people through [his hedge fund] Atticus. He was a good custodian of other people's money.\"</p> <p>To a point. Certainly he has always trumpeted the fact that earlier investors in Atticus \u2013 which was named after Atticus Finch, the lawyer in <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> \u2013 made a fortune as they benefited from two market booms. A valedictory communication with investors as the fund was effectively closed in 2009 recorded that Atticus Global was up 19% annually, after fees, compared with a gain of 3.9% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. Rothschild was a massive winner personally too: <em>Alpha</em>, a hedge fund industry magazine, estimated his 2007 earnings to be $250m.</p> <p>None the less, the full Atticus story is not an entirely glowing one. As the financial system imploded in 2008, Atticus clients became some of the crisis's most high-profile victims. Investors were withdrawing funds at an alarming rate, and Atticus's asset base shrank from a peak of around $20bn to around $5bn, which it returned to clients in 2009. Investors wer riled by the fund's treatment of a $1bn investment in Deutsche B\u00f6rse, which Atticus separated from its main funds: clients argued that this limited their ability to withdraw their money.</p> <p>A further $1.2bn was briefly run as a separate European fund called Attara Capital; it closed this year after assets shrank again. But by that point Rothschild had moved on.</p> <p>As a co-chairman of Atticus, the young financier is thought to be frustrated that he did not receive enough credit for its performance. But Vallar and Vallares \u2013 the cash shell that became Genel \u2013 were undoubtedly his creations. Rothschild's pitch was that he would use the funds raised to acquire natural-resources assets in emerging markets, impose western standards of governance on these companies, and thereby unearth hidden gems. Vallar would be a FTSE 100 company, he predicted, and such was his energy and confidence that plenty of investors believed him.</p> <p>One source with knowledge of Rothschild's business style said: \"He is a phenomenal networker. He collects people. And then puts them together. There is not a meeting that he won't take.\"</p> <p>This all-encompassing modus operandi has thrown up intriguing deals as well as some fascinating alliances. They include Hannam, the banker who introduced the PT Bumi transaction, who is currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/03/jp-morgan-ian-hannam-resigns?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">fighting a \u00a3450,000 Financial Services Authority fine</a> for market abuse, and Ivan Glasenberg, the multi-billionaire chief executive of Glencore, in which Rothschild invested.</p> <p>He was also once close to Saif Gaddafi: the son of the now-fallen Libyan leader invited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/27/gaddafi-son-saif-al-islam-profile\" title=\"\">Rothschild to his 37th birthday party in Montenegro</a>, where the financier is investing in a luxury resort. The Gaddafi-Rothschild connections also extend to Jacob, who was a senior adviser to the Libyan Investment Authority.</p> <p>However, the relationships that always seem to define Nat Rothschild, now 41, are his friendships with former government minister Lord Mandelson and colourful Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who controls the aluminium giant Rusal, in which Rothschild has invested. If Mandelson is viewed as a controversial figure, Deripaska is doubly so, and in July he was accused of an extraordinary array of offences \u2013 including ordering an assassination \u2013 during a now-settled legal battle with bitter rival Michael Cherney. Deripaska strongly denies the claims.</p> <p>However, the Russian remains better known in the UK as the third man in an intriguing triangle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/21/mandelson-georgeosborne\" title=\"\">introduced to the world in 2008</a> after it emerged that Rothschild had invited then shadow chancellor George Osborne \u2013 an old university friend and co-member of the Bullingdon club \u2013 on board the Queen K, Deripaska's \u00a380m yacht, moored off Corfu. They were joined by Mandelson, then the EU trade commissioner, and the conversation proved politically explosive.</p> <p>Back in Westminster, Osborne gossiped that Mandelson had been dripping \"pure poison\" about Gordon Brown \u2013 which, among other things, provoked much speculation about the previously low-profile links between Mandelson, Rothschild and Deripaska. Rothschild's revenge for Osborne's indiscretion was brutal: from his base in the Swiss ski resort of Klosters, he wrote to the <em>Times </em>accusing Osborne and Andrew Feldman, the Tories' fundraiser, of trying to solicit a donation for the Conservative party from Deripaska \u2013 an approach that would have breached party fundraising rules. The Conservatives swiftly denied the allegations, but for months Osborne appeared politically emasculated.</p> <p>That tale was followed by titillating accounts of the trio enjoying \"the most delightful <em>banya</em>\", a traditional sauna in which a young man beats bathers with birch leaves. Rothschild unsuccessfully sued the <em>Daily Mail</em> for libel after it accused him of being a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/10/nat-rothschild-loses-libel-daily-mail\" title=\"\">\"puppet master\" by using his relationship with Mandelson to impress the Russian</a>. But after all the thrashings Rothschild has endured, the real question is: can he re-emerge as a key figure in finance?</p> <p>He is not currently defending himself in public. But there are still plenty in the Square Mile who, while extremely unimpressed, reckon the City's habit of forgetting previous disasters when a new money-making opportunity appears means that Rothschild can re-emerge. \"His contacts book is large and the family name as good as any,\" says one City observer. \"I'd bet he will eventually get over this.\"</p>",

  "<p>It has become an axiom for the British right wing to claim that renewable energy will only work through the provision of vast subsidies. Stick to fossil fuels instead, runs the argument and we will maintain an economic power source that has supported our industry for centuries and should continue to do so for decades. Hence George Osborne's recent decision to turn away from backing wind, tide and wave plants and to plump instead for investments in new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/26/george-osborne-gas-climate-change\" title=\"\">gas-powered power stations</a>. \"We regard unabated gas as able to play a core part of our electricity generation to at least 2030,\" he argued.</p> <p>It is a bold philosophy but a mistaken one. For a start, this new dash for gas is predicated on the notion that gas prices will be maintained at their current modest level or possibly even an cheaper one for decades. The notion is fallacious. In fact, most financial forecasts indicate that the price of gas from suppliers such as Qatar will rise in coming years as global demand outstrips planetary supplies. Thus the chancellor, in his desire to provide cheap power in the short term, threatens to shackle the nation to an extremely expensive power source in the long term. By contrast, reliance on renewable power offers us independence on the issue of energy.</p> <p>However, there is a more worrying issue at stake. It is clear from Osborne's pronouncements that he believes support for green technology and the urge to maintain economic growth are fundamental opposites. This notion is not just false but damaging. A market in renewable technologies is developing across the globe as China, India and many other nations attempt to build low-carbon economies and look to the west to buy infrastructure. Britain is well placed to create the necessary industries that can provide the world with wave and tide power plants and carbon storage technology. There is money in clean energy, in short, and the government urgently needs to accept this fact.</p>",

Like potential royal brides, they arrive with skeleton-free closets and smooth, glassy smiles.</p> <p>In such an environment, a lapse of temper (or sobriety, or fidelity, or mere manners) can end a career. But the absence of lapses is eerie. That way lies Tony Blair, whose smiling face I can no longer see without hearing the sound of wind chimes and distant screaming.</p> <p>So, lest we are to be ruled solely by sociopaths and Blair's robot children, we should give them all a Bunbury option: a \"Michael Green\", under whose name to exercise all the human complexity for which modern politics cannot currently find room. Second identities for all MPs, I say, and six weeks every year in Vegas.</p> <p><em>www.victoriacoren.com</em></p>",
  "<p>Looking back, I blame the BBC's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/vote/\" title=\"\"><em>Big Read</em></a> of 2003. Literary lists were in the air and here at the <em>Observer</em> we decided to make our own selection. Top 10? Impossible. Top 50? Why not go for an all-inclusive century? And so the <em>Observer</em>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/12/features.fiction\" title=\"\">100 greatest novels of all time</a> was begun.</p> <p>From the first, the progress of this list was improvised and, frankly, erratic. As literary editor, I explained that our choices were the result of informal polling - \"partial and highly personal\". Most of this polling involved roaming the office for a week and buttonholing colleagues about their favourite fiction. Small wonder, as several critics subsequently pointed out, the list was so Anglocentric and, indeed, so middle class.</p> <p>My \"polling\" methods threw up several unexpected admissions. Our news editor, I recall, had never read <em>Anna Karenina</em>. My distinguished predecessor, Terry Kilmartin, had devoted the last years of his life to a re-translation of Proust's masterpiece, yet many colleagues had never opened <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9782070111640/a-la-recherche-du-temps-perdu\" title=\"\"><em>A la recherche du temps perdu</em></a>. Another surprise: there was almost no appetite for the great American novelists such as Hawthorne and Melville, though almost everyone nominated <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>.</p> <p>Roughly speaking, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes\" title=\"\">Cervantes</a>, the father of the novel, the first 50 to 70 selections were fairly uncontentious. The trouble started with the 20th century, especially when the seeds of English fiction became scattered across Australia, India and Africa. Terrible sacrifices would have to be made. In 2003, I was completing a biography of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780393327519/wodehouse-a-life\" title=\"\">PG Wodehouse</a>. Yet, in the final list, there is no mention of his masterpiece <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099513759\" title=\"\"><em>The Code of The Woosters</em></a>, or even <em>Joy in the Morning</em>. I now regret this. Other omissions caused similar distress. How on earth, demanded David Baddiel at a book launch, could we have excluded John Updike? What to do about classic genre fiction? Thrillers? Ian Fleming? We wrestled inwardly, debated, juggled names \u2013 and the die was cast. Nothing concentrates the literary mind like a deadline.</p> <p>Once the <em>Observer</em>'s list was out there, it began to take on a life of its own. First, it popped up as a snippet of dialogue in 2006's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jan/22/philipfrench\" title=\"\"><em>A</em> <em>Cock &amp; Bull Story</em></a>, Michael Winterbottom's retelling of <em>Tristram Shandy</em>. Next, it got sucked into the blogosphere, spun hither and yon, denounced, praised, abused.</p> <p>The literary news cycle continued to spin. Lists changed and decayed, but the <em>Observer</em>'s list was still out there, flourishing like a mad weed. From time to time, another literary community would discover it \u2013 and go bonkers. When Australia stumbled on it in 2009 there was a bushfire of hostile commentary focusing on our choice of Peter Carey as the solitary representative of Australian fiction. There have been other, more charming moments: the concert clarinettist who confided that he kept a dogeared copy of the list in his music case; the TV producer who wondered how he could render the list as a documentary.</p> <p>And now Tom Haentjens, the Belgian artist, has conceived a trailblazing project. His graphic design studio, Beshart, has united 100 artists from 28 countries in a co-creation project, <a href=\"http://www.doedemee.be/showcase/\" title=\"\">Doedemee</a>. Each artist redesigned a poster-size cover for a book from the <em>Observer</em> list, resulting in a collection that was shown in Antwerp city hall earlier this month.</p> <p>Their aim: to raise awareness of illiteracy via a fascinating cross-section of contemporary trends in design and illustration. For the consumer and reader, it has become a poster collection that focuses on the world's classics. Meanwhile, Sarah Brown has highlighted the campaign, as has the literary agency, Curtis Brown.</p> <p>As a result, Unesco has also become involved, as part of its fight against illiteracy; there's talk of a book; Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands may write the foreword\u2026 Somehow, I imagine this list will still be making waves and stirring up debate for years to come. Not bad for a week's work in 2003.</p> <p><em>The full collection can be viewed and is for sale</em> at <a href=\"http://www.doedemee.be/\" title=\"\"><em>doedemee.be</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Something confusing happened last week. The BBC security correspondent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/25/bbc-apologises-queen-abu-hamza1\" title=\"\">Frank Gardner, went on the radio</a> and accidentally told people something that the Queen had once thought. Apparently, it's against protocol to reveal any of the Queen's thoughts or feelings, and, if she ever shares them with you, at an informal dinner, garden party or knighting, you have to take the secret to your grave as if she's shown you her donkey ears. The BBC immediately and unreservedly apologised in obvious terror of the sovereign's wrath. This, in turn, seems odd because, by making it so clear that she'd be angry, they accidentally let the whole nation in on another of her top secret royal emotions.</p> <p>What makes this even odder is that the monarchical opinion that Gardner reported is so deeply unworthy of remark: he said that she'd been \"pretty upset\" that Abu Hamza couldn't be arrested when he was such an obvious ne'er-do-well. In terms of controversy, this is on about the same level as \"What a pity it rained on the jubilee weekend\" or \"That Louis Walsh seems like an odd fellow.\"</p> <p>She's been on the throne for six decades, but we know so little about her: she likes corgis and horses, she hates Abu Hamza, and she hates people knowing that she hates Abu Hamza. I don't quite understand why. Maybe she thinks Abu Hamza is really popular. Maybe she's scared that the monarchy will be overturned if the public realise how much she despises their beloved Hamza. Maybe she thinks he's a rap star or something. Maybe she meant Monty Panesar.</p> <p>I suppose the idea is that the monarch should be above political views \u2013 that must be why Prince Charles is working so hard to get all his out of his system in time. This is a democracy and so, if our unelected head of state is associated with any opinion more contentious than regret at a tsunami, people will begin to suspect that she's influencing policy. This case is a particularly juicy opportunity for republicans to moan because Gardner claimed that she communicated her displeasure at AH's continued liberty to the home secretary. That's practically ordering his arrest, they could argue. \"Off with his head!\" says the Queen. The fact that everyone then ignores her is hardly an argument in favour of the continued funding of the civil list.</p> <p>But I think the main reason for the presumed palatial anger is that the Queen's opinions, if made public, are likely to disappoint everyone. While they're still secret, monarchists can believe that Her Majesty's head is full of wise and noble thoughts, that she gives pertinent and timely advice to stressed premiers and provides continuity and perspective. Meanwhile, her detractors can assume she's a Nazi. But the truth is likely to lie somewhere disappointingly and blandly in between \u2013 as exemplified by her views on Abu Hamza.</p> <p>I decided to test my hypothesis and have spent the past few days investigating. I've been exploring the secret bars where footmen go to drink. Armed with a truth serum and the offer of unlimited Dubonnets, I've been quizzing disgraced butlers, dismissed bodyguards, ladies too long in waiting and former ambassadors from failed states. I've made a pass at the Dowager Duchess of Carnarvon and I've posed as someone offering to tarmac the King of Greece's drive. I was worried I'd be exposed but none of these people has ever seen <em>Peep Show</em>. And I have now compiled an exhaustive list of Her Majesty the Queen's secret opinions:</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson is refreshingly honest</strong></p> <p>\"He's not like the other politicians, is he?\" the Queen apparently recently said of London's ubiquitous mayor. \"He doesn't take himself too seriously.\" Her Majesty believes that politics has become too much about presentation and spin and that it makes a nice change to see someone a bit scruffy, who's happy to make a joke, in a position of power. She has also ventured the view that this means that it's OK for him to have affairs if he wants to.</p> <p><strong>John Humphrys interrupts people too much</strong></p> <p>An avid listener to the <em>Today</em> programme, what the Queen has uniquely pointed out is that John Humphrys doesn't listen properly to the people he's interviewing. \"Why doesn't he let them say their piece, even if he disbelieves them!?\" Her Majesty shouts at the radio every morning over the din of her breakfast bagpiper.</p> <p><strong>Tim Henman is a choker</strong></p> <p>While the tennis star's style of play greatly impressed Her Majesty, she believed that, when it came to key moments in high-pressure matches, he lacked the focus and drive to push for victory. The Queen's view was that the British player's comparatively affluent middle-class background had deprived him of the hunger that spurred his rivals on to success.</p> <p><strong>Ted Heath wasn't gay but just sort of asexual</strong></p> <p>The Queen doesn't go along with the theory that Ted Heath must have been gay. \"I think sexuality is much more of a spectrum,\" Her Majesty often says. But Mr Heath \"was different\" and showed no sign of fancying either the Queen or Prince Philip which was apparently \"almost unheard-of for a political leader until about 1982\".</p> <p><strong>Canned laughter ruins a sitcom</strong></p> <p>\"I don't need to be told when to laugh,\" the Queen often remarks. She thinks it's a terrible shame when perfectly good comedy programmes are ruined by intrusive and patronising laughter tracks. \"You don't get audience laughter on the classic comedies like <em>The Good Life</em> and <em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em>.\"</p> <p><strong>Mineral water is a waste of money</strong></p> <p>The Queen never ceases to be amazed by the amount of money people waste on mineral water. \"You can drink it out of the tap \u2013 what's the problem?\" she has often been heard to moan to the Earl of Wessex who is seldom without an accompanying Volvic.</p> <p><strong>Terry Venables should be England manager</strong></p> <p>\"I don't understand why we didn't just stick with that \u2013 it seemed to be going reasonably well,\" the Queen often complains when her footman brings her the latest England result, embroidered on a napkin. \"All this chopping and changing is confusing. Why don't we just make him do it permanently?\"</p> <p><strong>If global warming exists, how come Balmoral is so draughty?</strong></p> <p>\"We could do with a bit of global warming up here, I tell you!\" the Queen repeatedly jokes. \"Talk to me about global warming when the Land Rover is stuck in six feet of snow.\" It's believed that Prince Charles did just that for several hours last January.</p>",
  "<p>Hacking comes in three varieties. The first two that came to our collective attention are bad. One is an invasion of privacy practised mainly by middle-aged men on celebrities and the vulnerable; the other is carried out mainly by teenage boys on the military-industrial complex. Both are well-documented and often result in a court appearance. But there's a third kind, a good kind, so far unfeatured on <em>Newsnight</em> and mainly practised mainly by young men with enthusiastic smiles and creative facial hair who know their Python from their Ruby on Rails (they're programming languages, dummy). The good kind is about taking something apart \u2013 a computer, a line of code, a set of data \u2013 and rebuilding it, hopefully making it better, giving it a new function, or just doing something surprising and disruptive.</p> <p>When these good hackers meet up it's sometimes called a hackday or a codefest, but more often it's called a hackathon. These events have been around for a while: the word was coined back in 1999. Since then hackathons have flourished. Hackers love to meet other hackers, team up and collaborate \u2013 and then show off the results.</p> <p>Here in the break-out area of the donated London headquarters of Mozilla \u2013 the maker of the Firefox web browser \u2013 nearly 80 people have assembled for an all-weekend hackathon. It's Friday evening, and the event doesn't end till 9pm on Sunday: many of the participants have come prepared with sleeping bags, energy snacks and anti-perspirant. The majority are male and under 30, dressed in check shirts or tees with geek-joke slogans, such as \"Se\u00f1or developer\" or \"Munch my data\".</p> <p>The event's organisers are called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3_Beards\" title=\"\">3 Beards</a>, though it turns out there are four of them and only three have significant bristles. They also organise a Friday-night meet-up for technology types in east London called the <a href=\"http://www.silicondrinkabout.com/\" title=\"\">Silicon Drinkabout</a>; a <em>Dragons' Den</em>-style event for tech startup businesses called <a href=\"http://dont.pitchmebro.com/\" title=\"\">Don't Pitch Me, Bro!</a>, and something called the <a href=\"http://www.thedigitalsizzle.com/\" title=\"\">Digital Sizzle</a> \u2013 a tech event with a barbecue as its defining feature. This is Digital Sizzle number 6: the first one that isn't free (tickets are \u00a345) and the first one to take the form of a hack.</p> <p>Hackathons come in many varieties: they can be themed around a particular programming language; focused on creating stuff for a particular platform, such as Android; or a company might invite hackers to build new things using its content \u2013 Yahoo! has run an open hack day since 2006. The 3&#xa0;Beards thought London hackathons tended to concentrate on creating startups. \"They are mainly focused on creating a business idea, then pitching it on the final evening, along with all the relevant trimmings \u2013 revenue plan, target market, etc,\" says 3 Beards's Michael Hobson. \"We thought that by making the output purely artistic, it would foster more creativity and allow people to really run wild with their ideas.\"</p> <p>So this hack has a theme: art meets tech. The aim of the weekend is to encourage the hackers to take some of the masses of data living on the internet, or even create some of their own (in one case with goldfish), and present it in new, unusual ways, to make something from it \u2013 a piece of music, an artwork, a machine, a game \u2013 something that brings the data to life. Not everyone here has a computing background: a smattering of artists, designers, musicians have signed up to collaborate.</p> <p>Some hackers have come prepared with an idea. About a dozen take turns to explain their plan to the rest of the group, hoping to fire imaginations and recruit fellow hackers to their team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397021347\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348837639891/DataDress-social-media-pa-001.jpg\" alt=\"DataDress social media pattern\" width=\"200\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DataDress, woven from social media pictures generated during London Fashion Week.

She would like to remind the nerds of the age-&#xa0;old link between weaving looms and the computer.</p> <p>Stef Lewandowski describes himself as a hacker and knows how to work a crowd of geeks: \"What we need is lasers!\" gets a cheer. He's booked time on Saturday with a laser-cutting workshop. His plan is to turn tweets into wearable jewellery.</p> <p>Developer Gavin Clark says he has two ideas. One is a \"death clock\", which will use basic personal information to calculate when and why you will die \u2013 and use a projector to display an image of, say, a heart attack on to your body. He also wants to make a machine that will reproduce the weather from somewhere else in the world using lights, fans and a hose.</p> <p>Other hackers say they plan to do work with football data, or make art from Transport for London information. Another suggests turning \"emotional data into liquid\".</p> <p>For inspiration, the crowd watch a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/aaron_koblin.html\" title=\"\">TED talk from Google data artist Aaron Koblin</a>, whose team worked on the <a href=\"http://thewildernessdowntown.com/\" title=\"\">Arcade Fire/Chris Milk film for We Used to Wait</a>, which allowed you to incorporate Google Street View images of your home town into the video \u2013 an exemplary instance of tech meeting art. Wrapping up, Benjamin Southworth an ex-3&#xa0;Beard who is now deputy CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.techcityuk.com/#!/home\" title=\"\">Tech City Investment Organisation</a> (Tech City is what the government wants us to call Silicon Roundabout) implores the gathering to \"take something that's raw and honest, turn it into magic\".</p> <p>Tonight the hackers have to go home, but, after they return at 9am on Saturday, they don't have to leave until Sunday night. The organisers have supplied everything a hacker could possibly need: powerful Hewlett Packard PCs, XBox Kinects, various bits of hardware they might need to add GPS, lighting and sound to their projects. There are mentors from cloud communication firm <a href=\"http://www.twilio.com/?_kk=twilo&amp;_kt=901dc98a-a739-4dbf-8df3-6cf16043d540&amp;pi_ad_id=10117003744&amp;gclid=CMPD65zW1bICFYKMfAod9GwAdA\" title=\"\">Twilo</a> and social media monitoring specialists <a href=\"http://www.brandwatch.com/\" title=\"\">Brandwatch</a> giving expert advice and access to their web services. There is a generous supply of beer, coffee, burgers and Mexican food. And there's one shower.</p> <p>Yet participants aren't here for the new toys, diabetes-inducing diet and natural odours. A hackathon is about much more than that. As Michael Hobson explains: \"The participants get an experience which is hard to find elsewhere. It's only in this high-pressure, time-sensitive environment that you can really come face-to-face with yourself, and see what you're capable of. People surprise themselves with what they can output over a weekend\u2026 At the very least, it can give them a thirst to be more productive in their day-to-day life.\"</p> <p>There's also a brand of tech speed-dating going on. \"As well as the 'inward' development,\" says Hobson, \"they also form close bonds with the people they collaborate with. It can go either way \u2013 if you really get on with the person, you'll have a great friendship, but, if they get on your nerves, then it will come to the surface much quicker.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c-HJs_gbKic?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c-HJs_gbKic?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>By Sunday, the sense of bonhomie is palpable and rather surprisingly the sense of body odour is not: these are clearly quite hygienic people. The 20 teams are given three minutes to present their hacks to the audience. Judges are going to select a number of the works for a one-night-only show at the Whitechapel gallery, who, like the <em>Observer</em>, are sponsoring the event.</p> <p>Rachel Taylor and her team present their dress made entirely from Instagram and Flickr pictures, a mask made from faces, and a hat made from tweets \u2013 all grabbed from London Fashion Week. The death clock was jettisoned very early on, but Gavin Clark and his team have a rudimentary weather machine to show the crowd. It works like this: the audience vote by text for the city weather they would like to witness (Jakarta, New Delhi, Rio, Cape Town and Beijing are on offer), then, with the help of a lamp, a fan, a strobe light and pond pump that streams water down a plastic sheet, they get to see 10 days' worth of weather in 100 seconds. Beijing wins, and each time it rains there's a big&#xa0;cheer.</p> <p>Stef Lewandowski (who worked alone; he calls this a \"solo hack\") asks for six women \u2013 which is most of the women in the room \u2013 to model his data jewellery. Some is in the form of coloured acrylic strands that hang from a necklace, some cut from felt and sitting on the collarbone. His wife's past 3,000 tweets are visualised as a necklace (\"The length of the strands corresponds with how chatty she is in a given period\"), while a \"necklace of death\" uses red acrylic strands to visualise how many people are talking about death on a given day, and includes an engraving of the name of someone who appeared in the <em>Guardian</em> obituaries that day. After some deliberation, the judges decide on three winners: Stef's necklaces, the See-Thru Planet iPad app, and the RSVP Network.</p> <p>Ten days later, 600 people turn up to see the projects at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/whitechapel-gallery\" title=\"\">Whitechapel gallery</a> in east London, not far from Silicon Roundabout. The teams have had a chance to polish their work and get it ready to show off in the gallery's vast white spaces.</p> <p>Stef, a veteran of many hackathons, tells me that that is what made the Digital Sizzle hackathon unique. \"This event raises the whole thing. Instead of making something that only my fellow hackers see, I'm making something that is worth someone else's time to look at.\"</p> <p>Some of the projects have already attracted commercial interest. Stef has had orders for his necklaces, and \"the wife of someone famous\" has expressed an interest in investing. If that doesn't work out, he's thinking of raising funds when <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a> launches in the UK. The weather guys have set up meetings with Virgin Atlantic and Emirates, which are both interested in the idea of machines in airports that simulate the weather in travellers' destinations.</p> <p>The tech-art culture clash has pleased Iwona Blazwick, director of the Whitechapel, who says: \"We have been so impressed with the entrepreneurial spirit as well as the sheer speed at which the techies work. Everything is possible! The results demonstrate how the collaborative power of artists with technology experts can make us see our world with fresh eyes.\"</p> <p>3 Beards's Bryce Keane is sipping on a well-earned raspberry beer. Plans are already being made to turn it into a annual event with a longer two-week exhibition. \"I don't think we imagined it would be this successful, but we're really happy that it is. It shows the London tech scene is alive and well.\"</p> <p><em>The organisers would also like to thank headline sponsors <a href=\"http://www.wpschallenger.com/\">WPS Challenger</a>, along with <a href=\"http://mindcandy.com/\">Mind Candy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wirehive.net/\">Wirehive</a>, <a href=\"http://designa-z.tumblr.com/\">Hewlett Packard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.diginate.com/\">Diginate Printers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.casio-projectors.eu/uk/\">Casio Projectors</a> and <a href=\"http://www.leaderboarded.com/home/\">Leaderboarded</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Ever since the early days of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/muse\" title=\"Muse\">Muse</a>, frontman Matt Bellamy and drummer Dom Howard have shared a running joke about success. Before each major concert, each step up the ladder, Bellamy turns to Howard and says: \"Is this it? Have we made it yet?\" Every time, the drummer shakes his head and replies: \"Not yet. Nearly.\"</p> <p>Muse's unabashed hunger for megastardom is unique among British bands of the post-indie era, who tend to reject it (Radiohead), blow it (Oasis) or be pathologically humble about it (Coldplay). Muse, however, never flinch at excess. Only health and safety thwarted their plans to dangle acrobats from a helicopter over Wembley Stadium in 2007. Their forthcoming tour in support of sixth album The 2nd Law will find them playing beneath an inverted pyramid of LED screens: an upside-down version of the \"all-seeing eye\" beloved of conspiracy theorists. \"It's turning the power structure of the world on its head,\" Howard says matter-of-factly.</p> <p>Muse have sold more than 15m albums. Their last one, 2009's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/11/muse-the-resistance-review\" title=\"The Resistance,\">The Resistance,</a> was No 1 in 19 countries. Like Depeche Mode in the 1980s, they are taken more seriously outside their homeland, in countries where people are less likely to arch an eyebrow at songs with rococo arrangements and titles such as Exogenesis: Symphony Part 2 (Cross-Pollination). Since releasing their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, the trio from Teignmouth, Devon have made their quixotically ambitious music a global concern by touring longer, farther and harder than anybody else. They used to say yes to everything, working themselves to exhaustion and becoming, says Howard, \"cynical and weird\". Success has bought them a saner work-life balance.</p> <p>I meet Bellamy, Howard and bass-player Chris Wolstenholme <strong> </strong>separately during breaks in tour rehearsals at north London's Air Studios. When they made <em>The Resistance</em> each of them was living in a different country but this time they're all based in or near London, although Bellamy and Howard also have homes in Los Angeles. The singer is engaged to the actress Kate Hudson, which makes him future son-in-law to Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, and the couple have a one-year-old son, Bingham Hawn Bellamy, whose foetal heartbeat is sampled on the new album's dubstep-disco-U2 monster Follow Me.</p> <p>So by any measure 34-year-old Bellamy is a star, but he doesn't have the aura of one. His sharp features and stick-figure frame jangle with a wary, wiry intensity and he talks quickly, with many nervous giggles. If you didn't know what he did, you might assume he was a talented software programmer with a small fortune in Silicon Valley stock options.</p> <p>\"On stage it's easy,\" he says. \"There's something about the audience and the energy that takes you to this place. I have trouble being like that when I'm not on stage. I tend to be a bit quiet \u2013 a touch avoidant, y'know? I think you do get what you visualise. I never dreamed about being in a limo or being backstage with loads of girls. I only visualised playing very well and enjoying it.\" He says that seeing the attention Hudson gets \"definitely puts your world into perspective\". Howard reckons that family life has made the singer \"slightly more relaxed, but to me he's still as manic and weird and meticulous as he's always been\".</p> <p>Because Muse's success rests on tours and albums rather than hits and headlines, they are not quite household names, so some viewers were doubtless puzzled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/12/london-2012-olympics-closing-ceremony-live\" title=\"during the Olympics closing ceremony\">during the Olympics closing ceremony</a> by the trio's performance of Survival, a berserk, operatic anthem that seemed more appropriate to a supervillain than an athlete: \"I won't forgive/ The vengeance is mine/ And I won't give in/ Because I choose to thrive.\" Bellamy admits that the song was already written when the organisers approached him. \"It was definitely a bit more demented than I think they realised,\" he says with pleasure.</p> <p>Survival makes a lot more sense in the context of <em>The 2nd Law</em>, an album which encompasses the global economic crisis, peak oil theory, food security, evolution, the taxation proposals of 19th-century economist Henry George and the concept of the \"stress nexus\". \"It's talking about the second law of thermodynamics and how, as a limited ecosystem, we are on the verge of needing an energy revolution in order to sustain the way that we're living,\" says Bellamy. \"This inner strength we have, this desire to evolve and expand and explore, I do love that about humanity. At the same time it's scary what it does on a global scale. I'm very much caught between the two.\" Bellamy is self-aware enough to have considered the quandary of criticising overconsumption while traversing the globe in a gas-guzzling stadium rock band. \"Exactly! We're all a function of the world. I think for every finger you point out there should be three pointing back at you.\"</p> <p>You don't get this kind of stuff from the Kings of Leon, but then Muse have been putting grand ideas into their records for years now. <em>Black Holes and Revelations</em>, the 2006 album which broke them in the US, was in part a bilious condemnation of the architects of the Iraq war while <em>The Resistance</em> was an us-vs-them concept album heavily inspired by <em>Nineteen-Eighty-Four</em>. (They dismiss as \"complete nonsense\" a recent $3.5m claim that it was plagiarised from US songwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/12/muse-resistance-lawsuit\" title=\"Charles Bollfrass\">Charles Bollfrass</a>.) I suspect Bellamy's politics are often overlooked because (a) he has never aligned himself with a specific cause and (b) he frames them in such a blockbuster manner that people assume he's joking \u2013 which, he insists, he is not. \"I don't think our records contain obvious humour,\" he says, a touch defensively. \"We're not cracking gags.\"</p> <p>A few years ago, Bellamy's reading list was more outr\u00e9. He often recommended that interviewers imbibe the wisdom of David Icke, although even he admitted the theory about the royal family being alien lizard people was a little too ripe. \"I was getting very drawn into obscure conspiracy theories,\" he concedes. \"As time's moved on I've become far more rational and empirical and I've managed to focus on slightly more realistic, tangible things.\"</p> <p>It's a wise move. Muse were taken aback when <em>The Resistance</em> was embraced by swivel-eyed Fox News demagogue Glenn Beck (\"the lyrics are just dead-on [about] what's coming our way\") and the single Uprising began soundtracking YouTube clips produced by the kind of people who believe climate change is a socialist conspiracy and Obama is an Indonesian Muslim. (Conservative attention seems to run in the family: Bellamy's father George used to play rhythm guitar in the Tornados, whose 1962 chart-topper Telstar was one of Margaret Thatcher's <em>Desert Island Discs </em>choices.)</p> <p>\"In the US the conspiracy theory subculture has been hijacked by the right to try to take down people like Obama and put forward right-wing libertarianism,\" Bellamy agrees. He defines himself as \"a left-leaning libertarian \u2013 more in the realm of Noam Chomsky. It doesn't all have to be about guns and land protection, y'know? So yeah, I do find it weird. Uprising was requested by so many politicians in America for use in their rallies and we turned them down on a regular basis.\"</p> <p>Bellamy's motives as a lyricist aren't polemical but personal, even therapeutic. \"When I dabble in watching the news and reading about current events I tend to get a future negative view and that's something I've dealt with through music. It's quite possible I'm slightly paranoid.\" A giggle. \"But I'd say making music is an expression of feelings of helplessness and lack of control that I think a lot of people can relate to.\"</p> <p>His songwriting stems from the belief that music can transform and transcend the everyday. \"I remember the first classical music I heard, Berlioz and Chopin\u2013 it did something to me that I still can't put into words. It's a sense of timelessness. It's something to do with the whole condition of life and death and time. It somehow makes all those things connect.\" He's full of wonder when he talks about music, but laughs neurotically whenever I mention fame or ambition. \"Dom's the one to speak to about ambition,\" he says. \"I think basically the band's career is me trying to please Dom.\"</p> <p>Dom Howard is Muse's unflappable rock pro: the free-and-single, up-all-night one who uses the phrase \"rocking out\" without reservation. \"Even when we were sitting around in Matt's nan's basement writing songs we'd be dreaming of <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/nme-video/muse-at-reading---our-fans-are-the-most-dedicated-in-the-world/1133191383001\" title=\"headlining the main stage at Reading\">headlining the main stage at Reading</a>,\" he says. \"We've always had our sights set on being the biggest band in the world.\" He laughs, because it's an unfashionable thing to say these days, but not that hard, because he means it. \"Still going for it. Why not? If you're going to do it, do it properly.\"</p> <p>Before they wanted to be the biggest band in the world, Muse simply wanted to be bigger than Doctor Frank, a funk covers band from Teignmouth. \"They were the local heroes: the big boys with their posh instruments,\" says Wolstenholme, remembering Muse's first \"battle of the bands\" show in 1994. \"There wasn't much of an original music scene in Devon and when we started we realised why \u2013 because nobody wanted to watch original music. We played gigs to nobody.\"</p> <p>Here are the roots of Muse's unusual tenacity. For a long time they had no supportive scene, no wise mentor, no industry connections. Bellamy, a gifted musician but naturally shy, only reluctantly became singer and chief songwriter because \"nobody wanted to join our band\". They played gigs for five years before releasing <em>Showbiz</em> and even then Bellamy struggled as frontman. \"It wasn't as fun as I thought it would be,\" he says. \"The songs were a bit moody. When you're having to play them every night it can be a bit draining.\"</p> <p>He had an epiphany during Muse's first concert in Japan. Maddened by the audience's lethargy, he thought \"fuck it\" and executed a corny knee slide while shouting \"Come on!\" \"They suddenly went mental,\" he remembers, smiling. \"I thought: if I act stupid and have fun the crowd likes it. That's when we stopped taking it seriously.\"</p> <p>Muse have had many \"fuck it\" moments, becoming more fearlessly flamboyant each time. When I ask bassist Chris Wolstenholme if he's ever thought, in the studio, that a Muse song was too ridiculous he replies, half-jokingly: \"Probably every song we've ever done [is]. You can go on writing traditional pop-rock songs and get stale or try something new. There are risks either way.\" Howard cheerfully says, \"I love the excessiveness of the whole thing. I love Survival for that. You could say the choir's too much but you know what? It makes it. I like pushing it as far as we can.\"</p> <p>It's always an achievement for a band to retain its original line-up on the long and tricky path from youth clubs to stadiums. It's especially remarkable when one band member trod most of that path as an alcoholic. If you had to guess which one you'd choose the neurotic singer or hard-partying drummer over Wolstenholme, an affable family man who has the names of his wife and four of his six children tattooed in various languages on his arms and, until recently, still lived in Teignmouth. He is so untouched by fame that the other dads at school only found out he was in Muse while talking in the pub after playing football and went home to google him to check he wasn't making it up.</p> <p>But there's a genetic precedent: his father, a pub landlord, drank himself to death when he was 40. Wolstenholme combines rock-solid blokiness with the compulsive candour of someone who has undergone rehab. Only his nervous hand-rubbing betrays the weirdness of discussing the worst experience of his life with a stranger.</p> <p>His drinking began in earnest when Muse's career first took off and he was away from his family for as long as two months at a time. As the band grew so did his intake, until he was knocking back a pint of spirits, two bottles of wine and countless beers a day. It seems inconceivable that, for several years, nobody but his wife realised there was a problem. \"I kept my guard up,\" he says. \"I was quite crafty about how I drank and where I did it. Matt and Dom probably didn't realise how bad it was because I wasn't a nasty drunk. I didn't cause anybody any problems. I just retreated.\"</p> <p>\"For some reason he could still play the bass, even though he was shitfaced,\" says Howard. \"It went wrong literally two or three times in 10 years, which is nothing.\" Eventually, however, it became unignorable. \"He was drinking on stage,\" says Howard. \"I started counting how many drinks he was having during the set and I could see him getting more and more glazed. By the point we came off stage he'd be fucked. It just got too weird.\"</p> <p>Did they give him ultimatums? \"Yeah, a few times. Chris now says things like, I can't believe they put up with me for 10 years. Which is true. I can't believe we did. But we did. I've always believed in band integrity and sticking together. There's something about the fact we all grew up together. We've been together for 18 years now, which is over half our lives.\" Asked what difference Wolstenholme's sobriety has made to the band, he says simply: \"It's given us a future.\"</p> <p>During 2008 Wolstenholme developed panic attacks. \"You drink more to cover the anxiety and then the drink triggers more anxiety and you find yourself in this cycle of hell, basically.\" On April Fool's Day 2009, after a particularly bad period, he \"had a bit of a meltdown and that was it. I made a decision\". The hardest part, he says, was confronting all the difficult emotions he had spent so long submerging. \"Everything I should have dealt with in the previous 10 years suddenly hit me in the face. There are some things I regret. There are probably moments I should have enjoyed more than I did and that's a bit upsetting. With the mess I was in you don't feel any intense emotion any more. You're just subdued all the time. But the upside of that is I'm enjoying it now. I threw myself into music in a way I hadn't done for 10 years. It sounds corny but it was the only thing that made me feel peaceful.\"</p> <p>Previously unable to finish a song, Wolstenholme wrote two about his condition, Save Me and Liquid State, for <em>The 2nd Law</em>. Bellamy compositions such as Madness and Big Freeze are also unusually personal. Together, they suggest a quieter, more intimate Muse. Bigger-is-better escalation has got them this far but you wonder how much further they can push it without toppling into absurdity. I put it to Bellamy by quoting a track from <em>The 2nd Law</em>: \"An economy based on endless growth is unsustainable.\"</p> <p>\"It's a funny one,\" he says thoughtfully. \"As you asked that question, I realised for the first time there's a link between that and the political moments I'm talking about. If there's not an energy revolution we'll have to devolve and live a simpler lifestyle. In Muse, in our music and political things, we're striving for that not to be the case but knowing that we have to change. So yeah, I do want to expand on the subtler, quieter side of the band. Maybe go to a farm in Devon, live off the land, get out the acoustics and go full devolution.\" He laughs self-consciously. \"But I have said that before.\"</p> <p>It's an intriguing idea, this downsized Abel &amp; Cole version of rock's most expansionist band, but Bellamy has no time to dwell on it now. He's been summoned back to rehearsals and leaves the room to address the pressing business of touring the world with an upside-down LED pyramid.</p> <p><em>The 2nd Law is released on 1 October on Warners</em></p>",
  "<p>Away from the numbers, away from the domination of digits and dollar signs, away from the cold, hard diktat that compels sportsmen to make career decisions based on immediate financial gain \u2013 endlessly consulting their magic eightball agents, away from the disingenuous and the downright deceitful manoeuvring that precedes new contracts everywhere, sometimes a decision is based on more than lucre. Thus, although \"money\" is the word publicly connecting McLaren to Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton's move between them, it seems only fair to also acknowledge that in this case there may have been an all too human rationale in the driving seat as well.</p> <p>In Formula One, numbers are all. They are both the goal (to finish first) and central to the means by which it is achieved (the quest to go faster), as well as the grease that keeps the whole infernal difference engine furiously spinning (those dollars, those digits, again). In the paddock they are held in a fetishistic reverence that eightball-wielding agents would admire and they are the mechanics with which the personal in the sport is so often subsumed.</p> <p>But it is there nonetheless. Last year, when Hamilton took pole in Korea, it was the first time Red Bull had been knocked off the top spot. Yet he was outwardly unmoved and appeared indifferent at best. After a hard race, driving brilliantly to hold off a charging Mark Webber to take second place, he seemed even grimmer.</p> <p>\"I've had the worst year, if you expect me to be all happy-doolally after a race like that you're not going to hear it,\" he responded to inquires as to why he was not taking more pleasure in a fine drive.</p> <p>A difficult year it had been, the championship was gone and his team-mate, Jenson Button, was beating him on points, but his reaction still appeared out of character. Soon afterwards his split with girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger was revealed and it all seemed to make sense.</p> <p>He was going through a difficult period in public, a man of 26 dealing with emotions that most people endure repeatedly in private, while much younger and with the freedom to really let go, bury themselves, perhaps, in a bottle of cider and a Joy Division album, to emerge all the better, several weeks later.</p> <p>Hamilton, in contrast, grew up in a much more controlled environment. He had an extraordinarily advantageous start to his career that could not have been better in terms of becoming a successful driver but as everyone in the more chaotic, ordinary world knows, there comes a point when it is just time to strike out on your own.</p> <p>McLaren signed him to their young driver programme when he was 13 and he has been part of the team ever since, taking an F1 seat in 2007. In motor racing terms they are his family, with all that the concept entails. They have nurtured and protected him, revelled in his successes and comforted his failures but also had demands on and control of, much of his behaviour and his time.</p> <p>Proving to oneself that you are in control of your destiny is so very much a given rite of passage that it is almost unnoticeable. Hamilton has had to do it in public and in the form of finally making the break with the team that has been his life.</p> <p>John Watson, who drove for McLaren between 1979 and 1983, believes that this need to develop and assert himself away from the team was a central tenet of his decision. \"It's like a kid growing up and leaving home, getting away from the parental control,\" he says. \"When you become a McLaren driver everything about you becomes, in effect, the property of the team. McLaren are a great team to drive for but they've got limitations and I think Lewis felt those limitations were intruding into the time that he wanted to develop, from a non-motor racing perspective.</p> <p>\"Because he came in so young he doesn't know anything differently. Jenson is a more rounded personality and character by virtue of life experiences. Lewis's life experiences are very much contained within the strictures of McLaren.\"</p> <p>Money would have been a factor but Watson believes that far more important is what the Mercedes team principal, Ross Brawn, has told Hamilton to expect from their new car \u2013 certainly the manufacturer will expect to be strong in 2014 when the new engine rules are introduced. But these are the intangibles debated over the previous weeks of will-he won't-he debate. What seems more concrete is that Hamilton wanted to grow and develop and to do so he simply had to move on.</p> <p>\"Principally, I think the kid just wants to be his own person. Whatever he perceives as a burden, he's shed that now,\" is Watson's verdict on the first step of what he sees as a longer journey. \"I would love to see Ross, Lewis and I go fishing,\" he says. \"Show Lewis that there are other qualities or values in life that are very simple. I'd love to see Lewis&#xa0;with a mayfly trying to catch a trout. He's won grands prix, he won a world championship but he'd find it a lot more difficult to catch a trout. It's all about life balance.\"</p> <p>Whether the move delivers for Hamilton, the driver, is yet to be seen but he seems to have made it as much for Hamilton, the person, a man who is looking at the numbers and trying to make them balance.</p>",
  "<p>In some ways, it is just like old times. Huge crowds mob the presidential candidate as he swings through dusty villages and towns promising a new Venezuela. They surround his bus, chanting his name, and when he emerges they scream and surge forward, desperate to embrace him. Many clutch notes \u2013 handwritten pleas for a job, a house, an operation \u2013 and if they manage to slip them into his hands or pockets they near explode with joy. \"He knows things can't go on like this. He knows we're ready for a change,\" Josmir Meza, 25, a student, shouted over cheers.</p> <p>The trouble for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> is that he is no longer that candidate. In 1998, he was an insurgent outsider, a young, athletic campaigner who promised to overthrow the established order and \"refound\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\" title=\"\">Venezuela</a>. He was unstoppable and roared to victory.</p> <p>Fourteen years later, however, as he seeks a third term in next Sunday's election, it his youthful challenger, <a href=\"http://www.newint.org/blog/2012/09/25/venezuela-elections-capriles-chavez/\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a>, 40, who electrifies the crowds.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, 58, in contrast, is an ailing, elusive figure who now represents the establishment. He wishes not to storm the presidential palace, Miraflores, a pink, neocolonial spread in downtown Caracas, but to keep it. Having dominated Venezuela like a colossus, leading his socialist revolution to consecutive electoral landslides, he is facing the electoral fight of his life.</p> <p>With both sides depicting the vote as an existential test to vanquish or save the unique political and economic experiment known as chavismo, the stakes could scarcely be higher. If Ch\u00e1vez loses, his movement will almost certainly fracture, dismaying foreign supporters who hailed the \"<a href=\"http://worldnews.about.com/od/venezuela/f/bolivarianrevolution.htm\" title=\"\">Bolivarian revolution</a>\" as a leftwing showcase. If he wins, critics at home and abroad will warn of a slide into autocracy and dysfunction.</p> <p>Either way, it will be another chapter in the great drama that is the life of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. How a boy from a humble family in Sabaneta, a speck of a town on the vast grasslands known as <em>los llanos</em> rose to become not just president but a global figure simultaneously adored and reviled is a remarkable tale.</p> <p>Like the fireside legends of horsemen, demons and rebels that so enchanted the young Hugo \u2013 he memorised the poems, stories and songs \u2013 his rise is the stuff of myth. He was the second son of schoolteacher parents; if a girl, they planned to call him Eva (Venezuela's version of Eve), complementing the firstborn who was called Adan (Adam), but instead named him after his father. As more children arrived (six, all boys), the two eldest were sent to live with their grandmother, Rosa, a kind, industrious woman who doted on the boys.</p> <p>Hugo was by all accounts a happy, chatty boy who when not at school played baseball with a homemade bat and ball, painted, read books and supplemented household income selling his grandmother's \"spiders\", sugar-coated papaya strips. \"I would go round shouting, 'Hot spiders, tasty spiders for pretty girls!'\" he recalled recently. As a skinny teenager with big feet he was nicknamed Goofy.</p> <p>By the 1960s, Venezuela, once a sleepy corner of South America ruled by dictators, was a fledgling democracy with growing oil revenues and hunger for modernity. A new elite and middle class grew amid the skyscrapers but most rural migrants ended up in hillside shacks around cities.</p> <p>Hugo, a talented baseball player, dreamed not of politics but pitching for the major leagues. He became a military cadet hoping to vault from the academy to baseball clubs in Caracas. Instead, he fell in love with soldiering. \"A uniform, a gun, an area, close-order formation, marches, morning runs, studies in military science \u2013 I was like a fish in water,\" he recalled later.</p> <p>As Ch\u00e1vez moved up the ranks, he studied the writings of <a href=\"http://www.embavenez-us.org/kids.venezuela/simon.bolivar.htm\" title=\"\">Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar</a>, the 19th-century liberator who ousted the Spanish, as well as philosophers such as Nietzsche and Plekhanov. He also noted extreme poverty and inequality amid the oil boom. Inspired by revolutionary military leaders in Panama and Peru, and leftwing Venezuelan intellectuals, an idea began to form: revolt.</p> <p>Over a decade, he gathered fellow officers into a conspiracy to replace what they saw as a venal, sham democracy with a progressive, real democracy. The February 1992 coup was a military fiasco, letting the unpopular government survive, but Ch\u00e1vez turned his televised surrender address into a political triumph. Eloquent and dashing in his red beret, he introduced himself to a startled nation \u2013 \"listen to comandante Ch\u00e1vez\" \u2013 and said his objectives had not been met \"por ahora\", for now. He deserved 30 years in jail, went the joke: one for the coup, 29 for failing.</p> <p>Pardoned and released after two years, he was adopted as a figurehead by a coalition of grassroots movements and leftwing parties and stormed to victory in the 1998 election, cheered not only by the poor but a middle class fed up with ossified political parties. With a barrel of oil just $8, the petro-state was near broke.</p> <p>Few outside Venezuela, until then best known for beauty queens and oil, knew what to make of this mercurial arrival who praised Fidel Castro but said he was neither left nor right but seeker of a Blairesqe \"third way\". Within a few short years, Ch\u00e1vez became one of the world's most recognisable and polarising figures.</p> <p>Vehement rhetoric \u2013 he railed against the wealthy as \"squealing pigs\" and \"vampires\" who looted oil wealth \u2013 endeared him to the poor and alienated the middle class and traditional elites. They called him a monkey and worse. In April 2002, the elites briefly ousted him in a Bush administration-backed coup, tried again with an oil strike, then a recall referendum. Ch\u00e1vez survived and grew more radical, declaring himself a socialist and nationalising swaths of the economy. Soaring oil prices gushed billions into the treasury, which he used to fund Cuban-run health clinics and other social programmes, easing poverty. He created a state media empire that promoted a personality cult and tightened executive control over the armed forces, the judiciary and the legislature.</p> <p>He called George Bush a \"donkey\", \"Mr Danger\", \"an asshole\" and, during a memorable UN speech, \"the devil\". Supporters such as Ken Livingstone, Sean Penn, Danny Glover and Noam Chomsky paid homage in visits to Caracas. After winning a second term in 2006, Ch\u00e1vez won a referendum abolishing term limits and talked of ruling until 2021, then 2030. That looks fanciful now. Ahead in some polls, he trails in others.</p> <p>He remains revered in the barrios. \"He is a gift, he means everything to us,\" said Aleira Quintero, 55, a red T-shirted canvasser in Petare. But even supporters are fed up with horrific crime rates, inflation, shortages and crumbling infrastructure. Bridges collapse, refineries blow up, blackouts shroud cities.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez has proved a shrewd political strategist and inspired communicator but disastrous manager, warping the economy with contradictory controls, creating and dissolving ministries by caprice, launching and abandoning initiatives, neglecting investment and maintenance. Despite record oil revenues, Venezuela is borrowing billions to try to plug the holes.</p> <p>Charisma, giveaways and institutional control, not least the ability to monopolise the airwaves, could yet clinch re-election but Chavez faces two formidable obstacles.</p> <p>Drained and bloated by cancer treatment, he sometimes has trouble walking. Instead of the barnstorming of old, his public appearances are few and often melancholic. \"If it were up to me, you know I'd get down off this stage and I'd go walking, as in times past,\" he told a rally, tears in his eyes. Some supporters fear the cancer is terminal and that a vote for Ch\u00e1vez is a vote for uncertainty and power-grabs by unloved ministers and courtiers.</p> <p>The other obstacle is Capriles. Unlike previous inept, shrill opposition leaders, the state governor is a disciplined, energetic campaigner. A jogger and basketball player, his nickname is El Flaquito, the skinny one. He has seized the initiative by crisscrossing the country, visiting 274 towns, and casting himself as a centrist who will keep Ch\u00e1vez's social programmes while offering competent administration. To woo \"soft chavistas\" he does not call Ch\u00e1vez a dictator or even Ch\u00e1vez. Conscious of the name's power, Capriles calls him \"the candidate of the (ruling party) PSUV\".</p> <p>Whether the president wins or not \u2013 and given his electoral track record you would be foolish or brave to bet against him \u2013 his fame will live on. In or out of power, there will be no forgetting the name Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p>",
  "<p>A century ago this year, Robert Falcon Scott and his group of fellow explorers reached the south pole. Although ending in tragedy their story inspired generations, setting in motion 100 years of polar exploration and a century of scientific research.</p> <p>I am an ornithologist and for me the most memorable story from Scott's expedition is that of Edward Wilson's mid-winter trek to the emperor penguin breeding colony at Cape Crozier. This scientific foray was later dubbed the \"worst journey in the world\".</p> <p>Scott wrote of it as \"One of the most gallant stories in polar history. That men should wander forth in the depth of a polar night to face the most dismal cold and the fiercest gales in darkness is something new; that they should have persisted in this effort in spite of every adversity for five full weeks is heroic. It makes a tale for our generation which I hope may not be lost in the telling.\"</p> <p>In the footsteps of these pioneers, British scientists continue to work on the southern continent today, venturing into the most hostile conditions on Earth, in search of knowledge. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) collects data on, among other things, climate change, ice dynamics, ecosystems and fisheries \u2013 both in the Antarctic and the Arctic \u2013 and over the decades has made a series of world-changing discoveries. For example, BAS scientist Joe Farman's research in Antarctica first alerted the world to the threat of ozone depletion, and in so doing helped avert an ecological catastrophe.</p> <p>Next month a 12-strong BAS team will use a custom-built hot-water drill to penetrate a three-kilometre layer of ice to reach the waters of the subglacial Lake Ellsworth on the west Antarctic ice sheet. Taking 16 years to plan, this investigation will open new research into the Earth's past climate and could reveal new life forms.</p> <p>Times have certainly changed since Scott's famous Terra Nova expedition, but there is a new epic tale that I also hope will not be lost in the telling. It is one of ministers looking for spending cuts, cuts that could soon lead to the world's most respected polar research organisation being closed down.</p> <p>Considering the importance of polar research in understanding global change, it is alarming that the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), a research funding body reporting to Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, has published proposals to close the BAS headquarters in Cambridge, doing away with its name, and thereby making it politically easier to make deep cuts in Antarctic bases, ships and aircraft later on.</p> <p>The extent of the seismic shifts about to take place are underlined by the recent departure of senior staff. The director, deputy director and a board member have all left BAS over the past six months, and disillusioned with current events, senior scientists are contemplating moving to other institutions. BAS is vulnerable and the Whitehall axe could soon strike with devastating effects.</p> <p>Having been burned last year by the public outrage over proposals to sell England's forests and close the Forestry Commission, the proposals that would do away with BAS have been carefully crafted. At one level they look quite reasonable, for example in suggesting a merger between BAS and the National Oceanography Centre based in Southampton and Liverpool.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/consult/bas-noc-merger-consultation.pdf\" title=\"NERC BAS/NOC merger consultation document\">NERC argues this would help achieve synergies between polar and ocean research and save money in the process</a>. The idea would be to create a new institution to be called the NERC Centre for Marine and Polar Science, doing away with the 50 year-old British Antarctic Survey name.</p> <p>NERC and ministers are making reassuring noises as to their commitment to polar research, and to retaining a strong British presence in Antarctica, but senior figures at BAS fear the loss of the name and shift of headquarters is the first step toward bigger changes that will endanger the British capability to continue with properly supported scientific research on the southern continent.</p> <p>In the wake of shocking changes taking place in the Arctic, <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews\" title=\"National Snow and Ice Data Center\">including record sea ice melting</a>, it is surely wise to retain Arctic and Antarctic research as an unambiguous national priority. The polar regions may be far away, but they have the potential to directly affect us in the UK. A study published earlier this year suggested that the cold winters we have seen recently in the UK and elsewhere may be <a href=\"http://e360.yale.edu/feature/linking_weird_weather_to_rapid_warming_of_the_arctic/2501/\" title=\"Linking weird weather to rapid warming of the Arctic\">directly linked to the melting of Arctic sea ice</a>.</p> <p>More worrying is the west Antarctic ice sheet, which is suspected to be dangerously unstable and which could lead to more than three meters of sea level rise (at an unknown rate) if it collapsed</p> <p>It is sobering to note that the Thames barrier is built to cope with just a 16cm rise in sea level over the next 20 years. The research at Lake Ellsworth will help us assess the risk, and given the stakes retaining a world-respected, world-renowned and high-profile organization is surely a huge asset.</p> <p>Ministers and NERC need to stand back, take the longer view and do what is obviously the right thing: keep the British Antarctic Survey intact, keep it properly funded, and keep it in Cambridge.</p> <p><em>Tony Juniper is an environmental campaigner</em></p>",
  "<p>A row has broken out over the fate of one of the country's most distinguished scientific organisations, the <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">British Antarctic Survey</a>. The 60-year-old outfit, whose achievements have included the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer, is to be merged with the <a href=\"http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">National Oceanography Centre</a> in Southampton as part of a cost-saving exercise.</p> <p>But the downgrade threat has outraged scientists and politicians who say it will seriously weaken Britain's scientific reputation and its ability to carry out climate research. \"This is utterly foolish,\" said Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, chairman of the polar regions cross-party parliamentary group. \"This will destabilise the work of polar scientists at a time when important climatic changes at the poles need to be investigated. My group will be calling on the government to stop this merger. This is an attempt to trash an important scientific organisation.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Shanklin, one of the scientists who discovered the gap in the ozone layer in 1985, said: \"The British Antarctic Survey is almost synonymous with the Antarctic ozone hole. Losing it would create a comparable hole in British science.\"</p> <p>The merger \u2013 which would create a Centre for Ocean and Polar Science based in Southampton \u2013 has been proposed to satisfy government demands for major cuts to be made in the budget of the <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Natural Environment Research Council</a> (NERC), which funds the BAS. Science minister David Willetts wants a 10% cut in NERC expenditure and a 45% reduction in its capital spending by 2015. Polar research, which is costly, has been chosen to take a major hit.</p> <p>But the prospect of reducing polar research when Arctic sea ice coverage has dropped to its lowest summer level and parts of Antarctica are also showing signs of dangerous melting has been greeted with dismay. \"BAS is a terrific world-leading organisation, tightly operated, and staffed by first-rate scientists,\" said a UK climate scientist. \"Sadly, it does not seem to be highly regarded by its parent body, NERC.\"</p> <p>The organisation's director, Nick Owens, and its deputy director, Robert Culshaw, have left the survey since the merger was announced, so consultations are being run by the staff of the National Oceanography Centre.</p> <p>\"The fact that the survey's director and deputy director have left and that consultations are being run from Southampton, where the survey will be moved, has sent morale plummeting among BAS staff,\" said another BAS scientist. Ed Hill, the Antarctic survey's interim director, said the merger would not lead to the closure of the BAS's Cambridge building.</p> <p>\"Both marine and polar science need similar operational support, for example for sea vessels, and it makes sense to combine these,\" he added. \"However, I cannot say there will be no reduction in numbers of BAS scientists \u2013 though any cuts that are made will follow from overall cuts to our budgets and will not be caused by the merger.\"</p> <p>Most scientists remain scathing about the proposal, however. \"This plan reveals the current government's apparent disregard for the broad benefits of an increased understanding of the Earth,\" said Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. \"If the government wants to ensure the future prosperity and wellbeing of the UK, it needs to invest more, not less, in our world-class scientific organisations like the British Antarctic Survey.\"</p> <p>The environment campaigner Tony Juniper added: \"Ministers and NERC need to take the longer view and do the right thing: keep the British Antarctic Survey intact, keep it properly funded, and keep it in Cambridge, in the world-leading research cluster in which it is embedded.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the early 1980s British meteorologist Joe Farman, based at the British Antarctic Survey, was studying measurements of ozone levels in the stratosphere. The gas, which protects Earth from deadly solar ultraviolet radiation, had been surveyed by instruments at the BAS's Halley base in the Antarctic since 1957 to improve our understanding of polar meteorology.</p> <p>But Farman and his colleagues, Brian Gardiner and Jonathan Shanklin, stumbled on something far more important than data about weather fronts. Their measurements revealed that Earth's ozone layer had decreased by 40% between 1975 and 1984. An ozone hole was opening up over the southern hemisphere, threatening to allow ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth and trigger epidemics of skin cancers.</p> <p>The discovery caused consternation and eventually led to the signing of the Montreal protocol, which limited the manufacture of CFC gases that are used in refrigerators and other devices and which had been shown to be the cause of the ozone hole. That hole still looms over the Antarctic but is expected to recover thanks to the Montreal agreement \u2013 though not until 2080.</p> <p>The story is important for many reasons, but is particularly relevant today because it shows how crucial research carried out at the poles is, and how important the BAS has been in these endeavours. It also explains the range and volume of the horrified responses that have greeted the plan now being prepared to curtail the BAS's independence, a consequence of its merger with the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton.</p> <p>As Andrew Rosindell, chairman of the polar regions all-party parliamentary group, has put it: \"This will destabilise the work of UK polar scientists at a time when important climatic changes are occurring at the poles and need investigation. This is an attempt to trash an extremely important scientific organisation.\"</p> <p>Many other researchers, politicians and climate activists have made it clear that they also oppose the merger \u2013 a move implemented by the BAS's paymasters, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), because it, in turn, is being cut back by the coalition government as part of its plan to reduce investment in science. And here the story of the discovery of the ozone hole provides an extra twist to proceedings.</p> <p>In the early 1980s UK science was being squeezed by Margaret Thatcher's government and long-term monitoring programmes were considered to be particularly vulnerable, including the ozone project at Halley. As Shanklin has said: \"Our monitoring was in the frame. Nothing seemed to be changing and there seemed little reason to keep it going.\"</p> <p>The axe was about to fall when the three scientists published news of their discovery of the ozone hole in <em>Nature</em> in 1985. Overnight their work changed from being a drain on resources to being a world leader and a triumph for British science. The project, and the planet, were saved.</p> <p>Sadly, we seem to have learned little in the intervening decades. The coalition government of David Cameron \u2013 which pledged to lead \"the greenest government ever\" \u2013 has demanded a massive reduction in environmental research as part of an overall plan to reduce annual public investment in science by 14%. As Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change points out: \"Basic research, which is driven by the quest for new knowledge rather than an immediately identifiable application, is again under threat as part of the coalition government's programme to reduce its investment in science.\"</p> <p>The crucial word, of course, is threat. No one has yet closed down any BAS projects. But the risk is real; both the director and deputy director have already left their posts since the merger plan was announced and signs indicate a serious loss of morale. Senior scientists are unlikely to hang about at an institution that appears to be so ill-regarded by its controllers at the NERC and by the government. In such a situation, the next generation of Farmans, Gardiners and Shanklins \u2013 researchers who could pinpoint future risks to the planet \u2013 will not be on hand to do work that could have crucial environmental importance.</p> <p>And this is a key point. The impact of global warming is being felt first at the poles. This year summer sea-ice levels in the Arctic plunged to a record low and there is every sign that equally profound changes are taking place in the Antarctic, though it is a far more complex terrain to comprehend than its northern counterpart. Yet the government is inflicting cuts that will prevent Britain playing a proper role in such investigations, say critics who point out that, more than any other country, the UK has helped open up the Antarctic to scientific study. James Cook was the first person to cross the Antarctic Circle; James Clark Ross was the first to reach the continent's great ice shelves; Scott and Shackleton's expeditions in the early 20th century were triumphs of scientific endeavour, even though Scott was beaten to the south pole by Roald Amundsen in 1912; and the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1955-58, led by the British explorer Vivian Fuchs, was the first to cross the continent overland.</p> <p>It is an impressive legacy. Just how long Britain can continue to add to it with new research remains to be seen. Certainly the prospects of us continuing to do world-leading science there are looking a bit stressed at present.</p>",
  "<p>Call it the \"close your eyes test\". The challenge faces every leader of the opposition. Whether or not they pass is invariably crucial to their eventual success or failure. Can voters close their eyes and imagine this person standing on the threshold of Number 10 telling the country that Her Majesty has just invited them to form a government? So when Toby Helm, our political editor, and I went to interview Ed Miliband for today's <em>Observer</em>, I asked the Labour leader whether he thought people saw him as a future prime minister. After a pause, he replied: \"Well, that's for them to decide\", a response that did not ooze confidence.</p> <p>His aides protest that it is always hard to look prime ministerial until you are actually prime minister and some of his personal ratings are at least heading in the right direction as voters and commentators, some of whom originally and foolishly wrote him off as a Labour version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/iain-duncan-smith\" title=\"\">Iain Duncan Smith</a>, reassess his qualities. Though still negative, his net approval rating on the <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/\" title=\"\">YouGov</a> tracker has improved 31 points since mid-January while David Cameron has slumped by 25. \"The more people get to see of Ed, the more they like him,\" says one of his senior staff, though it could be that the converse is the more important dynamic: the more people see of David Cameron, the less they like him.</p> <p>People may be warming to the Labour leader, but when asked whether he looks prime ministerial, the answer from our opinion poll today is a big, rude raspberry. On several of the key qualities that voters look for in a leader, he is rated very poorly. Only 28% of respondents can imagine him as prime minister; 63% cannot. That is a bad fail of the \"close your eyes test\".</p> <p>This encourages Tories to believe that, for all the difficulties of the coalition and despite the severe decline in their man's personal ratings, they can win the next election by making it as presidential as possible. Their plan is to try to brand the Labour leader as too weird and too left wing to put inside Number 10. In some ways, as he remarks in our interview, this is rather flattering. Tory propagandists would not be personally targeting him if they did not take the idea of Prime Minister Miliband seriously. You also have to wonder what leaking their scheme says about their judgment. If you plan a surprise attack it is usually thought best to, well, keep it a surprise. Personal campaigns against opponents have a record of backfiring because voters decide it says more about the nastiness of those doing the attacking than it does about the object of the attack. Mr Miliband might also take some encouragement from the fact that previous Tory efforts to define him negatively have not been terribly effective. The \"Red Ed\" tag that they tried to stick to him when he first became leader never really caught on.</p> <p>That said, important members of the shadow cabinet think he would be unwise to be complacent. Mr Miliband is just about old enough to remember how the Tories, in co-ordination with the right-wing tabloids, turned the public images of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/book-review--how-worzel-came-to-save-the-labour-party-michael-foot--mervyn-jones-victor-gollancz-20-pounds-1369303.html\" title=\"\">Michael Foot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=171485&amp;sectioncode=5\" title=\"\">Neil Kinnock </a>into Worzel Gummidge and the Welsh Windbag. Tabloid power has been diluted by the growth of new media, but ferocious press attacks can still have a destabilising, demoralising and debilitating effect.</p> <p>The Labour leader is additionally vulnerable because to much of the electorate he is still largely a blank canvas. Some voters may be aware that he is the son of Jewish refugees from the Nazis, a story he has often told. There was that bit of confusion about whether or not he was going to get married and, for many voters, that and beating his brother is probably the sum total of their knowledge about the man who would be their next prime minister. How to convey his personality to the public has been intensely preoccupying his circle in the run-up to his conference speech. There are certain things he can do nothing about. As he has said himself, if you asked spin doctors to design the perfect leadership candidate, they would not come up with Ed Miliband. Image-makers would probably describe something like Mitt Romney, which goes to show that having presidential teeth and hair is not the same as being presidential.</p> <p>The Labour leader cannot help coming over as agreeable, idealistic, a bit pointy headed and rather earnest, because that is what he is. Much of his summer holiday on a Greek island was spent reading books of social and economic theory. He has invited an American political philosopher, <a href=\"http://www.gov.harvard.edu/people/faculty/michael-sandel\" title=\"\">Michael Sandel</a>, to address the conference. He will never be convincing as the blokey candidate with whom you'd most like to share a pint. He is a career-long member of the professional political class. He read PPE at Oxford, worked with me on a politics programme on Channel 4, landed a job as a special adviser, took a sabbatical at Harvard when working with Gordon Brown and Ed Balls became just too much, returned to Britain to be guided into a safe seat and not long after was in the cabinet.</p> <p>True enough, the state educated him, in Leeds and then at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/02/haverstock-school-labour-leaders-eton\" title=\"\">Haverstock comprehensive</a> in north London, a contrast with David Cameron that I expect to be highlighted in his speech. But in its way his childhood was as rarefied as that of the Tory leader. Not many people grow up in a household in which the most famous intellectuals of the left gather around the kitchen table. He cannot claim to be another Abe Lincoln, rising to greatness from log cabin poverty. In a nice irony, thanks to the London property boom, the Miliband brothers inherited a tidy windfall from their Marxist father.</p> <p>The sort of stunts performed by previous leaders of the opposition \u2013 Tony Blair doing headers with Kevin Keegan, David Cameron riding with huskies in the Arctic Circle \u2013 won't work for him. We are now familiar enough with such manipulations to have become suspicious of them and anyway there would be a high risk of him looking like a prat. So his best bet is to attempt to flip the flaws in his image into an advantage. The earnestness and wonkishness at least suggest an authenticity that might be contrasted with the sort of slickeries practised by David Cameron en route to power.</p> <p>And there are things that he can do something about. One is to make speeches in plainer English. His interest in ideas is an attractive quality, but when he rises to speak on Tuesday it will be essential that he does not talk as though he were addressing a thinktank. Concepts such as \"predistribution\" are stimulating, even potentially popular if turned into practical policies. This year's speech, like last year's, will focus heavily on \"responsible capitalism\", but it will only win him a hearing among mainstream voters if it is expressed in clear, engaging and populist language. Mrs Thatcher read Hayek, but she did not often quote him when she was trying to get votes. She instead told audiences that she would sell them their council houses.</p> <p>What should most worry Mr Miliband is how few voters think he is capable of making a tough decision. I am sure he would protest that this is not fair. Did he not stand against his own brother for the leadership? Did he not show cojones when he led the condemnation of Rupert Murdoch? And now, in our interview, he issues a drastic ultimatum to the banks. The public is not convinced. Just 14% of the respondents to our poll rate him \"able to take tough decisions\". That could be in part because they sense that he picks relatively easy targets. No one in the Labour party is going to be upset when their leader attacks News Corp or the City. One way to go about persuading the electorate that he is steely enough for the job would be to pick some battles with his party, but he has rejected that Blair model of how to define your leadership. We have yet to see in him a capacity to challenge labour's ideological comfort zones or to take an unpopular position because he believed it to be right.</p> <p>This weakness matters greatly because it is closely enmeshed with whether voters will be prepared to trust the nation's finances to Labour. Mr Miliband can say that he recognises that a Labour government would have to operate under tight fiscal restraints. To convince the voters that he means it, they really have to believe that, when Prime Minister Miliband is confronted by unexpected crises, protesting crowds, demanding trade unions or stroppy colleagues, his first instinct will not be to deal with problems by throwing at them money that the country does not have.</p> <p>He has passed some of the early tests of being leader of the opposition and done so more effectively than critics and even some friends expected when he first became Labour leader. Now comes the challenge of persuading the country that he could be its next leader. By the end of his speech, he needs more people to be able to close their eyes and think of Prime Minister Miliband. It would help if they quite liked the idea too.</p>",
  "<p>The Manchester City machine is cranking inexorably into life. This was another performance delivered in fits and starts, with only flashes of the dazzle of which they are clearly capable, but the huff and puff was still rewarded late on.</p> <p>A stodgy recent run of results has been checked and momentum has been injected into the champions' campaign. Roberto Mancini's bold pre-match insistence that his team \"will win the title\" for&#xa0;a second year in succession feels more plausible.</p> <p>The manager's urgency to arrest the longest winless sequence of his tenure \u2013 albeit one that stretched to only four matches \u2013 was obvious, as attacking players were drip-fed into the contest's latter stages in a bid to secure the victory. A draw at Fulham, an impressive collective with bite on the break, might normally constitute an acceptable result, but City needed a fillip with Chelsea having already won and Borussia Dortmund due at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday in the Champions League.</p> <p>By the end they had six forward-thinking players pouring towards the hosts. But Fulham might still have held out had panic not set in as full-time approached. City would not be denied. The winner was slammed into the roof of the net by Edin Dzeko with virtually his first touch of the game, Ga\u00ebl Clichy's cross having been flicked on by another substitute, Mario Balotelli, before John Arne Riise's headed clearance squirmed off Brede Hangeland and into the Bosnian's path.</p> <p>Dzeko has started this season with the same flurry of goals as last time around. He will hope to sustain his form more consistently from now on in, though competition for places in this frontline is ferocious.</p> <p>Sergio Ag\u00fcero's equaliser, just before the interval, had been his first reward since winning City their Premier League title in the death throes of last season, yet the Argentinian feels like a first-choice amid this company.</p> <p>The quartet of forwards, with Carlos Tevez thrown in, will always benefit if&#xa0;their team-mates retain possession as they did here, with hints aplenty that David Silva is stirring as if roused by Yaya Tour\u00e9's thunderous presence at&#xa0;his side. Mancini pointed to the performance, rather than the result, as key. \"It's&#xa0;important not only because we won, but because we played very well,\" he said. \"And we did play really well.\"</p> <p>That was said with obvious satisfaction and yet City are only warming up. They were off the pace for the opening 20 minutes and behind. Indeed, it was as if their predicament only dawned upon them 10 minutes before the interval. Thereafter, they pressed until Fulham were cracked open.</p> <p>Martin Jol acknowledged Fulham's retreat, all the early urgency that had yielded Mladen Petric's penalty fizzling out. They had merited that lead, even if the penalty award felt soft: Pablo Zabaleta did appear to tug down on&#xa0;Riise, possibly just outside the area, though what was&#xa0;more baffling was referee Mark Halsey's reluctance to acknowledge a similar offence at the other end of the pitch, when Riise pulled down on Tevez.</p> <p>Regardless, Petric converted the spot-kick with confidence and had Bryan Ruiz subsequently beaten Joe Hart, the complexion of the match might have changed. Instead, City were shrugged awake and Fulham could not cope.</p> <p>\"It wasn't our intention to sit back, but they were too good for us,\" said Jol. \"After that first half an hour, all we did was defend. They were stronger than us and more eager to score. We could only defend, defend, defend, which is probably not enough against them.\"</p> <p>The Fulham manager will hope to add at least one midfield reinforcement next week, with interest retained in the free agents Nigel Reo-Coker and Micka\u00ebl Tavares. His team feels like a work in progress and this result should not demoralise them.</p> <p>Yet, for City, it can serve to inspire. A team in search of its rhythm will be encouraged that a deficit could be overturned. They had threatened to level, with Mark Schwarzer clutching a loose ball on his goalline and palming Silva's effort away, before Tevez was permitted time to spit a shot diagonally across the penalty area and Silva sprinted between opponents to touch the ball cleverly goalwards. Schwarzer did wonderfully well to push away that effort at full stretch, but Ag\u00fcero reacted quicker than Sascha Riether at the far post to convert the rebound into an empty net.</p> <p>\"The guys continued to play their football and always stayed calm,\" said Mancini. \"But we wouldn't have deserved just to draw.\"</p> <p>Dzeko's intervention ensured they had reason instead to celebrate.</p>",
  "<p>The Obama administration has wound up its controversial investigation of a government polar bear researcher without finding any evidence of scientific wrongdoing, campaign groups said late Friday.</p> <p>However, the scientist, Charles Monnett, who was the first to draw attention to the dangers to polar bears in a warming Arctic, was reprimanded for forwarding official email to a local government official and a fellow researcher at the University of Alaska without prior authorisation.</p> <p>Campaign groups described the findings as a victory for Monnett, who until last year oversaw much of the government's scientific work in the Arctic. It was also an embarrassment for the Obama administration, whose two-and-a-half-year investigation uncovered no evidence of major wrongdoing.</p> <p>\"This has been a vindication of Dr Monnett in that they found no scientific misconduct or anything related to his scientific work that merited any sort of discipline or personnel action,\" said Jeff Ruch, director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which had led the defence of Monnett.</p> <p>But he said the official reprimand, though minor in terms of disciplinary action, was sobering. \"It reads as if it was motivated by attempts during the Obama years to clog leaks and root out environmental dissidents inside the department of interior having to do with Arctic drilling.\"</p> <p>Until mid-2011, Monnett oversaw much of the research on Arctic wildlife, managing $50m in scientific projects, for the government agency overseeing oil drilling in Alaska, the bureau of ocean energy management, or BOEM.</p> <p>Peer said Monnett was told informally on Thursday he could return to his scientific role.</p> <p>The reprimand will be expunged from his record in two years or less, <a href=\"http://www.peer.org/docs/noaa/10_1_12_Monnett_reprimand.pdf\">the interior department said in a letter to Monnett</a>.</p> <p>The wildlife biologist was suspended for six weeks last year and subsequently sidelined as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/28/arctic-scientist-polar-bear-oil\">interior department's inspector general investigated charges of scientific misconduct</a> and mismanagement of government contracts.</p> <p>The investigation was launched in March 2010 just as Obama announced he would open up the Arctic to offshore drilling and expand oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The investigators began their inquiries by examining allegations that Monnett and another scientist had used false data in an article on drowned polar bears.</p> <p>The scientists wrote the article after a research flight in 2004 during which they observed four drowned polar bears. In the article for Polar Biology, Monnett concluded the bears, though usually strong swimmers, had become exhausted during the long distances between patches of solid sea ice.</p> <p>The research note was the first time scientists had drawn a link between melting Arctic sea ice and a threat to the bears' survival, and was immediately taken up by Al Gore and other environmental campaigners. In 2008 the polar bear was listed as an endangered species because of climate change and melting sea ice.</p> <p>The inspector general's report found flaws in the work, but no major issues of scientific integrity.</p> <p>The investigation then examined whether Monnett had improperly awarded research contracts.</p> <p>In the end, the department decided to take action only on Monnett's unauthorised release of government documents on five separate occasions in 2007 and 2008. \"I consider your misconduct very serious, \" the deputy director of BOEM, Walter Cruikshank, wrote in the letter to Monnett.</p> <p>Some of the material disclosed by Monnett was later used in court to force the interior department to revoke its approval of Shell's drilling plan, the letter said.</p> <p>Arctic researchers and environmental campaigns saw the investigation of Monnett as an attempt to discredit or sideline government scientists \u2013 and so clear the way for Shell and other oil companies seeking approval to begin drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.</p> <p>Shell began drilling its first offshore well in the Chukchi this month but was forced to pull out because of a series of problems in its oil containment system.</p> <p>\"It was a witch hunt. They were looking for anything they could find on Chuck (Monnett) to try to get rid of him or at least try to discredit him,\" said Richard Steiner, who was the receipient of four of the five unauthorised email releases.</p> <p>Rebecca Noblin, who heads the Arctic programme for the Centre for Biological Diversity agreed. \"After years of dredging through Dr Monnett's files looking for damning evidence against the scientist, all the inspector general could come up with is that Dr Monnett disclosed documents that should have been public in the first place,\" she said in an email. \"If there were more people like Dr Monnett in BOEM, maybe we'd see more drilling decisions based on science rather than politics.\"</p>",
  "<p>The killing of the US ambassador to Libya is rapidly becoming election fodder, as Republicans seize on confusion over the circumstances of Chris Stevens' death in Benghazi three weeks ago and accuse the Obama administration of covering up an al-Qaeda connection.</p> <p>US officials reiterated on on Friday that they regard the killing of Stevens and three other Americans working for the state department at the US consulate in Benghazi as an assault by terrorists who planned the attack. But a dearth of real information about the exact circumstances of the assault has left open the question of whether such planning was merely the work of a few hours, to take advantage of a spontaneous anti-US protest over a short internet video that prompted demonstrations across the Middle East by offended Muslims, or weeks and months, to mark the 11th anniversary of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks on the US. </p> <p>Disagreement over that question is dividing along political lines. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Republican senators wrote to the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, demanding that she explain her statement, five days after the killings, that they were part of a spontaneous anti-US protest. Four senators signed the letter, including John McCain, which said Rice made \"several troubling statements that are inconsistent with the facts and require explanation\". </p> <p>The former New York mayor Rudolf Giuliani, who sought the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2008, went further, accusing the White House of a cover-up.</p> <p>Speaking to Fox News, Giuliani said: \"This is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the most transparent in history. And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four Americans.\" </p> <p>Rice's explanation of a spontaneous assault by a well-armed Libyan militia was maintained by the administration until 10 days ago when Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Centre, called the killings a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, and the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, this week shifted away from the initial line. Clinton on Wednesday hinted that the al-Qaeda offshoot in North Africa may be tied up with the Benghazi assault.</p> <p>\"Now with a larger safe haven and increased freedom to manoeuvre, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their networks in multiple directions,\" Clinton told a meeting of international leaders at the UN which discussed the crisis in North Africa, including the seizure of northern Mali by armed Islamist forces. \"And they are working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions under way in North Africa, as we tragically saw in Benghazi.\"</p> <p>Administration officials were careful to say afterwards that Clinton was not claiming firm evidence of a link. Olsen was similarly cautious in speaking to senators this week.</p> <p>\"The picture that is emerging is one where a number of different individuals were involved, so it's not necessarily an either/or proposition,\" he said. </p> <p>Officials say that while there is some evidence that individual members of the local militia responsible for the attack, Ansar al-Shariah, may have been in touch with extremist elements in other countries, no hard information has so far emerged of a direct foreign or al-Qaeda link to the attack in Benghazi. </p> <p>The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Martin Dempsey, on Thursday said there \"was a thread of intelligence reporting that groups in the environment in eastern Libya were seeking to coalesce but there wasn't anything specific\". He added that there was no intelligence indicating a looming attack. </p> <p>Officials say US intelligence picked up a call by a member of al-Qaeda in North Africa celebrating the attack, but that is not hard evidence of a link. </p> <p>Panetta said on Thursday that there was some preplanning involved in the assault.</p> <p>\"As we determined the details of what took place [in Benghazi], and how that attack took place it became clear that there were terrorists who had planned that attack,\" he said.</p> <p>But whether that was over the proceeding hours, when the militia realised it could take advantage of the existing protest outside the consulate, or over the previous days and weeks remains a question investigators are struggling to answer. At present, the Americans are unable even to establish how large the protest was and how long it went on.</p> <p>Administration officials continue to maintain that if there was preplanning, it was not long term. But some Republicans argue that there is already evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, of a plot. For a start, they say it is no coincidence that the assault on the Benghazi consulate was on 11 September. </p> <p>The discovery in the wrecked consulate, by CNN, of Stevens' diary has also fed claims that the White House is underplaying a broader terrorist connection. Stevens wrote that he feared he was an al-Qaeda hit list and was alarmed by his lack of security after earlier attacks on US and British targets in Benghazi and amid what he described as a growing al-Qaeda presence in Libya. </p> <p>The state department's furious reaction to CNN's reporting of Stevens' fears \u2013 calling the use of non-personal information from the diary without the family's approval \"disgusting\" \u2013 suggested alarm in the administration at the potential damage to its denials of a conspiracy and that it will be open to criticism that it did not provide sufficient protection to the Benghazi consulate.</p> <p>There are also questions about the circumstances of Stevens death and whether Libyan militias knew he was at the consulate. However, given the large footprint American diplomats make as they move around the Middle East, it would not have been difficult to discern that an important US official had arrived in Benghazi. </p> <p>Giuliani said the White House was reluctant to admit al-Qaeda involvement because it wants to dismiss that threat following last year's killing of Osama Bin Laden.</p> <p>\"I think it's because they have this narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\" he said. \"They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia \u2013 he was going to declare this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very convenient narrative.\"</p> <p>Libya's president, Mohamed Magariaf, has also made the link by blaming \"al-Qaeda elements\" hiding in his country for the death of Stevens and three other Americans working for the state department.</p> <p>\"It was a preplanned act of terrorism directed against American citizens,\" Magariaf said this week.</p> <p>But claims of an al-Qaeda connection has been met with scepticism by others in Libya who say it is feasible for well armed militiamen to have taken advantage of the protests outside the US consulate to launch a substantial attack. </p> <p>The likelihood of a definitive explanation any time soon looks dim. </p> <p>The Obama administration has said an FBI investigation will establish the facts. But the New York Times on Friday reported that the FBI team remains in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, over 400 miles away, because of fears for its safety. </p> <p>Meanwhile the crime scene of the killings in Benghazi has been picked over by Libyans, who are assumed to have compromised what ever evidence there was that would have been of use to investigators. </p> <p>One US law enforcement official in Tripoli told the New York Times that they may never make it to Benghazi.</p>",
  "<p></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"historyotters.wordpress.com\">Adam Otway</a>, history teacher, Manor Church of England Academy, York</strong></h2> <p>My school has links with Canberra school in Singapore and in previous years some members of the SLT have been to visit their school and vice-versa. Last year for the first time they decided to send a member of the teaching staff to experience their education system and to do some teaching. That was to be me.</p> <p>Last February I made my way to Singapore and after a grueling 24 hours of travelling, alone, (including an amusing but embarrassing incident with an Indian man on one of the flights) I arrived, to find some of the most hospitable people on the planet. I observed and was greeted by teachers around the school, but most bizarrely I achieved something akin to celebrity status in the eyes of the children without actually doing anything. Some of the children still send me emails.</p> <p>I teach some of my history lessons dressed up in character (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrAOtway\">see my Twitter profile pic</a>). So I planned to teach in Singapore in character. Owing to the need to have my own clothes in my suitcase and the fact that it is outrageously hot in Singapore, I chose to dress as a Chicago gangster for a lesson and I attempted to speak in a stereotypical US gangster accent. I spent much of my time followed by giggling children and I had to keep stopping on corridors so that they could have their photograph with me. When I spoke in assembly to the whole school the students went mad, cheering and whistling when I took the stage, it did wonders for my ego.</p> <p>While out there I learnt how they use technology and in particular the iPad with their teaching. Since returning I have started teaching with an iPad myself and I must say it has revolutionised the way I teach. In Singapore the teachers had class groups on Facebook on which they communicated with the students, bizarrely I also observed a teacher answering a phone call from a student asking about their homework one evening. Obviously this is never going to happen in the UK but I have set up an Edmodo account and use it frequently with my classes, all as a result of my visit. I also let pupils contact me on Twitter if they have any problems with their homework.<br> Going to Singapore is something I will never forget and I have made some very long distance friends that I intend to keep.</p> <h2><strong>Craig Nunn, primary teacher, Norwich Road School, Thetford, Norfolk</strong></h2> <p>In my early twenties, straight out of university, I spent almost two years teaching English in China and one year teaching English in Poland. Previous to this experience, I hadn't considered becoming a primary school teacher, and saw travelling as a way of avoiding thinking about a career. However, after three years of living out of a suitcase, I decided to apply for a PGCE at Cambridge and when offered a place grabbed it with both hands.</p> <p>Between my PGCE and my NQT year I also spent three months travelling India. My experiences abroad have, both directly and indirectly, influenced my teaching. I definitely think I am more prepared for life in the classroom now than if I had entered teaching straight from university. I'm definitely a more confident person having met, interacted and sometimes become friends with vastly different people from all walks of life around the world. Experiencing somewhere like China has made me a more diplomatic person who understand how to handle difficult parents, for example.</p> <p>Being able to share my experiences of travelling with the children has helped me bring topics to life. For example, one of our topics in year 3 is 'A Taste of India'. Being able to tell the children stories of first hand experiences, show them videos and photographs and tell them about witnessing a Hindu funeral on the banks of the Ganges, being an extra in a Bollywood movie, staying and helping out at the Golden Temple in Amritsar has meant the children can see a different India to the often simplistic one shown in KS2 textbooks.</p> <p>I work in a school in Thetford in Norfolk, and around a third of our children don't speak English at home. Having taught TEFL, and experienced those first awkward moments of hearing and attempting to use an unfamiliar language helps me to empathise with these children. Having picked up a little Polish, seeing a new Polish child come to meet me for the first time with his or her parents and being able to greet them in their own language is greatly rewarding and helps put both the parents and child at ease. My experiences have also helped me understand how children acquire language, but also the importance to maintain using their first language in and around school. The dual-language children in out school act as translators for new arrivals, and when learning new topic words at the beginning of term we will learn them in all the languages spoken in our class.</p> <h2><strong>Dhamayanthi Sangarabalan, principal teacher, Blackhall Primary School, Edinburgh</strong></h2> <p>As a child, I travelled quite a lot and lived abroad in developing countries. I was always aware that some people have a lot and some so little. As I was growing up, I always felt that at some point in my life I wanted to have a chance to share my skills with people who didn't have those things.</p> <p>It was finding the right time to do that; I had to study, decide what I wanted to do, become a teacher, get a job and get the experience. VSO don't take people who don't have any experience. I was placed in Ethiopia two years ago and spent two years training teachers in the town of Abi Adi.</p> <p>Doing VSO is a chance to reflect and get away from the rat race of living in the developed world and a chance to identify and realise that you do have really good skills. I think we're so busy here as teachers, we have heavy workloads, we're marking, the curriculum is changing and there's always something new we have to do. So, for me, it was a chance to step away and reflect on why I became a teacher in the first place and what I love about teaching. That's what you've got to try and get across to the people you're working with to motivate them. I wanted to get across why I wanted to be a teacher and my vision for young people. I think it gives you a lot of personal satisfaction that way. I don't think I would have thought about it that deeply having just been here all the time.</p> <p>I'm a school teacher here but in Ethiopia I worked in a college of teacher education and I was liaising with the local ministers for education and advisors from different departments. I was gaining valuable management and leadership skills in terms of professional development learning to negotiate, compromise, learning to run meetings, learning to run training.</p> <p>I went into teaching with the idea that we were raising young people to be global citizens. You do have to get your literacy and numeracy follow the curriculum but it's also about helping young people realise their place in the world. Having been away, and done several voluntary experiences before VSO, I always brought that back into the classroom. So whenever we were learning about something it was never about sitting down and looking at a text book, but looking at the world around us and asking \"how is this going to help you become a young citizen of the world?\"</p> <p>If you go away on VSO, or other voluntary experiences, and you come back into the classroom, whenever you share your experiences with your children they are so engaged because it's you talking and they know you. It's not just something they saw on a news clip. The minute I say \"I met this child at a school once\" or \"I worked with a teacher in Ethiopia...\" they immediately prick up because it's your story, so they understand that from you.</p> <h2><strong>Chris Ewing, head of PE, Ridgewood High School, Stourbridge</strong></h2> <p>After a hectic five years at a high performing Catholic school in Hagley, I decided to resign in 2002 and see a bit more of the world. With a friend who was also a teacher, we headed to the West Coast of the USA taking in LA, Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Yosemite and San Francisco. We then flew to Fiji, had a campervan experience in New Zealand and then Brisbane in Australia. We spent new year in Sydney and got a flat in Bondi. I signed up with some supply agencies and sent out a few CVs. I started with some PE supply but got lots of general supply which put me well out of my comfort zone, including some primary work. I kept a diary while away which I still read regularly. I often talk about what I experienced and saw to my pupils.</p> <p>While away I was lucky enough to see some spectacular sights, climb the Sydney Harbour bridge, peer into the Grand Canyon, sail under the Golden Gate bridge, snorkeled off the barrier reef and walked around Uluru. I have eaten Kangaroo kebab and own a Didgeridoo purchased in Alice Springs. I got lost in South Central Los Angeles and have seen a roller skating granny in Venice beach. I could go on.</p> <p>I speak to my pupils about all of this. I come from a working class family from Tamworth (can you get any further from the sea?). By getting an education and some sports qualifications I have been able to coach football in USA numerous times and teach abroad while seeing all of this. Why can't they? I did just enough at school and eventually left Loughborough with a PE teaching qualification. I share this with the pupils on what is possible if they can apply themselves and get educated. It can lead to better job prospects and ultimately the possibility of a different type of education of experiencing different cultures. I am not showing off to them, but trying to make them realise what is there is outside of Stourbridge.</p> <p>My geography teacher Mr Snowden when I was at school was forever going on about his trips to South America, Asia - everywhere in fact. Other students would say \"he's boring\" or \"who cares?\" but I would look at a map and wonder what it would be like. So if it motivates at least one pupil, I would be happy with that.</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<h2><strong>Sue Rhodes is director of communications for the </strong><a href=\"http://www.clgf.org.uk/index.cfm\" title=\"\"><strong>Commonwealth Local Government Forum</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>What is economic development?</strong> When we were discussing local economic development (LED) at our commonwealth local government conference last year, we defined LED as \"a process which brings together different partners in a local area to work together and harness resources for sustainable economic growth\". Approaches should reflect local needs and circumstances.</p> <p><strong>Councils should be community leaders:</strong> They should bring together the different sectors and expertise within their areas. They do not necessarily have to have all the skills within, but know how to lead and create the right environment to encourage business and skills development. They have local knowledge about where opportunities might arise.</p> <h2><strong>Councillor Tony Samuels is cabinet member for regeneration at </strong><a href=\"http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Surrey county council</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Take equity stakes in estate assets:</strong> This would provide access to finance and allow councils to capture the market value rather than book value of new projects. It would also ensure new revenue streams to support services.</p> <p><strong>Sharing information and working together is essential:</strong> It is an ethos that must pervade into the public sector as swiftly as possible. Not only are economies of scale achievable but we reap the benefits of other councils' skills and expertise which can benefit us all.</p> <h2><strong>James Doe is assistant director for planning, development and regeneration at </strong><a href=\"http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Dacorum borough council</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Securing investment: </strong>Authorities must have development and investment schemes ready to go when funding schemes are announced. The most recent example of this was through the national \u00a30.5bn 'growing places' fund which was delegated down to local enterprise partnerships (LEPs). Not all authorities were in a position to bid. We were, because of our advance plans for the Maylands project, which came from imagination, commitment and investment upfront.</p> <h2><strong>Philip Monaghan is founder of </strong><a href=\"http://infrangilis.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Infrangilis</strong></a><strong>, a consultancy and thinktank working on resilience strategy</strong></h2> <p><strong>Low rise carbon special enterprise zones: </strong>These are one of the most interesting examples of local economic development work around the world, from Liverpool to Toronto. They are boosting local economies through smarter spatial planning and asset management, re-branding and use of local business relationships creating new areas to harness innovation and trade in low-carbon good and services \u2013 energy efficiency, water conservation, waste treatment and so on.</p> <p><strong>Central government vs local government: </strong>Central government is not always best placed to lead on the growth agenda. There are numerous examples from around the UK and the world where the local government is doing a better job. For example where local government is more strategic and innovative than the state. This means the state can do more to listen to and empower local government when formulating and delivering its national growth strategy.</p> <h2><strong>Nye Cominetti is a researcher at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theworkfoundation.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Work Foundation</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Should local authorities compete?</strong> The new LEP structures demand co-operation. LEPs arecollections of local authority areas. Given the new competitive regime for bidding into central government money for economic development, authorities on LEPs must work together to produce successful bids if they are to secure any funding for projects at all. I've found that, within some LEPs, council represenatives are reluctant to work together in this way, and understandably (as elected politicians) want to act in the interests of their area first, rather than the wider LEP area.</p> <p><strong>Business rate retention:</strong> The new business rate retention scheme being introduced in theory gives local authorities a powerful incentive to compete for new businesses. Any business border hopping they can encourage could have a real impact on their revenue.</p> <p><strong>How can branding help?</strong> It's very important for inward investment purposes, but interestingly perhaps also for attracting public money. The Smith Institute suggested that the east midlands was failing to land much regional growth fund or capital housing money because it had no unified 'identity' or 'brand' as a region, which contributed to its not having the ear of central government.</p> <h2><strong>Peter Manning is head of international trade at </strong><a href=\"http://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Default.aspx\" title=\"\"><strong>Essex county council</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Setting up a link with another country is not difficult: </strong>Making the link work is. There are many Chinese cities and regions looking for partners in the UK, but unfortunately the outcome is usually civic incoming visits that take up time and lead nowhere. I'd advise any area looking for a link to consider how they will fund it to the point where it gets beyond civic exchanges.</p> <p><strong>Doing business with China: </strong>It takes time and [a track record of] successful projects to get to the point where real business happens as a result of the link. It must be clear at the outset where what the basis for exchange is, otherwise a link will not have any chance of producing results. Jiangsu Province is leading the development of wind energy and offshore wind in China, while Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex is leading the development of the UK offshore wind industry.</p> <p><strong>There is a basis for exchange:</strong> There are also economies of scale that you will need to consider: as you see, we are teamed up with Norfolk and Suffolk county councils on this work. If you want to use a link to promote exports, for example, there have to be enough businesses in your area that are ready and able to do business. In fact, the numbers in this category are quite small, which is one reason why we work with other counties. We then combine our advantages to put a package together.</p> <p><strong>No-one knows how to create growth at the macro level: </strong>It is also true that there is no template for local economic development and that efforts need to be built around local opportunities and the drive of willing people and organisations. Counties should be bullish about their role in attracting inward investment and promoting exports.</p> <p><em>You can read the discussion </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/sep/25/live-discussion-economic-development\" title=\"\"><em>in full here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Martin Robertson is group finance director at <a href=\"http://www.whg.uk.com/main.cfm\" title=\"\">WHG</a></h2> <p><strong>Resist temptations: </strong>It's so tempting to sign up for something sexy that you don't really understand. The risks need to be fully understood. Certainly the ones that have been offered to us leave the risks squarely with the provider.</p> <p><strong>Risk assessment involves asking a lot of questions: </strong>What if this? What if that? How will this impact X, and who should be working with us on this? It involves more formal due diligance, but there is a big role for common sense. We are sometimes expected only to talk about the numbers, but there's more to it than that. As part of the corporate team we have to make sure everything is covered.</p> <p><strong>On affordable rents we are in the dark:</strong> We need a long-term message from this government. If we had a clear direction it would help with planning, otherwise we risk downward pressure on rents after committing equity to schemes that rely on higher income.</p> <p><strong>My tips for aspiring finance directors: </strong>Get on a board for the experience, and it looks good on your CV. Don't be put off by not being from housing as this may be a strength. Visit a finance director and ask them questions about their role. Research your target registered provider; don't be like a candidate for a job we interviewed \u2013 we asked why she wanted the job and she asked us to remind her what the job was.</p> <p><strong>Zero grant means higher rents:</strong> It is wise to plan for no grant funding at all, although perhaps unlikely. But much of the pressure we face is uncertainty caused by the government's unpredictability.</p> <h2>Susan Hickey is executive director finance at <a href=\"http://www.peabody.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Peabody</a></h2> <p><strong>Ingredients for success: </strong>As well as having a firm grasp on the numbers, a finance director needs excellent communication skills and wider people skills to lead a high-calibre finance team. We need teams with a very strong focus on service delivery, healthy questioning minds and willing to challenge and improve the status quo.</p> <p><strong>Diversification: </strong>From a risk management perspective, it is risky not to plan for diversification.</p> <h2>Paresh Parekh is group director of resources at <a href=\"http://www.asra.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Asra Housing Group</a></h2> <p><strong>We need to keep up just to stand still:</strong> Key to this changing environment is risk management and to ensure that the senior management team and the board understand them. The role of the finance director is more critical then ever, to clearly understand the implications from these risks and have a framework to manage them.</p> <p><strong>Social landlords are everything to everyone: </strong>We are commercial, not-for-profit, charitable, for-profit, innovative, dedicated to the core business, helping the disadvantaged and developing expensive London homes for sale.<strong> </strong>We are being pulled in all directions, and the finance director in the housing sector needs a range of skills which finance directors in the private sector generally don't as they are just asked to focus on shareholder value.</p> <h2>Allister Young is director of finance for <a href=\"http://www.coastlinehousing.co.uk/index.html\" title=\"\">Coastline Housing</a></h2> <p><strong>Acquiring new skills:</strong> Housing had a very simple business model and has diversified. This has been mirrored in terms of the job requirements and skills. The professional qualification is a given, but beyond that I would look for someone who can show that they will continue to push to take finance from back office overhead to an essential value adding service; somene who can demonstrate that they can deliver complex projects; someone who is willing to make difficult decisions, and who maintains an inquisitive challenging mind.</p> <p><strong>The key to success: </strong>From a career development point this is crucial. Show that you want more than just sitting behind a computer screen producing reports and are much more likely to succeed.</p> <h2>Stuart Fisher is finance director at <a href=\"http://accordgroup.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Accord Group</a></h2> <p><strong>Getting the right balance:</strong> There is definitely a need to be more commercial, but at the same time it's important that we never lose sight of what we are here to do.</p> <p><strong>Commercial talent: </strong>The skills required for the future of finance in the sector are definitely changing. The trend seems to be for a calling on new colleagues to have a degree of commercial sector experience. There is still a requirement for colleagues to understand the social housing sector, but we need fresh people with different experiences and new ideas.</p> <p><strong>Value for money: </strong>Value for money has always been a bit a vague issue in the sector, beyond \"doing more for less\". The regulator has now made its position clear and this allows us to respond in a much more targeted way.</p> <h2>John Butler is finance policy officer at the <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Housing Federation</a></h2> <p><strong>The uncertainty of grant funding:</strong> We are constantly pushing government on this issue, and they seem to be getting the message. However, it is absolutely right that housing associations should plan for all eventualities, including zero grant, and proper analysis and forward planning for this scenario should be undertaken.</p> <p><strong>Before diversifying:</strong> Housing associations need to ensure their risk management procedures are in place and that the board fully understands all the risks.</p> <p><strong>Harmony: </strong>A truly exceptional finance team works in harmony with the rest of the organisation.</p> <p>They anticipate the most appropriate financial information that decision makers need and communicate this information to them in a timely and comprehensible manner.</p> <p><em>Click here to </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/sep/21/live-discussion-future-housing-finance\" title=\"\"><em>view the discussion</em></a><em> in full</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice direct to you.
