But these days, even hyper-cool club DJs are paying tribute to the school disco, dropping surprisingly mainstream and poppy tunes into heavy dance sets. These jump-up party DJs are more interested in turning a sweaty dancefloor upside down by dropping <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8AOAap6_k4\" title=\"\">Womack &amp; Womack</a> at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/jun/08/sonar-soundtrack-playlist-to-barcelona\" title=\"\">Sonar</a> (nice move, Jackmaster) than they are concerned by disapproving glances from head-nodding backpack purists.</p> <p>Ten years ago, promoters could fill their clubs with one DJ who would take the crowd on an epic seven-hour journey deep into the heart of their sound. Today, the same promoters pack their basements with the dancing feet of the fidgety YouTube generation. DJs are often offered 45-minute slots on lengthy lineups. They have a mini-window within which they can wow the rug-cutters and stand out from their peers. A DJ fears nothing more than a whole dancefloor hunting en masse for the nearest smoking area, and this is when the uncle-friendly track comes in handy. You know the sort: chipper pop songs, chock-full of vocals and nostalgia; a recognisable three minutes that can unify the crowd, lifting them from their deep house comas into collective, occasionally singalong euphoria.</p> <p>Of course, dropping a wedding tune and getting it right is not a simple process. It's a masterclass in the fine art of styling it out. Like a perfectly timed joke, it's all in the delivery. Alexander Waldron, founder of the feelgood <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/greco-roman\" title=\"\">Greco Roman</a> parties, explains: \"It's best to just play a snippet and then introduce a different bassline underneath it; something to keep it exciting.\" You'll never catch a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/19/boiler-room-ustream-james-blake\" title=\"\">Boiler Room</a> DJ playing back-to-back Now 24 classics. But you might hear him or her playfully sandwiching Michael Jackson's Liberian Girl between bass-heavy garage tracks, as <a href=\"http://djoneman.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Oneman</a> did at the online party back in June.</p> <p>For some young bucks, there's a refreshing lack of awareness of any Davidoff Cool Water, sixth-form disco memories; their baby-soft ears are hearing the tracks for the first time round. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/18/jessie-ware-private-pop-star\" title=\"\">Jessie Ware</a> remixers <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/disclosuremusic\" title=\"\">Disclosure</a> are both well under 22 \u2013 when they hear <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kXMcjKhBgU\" title=\"\">Phats &amp; Small</a> they think perfect house beats, not a brief chart career and a surprising marriage to Vanessa Feltz. DJ du jour, Mel\u00e9, unflinchingly weaves Daniel Bedingfield's Gotta Get Thru This into his <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2012/08/13/download-a-9-track-mixtape-from-liverpudlian-party-starter-mele/mele-13-aug/\" title=\"\">FACT mixtape</a>. \"I think that if you're a fan of a lot of different types of music you shouldn't be afraid to play what you really love listening to,\" he explains.</p> <p>The wedding DJ phenomenon is bound to have a shelf life. Purist sets are already making a comeback, often with the added playfulness of specialist DJs having a bash at a whole new genre \u2013 dubstep stalwart <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/dec/03/skream-magnetic-man-dubstep-global\" title=\"\">Skream</a>, for example, played a disco set at London's East Village earlier this year, while TEED played an all-jungle set at the Boiler Room in June.</p> <p>But there will always be DJs with the courage to play the hits. As Waldron explains: \"There's a common misconception in DJing that rare records are cooler, but in reality a lot of records are rare simply because they're crap.\"</p>",
  "<p>Does being uprooted matter? Does being removed from the country in which you were born and where you spent the first years of your life leave an indefinable emotional scar? I don't believe so. Many of the \"uprooted\" are clearly much happier in their adopted countries than they were in their countries of origin. But making a new home in a completely new environment and a completely new language inevitably influences a person's perceptions, both about him- or herself and about others.</p> <p>I was born in Jerusalem shortly before the second world war and lived there until I was nearly nine. It would never again be my home.</p> <p>My parents had met there, both having left Germany soon after Hitler came to power. My mother had had to abandon her legal studies in Berlin when the Nazis decreed that Jews could no longer practise law. My father, at that time already a successful lawyer, was debarred from continuing his career. But they were young and unattached and, like many Jews who could afford to start a new life, they set off for Palestine, where Jews could live freely. They married in 1937.</p> <p>Neither of them were committed Zionists. On the contrary, my father's experiences in the first world war as a soldier in the German army (he had won an Iron Cross) had put him off all forms of nationalism. My mother, before the rise of Hitler, had been in favour of assimilation, believing that the more Jews and non-Jews intermarried, the more likely it would be that the \"Jewish problem\" would gradually fade away.</p> <p>Nor were they religious. In common with many German Jews, they did not observe Jewish customs or traditions in any shape or form. Throughout my childhood I never once entered a synagogue \u2013 I barely knew there were such places \u2013 and was brought up in ignorance of the most basic tenets of Judaism.</p> <p>Soon after his arrival in Jerusalem, my father, whose family had been in the retail business, set up a women's fashion store. It was to become the largest such store in the city (which was much smaller in those days). The Queen of Jordan sometimes shopped there. We lived in a large flat above the shop where, as an only child, I spent a great deal of time playing on my own. At home I spoke German and later, at school, Hebrew.</p> <p>My mother was much stricter than would be acceptable today. During mealtimes, for example, I often had to hold books under my arms to make sure that my elbows weren't sticking out. If I didn't finish my spinach at lunchtime, it would be served up again for supper, with a bit of sugar sprinkled on it.</p> <p>Not that my childhood in Jerusalem was unhappy. One of my most vivid memories, for example, is of an annual excursion to pick flowers with my adored father. He would take the day off \u2013 presumably with the aim of putting in what is now called \"quality time\" with me \u2013 and we would walk hand in hand to the outskirts of town. We would clamber across rocky hills looking for the long-stemmed wild cyclamen \u2013 pink, purple and white \u2013 that sprang up every year in the patches of dusty earth between the rocks.</p> <p>We were always alone on this stony high ground, with its panoramic view of the old city surrounded by olive groves. Even as a small child I could sense that there was something historic and mythical in this landscape, or so it seems to me now.</p> <p>Life at home and at school was going well when, in 1947 (just before the state of Israel came into being), my parents decided to leave Palestine; they were eager to resume their former careers. When we set sail, I thought we were going on holiday. I had no idea that I was never to return \u2013 or only years later, as a tourist. I suppose my parents felt that to explain that we were emigrating would upset me too much. So I was not given the chance to say goodbye to my friends, teachers or anyone else.</p> <p>While my parents travelled to England and America looking for work, they left me in a small boarding school in Switzerland. It was a completely different world and I was overwhelmed by so many new impressions and demands that I soon began to forget my old life. I also began to forget the Hebrew language. When they came to fetch me after a year, I was speaking Swiss-German, which they could barely understand.</p> <p>Eventually my father was offered an important and very suitable job with an Anglo-American legal aid society to compensate the victims of Nazi persecution. But there was a downside: it meant living in Germany, the last place my parents had wanted to go back to. They reluctantly agreed, but couldn't accept that their daughter should be brought up and educated as a German.</p> <p>Throughout my childhood my parents never talked to me about the Holocaust. Presumably, they wished to protect me from the knowledge of human evil. Indeed, I gradually deduced, but was never directly told, that my mother's parents had perished in a concentration camp. My mother had travelled back to Germany shortly before the outbreak of war to persuade them to leave but they had refused. A regime as barbaric as Hitler's, they thought, could surely not survive.</p> <p>My parents wanted me to be English. Like most refugees throughout the world, they greatly admired England \u2013 for its tolerance, its independent spirit, its courage in resisting tyranny, its rule of law.</p> <p>In 1948, my mother went to England to search for a suitable boarding school for me. At that time, many girls' boarding schools did not accept pupils who spoke no English. So she decided on Dartington Hall, the co-educational, \"progressive\" and somewhat notorious school situated in Devon. She deposited me there and left me to sink or swim.</p> <p>I sank, temporarily at least. It is a miserable experience to be completely cut off, without a single family member or trusted friend in the whole country to speak to or confide in. Every evening I used to hide in a corner of the school's large, dark gym so that I could cry without being seen.</p> <p>It took about a year to learn fluent English, after which I soon became an integrated and happy member of the school. Luckily for me, there was a terrific craze for roller-skating a few months after I arrived and because I had learned ice-skating in Switzerland, I was a whizz at this \"sport\". So my lowly status was slightly enhanced.</p> <p>Occasionally my parents came to see me, but my chief memory of these visits is the embarrassment I felt because of their German accents. As they had intended, I had been thoroughly anglicised.</p> <p>In the ensuing years I was too preoccupied \u2013 getting married, having children, working \u2013 to think much about my childhood in Jerusalem. I did, however, have a rather surprising experience in my thirties, when I went to see the Hollywood epic Exodus. Before this very mediocre film begins, while the credits are rolling, the wide screen is filled with some beautiful panoramic scenes of Jerusalem and its surrounding hills and olive trees. As soon as I saw this, I unexpectedly burst into tears.</p> <p>Since then, I have only been to Israel for three or four short visits, the most recent of which came about in a most unexpected way. I found myself seated, at a conference, next to a charming Israeli journalist. He was about the same age as me and had also been born in Jerusalem. But talking about our common background turned out to be a uncomfortable experience.</p> <p>What school had I attended, he asked. Alas, I couldn't remember its name. What about the names of any teachers? Again, sorry, can't remember. OK, surely I could recall the names of some school friends?</p> <p>Well, yes, I remember the name of one girl, who had been my best friend \u2013 Ruth. Ruth what? It was almost exactly 60 years ago, I protested.</p> <p>\"Well,\" he said, \"I regard this as a challenge. I will find your Ruth.\" He was as good as his word. It took him only a few phone calls.</p> <p>My Ruth turned out to be a good friend of his. She remembered me well.</p> <p>A day or two later I got a call from Ruty (as she was known) who sounded so friendly and jolly that I was instantly drawn to her. We decided to email each other our life stories, starting from the time we had last seen each other.</p> <p>So began an absorbing correspondence, which proceeded by chronological instalments. Every day we would eagerly await the arrival of a new episode and, like Victorian novelists, we sometimes deliberately ended on a cliff-hanger. Our stories could hardly have been more different.</p> <p>Ruty's life resembled an action thriller. After military service she had worked in various psychiatric centres and addiction clinics; she had founded Israel's first organisation to help dyslexic students and she had worked in the Israeli parliament, becoming head of the foreign relations department. Meanwhile, she had lived through the hardships and terrors of war. My story by contrast, with its succession of desk jobs, was more akin to a romantic novelette.</p> <p>When our narratives reached the present day, Ruty invited me to Jerusalem, to attend a lunch party she was giving for her women friends. Of course I accepted.</p> <p>The party was attended by about 30 women \u2013 doctors, archaeologists, lawyers, journalists. I have never before, or since, been to a gathering where there was such a strong feeling of mutual trust, openness and equality.</p> <p>None of the elements which so often impair the enjoyment of social occasions in England \u2013 cliquishness, social insecurity, insincerity, and so on \u2013 were present. I was hugely impressed and attracted by these women, but at the same time felt very English, and very much an outsider.</p> <p>The question I was most often asked was: \"Why did you leave Israel?\"</p> <p>My reply, that it had been my parents' decision, not mine, seemed not quite to satisfy them. Perhaps I was imagining this \u2013 there was certainly nothing reproachful in anyone's reaction \u2013 but I felt an unasked question hovering in the air: why hadn't I come back when I was old enough to make my own decisions?</p> <p>How would I have replied? The truth is that it never occurred to me to return to Israel. I greatly admired the country's achievements \u2013 its democratic way of life, its outstanding universities, its cultural attainments, its contributions to medicine and so on \u2013 but I had no family or friends there. I had been brought up, for better or worse, without any sense of religious or ethnic identity. Though I have never felt totally at home in England, I married an English husband and had brought up two English children.</p> <p>I was very happy to be English \u2013 or almost English.</p> <p><em>\u2022 An Almost English Life, by Miriam Gross, is published by Short Books, \u00a314.99.

  "<p>It wasn't until the late 17th century that women were allowed on stage. Prior to that, female roles were played by men or boys. The Puritan preacher John Rainolds railed against the presence of cross-dressing actors. \"The putting of women's attire on men may kindle unclean affections,\" he warned, warming to his own soliloquy to denounce the \"filthy sparkles of lust to that vice\". He wouldn't be thrilled (or at least wouldn't admit to being) by the Donmar Warehouse's latest idea of an <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">all-female cast for Julius Caesar</a>. It seems remarkable that a play with only two female characters can carry the weight of affirmative action, but the proposal for a Caesarina<em> </em>\u2013 or should that be Julia Caesar? \u2013 follows on from the success of Gregory Doran's all-black rendering of the same play for the RSC. It is the fact that this is a work of (literally) Brutish macho power play that makes the idea of flipping genders quite so disruptive, offering the chance to transform a dusty GCSE set text into something much more Pussy Riot. Anthony's final tribute to Brutus \"This was a man\" may well have to be played for laughs, but Portia's \"I have a man's mind, but a woman's might. How hard it is for women to keep counsel!\" will press home the dramatic potential of turning sexual politics on its head, which Josie Rourke's first season running the Donmar has already ably demonstrated. By moving men off the stage she might just grab hold of the ears of her countrywomen, and bury a patriarchy that is more used to being praised.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2012. The original said women were not allowed on stage until the late 16th century, when the 17th century was meant. A misspelling of Caesarina has also been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>I had no idea what to do. I'd just crossed the line to win gold in the T34 100m, the first track gold of the Games, and I literally had no idea what was going on. I hadn't seen anyone else celebrate, so I smiled and waved and headed off&#xa0;\u2013 I didn't really make as much of it as I should have.</p> <p>But you wouldn't have been able to get me off the track without celebrating after winning gold No2 in the 200m. I was like: 'I am taking this victory lap.' I took my time on that circuit, soaking it up because it's never going to happen again. Two gold medals \u2013 you can't ask for anything more than that, can you really? And as an athletics team we couldn't have asked for any more either. Our goal was to come here and beat Beijing and we've done that. By miles.</p> <p>So let's just say I'm feeling pretty good. But I've not even had time to get a hangover yet. There really wasn't much time to celebrate at all after picking up my second gold \u2013 it was race, media, podium, media, home. We got back to the village at about midnight and, rather than champagne, a McFlurry at McDonald's was all that I really had by way of a celebration.</p> <p>I'm trying to make the most of being here because it has been such fun. Already I feel like maybe I've forgotten bits of it. There was so much going on and it was such an amazing atmosphere in the stadium on Thursday that I wish I could do it just one more time. I couldn't have competed on a better night. We had Jonnie Peacock, we had David Weir, two of the greatest athletes we've got on our team, and everyone was there to support them, so to race on that night I got their support too. The noise was just out of this world.</p> <p>It all happens so quickly. You finish the race, do your victory lap, go through the mixed zone with reporters and TV cameras in your face, then, after the first race, the drug tester was right there next to me. Brilliant.</p> <p>So you rush through all that because the medal ceremony is so close to the end of the race. It was only 15 minutes or so. So you have to get out of your race chair and into your day chair really quick. You don't get time to think about what is going on.</p> <p>After the 200m I rushed upstairs to watch Dave's race and they wouldn't let me in to the athletes' seating area \u2013 it was doing my head in. I was like: 'I've got a gold medal!' It's this stadium, it really doesn't like letting me in. I make that the third time I've struggled \u2013 first at the test event, then at a media barbecue and now at the Games themselves! But I managed to get in to watch Jonnie's race and the atmosphere was electric. You could hear a pin drop. After the false start everyone was just so tense on that start line. It was just amazing, fantastic.</p> <p>Even the five days between my races went by in a bit of a blur. I was training every morning \u2013 and to get to the track, set your chair up, train, then get back to the village takes a long time. So that's half the day gone already. Then the rest of it you're hanging around with your friends in your room, so it wasn't too bad at all. I went to the stadium on a couple of nights \u2013 to watch Hollie Arnold throw and then watch Sally Brown run. So you just filled the time with watching the other guys on the TV and it zoomed by really quickly, so I'm gutted that it's nearly finished.</p> <p>For me each race was different. In the 100m heats I was nervous, because it was my first time in the stadium and I thought I'd be more scared of that noise. But instead of 'Wow \u2013 this is scary' it was 'Wow \u2013 this is all for me. That's wicked'. I loved that.</p> <p>Then, for the final, I'd looked at the times and I knew I could win it, so I wasn't really nervous. In the 200m it was the other way round \u2013 for the heats I knew I would be fine, but then in the final I was so scared. So it was all a bit weird emotion-wise.</p> <p>I never realised how far I was ahead in either race. I never do. When I watched the 200m back live on TV after the race I was like: 'Oh. I was quite far ahead, wasn't I?' I always think I can hear other people right behind me. And it's always actually myself that I can hear. So I'm just a bit bonkers.</p> <p>I'm loving all the attention but it feels so strange. It hasn't sunk in yet what has happened. I don't think it'll change me though. People keep writing on my Facebook, saying: 'You've just won two gold medals and you're still talking about McFly in your interviews. You're weird.' I'm like: 'Well, maybe I am!'.</p> <p>It doesn't feel like I've suddenly become famous. We're in a very closed environment in the village. You're pretty much left to your own devices. I think it may be a bit different when I go home when anyone can get hold of me at anytime. That said, when I've been out in the Olympic Park loads of people have been coming up and asking for pictures, asking to see the medal. It was quite funny the other day. I went to meet my friend to show her my 100m medal and one of the girls in my apartment in the village had just won bronze the night before. I accidentally took her medal with me. So when I got to see my friend I was like: 'Where's my gold gone?' The medals are pretty much all just piled up on the table next to the dead flowers in the apartment at the moment, so I had just grabbed the wrong one. I'll let my mum decide what happens to them when I get home, which is probably for the best.</p> <p>I've been away for quite a long time, so when I do go home it'll be cool to see everybody who's helped me along the way. I've had a few emails saying I'm going to have a civic reception. I'm the first person from Calderdale to ever win a medal. It's really exciting. I just hope I've done them proud. But at the same time I don't want to leave this place. I'll be leaving a lot of friends and I don't know when I'll see them all again, so it's little bit sad. I don't want to leave Sally and Hollie behind. I'll have to see if I can take them home with me.</p> <p>It is strange not to have London 2012 in my future \u2013 it's been a long road to get here \u2013 but at the same time I've got less than four years to Rio. We've got world championships next July, so there's a lot of work to do to build up to them. There's always something to aim for, you've just got to find it and concentrate on it. I'll definitely be aiming for the Games in 2020, I'll be 28 by then, and maybe a few after that, we'll have to see.</p> <p>Away from the athletics I've been trying to keep up with Sarah Storey, Ellie Simmonds and the rest of the ParalympicsGB team's exploits whenever I can but you're so wrapped up in athletics that you don't always have time. You might know that someone has medalled but you don't often get to see them to say well done. I saw Sarah on Friday. She said: 'Oh, well done!' I was like: 'Well done! What did you do?' It's just the way it is. You're wrapped up in your own sport and that's who you hang around with. It's nice to be around all the other sports as well but you have to stick to your comfort zone until you finish. It's getting to the point now, though, where pretty much everyone has finished competing, so it's nice to see everyone when they're not stressed out.</p> <p>Even so, everyone has been so supportive of each other and so friendly that it's been a lovely place to be. It has been so nice. It's surpassed my expectations. I just want go back to the beginning and do it all again.</p>",

If it likes the look of what is being proposed, the new fund will provide backing to the tune of up to \u00a350,000.</p> <p>According to the Co-operative Group, the UK is witnessing a \"resurgence\" in enterprises set up and run for the benefit of the community \u2013 from bookshops and renewable energy projects, to pubs and post offices. The number of UK co-operative enterprises rose from 5,450 in 2010 to 5,933 in 2011.</p> <p>Often there is an opportunity for people who back a venture's aims to become a member by buying shares, and that's the case with Greater Manchester TreeStation, based in West Gorton, which acts as a hub for a wide range of wood-related activities.</p> <p>It does a lot of work for local councils, and hopes to build up its business, supplying woodchip for heating. The company was set up in 2008 and recently changed its constitution to become a \"society for the benefit of the community\" \u2013 a type of Industrial and Provident Society.</p> <p>Nick Torr, one of the team at the society, says: \"For me, what the TreeStation is working towards is a no-brainer \u2013 we have this valuable local timber resource all around us, even in our urban environment, which needs to be responsibly managed to help create the sustainable future our children deserve.</p> <p>\"Surprising quantities of wood are still being wasted, or poorly utilised. Our aim is to 'upcycle' as far as possible. Timber from our own activities, and other contractors, is used to make sawn timber for joinery, firewood, and woodchip for biomass boilers. Nothing is wasted, as anything left over is in demand for composting locally or use on allotments and by gardeners.\"</p> <p>The organisation wants to secure more contracts for supplying woodchip and to expand its firewood and tree surgery operations, so it has launched a share issue to raise \u00a3140,000.</p> <p>The minimum investment is \u00a3200, and the society says that each year the directors will recommend what interest rate should be paid. The share offer document states it is currently intended it will be set at 5%, though that may be changed by the board.</p> <p>It also warns that the share offer is exempt from regulation and therefore, \"if the business fails you have no right of complaint to the <a href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Financial Ombudsman [Service]</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a>\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, the new fund has been set up specifically to support community-owned enterprises looking to raise money via a share issue. Backed by the Co-operative Group and the <a href=\"http://www.co-operativeloanfund.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Co-operative Loan Fund</a>, and operated by <a href=\"http://www.coopfinance.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operative &amp; Community Finance</a>, its main aims are to boost investor confidence, while improving access to capital by underwriting a share issue by up to \u00a350,000.</p> <p>However, the reassurance provided by its confidence in a project may mean the share issue hits its target without this investment.</p> <p>Applications from all kinds of community-owned ventures will be welcomed. However, it will only invest in Industrial and Provident Societies.</p>",
  "<p><sup>\"</sup>Even if you're a really good swimmer,\" says Lawrence Norfolk, \"you're not going to be able to swim the Pacific. You're going to fail. And I found myself in the middle of the Pacific.\" The 48-year-old novelist is explaining why, five years ago, he abandoned the most complex novel that he, or perhaps anyone else, has ever attempted to write. \"I took on more than I could cope with. With hindsight it was a work of insanity, but it seemed like a good idea at the time.\"</p> <p>Provisionally entitled <em>The Levels</em>, the&#xa0;novel had three settings \u2013 Britain at the end of its Roman era, the second world war and 1981. \"It was so complex that it became exponentially more difficult with every sentence.\" The cast&#xa0;list for each time-frame had four or five major characters and 40 or 60 minor characters. \"Everything that happens resonates. As soon as a character does something in Roman times that has three or four effects in the war section and another 10 or 12 effects in the 1981 section. It was impossible to control and the more I wrote, the more the ending got further&#xa0;away.\"</p> <p>Even then, though, Norfolk, who is superbly confident in his own abilities, refused to give up. \"With every book that I've written there's been a moment where I've thought I've gone wrong and I don't see how I can fix it. Not that I <em>can't</em> fix it.\" Norfolk made his name as a 27-year-old tyro with <em>Lempri\u00e8re's Dictionary</em> in 1991. He was compared by Malcolm Bradbury to Pynchon and Eco. Louis de Berni\u00e8res called him a genius. Granta listed him as one of 20 Best of Young British Novelists. He followed it up with two other similarly vast and architectonically impressive novels, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/popesrhinoceros.htm\" title=\"\"><em>The Pope's Rhinoceros</em> (1996)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/16/fiction.reviews5\" title=\"\"><em>In the Shape of a Boar </em>(2000)</a>, often virtuosically using different interfusing narrative time-frames; with each book, he believed he could write himself out of the mess he'd written himself into. \"Every time I've just continued in the belief that if you just keep working at something it'll come right. <em>Lempri\u00e8re's Dictionary</em> seemed to go really wrong about a third of the way in, but there's no trace of that in the finished book. This time I was right to feel hopeless.\"</p> <p>We're sitting in the kitchen of his west London home, where Norfolk lives with his wife, biochemist Vineeta Rayan and their two sons. The painful remembrance of what he calls \"the novel that died\" was prompted by me asking what he's been up to for the past&#xa0;12 years since the publication of his last book. He's just given me the long answer. \"There's a short answer, which is I had a novel which imploded, a film that didn't get funded and two kids.\" His sons Lucas and Joseph (to whom he dedicates his new novel) notwithstanding, it's been a period of setbacks. That film, for instance, was based on Norfolk's screenplay of the <em>Iliad</em> written at the behest of his friend,&#xa0;director Philip Haas. \"We didn't&#xa0;have enough money for Troy or for a single chariot,\" he says. Billy Connolly and then Mandy Patinkin were to play Zeus, while Jessica Lange and then Helen Hunt were slated to play Hera. The project collapsed, leaving Norfolk with arguably the most promising adaptation of a literary classic to go unfilmed since Pinter scripted Proust.</p> <p>Norfolk insists that literary setbacks are part of the territory. \"Unless there's a possibility of failure, what you're doing isn't actually art.\"</p> <p>After he realised <em>The Levels</em> had definitively failed, he had a bracing meeting with his agent Carole Blake. She asked him if he had any other ideas. \"I said: 'There's this boy and he's an orphan and he becomes a chef in the 17th century. He falls in love with the wrong girl. The civil war happens so he loses everything but they can be together. Then when the Restoration happens, he gets everything back: he can be the greatest chef of the age and she can be lady of the manor and they have to decide what to do.' Carole&#xa0;said:&#xa0;'Well&#xa0;what do they do?' I didn't know at that point but I knew I&#xa0;had to write the book to find out.\"</p> <p>He's spent the past five years doing that. The result, a typically Norfolkian tome of a historical novel dense in research and intellectual ambition, is called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=john+saturnall%27s+feast&amp;tag=googhydr-21&amp;index=stripbooks&amp;hvadid=13048914008&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=6735171731606404351&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;ref=pd_sl_9kwq51vsi_e\" title=\"\"><em>John Saturnall's Feast</em></a>. It's the story of the eponymous chef during the religious and ideological ferment of Charles I's reign, the civil war, the protectorate and the restoration. Norfolk's first English-set novel has an <em>Upstairs Downstairs</em> storyline. The wrong girl is Lady Lucretia Fremantle, headstrong daughter of the lord of the manor in whose cavernous subterranean kitchens Saturnall works.</p> <p>One catalyst for the book was his friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/07/booksonhealth.features\" title=\"\">Kate Colquhoun's <em>Taste: The Story of Britain Through Its Cooking</em></a>. Norfolk was impressed by her disinterring of pre-Cromwellian cuisine. \"It was incredibly sophisticated. When Kate got to the civil war her narrative basically stops because it's war \u2013 there's nothing to be said about the cuisine. It's actually a pretty boring chapter but I read it avidly and imagined a chef whose professional life is stopped by war. What would you do if you were John Saturnall? Suddenly the bottom has fallen out of your world. The book goes backwards and forwards from that crisis moment.\" He also sought tips from restaurateur David Moore of Pied-\u00e0-Terre on how big kitchens work.</p> <p>Norfolk's novels have always expanded their readers' vocabularies, and <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em> is no exception, but with this twist: the new words you'll learn are overwhelmingly obsolete ones commonplace in the gentry's kitchens of early 17th-century England. Here there are varieties of apples called Quodling and (my favourite) Genet. There's maslin bread, manchet bread and horse bread. There are sallets, dariole-cases, kickshaws and maunds.</p> <p>Each chapter is prefaced with a recipe ostensibly from the John Saturnall cookbook. It isn't quite Nigella. \"Next take the cold Cream, warm Honey and a Ladder,\" counsels the recipe for Baked Quodling Apples served with a sweet Cream. \"Climb the Ladder Pour the Honey and Cream into a Pot of Gascon wine and let it froth, the higher the better.\" During war's lean years, Saturnall is forced to forage for chestnuts for bread. In one scene, he seduces Lucretia from her fast (which she began in protest about being betrothed to a twit from a neighbouring manor) with dishes devised to titillate her palate; in another, which takes place during food shortages, he describes the dishes she can no longer taste. The seducer is in both cases an artist \u2013 wooing the lady with the fruits of his imagination.</p> <p>Norfolk's novel is unexpectedly voguish. Foraging has been the last word in cuisine since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/26/rene-redzepi-noma-best-restaurant\" title=\"\">2010 when Danish restaurant Noma beat Ferran Adri\u00e0's elBulli and Heston Blumenthal's the Fat Duck to become supposedly the world's best restaurant</a>. Lab-based, molecular cuisine was over, supplanted by a cuisine based on foraging. \"You've got to be kidding,\" says Norfolk when I put this to him. \"The foraging in my book is about starvation rations.\"</p> <p>Norfolk was more interested in trying the seemingly impossible, to get into the psychology of 17th-century England by means of the politics of its food. \"Making bread is hard \u2013 I know this because I occasionally bake. It's hard to make a loaf let alone six loaves a day. There's some equation between labour cost and snob value.\" It is always part of his aim to enter into the psychology of a historical period through research and imagination. \"It's usually about two-thirds of the way through a book I think: 'I'm there! I'm right in the&#xa0;17th century! The End.' So it's frustrating.\"</p> <p>Is that true of all your books? \"They're all imperfect. You never finish a book, you just abandon it. Donna Tartt said: 'I'm the sort of person who's quite happy to push a semi-colon around a sentence for an afternoon.' I'm not quite like that, but there are a couple of sentences in <em>Lempri\u00e8re</em> I still go back to and rearrange in my head. I'm not unhappy with the big things.\"</p> <p>One of the big things Norfolk attempts in <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em> is to explore how religions try to codify humanity's most basic drives. What may come across as a novel indicting Protestantism's suppression of fun, sex and good food (it's Protestant groups who smash up the manor and lay waste to its subterranean kitchens where Saturnall finesses his culinary skills; it's civil war that destroys his supply lines and thwarts his surreptitious affair with Lucretia), is really a broader exploration of control. His argument borrows from Freud: \"There are two primary impulses \u2013 to eat and to reproduce and all human psychology has to start with that. We ate before we prayed. The church knew that and so do moralists of all flavours. They always sought to regulate those two primary impulses because they couldn't ban them.\"</p> <p>Against religious control, Norfolk pits the myth of a pre-lapsarian feast, a saturnalia at whose table everybody \u2013 regardless of class, race, creed or tastes in facial hair \u2013 could take their place. \"At the root of all these pagan rituals is a feast. That legacy has been bizarrely twisted through Christianity. I mean the idea that you cannibalise Christ is a deeply odd idea.\"</p> <p>In <em>The Levels</em>, Norfolk had imagined that pagan ritual feast under threat as the Romans leave Britain. A woman called Bellicca strives to hold on to all the civilising plants and culinary techniques the Romans brought here. \"She escapes the barbarians who rose to power after the Romans. She brings all these plants that the Romans introduced, a sort of Ark of the Mediterranean civilisation, to the head of the valley in Somerset.\"</p> <p>In <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em> this Bellicca provides the deep mythic backdrop to the 17th-century storyline. At the start of the novel, we find English villagers still arguing over the meaning of that myth of a pagan tradition that once thrived in Somerset. Protestant sects take Bellicca to have been a witch banished from Somerset by a Christian hero. Young Saturnall's mother, widely suspected of being a witch thanks to her herbalist skills and mastery of culinary arcana, is the last guardian of this feast and its recipes, and so an outlaw figure. Her bequest to John is to&#xa0;remember the recipes and nurture the feast. Which is why he has to become a cook \u2013 to try to bring a saturnalia to repressed England. The clue is in his surname.</p> <p>Neither of two great 17th-century English thinkers, Milton and Hobbes, is named in this novel but they stalk its pages. The feast Norfolk imagines is a rebuff to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, in which Milton imagines the original place of plenitude and bliss, Eden, as eternally tainted by our desire to eat what we shouldn't. As for Hobbes, who fled civil war into exile and who imagined that in a state of nature human life was nasty, brutish and short, Norfolk argues \"he generalised from his own historical position, which was situated in war. We have a view of the past which is historiographically bent towards the unpleasant. Hobbes's idea is people were killing each other all the time. That's what was reported. Neighbour says hello to neighbour wasn't reported. My idea is to get to the past that was unreported.\"</p> <p>This is what he's always done, Norfolk says, in his historical fictions, to imagine the hitherto unnarrated past. \"I think about the people who didn't win \u2013 the deep background to this book is these people and where they lived.\"</p> <p>Norfolk was born in London in 1963 but moved soon after with his parents to Iraq, where his father was employed as a civil engineer. Most of his father's works, Norfolk said later, were destroyed by allied cruise missiles. They were evacuated to England following the 1967 six-day war. He spent his formative years in the West Country, where <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em> is set. After reading English at Kings College London he did a PhD on John Ashbery's poetry. In 1989, his then girlfriend told him to get an agent. So he accosted one at the London book fair and presented her with a synopsis of <em>Lempri\u00e8re's Dictionary</em>. He might have remained unpublished but for the agent shouting after him \u2013 Norfolk had omitted to write down his name, address and telephone number. <em>Lempri\u00e8re's Dictionary</em> was a hit. \"Literary success is mysterious. A 500-page novel about a dead dictionary writer with no sex? My book sold more than anybody would think. In Germany it was on the bestseller lists for nine months.\"</p> <p>Suddenly, aged 27, he was rich. \"I got this huge wodge of cash and thought I could buy all the things I'd ever wanted. So I sat down to write a list. Number one: posh stereo. Number two: I just stared. I couldn't think of anything else. I didn't want a car or a house so I put it in a bank and went to America.\"</p> <p>So he left London for Chicago, where there was a lab at which his girlfriend, now wife, wanted to work. There he wrote <em>The Pope's Rhinoceros</em>. They returned after three years and started a family. <em>In The Shape of a Boar</em>&#xa0;followed.</p> <p>Can Norfolk imagine writing fiction that involved no research and had no historical setting? \"I can't. I'm interested in the first instance in things that are remote from me.\" What an odd impulse, and yet it's one that, Norfolk discovers again and again, undoes itself as he writes: \"I've begun all my books with the intention of writing about something that has nothing to do with me. As I begin writing, the shadow creeps up behind me and finally engulfs me and I realise that everything I'm writing in the book is autobiographical \u2013 it's all about me! Lempri\u00e8re lived 200 years ago, on Jersey. I somehow managed not to see that he's the same age as me, he moves to London from a rural environment, he writes dictionary entries \u2013 as I was doing at that point.\"</p> <p>The same is true of <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em>, which starts with the young John being bullied by boys from a Protestant sect in his village because they believe his mother to be a witch. Not, you understand, that Norfolk's late mother was a witch. \"I realised that some of these things actually happened to me. I was bullied, ignored and ostracised \u2013 all things that happened to John Saturnall and for similar reasons. I was the smart kid and probably deserved it \u2013 I certainly got it.\"</p> <p>Even writing meticulously about Saturnall's work in the kitchens has an autobiographical dimension. \"When you bake a loaf of bread why put a cross on the top? Well, partly it's to relieve the tension, but also it's art. There's a dimension beyond just function and that's art. I realised I was having this argument with myself about what is this thing called art. It was only apparent to me when I'd more or less finished writing the book.\"</p> <p>Most tellingly of all, Norfolk found he was writing about his relationship with his mother, Shirley Blake, through the storyline of supposed witch and errant son. \"There are many parallels.\" She taught you to cook? \"Yeah, and I put that in the acknowledgments, which is the last thing I wrote. Gruesomely, she was taken ill a month after I wrote that and died soon afterwards.\" The novel's acknowledgments, in fact, pay tribute to many of the women in his life for getting him through the last 12 years \u2013 his agent, his mother, his friend Kate and, no doubt most importantly, his wife \"who scooped me off the kitchen floor and whose faith restored my own\". After I read this to Norfolk, he says: \"There are all these women who sorted me out. Otherwise I'd still be on a kitchen floor \u2013 it's just a matter of which kitchen.\"</p>",
  "<p>The red, sandy mass of the Simpson Desert stretches across 68,100 square miles of Australia's Northern Territory, extending over state borders into Queensland and South Australia. The landscape is relentless. In parallel lines, from north to south, dunes stretch as far as the eye can see \u2013 some of their ridgelines continuing unbroken for 200km, some of their peaks soaring to 40m. There are no maintained roads, no escape routes and, with summer temperatures reaching up to 50C, no second chances for the unprepared. It took Samantha Gash four days to run across it.</p> <p>\"There's a huge sense of space in the Simpson,\" says Gash. \"There were only two turns to be made in the whole 379km route. You can see for miles and that sort of environment puts a lot of things in life into perspective.\"</p> <p>Since 2008, the 27-year-old lawyer has run ultramarathons all over the world (though her epic run across the Simpson was not an organised event). To qualify as an \"ultra\" a race has to be longer than a traditional marathon (26.22 miles), with the most common distances for single-stage races being 31 miles, 50 miles, 62 miles and 100 miles. Multi-stage races take this a step further. In 2010 Gash became the first female \u2013 and the youngest person \u2013 to complete the infamous Four Desert Series, racing 250km in four separate stages across the Atacama, Sahara and Gobi deserts and Antarctica.</p> <p>Another desert race, the Marathon des Sables, a six-day, 243km race across the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco, is considered by some to be the toughest on Earth.</p> <p>\"I just love deserts. Running is a way of exploring the world: that's why I do it,\" says Gash. \"Once you tackle something bigger than you've done before, you break down boundaries and that's so powerful. How can you deny yourself the opportunity to find out how strong you are?\"</p> <p>It's a question people are trying to find their personal answers to with growing fervour, as the bog-standard marathon loses its reputation as the pinnacle of running endeavour.</p> <p>\"I did my first ultra in 1995,\" says Rory Coleman, a performance coach specialising in training people for long-distance races. \"Back then it was a few oddballs looking for a different challenge. Now I think ultras are seen as the new triathlons, and the ultra race scene is exploding.\"</p> <p>Together with his wife \u2013 ultra racer Jen Salter \u2013 Coleman organises events around the UK. \"We had 300 enter our Cardiff ultra this year,\" he says. \"Next year we'll easily have 500.\"</p> <p>Despite the growing interest, the organisation of ultras is still rather disparate, with independent races popping up all over the place, giving the sport a slightly amateurish feel, with camaraderie playing a large part. There's a relatively comprehensive list of global events at <a href=\"http://marathons.ahotu.com/\" title=\"\">marathons.ahotu.com</a>. Some of these, such as the Dukeries 40-miler, which took place in May are billed as a gentle introduction to ultras. Others, such as Whistler's Meet your Maker \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/maple-ridge-resident-wins-first-ever-meet-your-maker/Content?oid=2320636\" title=\"\">held for the first time last week, with the winner finishing in eight hours, 31 minutes</a> \u2013 make no bones about what they are: 50 miles of undulating singletrack alpine terrain. So if you really want to run across the US's national parks, there's an ultra for you. And if you fancy tackling 4,600m of altitude gain in Luxembourg's Little Switzerland, you're in luck this year.</p> <p>\"Running has seen tremendous growth in the past 20 years,\" says Topher Gaylord of Mountain Hardware, an outdoor equipment company that has turned its attention to ultras enthusiastically. \"There's been a tenfold increase in trail events, and the events have seen a massive rise in participation because it's such a natural way to engage with the environment.\"</p> <p>Last weekend Gaylord was one of 2,743 runners who took part in the North Face Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (<a href=\"http://www.ultratrailmb.com/\" title=\"\">ultratrailmb.com</a>) , a single-stage race that begins in Chamonix and takes in 100 miles of Alpine scenery, three countries, 400 summits and almost 10,000m of altitude gain. <a href=\"http://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/2012/09/01/fifth-ultra-trail-du-mont-blanc-victory-for-british-ultrarunner-lizzy-hawker\" title=\"\">It was won&#xa0;by a British runner in 12&#xa0;hours 32 mins.</a> Support is minimal and the elements merciless \u2013 both this year and last&#xa0;the weather was so bad runners ended up covering part of the course as snow fell around them.</p> <p>This epic race, where the looming presence of Mont Blanc is the only constant, has demolished champions. Gaylord, who has entered the event 10 times, says: \"No matter how prepared you are, it's always a challenge and there's never a guaranteed outcome. But it teaches you to be calm. There's not a lot you can do about the elements, so you have to learn to be comfortable with whatever you get.\"</p> <p>Another competitor, Rachael Hutchins, adds: \"It doesn't get more scenic than Chamonix. I remember just before reaching the first checkpoint in the TDS last year (the Traces des Ducs des Savoie \u2013 a subsidiary and slightly shorter event under the UTMB umbrella), I rounded a bend to be faced with the most amazing view of a glacier I've ever seen. It was spectacular.\"</p> <p>Trail-based, or off-road, ultras are becoming the norm, with runners often speaking of the enjoyment of being part of the landscape, of the feeling of adventure. But city-based challenges still have a&#xa0;part to play in this relatively embryonic sport.</p> <p>\"My all-time favourite is the 3100,\" says Abichal Sherrington, editor of Ultrarunning World magazine (<a href=\"http://ultrarunningworld.co.uk/\" title=\"\">ultrarunningworld.co.uk</a>). This is the longest certified foot race in the world, with runners lapping a 0.5488-mile course round an extended city block in Queens, New York City, until they clock up 3,100 miles in 52 days. \"It's as close to heaven as you can get. It's like meditation. You enter a different realm. It's not boring because you're completely focused on that moment, on what's going on inside your body. We live in these tiny worlds with all these boundaries. But there's so much more to life, so much to explore and these races can be key to that.\"</p> <p>While pounding out 100 miles may seem like an activity reserved for elite athletes, competitors generally agree that the opposite is true: ultras are for everyday people, and they're not wired differently. What they share is a desire to push boundaries.</p> <p>\"For me it's definitely a physical test,\" says Hutchins. \"The setting is usually mindblowing and I find it easy to switch off my brain.\"</p> <p>The advice from those in the know is start small and allow yourself to develop a love for the sport and an appreciation of the outdoors, building up your distance slowly.</p> <p>And it seems it isn't just runners who have the opportunity to take their sport to a higher level. Cycling events such as 24 hours of Exposure (<a href=\"http://www.sip-events.co.uk/solo-home.html\" title=\"\">sip-events.co.uk</a>) and the Strathpuffer 24 (<a href=\"http://www.strathpuffer.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">strathpuffer.co.uk</a>|), both UK endurance mountain bike events, are becoming increasingly popular, while the <a href=\"http://www.ultracycling.com/\" title=\"\">Ultramarathon Cycling Association of America</a> lists 116 events taking place this year, compared with 75 in 2011. Stage bike races such as South Africa's 800km <a href=\"http://www.cape-epic.com/\" title=\"\">Cape Epic</a> or the 3,000-mile <a href=\"http://www.raceacrossamerica.org\" title=\"\">road cycling Race Across America</a> offer slightly more challenge for your buck.</p> <p>\"We are absolutely not different from anyone else,\" says Andrew James, who in 2009 broke the record for the UK's <a href=\"http://www.tra-uk.org/ridgeway_challenge.php\" title=\"\">Ridgeway Challenge</a>, running 85 miles in 12\u00bd hours. \"People of all ages and sizes can and always have covered large distances. I'm constantly bewildered by how my body can run so fast for so long.\"</p>",
  "<p>Canada has closed its embassy in Tehran and ordered the expulsion of Iranian diplomats from Ottawa, partly because of the country's backing of the Syrian regime.</p> <p>Canada's foreign affairs minister, John Baird, cited Iran's support for Bashar al-Assad, its disputed nuclear programme and continued human rights violations as reasons behind his country's decision to sever diplomatic ties with Tehran. He said the Canadian government perceived Iran to be \"the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today\". \"Canada has closed its embassy in Iran, effective immediately, and declared personae non gratae all remaining Iranian diplomats in Canada,\" Baird said.</p> <p>All Canadian diplomatic staff had left Iran and Iranian diplomats in Ottawa had five days to leave the country. Canada joins its main allies, the US and the UK, as countries without diplomatic presence in Tehran.</p> <p>\"The Iranian regime is providing increasing military assistance to the Assad regime; it refuses to comply with UN resolutions pertaining to its nuclear programme; it routinely threatens the existence of Israel and engages in racist anti-Semitic rhetoric and incitement to genocide,\" Baird said in the statement published on Canada's government website for foreign affairs and international trade.</p> <p>Ottawa's move comes only a week after Iran attempted to seize upon an international conference in Tehran to claim a diplomatic triumph in defiance of western-led efforts to isolate the regime. To the dismay of Iran, two of its main guests for Tehran's summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi, embarrassed the host by making speeches unwelcome by the regime. Morsi, in particular, stunned Iran, a staunch supporter of Assad, with a plea to the world to back Syrian rebels.</p> <p>Canada is an outspoken critic of Iran's human rights record and has actively pursued the effort to hold Tehran leaders accountable for their right's violations on international platforms in recent years, including through sanctions.</p> <p>Baird said: \"[Iran] is among the world's worst violators of human rights; and it shelters and materially supports terrorist groups, requiring the government of Canada to formally list Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism under the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. Moreover, the Iranian regime has shown blatant disregard for the Vienna convention and its guarantee of protection for diplomatic personnel. Under the circumstances, Canada can no longer maintain a diplomatic presence in Iran.Our diplomats serve Canada as civilians, and their safety is our number one priority.\"</p> <p>Baird appeared to be referring to an incident last November when protesters in the Iranian capital stormed the British embassy in Tehran, ransacking offices and diplomatic residence.</p> <p>Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University in Montreal, said the recent row was the worst crisis in bilateral relations between Tehran and Ottawa for many years.</p> <p>\"I think the closure of Iranian embassy in Ottawa should be seen in the context of concerns by the Canadian government about the Islamic republic's recent activities in its Ottawa mission, including using it to establish wider presence in Canada through a series of ostensibly cultural activities, at universities and other institutes and infiltrating the Iranian diaspora and neutralising opposition to the regime,\" he said.</p> <p>According to latest official figures more than 400,000 Iranians live in Canada. \"There is an significant Iranian diaspora in Canada, we call Toronto, Tehranto, even many regime insiders live here but the majority consists of refugees or migrants,\" said Akhavan.</p> <p>The Canadian embassy in Ankara, Turkey, will provide services to Canadians living in Iran in the absence of Tehran's mission. The Canadian foreign ministry has also upgraded its Iran travel advice, urging all its citizens not to travel to Iran.</p> <p>\"Canadians who have Iranian nationality are warned in particular that the Iranian regime does not recognise the principle of dual nationality,\" it said. \"By doing so, Iran makes it virtually impossible for government of Canada officials to provide consular assistance to Iranian-Canadians in difficulty.\"</p> <p>The frosty relations between the two capitals became even more restrained in 2003 when an Iranian-Canadian photographer, Zahra Kazemi, died while in jail in Iran. Iran said she died of a stroke but Canada insisted she died under torture because of a skull fracture.</p> <p>A number of Iranian-Canadians are currently held behind bars in Iran, including Hamid Ghassemi-Shall who is facing execution after being convicted of espionage, a charge his family say is trumped-up.</p> <p>There was no immediate reaction from Iran in response to Canada's move but Iranian state news agencies reported Baird's statement.</p>",
  "<p>A team of French detectives is to work with British police in the desperate search for clues as to why a British family was murdered along with a passing cyclist on a secluded French hillside.</p> <p>The detectives are to request permission to search the Surrey home of Saad al-Hilli and his wife, Ikbal, and speak to the dead man's brother, Zaid, after claims there may have been a dispute in the family over money.</p> <p>French officials said this was one line of inquiry among others and Zaid has reportedly told police he denies any involvement.</p> <p>More than 48 hours after the Hillis were killed and a 77-year-old woman and a cyclist were gunned down in cold blood with a bullet to each of their heads, French officials revealed they had confirmed the couple's identity by asking their four-year-old daughter, Zeena.</p> <p>In the presence of a French child psychologist, the orphaned girl, who spent eight hours cowering in terror under the body of her mother before being discovered, was shown photographs of her parents from passports found in the car where they were killed.</p> <p>Eric Maillaud, the public prosecutor, said she had responded in \"childish language\" saying: \"Yes, that's my mummy. And that's my daddy.\"</p> <p>The girl also identified a photograph of her older sister, Zainab, aged seven, who was shot, bludgeoned and left for dead near the car, parked in an Alpine beauty spot.</p> <p>Shortly after Zeena was found, French police said the best place for the orphaned girl was \"back with what's left of her family\", and that they had taken a softly-softly approach to questioning her. But British experts expressed surprise that she has not been reunited with a relative or family friend already.</p> <p>Maillaud said the French authorities hoped to hand the child over to relatives said to be waiting to fly to France to collect the child, \"as soon as possible\". \"The girls have to be our first priority,\" he said.</p> <p>Three French detectives flew to London to co-ordinate the inquiry with the British authorities, and a fourth was expected . Maillaud said investigators from both countries were co-operating \"100%\". He added that the relationship between Hilli, a 50-year-old aerospace engineer, and his brother Zaid, and rumours of a dispute over money and a family inheritance were the primary, but not exclusive, line of inquiry for the moment.</p> <p>\"We hope he will be heard as a witness, but that doesn't mean he is suspect number one,\" he said.</p> <p>Maillaud said Zaid had first gone to police to ask about his brother after learning from the TV news he had been murdered in France. \"He was worried and went to make inquiries,\" he said.</p> <p>When reports emerged claiming the brothers had been in dispute over money, Zaid returned to the police to deny there had been any bad feeling between them.</p> <p>\"We were given information from a British police source that there was a conflict between the two brothers. A conflict about money. Now we understand Mr Hilli's brother has said there was no conflict,\" added Maillaud.</p> <p>He said police had found a further 10 cartridges from an automatic pistol following the removal of the family's BMW estate car from the isolated car park at the end of the narrow Route de la Combe d'Ire, bringing the total number of cartridges to 25.</p> <p>He had no idea if there was more than one killer or more than one weapon. \"Was the family targeted? Honestly we don't know. The hypothesis [of a family row] has come out because there appears to have been some legal action between the brothers. But it's still just one line of inquiry because there is also the profession of the victim and even the fact that he was born in Iraq, that might be important,\" said Maillaud.</p> <p>He said the younger girl, who is in hospital under the care of a child psychologist and under armed protection, had been interviewed by detectives in the presence of an English-speaking representative from the British embassy.</p> <p>French police said armed gendarmes were also outside Zainab's room in hospital at Grenoble, changing shifts every four hours. She is still in an induced coma but said to be stable.</p> <p>\"Nothing has been left to chance,\" a gendarme told Le Figaro. \"We would not hesitate to move her even 500km away if we felt that someone could disturb her in any way.\"</p> <p>The paper said two \"softly spoken gendarmes\" who specialised in dealing with traumatised children had questioned Zeena twice on Friday with the help of a translator. Her room has been filled with bright colours, teddy bears and small chairs to \"create an agreeable and comforting environment\", an investigator said.</p> <p>\"It is not a case of conducting traditional questioning, but building up a kind of fluid dialogue in the tone of a conversation without breaks so the child can bring up the event herself without a direct question being asked. But a child of four knows very well what she has heard and experienced.\"</p> <p>The British ambassador, Sir Peter Ricketts, said consular staff were staying with the girl \"round the clock\".</p> <p>Maillaud said: \"Physically she is very well; she is being protected by a gendarme and has a nurse with her. She has been told her family is dead. I don't know how you tell a four-year-old that she will never see her family again, but she knows.\"</p> <p>\"She is only four so what she has been able to tell us is more about the ambiance. She has spoken of hearing noises and cries and told us she was afraid so she hid.</p> <p>\"Our priority now is to get this poor little girl reunited with one of her relatives and back with family members. I understand there are members of the family ready to come to France to get her.\"</p> <p>But Michael Hughesman, who provides post-traumatic psychological support to schools, said universally accepted good child protection practice meant the girl should have been reconciled with a familiar adult she could \"emotionally cling to as an urgent priority\".</p> <p>He added: \"Until the child is reunited with an adult she knows and trusts, she is likely to continue to vividly replay in her head those hours in which her parents were murdered and the eight hours that came afterwards, when she was left alone in the car with the bodies. She is likely to continue to intensely relive those experiences and memories until she finds an attachment figure who can bring her back to some sort of grounded reality.</p> <p>\"The only person who can do that is an adult she has known for a substantial period of time and already trusts. This little girl will be looking for a suitable adult to cling to. It's vital for her recovery process.\"</p> <p>Gordon Milson, a clinical psychologist, agreed: \"She will be stuck in that traumatic situation and living in a distorted reality until she is reunited with people, objects and environments with which she is familiar and with which she feels safe.</p> <p>\"She will be unable to be certain she is safe and the threat is even over until that happens. Her only instinct for finding solace will be with an adult she already knows.\"</p> <p>But Julie Stokes, a consultant clinical psychologist and founder of the childhood bereavement charity Winston's Wish, in London, said the child's age might protect her \"even if something goes drastically wrong [with the way she is treated] in the first few days\".</p> <p>Stokes, who was given an OBE for her work with bereaved children and runs a service at the charity for children whose parents have been murdered, said: \"While older children can become fixated on things that go wrong in the first few days after the traumatic event but the memories of younger children are different.</p> <p>\"Their brains have a natural defence mechanism that protects them from quite a lot of horror. I would be hopeful that this mechanism could protect this child now.\"</p> <p>Investigators are waiting for doctors to let them to question Zainab, who is in an artificially induced coma to aid recovery.</p> <p>\"The elder girl is not in a state to speak and we will have to wait for a go-ahead from the doctors before talking to her. She is a key witness for us, which we know is terrible for her.</p> <p>\"They say seven is the age of reason and we just hope she can give us some descriptions, some details of clothes, colours of skin, anything that could lead us to who killed her parents.\"</p> <p>Surrey police said in a statement: \"This is a tragic incident and at this time our thoughts are with the family and friends of all those involved.</p> <p>\"This is a complex and ongoing investigation being led by the French authorities and Surrey police is providing any assistance possible.</p> <p>\"As part of this, the force is facilitating a visit by French investigators to conduct inquiries in the UK.</p> <p>\"We are unable to confirm any details around the investigation and it is inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.\"</p>",

  "<p>The fiasco at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/londonmetropolitanuniversity\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan</a> is making every university with non-EU students sit up and rub its eyes. While British people of all ethnicities may well be becoming more hawkish on immigration, the proposed clampdown on student visas seems designed to appeal to those whose idea of Britain is not imaginative or comprehensive.</p> <p>Teaching on the master's in creative writing at the University of East Anglia \u2013 which last year won a Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher and Further Education \u2013 I have encountered students from China, Sweden, India and North America. The Man Booker fellowship at UEA has twice been awarded to Canadians. The next two years will see young writers from Brazil, Singapore, Nigeria and the Philippines arrive in Norwich, newly dubbed a Unesco city of literature. A third of the 2012-13 intake will be non-EU.</p> <p>The idea that visas might be denied to these applicants, who have competed with around 250 other candidates for 30 places, is as barmy as a bottle of spiders. Many international creative writing students retain British agents and publishers when they go home. Going beyond creative writing, a recent <a href=\"http://www.oxfordeconomics.com/samples/intexe.pdf\" title=\"\">Oxford Economics case-study of Exeter University</a> showed that every 10 international students support six British jobs.</p> <p>Foreign students add cultural value to their British peers, who need an international outlook. As TS Eliot once put it: \"Uniformity means the obliteration of culture, and \u2026 self-sufficiency means its death by starvation.\" The woman of letters knows this too, no doubt.</p> <p>It's perilous, this cocksure assumption that the UK higher education sector can hold its own financially without foreign students. We're in danger of ensnaring our best export \u2013 education \u2013 in the deadly red tape that the prime minister so abhors.</p> <p>Canada recently resolved to double international student numbers. Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France and Japan all distinguish for policy purposes between foreign students and other migrants. Britain needs to follow through and take university-sponsored students out of its net migration target.</p> <p>Even the Home Office's own analysis indicates that university-sponsored students are no less than 98% visa-compliant, and very likely more. The tiny fraction of fraudulent student visas must be balanced against the huge cost of alienating foreign applications wholesale. And that is happening already. This week, the Times of India reported that Indian students are cancelling applications to UK universities. We just don't seem welcoming any more, despite Olympic bonhomie. This is squarely the fault of a government bent on tearing itself in two. One part stretches our narrow island into the world, adept and flexible and exploratory, seeking trade and influence; the other is chained to the salt-lick of atavistic localism, batting away global opportunities like a cow's tail in June.</p> <p>We need to tool our development and diplomacy policies to meet the causes of migration at source, in partnership with the countries where they occur. Declining paying students will empty Treasury pockets much more quickly than useful initiatives abroad (in all likelihood the applied product of British university research anyway).</p> <p>While most academics have come to accept a market economy in education, the very institutions which enable that idea are now under threat. The proposed visa policy could bring universities crashing down, as if they were birds suddenly given wings of lead.</p> <p>Luckily, there are some wise voices on parliament's business, innovation and skills committee, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/news/overseas-students-and-net-migration-chairs-comments/\" title=\"\">which published a report on the issue</a> this week. It reveals cross-departmental vellication about the Home Office's plans: \"Despite the view of the Home Office, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills appears to be sympathetic to removing overseas students from the government's migration figures.\" The report's conclusions come out strongly in favour of recording overseas students in a separate classification and not counting them against the overall limit on net migration. That would be the right decision, recognising the vital importance of the international student to our economy. <em> </em></p>",
  "<p>In economics, \"competitiveness\" does not describe Barack Obama's insistence on not only being president of the US but also beating his staff at bowling. A rough synonym for productivity, global competitiveness is a broad measure of labour market efficiency: what a nation spends to produce what goods and services.</p> <p>This week, the <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2012-2013/\" title=\"\">World Economic Forum released its ranking</a> of all 144 countries on competitiveness. Again, Switzerland led the pack at No 1. Lo and behold, the UK is in the top 10 \u2013 just after the US \u2013 in eighth place. I'm sorry, but my jaw dropped. My utter incredulity that Britain ranked so highly derives from anecdotal experience, and has no statistical value. Indeed, my bafflement derives from my loo.</p> <p>In the spring of 2011, I noticed a peculiar white speckling around the grouting of the slate floor in our bathroom. Though resembling limescale, the crust was accumulating where no standing water had evaporated; a couple of tiles had started to tilt. (If you don't own a home, you're now bored to death. Readers from the landed gentry just got interested.) A plumber confirmed my fears: water was rising from underneath. We had a leak.</p> <p>I quite fancy our painfully bourgeois slate flooring, so when the plumber first took a sledgehammer to the tile I felt a little sick. As the plumber started to dig, smash went another tile, and another, reminding me of the way I picked at scabs as a kid, the lifting of one dry edge eventually giving way to a gory, sanguinary excavation.</p> <p>But we did not have \"a\" leak. The tub leaked. The sink leaked. The toilet leaked, the mains leaked, the central drain leaked, and so did the shower. The original plumbing job was so shoddy, in such violation of every code and established practice, that even our hip, seen-it-all plumber was impressed. Hired by the previous homeowner in 2003, the plumbers who authored this festive indoor fountain were proud members of Britain's famously efficient workforce.</p> <p>So let's talk about my \"competitiveness\": this tempest in a toilet cost me hundreds of phone calls and emails. While co-ordinating a dozen different companies, I conservatively estimate that six solid weeks of my 2011 work year were lost to my bathroom. I am part of the British labour force, too. I was supposed to be writing a novel.</p> <p>Oh, and once our humble hovel was nearly up and running? The central heating element would no longer fit, which necessitated digging up the newly laid slate floor. The shower entrance wasn't plumb, so the contractor had to special-order a new non-rectangular glass shower door and have it tempered. Doubtless the considerable costs of this incompetence were charged to my insurance company. Heard the term \"farming a claim\"? These guys could have been harvesting wheat in my loo.</p> <p>Now, I do occasionally encounter a British business that delivers what and when, and for exactly the price they promised. But commercial paragons in the UK are rare. If the standard of productivity exemplified by Shriver's bathroom follies ranks eighth in the world, God save those poor bastards in Greece (No 96 \u2013 three ranks below Mongolia).</p> <p>What is it about enterprise in Britain that's so top-heavy, so bureaucratic, and so frequently crap? All you homeowners champing at the bit to take advantage of the proposed relaxation of planning rules for domestic extensions: ask yourself first just how many years of your life you'd be willing to sacrifice for that conservatory. How many emails would you write, how many messages would you leave \u2013 how many missed appointments and botched plaster jobs would you put up with \u2013 just for a sunny place to sit? I suggest, when hiring tradesmen, fly in the Swiss.</p>",
  "<p>You have to bend low to pass through the little door. On the other side it is mysteriously twilight. A glade of trees casts stark shadows in the dusk and among them stands a Chinese woman quietly humming to herself, and to you. For she seems to have been awaiting your arrival.</p> <p>Gradually this woman begins to walk towards you, dry leaves rustling beneath her bare feet. Her eyes catch yours and you can't look away. The effect is transfixing \u2013 the approach, the melodic humming, the building suspense, for what will she do when she reaches you (and what will you do,&#xa0;come to that)? I broke into a smile,&#xa0;she smiled too, but who was leading whom? Face to face, eye to eye, so near and yet so far: it felt as if we were spellbound.</p> <p>I have never experienced an encounter quite like it in a gallery: an encounter that so completely exposed the gulf between two strangers, but also between two foreigners. For how would a Chinese visitor have responded? Should one laugh, speak, embrace this woman with her&#xa0;charismatic smile and her pockets full of handwritten notes? The&#xa0;performance puts you on the spot,&#xa0;irresistibly bringing such questions to mind.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yingmei-art.com/en/aboutme/\" title=\"\">Yingmei Duan</a> is a considerable presence in contemporary Chinese art. She was born in 1969 in the northeastern oil fields and endured the local stigma of a cleft palate until she was an adult. Hers is an art that courts speech without actually speaking, and its eloquence relies upon this poignant muteness. At the Hayward Gallery she is also responsible for the flitting figures in striped pyjamas that hover behind one's shoulder, silently shadowing every move.</p> <p>At the outset, these girls seemed political \u2013 what else? \u2013 with their unnerving scrutiny, breathing down one's neck. I tried in vain to catch mine out by turning very fast, desperate to shake her off. But gradually the pendulum swung and it felt as if she herself was in some sense anxious or afraid. I decided to talk to her, this elusive somnambulist, but by then she had somehow vanished.</p> <p>Almost every work in <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/hayward-gallery-and-visual-arts/tickets/art-of-change-new-directions-from-china-68669\" title=\"\">Art of Change</a> has the force of an encounter. You come upon gigantic beetles and a hyperreal triceratops, the size of life, ogling you with its beady eyes. You come across silkworms working at their subtle task, <a href=\"http://www.shanghartgallery.com/galleryarchive/artists/name/liangshaoji\" title=\"\">cocooning objects </a>with their silvery-white floss. There are games of ping-pong played on weirdly distorted tables and chairs that double as drums. Many of the exhibits are living people.</p> <p>Nine artists are represented with work from the past 30 years. There are installations, videos and many live performances. But if that sounds just like any other Hayward show, be aware&#xa0;that this one feels about as remote from the familiarity of European art as it gets.</p> <p>Indeed, it feels fairly remote, too, from the contemporary Chinese art that has so glutted the market of late that industry insiders regularly talk of burn-out. China was the hit of the Venice Biennale as far back as 1999. Charles Saatchi opened his Chelsea gallery with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/12/art-saatchigallery\" title=\"\">Chinese show</a> in 2008. Chinese collectors, riding high on the economic miracle, bought so much political pop and cynical realism that some Chinese artists were millionaires a decade ago.</p> <p>What makes this show exceptional is that it looks at the art hidden behind all that success; in some cases literally made, or shown, under the ground. There are videos of performances that lasted a day or two before they were closed by the authorities, and work by artists whose shows never opened at all. The art is uniformly strong.</p> <p>But it is also opaque at times. Those Beijing gallery-goers herded into a cage and menaced by a Chinese tiger: does this translate as satirically as one imagines? Those dogs tethered to running machines that rush nowhere on all fours: is this a verbal-visual play on the communist insult \"running dog\"? And what about the <a href=\"http://www.longmarchspace.com/artist/list_14_brief.html;jsessionid=8E28787093FE312C7AA58410173344D8?locale=en_US\" title=\"\">Madein Company</a>, with its political art and its English pun of a title, does that mean exactly the same thing there as it does in London?</p> <p>The opening gallery is a cemetery of tombstones, or rather tombs to stones thrown during protests in China. A woman sits there making grey casts of these political relics; a sign urges you to bring in some of your own. But from where exactly? Some forms of art simply cannot mean the same thing in Britain as they might in China.</p> <p>Much of the work is disorienting \u2013 the maze that turns out to have no entrance, but from which random objects are thrown high in the air (or are they so random?). Madein Company's video of an African child being manipulated through Chinese religious rituals in what looks like a zoo, while a vulture sits by, is unbearably upsetting as it seems to put one in the position of a news photographer in a war zone. It means far more if one knows something about China's political relationship, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/13/china-role-peace-crises-africa\" title=\"\">with Sudan</a>.</p> <p>At one point visitors encounter the proverbial China condensed in one gallery \u2013 tea houses, paddy fields, rosewood furniture. But every cliche is utterly disrupted. The ping-pong table does not function, nobody is drinking tea, and the crops have been genetically&#xa0;modified (by the artist) to exceed all quotas.</p> <p>There is a moment where you suddenly feel you're on familiar ground with the <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10454\" title=\"\">arte povera</a> work of <a href=\"http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/51\" title=\"\">Chen Zhen</a>, his temples, boats and tea houses made of household candles, his mud-coated room in which every single thing from the bicycle to the rice bowl is caked in the stuff, a monochrome shrine to the everyday. But Zhen, who died in 2000, had emigrated to Paris, and there is a strong flavour of the west in his work.</p> <p>But what is most enthralling here is also most strange: the warm, dark gallery in which it is possible not only to see but also to hear silkworms, greatly magnified, eating their way through crisp leaves and apparently coughing very quietly every now and again; a beautiful and meditative piece, but also ineffably comic.</p> <p>Or Xu Zhen's extraordinary falling figure: a woman suspended in freeze-frame on the way down from a great height, arms flailing, with no visible means of support. She has fallen in the blink of an eye, and with the blink of an eye \u2013 her own \u2013 one suddenly comes to understand that this is not a statue at all but a living being. I have no idea how this is achieved, for there are no wires, and no obvious armature for her falling body. But the effect is singularly dramatic.</p> <p>One feels as protective towards her as one felt warmly towards the woman in her enchanted forest. These are unfamiliar feelings for an art gallery, to say the least, but this is a most uncommon show of art.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Paul will be here from 4.30pm. Ish.</strong> In the meantime, take a look at Paul's pre-match thoughts on the blog:</p> <p>For too long the Republic of Ireland have behaved like Stoke City's idiot twin. During his four-year reign Giovanni Trapattoni has ordered Ireland to play like Tony Pulis's team despite having more creativity at his disposal and less power. There have been a few moments when that description didn't fit \u2013 a couple of good friendly wins and, most famously, the draw in Paris in the 2010 World Cup play-off, when Ireland played slickly only for the luck that had enabled them to make it that far to suddenly defect to the French\u2013 but overall Trapattoni's tenure has been characterised by double-barrelled perverseness: the manager persisting with tactics that make Ireland look worse than they actually are, and results contriving to make the manager's tactics appear better than they actually are. Until Euro 2012, that is. There the unsustainable pattern collapsed and Ireland copped three overdue thrashings, leaving Trapattoni's instructions looking as inspired as Clint Eastwood's chat with a chair.</p> <p>Stoke, of course, have given notice that they intend to add more nuance to their playing style, with Pulis recently buying some scheming central midfielders. Trapattoni, aware of the rising despair at his dogmatism, has hinted at a fresh approach too. He even gave a belated first start to James McCarthy during the August friendly in Serbia and the artful Wigan player will make his competitive debut when Ireland kick off their World Cup campaign in Kazakhstan on Friday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/sep/06/giovanni-trapattoni-republic-ireland-change\">Article continues here</a></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong><br>Welcome, shock-seekers. For I assume that you are tuning in because you are hoping to hear tell of either (a) Kazakhstan notching a famous victory that puts them on the football map and shunts Giovanni Trapattoni out the green door or (b) the Republic of Ireland showing hints of unpredictability and variety for the first time under the arch-dogmatist and igniting hope that real change is afoot. The Italian claims he has seen the light after years in the darkness resulted in him guiding the country witlessly into Euro 2012 humiliation, but he has yet to seriously back it up with actions. As mentioned in the blog thing below, the inclusion of James McCarthy is a step forward \u2013 even if it was pretty much forced on the manager by the suspension of Keith Andrews \u2013 and it will be interesting to see to with extent the Wigan youngster is allowed to receive the ball from full-backs, play it to team-mates and even run forward with it from a central position, all of which are enterprises that Trap has generally banned central midfielders from attempting. But several others inclusions, most glaringly those of Robbie Keane and Stephen Ward, plus the usual 4-4-2 formation, suggest the Italian is not truly for turning. The forecast, alas, must be for tepid fare and a 0-0 draw or possibly 0-1 away win.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Teams: </strong><br><strong>Kazakhstan: </strong> Sidelnikov; Kirov, Kislitsyn, Mukhtarov, Nurdauletov, Konysbayev, Bogdanov, Ostapenko, Shmidtgal, Nusserbayev, Rozkhov. <br><strong>Ireland:</strong> Westwood; O'Shea, O'Dea, St Ledger, Ward; Cox, Whelan, McCarthy, McGeady; Keane, Walters</p> <p>Ref: Avram Ionut (Romania)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>4.53pm: The teams totter out on to the plastic pitch, to polite applause from a small crowd and ... combined German and English commentary on the feed I'm following it on: throw in a bit of Italian and we'd have authentic Trapattoni gobbedygook .</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>4.58pm: That Kazakh anthem is magnificent! A booming masterpiece that sounds like it is being propelled to the heavens from the very bowels of the earth, or perhaps a fanatical Laibach fan.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>5.02pm: The German in the gantry appears to have been made walk the plank ... and replaced by a plank, who so far has shared such insights as \"the Republic if Ireland have good fans\" and \"both sides will want to win here\".</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Off we go. From kick-off Ireland work the ball immediately back to Ward, who smashes it 70 yards forward. Behold the brave new dawn!</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> After a bout of kick and rush from IReland, the ball breaks to McCarthy, whose low curling shot from the edge of the area is tipped behind for a corner. There follows another corner as O'Dea header is pushed behind. Walters meets the next one, but his header is deflected behind for yet another corner. This time McGeady's delivery eludes everyone. But the early evidence suggests the home side are hopeless in the air; and Ireland are certainly going to continue trying to exploit that.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> McGeady turns past a dazzled defender on the edge of the area before firing wide.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Kazakhstan have settled at last and, to the excitement of the suddenly very noisy fans, they piece together the first flowing move of the game, comprising up to five passes. There was a shot at the end of it but the camera lens isn't big enough to reveal exactly where it ended up. \"Be fair to the plank,\" blurts Casey Murphy of the 5.02pm comment. \"Reasonable observers might often wonder whether Trappatoni does want to win.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Change? The Irish full-backs are hoofing the ball towards Walters at every opportunity. It's as if McCarthy isn't on the pitch. The Kazakhs are tidier and more imaginative in possession but have so far shown no sign of a cutting edge.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> In all fairness, this is abysmal from Ireland. \"It amazes me that the FAI lets Trappatoni pick the team without being obliged to attend any of his players' club games,\" fumes Justin Kavanagh. \"So it's hardly surprising that he picks the same players over and over. Televised games hide a multitude of weaknesses and failings. Consider a player like Keane, who may miss several games in the MLS, then play against a recently formed club and score handily. How could any coach draw any conclusion from the striker's form or fitness from watching by DVD? This is management by remote control. It strikes me that after the Staunton debacle, the FAI decided that a semi-retired coach doing half the job is their best bet, especially as someone else is paying his wages.\" It's low farce, is what it is.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min: </strong> Kirov raids forward down the left in a way the Irish fullbacks would never be allowed to do. He then combines well with Nusserbayev and the reasonably impressive Ostapenko before Ireland eventually scramble to smother the attack.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> A mistake at the back by Kazakhstan gifts Ireland possession in a dangerous area but McGeady botches two good shooting opportunities.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Keane takes control of the ball in the opposing box, swivels, then shoots into the sidenetting. I didn't see how the chance came about and the TV people have apparently scrapped replays: it's as if they just want to get this match over and done with it as quickly as possible ... \"Am I the only Irish fan who hopes Kazakhstan win?\" Hugh Collins dares to ask. \"In the long run, it may be the best thing for the ireland team. Colemand, McCarthy et al could easily end up just refusing to play for Ireland if this continues.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Westwood hurtles off his line to dive at the feet of Konysbayev as Kazakhstan continue to apply a helter-skelter sort of pressure.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Ireland produce their most intricate piece of play so far and, lo and behold, they create a decent chance. McGeady coolly picked out Cox, who swapped quick passes Keane before firing into the sidenetting.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Trapattoni's strategy for coping with the plastic pitch appears to be to keep the ball in the air as much as possible ...</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> This is brainless stuff from Ireland. Kazakhstan are clearly a weak team but Trapattoni's men are playing to such a frill-free game plan that the hosts are almost comfortable. It would not take much passing and movement to carve this team up, but Ireland's preference is for punts and bluster.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> The keeper comes to try to catch a McGeady freekick from the left and gets just enough of a touch to take it off the head of O'Dea. The ensuing corner comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Kazakhstan make it into Ireland's half for the first time in about five minutes and, after, a couple of dinky passes, Bogdanov's attempted shot is charge down by St Ledger and Whelan.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> O'Shea provides an overlap for the first time in the game and duly receives the ball from McGeady. But his subsequent cross is dross. Elsewhere, Kerzakhov has just hit the post for Russia, who are still 1-0 up against Northern Ireland with 13 minutes to go.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Kazakhstan 1-0 Rep of Ireland (Nuradauletov 37')</strong> <br>Despite the palpable inferiority of the opposition, Ireland have not aspired to do anything more than the most rudimentary tasks of football so far, and now they have failed to meet even that low standard: Nuradauletov was allowed to jump and meet a Shmidtgal frrekick from eight yards and he sent his header into the net.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Cripes! The Kazakhs almost make it two! Ireland are a shambles and after Westwood parried a long shot, a home player rushed on to the rebound and clattered it against the post!</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> The hosts seem buoyed by their goal and playing with extra dynamism: they don't look like giving up their lead as easily as they got it ... and so far Ireland don't look producing anything intelligent enough to get back into the game. If this approach doesn't change, and if McClean and Long don't come on at half-time, it will be an outrage.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Trapattoni has got 10 minutes to abandon decades-old principles. Optimistic?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Green mist</strong> \"I'm with Hugh Collins,\" announces Justin Kavanagh. \"The best thing that could happen is if this pretence at running an international team is exposed tonight by Kazakhstan on the plastic pitch. Workers in the former Soviet Union had a saying 'they pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work'. The Irish players' take on that tonight would be 'he pretends to coach us, and we pretend to play.'\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Unacceptable</strong>, that's what this has been, especially after all the clapTrap about change. It's the stupidity of the approach that is so infuriating: Ireland simply could not have deployed a game plan less likely to expose Kazakhstan's limitations and more likely to hide Ireland's modest but superior skills. In a sense this half has been more dispiriting that then 5-2 defeat to Cyprus that did for Stan Staunton, because rather than disjointed farce, this is organised incompetence.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> NO CHANGES AT HALF-TIME! Change the manager now, I'm saying.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Hooof! O'Shea eschews a pass into midfield to kindly give the ball back to Kazakhstan.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> The first shot of the second half comes in from Nussebayev, who took the ball down on his thigh and then blasted over from 20 yards. Goal kick to Ireland ... and ten seconds later Kazakhstan have the ball back, courtesy of more Trap-pleasing hoofery. This cannot go on!</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> It's the willful dumbness of this performance by Ireland that makes it so outrageous. And it's encouraging the Kazakhs, who are pinging the ball around in a way that Ireland refuse to do and looking marginally the more dangerous of two mostly blunt sides.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> The commentator seems to think Kevin Doyle could be the answer off the bench. And while it's probable that he'd do better than Keane, who has barely touched the ball (and, in fairness, barely been given a pass that he could be reasonably expected to do anything with), Doyle's omission was one Trap decision I agreed with : the Wolves striker has been below par for a while now. Long and McClean would be a much better bet, and Coleman on the right. I only mention this because there has been nothing else to mention in the last few minutes. This is pap.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Ireland substitution:</strong> OK, here comes Doyle. Off goes Cox.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> There is a pause in the game because a Kazakh player is injured. And possibly also because the Irish players have a mutiny to plot? \"I'm sensing you're a bit down on Trap,\" notes canny Simon McMahon. \"But at least you were at Euro 2012. I'm one of I suspect many Scotland fans who would give their right arm for three thrashings at a major finals.\" I said at the time that Ireland were lucky to get to the Euros and such success was unsustainable with Trap's methods.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> OK, the Kazakh has recovered and \"play\" has resumed. I think.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> McGeady, who has probably touched the ball more than any other Irish player, receives an actual pass wide on the left, behind the defender. He could so some damage here ... but he treads on the ball and knocks it out of play, then re-enacts Edvard Munch's scream. A nation does likewise.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> The Kazakh keeper comes to claim another aimless cross. \"You got a bum assignment there, Paul&lt;\" scoffs Victor Bear. \"While you tear off your goatee, watching the Trap kill Irish football one hoofed ball at a time, I'm watching Liechtenstein play Boznia-Herz in a stadium that makes the old Plough Lane look like the Nou Camp. Liechtenstein are very much the Irish of this contest, sitting behind the ball, waiting for the apocalypse. The BH fans are doing the reverse Poznan in the stand, which consists of jumping up and down while actually watching the game (somebody should point this practical adjustment out to the Poznan fans). I think it's still 0-0 after 20 min, but I get distracted every time they show a shot with those magnificent snow-capped Alps in the background.\" Ireland are not sitting behind the ball, they are scurrying underneath it.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Hopeful squeals from the crowd as Nusserbayev tries his luck from 25 yards ... his shot is well-struck, but it fizzes inches wide. And on that note, Nusserbayev is replaced by Jolcheyv. Trapattoni, meanwhile, apparently sees no reason to make any more substitutions yet.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> At last! Another substitution from Ireland and on comes Long. Off goes Walters. But where is McClean?</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Sidelnikov clasps a 30-yard Whelan shot to his chest and, perhaps, stifles a laugh.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>75 min: </strong> Kazakhstan deal easily with a 40-yard freekick sent into their box by Whelan. \"This is horrific,\" screams Paul Rock. \"I'm sitting in Dublin watching this and when I look out the window I see kids playing hurling and rugby in the street. They have no interest in this game. By sticking with Trap, the FAI have set back soccer in Ireland by years. We were never a great nation, but always had a few players in each generation that would encourage kids to play. Trap has killed all love or enjoyment in Irish football. This is a sad day. Also a milestone\u2026.a nadir in our football history.\" But at least we seem to have some wise kids.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> The best chance of the second half so far is created by the only team that has tried to be creative: Jolchev peels of St Ledger and receives a pass into his path, but his Westwood diverts his 16-yard shot behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Lots of bluster around the Kazakh box now, but still no sign of Ireland summoning the wit to penetrate. \"I made the wise decision to not watch the game so am just following your MBM,\" sighs Darragh Thomas. \"I'm not even sure I want us to qualify for Brazil. I love the World Cup anyway, I don't need us to compete in it to enjoy it. I definitely would have enjoyed the Euros more had we not have taken part. There was about 20 of us having a great day in a beer garden, having a great day half watching Spain v Italy. We all pile back to a friends house to watch the Ireland game properly. By half time the mood was absolutely miserable.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> As Sidelnikov comes to claim another long ball, the commentator reckons \"it's just a case of pumping the ball into the box for Ireland at this stage\". Erm, that's all they've been trying to do all game.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> All too easy for Kazakhstan. Simply by keeping their shape and jumping above Ireland's small forwards, they are protecting their lead comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Penalty to Ireland! Rozkhov pushed Keane over to stop him latching on to an error by Mukhtarov.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Kazakhstan 1-1 Ireland (Keane pen 88')</strong> Keane sends the keeper the wrong way, which, regardless of how this match ends, is the direction that Ireland are still heading under Trap.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Kazakhstan 1-2 Ireland (Doyle 89')</strong> A totally undeserved but very well taken winner, courtesy of Doyle, who raced on to a Ward header and thundered a volley into the net from 16 yards. Jamnation once again for Trap.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> Kazakhstan are trying to snatch a late equaliser but they are broken. \"This is the worst thing that could have happened,\" sobs Nilly Murphy, who does not need to elaborate.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Full-time: </strong> Three points is unjustly lavish reward for the one simple-minded idea that guided Ireland through this match. Hats off, at least, to the spirit of the Irish players who at least showed spirit amid the witless assignment given to them by lucky Trap. \"Despite what Trappatoni will say about results, no one Irish will remember this result with any pride, and noone will be able to forget such an abject performance,\" sums up Justin Kavanagh. Right, I'm off to MBM Wales v Belgium, which should prove to be an entirely different sport to what we've just witnessed.</p>",
  "<p>Air Jordans or Blazers is the question. I'm getting dressed for a very important meeting, so I'd better get it right. Which means I'd better go with the bright pink Blazers. (By the way, what I'm referring to here is not a type of jacket, but rather a pair of Nike trainers.) Definitely jeans, that's always a safe bet. No doubt most of my colleagues will be in formal attire for this meeting, so I also prepare myself for the inevitable teasing that's coming my way.</p> <p>When I began my career at a college, management and some colleagues took umbrage to a teacher in trainers, jeans and, sometimes, a baseball cap. At 24, I wasn't in a mid-life crisis, it was just the way I chose to present myself to the world. But to them, an academic was expected to dress differently and comments such as: \"You don't dress like a teacher\", \"Ever considered wearing a tie?\", \"Do you feel trainers are appropriate for a staff meeting (pink ones at that)?\" and \u2013 my personal favourite \u2013 \"Well if you dressed more like a staff member you wouldn't get mistaken for a student\", soon formed the soundtrack to my early teaching career.</p> <p>The reactions from my peers, then as now, have often made me question my attitude to formal dress. Am I just trying to be rebellious? Would a shirt and tie really give me more authority in a classroom?</p> <p>My old headmistress would have thought so. Mrs Bannister had three deputy heads under her (all men incidentally) and, trust me, the students \u2013 and probably most of the members of staff \u2013 thought twice before messing with her. Her vast collection of grey suits were designed for one thing and one thing only: keeping 800 adolescents in check. And it worked, at least for the most part. But I've taken a different approach. Though I sometimes wished my college students would smarten up, I had a great rapport with them and it was built while trading comments on trainers and jeans. My dress sense helped me connect with what was described as a 'hard to reach' class.</p> <p>Do I have to dress like Mrs Bannister to establish my power? Working in a university, I see my role more as that of a facilitator of learning \u2013 so do I still need to have the whole shirt, tie and tweed going on? If not, do the comments I keep getting have more to do then with some concept of tradition? I wonder what it is I am expected to show reverence for: academic tradition or the institution? I value what I do and try and do it to the best of my ability, but I don't have to be formally dressed to be a good academic. What's more, my clothes reflect my working life. As a dual professional (with one foot in academia and the other in the creative industries) jeans and trainers are comfortable and manageable.</p> <p>As I gear up for a new term, I know that building rapport with my students, while being able to establish a sense of authority, will be crucial. Wearing Nikes won't guarantee me instant credibility or respect, nor will it incentivise my students to always come prepared to engage. But the way I dress is a statement about my personality that feeds into my teaching style. Our clothes communicate on our behalf and mine allow me to connect with my class in ways, and at speeds, I could scarcely achieve in my assigned contact hours.</p> <p>Colleagues who teach more traditional subjects, will no doubt gently rib me about my choice of clothing at some point in this academic year. Yet, I know we're on the same page about what we want to achieve in the lecture theatre, and the kind of environment we want to create for all our students. So as I prepare my lectures for the start of term, I will also prepare my wardrobe. No tweed, no corduroys, no elbow patches - just yet. Mortarboards are strictly reserved for graduation. Instead you'll find me in Jordans, Dunks and Air Max \u2013 and forever in jeans.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Lartey is an associate lecturer at <a href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/\">The University of the Arts London</a>, at LCC, in the faculty of media.

  "<p>There is a famous Monty Python sketch called \"Four Yorkshiremen\". It portrays tuxedo-wearing men sipping fine red wine, chomping on cigars and eagerly reminiscing about their impoverished childhoods. The conversation quickly turns into a bizarre arm's race of boasting about humble origins when even living in a hole is seen as the height of luxury. Soon, one man is claiming to have grown up \"in a lake\", prompting one companion to exclaim:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You were lucky to have a lake! There were a hundred and fifty of us living in t' shoebox in t' middle o' road.\"</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xe1a1wHxTyo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xe1a1wHxTyo?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Yet, listening to the endless drum beat of speeches from both the Republican and Democratic conventions in the past week, it seemed they were mimicking the Pythons' finest work. According to their own stories, speaker after speaker detailed their family's rise from poverty to success in the space of a generation or two. In order to praise the powerful myth of the American Dream, both Republicans and Democrats battled to outdo each other with origin stories of deprived woe.</p> <p>Here, for example, is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80348.html\">Rick Santorum, praising the memory of his Italian immigrant coal-mining grandfather</a>. \"My grandfather mined coal until he was 72 years old \u2026 working the mines may not have been the dream he dreamed \u2013 I never dared to ask him \u2013 but I think his answer would have been that America gave him more than he had ever hoped,\" Santorum opined, though surely anyone would hope for more than working in a coal pit until well past 70.</p> <p>But that was just for starters. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80413.html\">Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty could top that</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My dad was a truck driver. My mom was a homemaker. She died when I was 16, and my dad lost his job not long after that.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Wow. That must have been tough. But not as tough as <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/08/30/rubio_obama_trying_ideas_people_came_to_america_to_get_away_from.html\">Florida Senator Marco Rubio's grandfather's experience</a>. \"He was born to a farming family in rural Cuba.

He arrived in Pittsburgh as a teenager with nothing, not a penny,\" he said. Even \u2013 staggeringly \u2013 super-rich Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/30/transcript-mitt-romney-speech-at-rnc/\">joined in</a>. \"My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution,\" Mitt said. \"I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the US government as war refugees.\"</p> <p>Make no mistake, though, this posturing was a thoroughly bipartisan affair. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160574895/transcript-julian-castros-dnc-keynote-address\">Here is new Democratic Hispanic leader Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My grandmother was an orphan \u2026 She never made it past the fourth grade. She had to drop out and start working to help her family. My grandmother spent her whole life working as a maid, a cook and a babysitter, barely scraping by.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Or <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80673.html\">listen to Illinois congressional candidate Tammy Duckworth</a>. \"Mom took in sewing. My 55-year-old dad tried to find work. But at 15, I was the only one with a job \u2013 after school, for minimum wage. Thank God for the food stamps,\" she told the Charlotte gathering. </p> <p>From the famous to the unknown, everyone got in on the act. <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/videos/2012/09/06/scarlett-johansson-addresses-dnc.html\">Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson was not to be denied</a>. \"My father barely made enough to get by. We moved every year, and we finally settled in a housing development for lower middle-income families,\" she said, though that hardly sounds too Dickensian. But <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160578836/transcript-michelle-obamas-convention-speech\">Michelle Obama could make up for that</a>. \"My father was a pump operator at the city water plant, and he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when my brother and I were young,\" she reminisced. </p> <p>It is important to say there is no doubt these stories are true. They are also moving, showing the brave struggles and sacrifices that one generation can make for another, or the sheer obstacles that some individuals have overcome to achieve high office. But in the context of the propaganda jamborees that are modern conventions, they are being used to make a political point: the American Dream came true for me and it can for you, too. Increasingly, however, evidence for the truth of that sentiment is seriously wanting. </p> <p>Despite the heartwarming tales emerging from both sides of the political aisle, social mobility in America is under serious threat. In many ways, if you are to be born poor, you would be better-off being born somewhere else in the developed world than in the United States of America. Your chances of improving your social lot are likely to be better. As <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/class-mobility_b_1676931.html\">Columbia University Professor Howard Steven Friedman writes, about the work of the Economic Mobility Project</a>, the prospects of bettering oneself in the US can be worse than in many other developed countries, even class-ridden Britain. Friedman points out that an American male's income is nearly twice as reliant on his father's background as a Canadian's. Another study showed some 42% of American sons of fathers born in the poorest fifth of society ended up in that fifth themselves. That compares to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/class-mobility_b_1676931.html\">30% in the UK, and a range of 25-28% in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to-rise-from-lower-rungs.html?pagewanted=all\">A separate report</a>, by University of Ottawa Professor Miles Corak in 2006, reviewed 50 mobility studies of nine countries. He, too, ranked the Scandinavian nations and Canada as the most likely to be socially mobile, with the US and the UK bringing up the rear. But just in case you had any doubts, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has also got in on the argument. In his recent book, The Price of Inequality, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/american-dream-myth-joseph-stiglitz-price-inequality-124338674.html\">he writes that America's growing gap between the rich and the rest of us has decreased social mobility</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"America has the least equality of opportunity of any of the advanced industrial economies.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Many believe the nub of America's problem is with the very poor, skewing the figures for the country as a whole. As <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-american-dream-is-now-a-myth-2012-6\">the first graph in this Business Insider story shows</a> the real difference between a socially mobile country, like Denmark, and a less mobile one like the US <em>is</em> with the bottom fifth of society. Elsewhere on the spectrum, countries are much more comparable. Which makes the \"poverty arm's race\" on display in Tampa and Charlotte all the more misleading: if you are really born on the \"wrong side of the tracks\" in today's America, you are much more likely to stay there than end up testifying to a national convention about your remarkable rise out of deprivation.</p> <p>As America's politicians outdid each other to try and show how far they had come, the reality on the ground now is making those journeys longer and far more difficult. Unlike the Monty Python sketch, that is not funny.</p>",
  "<p>The world must look to designate an area twice the size of Argentina as nature reserves, or we will have little chance of establishing enough protected areas for wildlife and fish to stave off a disastrous loss of species, according to an analysis of natural and marine reserves.</p> <p>In the 20 years from 1990 to 2010, the amount of land with protected status rose from 8.8% to 12.7%, while the amount of sea protected was increased from 0.9% to 4%, according to a report by the United Nations environment programme (Unep) and others, published at the World Conservation Congress on Friday.</p> <p>Yet according to international targets adopted in 2010, that proportion must increase to 17% and 10% respectively by the end of this decade. On current rates of progress, this target looks very unlikely to be met. In order to meet the goals \u2013 which some analysts say will not even be enough to prevent rampant species loss \u2013 an area more than twice the size of Argentina would have to be designated on land as reserves, and at sea an area greater than Australia would need to be put under marine protection in order to meet the internationally set targets.</p> <p>The report also concluded that about half of the world's important sites for biodiversity are still unprotected.</p> <p>Julia Marton-Lef\u00e8vre, director-general of the IUCN, which is hosting the conference and co-authored the report, said establishing reserves and other forms of protection was an effective way of conserving species that are under threat. \"Protected areas have contributed significantly to conservation of the world's biodiversity and an increase in their coverage and effectiveness is vital to a thriving planet and communities for the future. These rich natural areas are very important for people, who rely on them for food and clean water, climate regulation and reducing the impacts of natural disasters.\"</p> <p>According to the report, much progress has been made in setting up and governing protected areas. But the wide range of ways of designating nature reserves in different countries, and the difficulty of establishing marine reserves, which often require cross-border cooperation and fraught negotiations over fishing rights, has made it hard to judge how well these initiatives are functioning.</p> <p>Also at the conference, the World Bank's vice president for sustainable development, Rachel Kyte, issued a challenge to conservation groups, calling on them to forge closer links with businesses in order to achieve their aims. Conservation organisations have long been suspicious of businesses, seeing them as more likely to exploit valuable species and habitats for their own gain than to strive to protect them, even if paying lip service to environmental goals. Some are also reluctant to follow the World Bank's lead in attempting to put a value on the natural world, as a way of encouraging governments and the private sector to protect natural resources.</p> <p>But Kyte said that the future for conservation lay in co-operating with the business world, and called on activists to \"get out of their comfort zones\". She said: \"The need for action is overcoming global political sclerosis. Companies working in developing countries are increasingly investing in biodiversity expertise, in community development, environmental restoration and long-term conservation capacity building.\"</p> <p>The two-week conference, held every four years, is expected to have 10,000 visitors. Some of the more controversial subjects to be discussed include the issue of conservation groups such as the IUCN working more closely with, and receiving funding, from businesses.</p>",
  "<p>Ferraris and Swiss watches may be catnip to a certain class of wealthy Chinese consumer. But to the Communist party they are proving a headache, an uncomfortably blatant sign of the wealth some have amassed.</p> <p>There is no shortage of cases. In recent days one official, Yang Dacai, faced scrutiny online for obtaining watches worth tens of thousands of pounds on a salary estimated at about \u00a31,000 a month. That was followed by reports this week that the victim of a fatal Ferrari crash in March had been the son of one of President Hu Jintao's key allies.</p> <p>\"Cases like the Ferrari and Yang cases hurts the regime's legitimacy terribly,\" said Xiaobo Lu, an expert on corruption at Columbia University. \"The government has a huge challenge with the 'trust deficit'.\"</p> <p>At best, such images highlight the growing gulf between China's rich and poor, and the extent to which officials and their families appear to be aligned with the winners. This year sharp-eyed observers drew attention to the designer brands on parade at the annual session of the National People's Congress, the largely rubber-stamp parliament that includes numerous business tycoons, with some dubbing the event Beijing fashion week.</p> <p>At worst, they raise embarrassing questions about corruption and nepotism. \"I can't imagine that an official who is a fanatic when it comes to procuring luxury watches is serving the people wholeheartedly,\" Wang Wenyu, who sparked the Yang storm by posting pictures on Weibo, told the Global Times.</p> <p>Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said consumption that could not be supported on official salaries, combined with behaviour that \"flaunts one's wealth or violates norms \u2026 chip at the credibility of the party, which tends to call for a more austere lifestyle, and undermine popular trust. And when such incidents are aired on the web, they can serve to galvanise public opinion.\"</p> <p>The party's provincial discipline inspection commission was investigating Yang Dacai's assets, an officer told the Global Times. Pictures posted online showed Yang wearing at least five different luxury watches, including, it was claimed, a Vacheron Constantin model worth between 200,000 and 400,000 yuan (\u00a320-40,000).</p> <p>Yang later said the most expensive was a Montblanc worth 35,000 yuan, and said he had bought the watches over the course of a decade using his legitimate income. Shortly after that interview, photos emerged of the Shanxi official wearing six more watches.</p> <p>A blogger using the name Huazong who has pioneered the tracking of expensive timepieces \u2013 evaluating the watches of more than 300 officials last year \u2013 said his work was \"not necessarily a good anti-corruption tool. It can't take the place of the government's anti-corruption organs.</p> <p>\"The key is to make officials' incomes public. Because all officials' incomes are kept in the dark, ordinary people can only guess. They will search about officials with luxury goods as a way to vent their pent-up emotions.\"</p> <p>He said the donning of luxury watches did not prove corruption, but did tell observers something else: \"Chinese officials are not elected, therefore they will not care about their public images.\"</p> <p>In a sign of the subject's sensitivity, Huazong's website was shut down and police summoned him to \"drink tea\", a euphemism for an intimidatory conversation.</p> <p>The government has sought to rein in spending by officials, with orders to eschew luxury cars and expensive banquets. An HSBC report on the luxury sector in China says: \"With challenging economic conditions, high-profile graft cases and rising social tension driven by China's growing wealth divide, there is a risk that corporate gifting may suffer as the government clamps down on conspicuous consumption and gets tough on corruption.\"</p> <p>Lu said the premier, Wen Jiabao, had promised to look into implementing a \"sunshine law\" requiring officials to declare their assets. \"One can only assume there is strong resistance to such tough transparency rules. But without it, people will remain cynical,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>After disappointing results in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/copenhagen\" title=\"\">Copenhagen</a> (2010) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/durban-climate-change-conference-2011\" title=\"\">Durban</a> (2011), the world awaited <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/rio-20-earth-summit\" title=\"\">Rio+20</a> with far less anticipation than we had for the Euro 2012 semi-finals, the successful crossing of Niagara Falls by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/16/nik-wallenda-niagara-tightrope-succeeds\" title=\"\">Nik Wallenda</a>, or the return of <a href=\"http://neverseconds.blogspot.com.es/\" title=\"\">lunch blogger Martha Payne</a>. Sustainable business, like all other business, has been riveted by the electoral politics of Greece and France and the more or less fictional pronouncements of G20 finance ministers. It was never likely that Rio+20 would change anything.</p> <p>We know that the international discourse about sustainability will not reverse decades of inaction, that governments will not likely guide us from economic and environmental disaster into a new world order of hope and quality of life. Our deep cynicism is well founded; we have seen too many pronouncements fail.</p> <p>Yet there is no human who does not prefer to live in hope. No business wants to discount its calculations of the net present value of future income streams by the absence of a future. No political leader wants to see the local impact of economic and environmental decline.</p> <p>How is it that time and again we are unable to achieve what so many of us want? Why can we not achieve an agenda which is likely the only way forward into prosperity?</p> <p>At the recent conference of the <a href=\"http://www.isnie.org/\" title=\"\">International Society of New Institutional Economists</a>, Shi-Ling Hsu presented a paper looking at why we cannot get the answer right. In <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpapers.isnie.org%2Fpaper%2F877.html&amp;ei=C9pJUNPVJYTs0gWmiIDoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuFEb7wn2Ac3bX3khLnV27HaMVbg&amp;sig2=J04PsI31Qqmf2Q68oNHULg\" title=\"\">Physical, Human, and Social Capital as Barriers to Environmental Policy Change</a>, he theorises that \"environmentally harmful products and practices persist because firms and people have so much invested in their persistence\". We lock in unsustainable technologies and ways of life because capital is too expensive to write off without threatening the viability of a firm or a consumer. Oil companies and coal mine operators cannot afford to lose the value of their investments. State-owned enterprises are no less dependent on the value of carbon deposits than are for-profit companies.</p> <p>Fishing villages and logging towns around the world want to maintain their livelihoods which depend on the extraction of decreasingly available stocks. Families who are making large mortgage and loan payments on suburban homes and cars are not easily convinced to leave their commitments and reinvest in housing and transport with a smaller carbon footprint.</p> <p>Hsu suggests that we are locked into our carbon-hungry lives and our extractive livelihoods by specific and pervasive public policies which favour the creation and stability of capital. Grandfathering the use of old technology allows firms and their customers to get by with processes and equipment which are far worse than their replacements. Tax credits for extractive industries slow the movement of our economies into more sustainable industries. Capital gains taxes provide incentives to retain capital long past its \"best before date\" to avoid triggering tax penalties.</p> <p>Too often firms must retain their holdings in assets that unnecessarily deplete natural resources or burn carbon in order to maintain healthy balance sheets. They cannot easily invest in new capital when governments allow them generous tax concessions on outdated technology.</p> <p>We can better align incentives so that business will move out of the status quo and into more sustainable methods. Governments need not continue to support and subsidise outdated industries and processes. Instead, they might identify \"environmentally-stranded capital\" and let it be written down to zero over a relatively short period of time \u2013 if it is taken out of operation forever. If we really want companies to change, we must demand accelerated write-off schedules for investments in coal mines and trawlers.</p> <p>One way forward is through better accounting standards. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/jun/22/rio-20-summit-final-day-live-blog\" title=\"\">GDP+</a>, the UK environment minister's proposal to enter natural resources into a national chart of accounts, had the potential to resolve some of the tension between the desire of business to innovate and capital policies which lock us into old technology. When a nation assigns a value to its natural resources, it may be more likely to drop incentives which encourage resource depletion. Nick Clegg took the proposal to Rio. After appeals by Clegg and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josephstiglitz\" title=\"\">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, the final text of the conference recognised the need for \"broader measures of progress to complement GDP\". It referred the problem to the <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/commission.htm\" title=\"\">UN Statistical Commission</a>.</p> <p>Until our various legislators and regulators reconsider their capital-related policies, we will have fewer financial incentives than we need. Until we stop being rewarded for maintaining old equipment, investments and industries, we have little reason to reinvest or to favour the substantive change which Rio+20 might have brought. Without fixing financial regulations and accounting schemes, we cannot easily fix the earth.</p> <p><em>Alison Kemper teaches management at York University and has worked with the Michael Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School since 2005.

  "<p>When the crowd in the Olympic Stadium started chanting 19-year-old sprinter Jonnie Peacock's name before the final of the men's T44 100m had even begun on Thursday evening, it was clear that something had changed.</p> <p>The Paralympics \u2013 ever the poor relation to the Olympic Games, with less funding, less coverage and less attention \u2013 appeared to have come of age.</p> <p>Now the Paralympics' biggest stars \u2013 the likes of Peacock, Ellie Simmonds, David Weir and Sarah Storey \u2013 can expect something just as desirable as the fame and adulation that has engulfed them, and arguably more necessary: money.</p> <p>Peacock, the boy from Cambridge who as a six-year-old amputee insisted on taking part in the races on school sports day, can now expect serious sponsorship and advertising deals, according to experts.</p> <p>\"These Paralympic Games have been a real changer in commercial terms. We have never quite seen anything like this before,\" said Nigel Currie from sports marketing agency brandRapport. \"Pre-Beijing there was really no consideration of using Paralympic athletes for sponsorship, but after London there are perhaps a dozen stars who would make six-figure earnings in the next 12 months.\"</p> <p>Peacock and swimming star Simmonds \u2013 who has added two golds in London to the pair she won as a 13-year-old in Beijing \u2013 are set to become the highest earning Paralympians in history, with the potential to put the income of stars like Tanni Grey-Thompson in the shade.</p> <p>Simmonds has already been repeatedly described as the \"poster girl\" of these Games, with her face showing up on billboards across the country.</p> <p>And she could expect to earn up to \u00a3500,000 in the next 12 months, up from an estimated \u00a3300,000, according to Currie.</p> <p>The 17-year old signed Games-time deals with London 2012 sponsors such as Adidas, BMW and Cadbury, but after winning gold in the SM6 200m individual medley and 400m freestyle more big companies are likely to be courting the swimmer. \"Ellie also has an endearing character \u2013 as well as being a great athlete she is very likable, which is something advertisers look for,\" said Currie.</p> <p>Peacock could earn a similar amount, he added. \"Although some of the Paralympians are likely to remain UK stars, Jonnie has won a blue-ribbon event that has global recognition, with the opportunity for further rematches,\" he said.</p> <p>More experienced athletes such as cyclist Sarah Storey and wheelchair racer David Weir, who has won the T54 800m, 1500m, 5,000m and still has the marathon to come, could see their earnings rocket on the speaking circuit. \"Weir particularly is moving into Steve Redgrave territory, becoming senior ambassador for the sport,\" said Currie.</p> <p>The Paralympics have demonstrated public appetite for disabled sport, but it will be a challenge to continue feeding the desire, according to Craig Spence, head of communications for the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). \"People get the Paralympics now. It is not just a gathering of disabled people; it's a huge elite sporting event, with the best athletes in the world,\" he said. \"We now have to keep up the noise about future events. We don't just put these guys back in a cupboard and roll them out again in 2016.\"</p> <p>Next year Lyon will host the IPC athletics world championships in July, with the swimming championships in Canada in August.</p> <p>The number of stars that have emerged from these Games may help to keep people interested. \"One man cannot carry a movement,\" Spence said. \"But in these games we have seen a number of superstars come through, and two of those at least \u2013 Jonnie Peacock and Ellie Simmonds \u2013 are only teenagers, with another two or three Games in them.\"</p> <p>For Channel 4 \u2013 the official Paralympic broadcaster \u2013 the Games have been a significant coup. With around 400% more coverage than the BBC dedicated to the Beijing Paralympics, the broadcaster has seen a boost to its \"day-share\" of viewing from around 7% to up to 30% at some points in the day, said Stuart Cosgrove, director of Creative Diversity at Channel 4.</p> <p>\"In the past the Paralympics were always viewed as a parenthesis, the aftermath of the Olympics,\" he said. \"I think this is the first time it has ever really got the attention it deserved.\"</p> <p>The Games have also revealed themselves to be a canny investment for sponsors and advertisers, with 6.3m people tuning in for the T44 100m final, and a high percentage of them belonging to the AB demographic.</p> <p>Channel 4 will have to bid alongside other broadcasters for the rights for Rio 2016, which, Cosgrove said, suddenly looks a lot more attractive. \"We have raised the bar. Suddenly the Paralympics are prime sporting real estate so we will have to get in there and fight for it,\" he said. \"But the idea that the Paralympics can be put back to the edge of sporting endeavour now is unthinkable.\"</p> <p>Public relations expert Mark Borkowski issued a word of caution: although Paralympic stars may find themselves very suddenly in the limelight, the attention could be short-lived.</p> <p>Could they hope to earn as much as their Olympic counterparts while the sun shines? \"Almost certainly not,\" he said. \"And we shouldn't forget that there is a recession going on and endorsement deals are thin on the ground.\"</p> <p>Still, Paralympians could hope for a distinctly more lucrative future than their predecessors, he added. \"There is absolutely a buzz and it is definitely plunderable for the next 18 months,\" he said. \"But whether or not it will continue after that remains to be seen.\"</p>",
  "<p>Leading shares ended the week on a high note on hopes of further central bank action to ease the global economic crisis, but cigarette maker <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> missed out on the rally.</p> <p>As investors moved into riskier assets like mining shares, defensive stocks such as tobacco companies were left on the shelf. But Imperial was also hit by worries about a spate of forthcoming negative news. Analysts at Nomura said Imperial would be hit by the continuing introduction of plain packaging around the world, including in France (7% of its profits), the UK (20%) and Australia (3%). It also said Imperial's second half results could miss City forecasts. To add to the downbeat mood, Societe Generale cut its price target on the company from \u00a328 to \u00a326.50. Its shares finished 82p lower at \u00a322.62 while rival <strong>British American Tobacco</strong> was also unwanted, down 63.5p at 3173.5p.</p> <p>Imperial was one of the biggest fallers in the leading index after commodities trader <strong>Glencore</strong>, which lost 14.3p to 378.05p following news it had raised its offer for mining group <strong>Xstrata</strong>, up 35p at \u00a310.14, at the last minute, in an attempt to appease disgruntled shareholders, in particular the Qataris.</p> <p>Other mining shares moved sharply higher as China's plans for \u00a399bn worth of new infrastructure projects lifted metal prices in the expectation of increased demand for commodities.</p> <p>Russian steelmaker <strong>Evraz</strong>, controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, rose 33.7p to 260.4p while <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 58.5p to 657.5p and <strong>Anglo American</strong> added 27.8p to 338.7p.</p> <p>Banks were boosted by Thursday's bond buying plan unveiled by the European Central Bank, in its latest attempt to aid beleaguered eurozone countries such as Spain and Italy. <strong>Barclays</strong> was 13.35p better at 206.4p while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group </strong>closed 0.815p higher at 37.015p as it sold its business in Uruguay to Banque Heritage, part of its strategy to reduce its international presence.</p> <p>Investors had been anticipating the ECB's proposals all week, and for once they were not disappointed. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong>, up 17.46 points to 5794.80 on the day, has gained more than 80 points since Monday.</p> <p>US jobs figures were the other big event of the week, but fell short of expectations. Non-farm payrolls rose by 96,000 in August, compared to forecasts of around 140,000. But many analysts believed this could now prompt US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to sanction further quantitative easing at its meeting next Wednesday and Thursday, something he had hinted at during the Fed's Jackson Hole gathering a week ago. James Knightly at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote> This puts QE3 firmly back on the agenda at next week's Federal Reserve meeting given the minutes to the previous meeting stated \"many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery\". [The non-farm] report suggests that the economy isn't strengthening so certainly builds the case for QE, perhaps open-ended, as recently suggested by St Louis Fed President, James Bullard. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere power group <strong>SSE</strong> lost 17p to \u00a313.58 after Morgan Stanley cut its price target from 1,210p to 1,170p:</p> <blockquote> We expect disappointment on the speed of a UK power market recovery and thus see little earnings growth before 2015, and dividend cover eroding. <br> SSE has a range of financing options but we still see a risk they are below the credit rating agency thresholds in 2013/14 and 2014/15. Much depends on the evolution of the power market. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Whitbread</strong> added 69p to \u00a322.79 as investors continued to warm to Thursday's better than expected results from the Premier Inn, Costa Coffee and restaurants group. Earlier in the week the company announced it had poached Nicholas Cadbury from components company Premier Farnell to become its new chief executive.</p> <p><strong>Meggitt</strong>, the FTSE 100 business which makes parts for Boeing and Airbus aircraft, climbed 6.2p to 407.3p after analysts at Citigroup said it could be a takeover target, while <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> edged up 0.5p to 361.2p following renewed talk of private equity interest in the retailer.</p> <p><strong>International Airlines Group</strong>, owner of British Airways and Iberia, ended 2.1p higher at 146.7p. Australia's Qantas announced on Thursday it would end its 17-year alliance with the airline, with analysts suggesting IAG could now turn to Qatar Airways as a partner.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, Indonesian coal miner <strong>Bumi</strong>, floated in London last year by financier Nat Rothschild, recovered slightly from recent falls, adding 7p to 275.4p. But it has still lost around a quarter of its value in just under two weeks. Investors have grown increasing worried about the financial health of the Bakrie Group, which owns 30% of the company, as well as trading at Bumi Resources, where it owns 29%. Bumi Resources recently reported a \u00a3203m half year loss amid weaker coal prices, and has debts of around \u00a32.5bn.</p> <p><strong>Britvic</strong> dipped 7p to 356p on profit taking after the drinks group agreed to merge with Irn-Bru maker <strong>AG Barr</strong>, down 13.6p to 468p.

  "<p>The cars screamed around the old woodland setting of the Monza circuit, through the Curva Parabolica and the Variante Ascari, in a noisily theatrical attempt to distract attention from the only topic of conversation; they failed.</p> <p>Should he go or should he stay, to amend the old hit from the Clash, was the only show in town here as Lewis Hamilton's possible switch from McLaren to Mercedes was discussed throughout the paddock with a ferocity that strangely lent the move a greater credence.</p> <p>When the story emerged on Wednesday evening \u2013 or when an old possibility was given fresh impetus through the voice of Eddie Jordan \u2013 it was quickly dismissed as a bargaining gimmick by Hamilton's agents, XIX Entertainment, in order to get a better offer from his current employers. By Friday, though, it had become more plausible, through a combination of Hamilton's moody demeanour and the sheer ubiquity of the debate.</p> <p>But why would Hamilton and his advisors countenance such a move, from an habitually successful team that are second in the constructors' championship to a struggling outfit of underachievers who are fifth?</p> <p>There are a number of reasons. XIX Entertainment may not know much about Formula One but they do understand contracts and there is the chance that they will be able to wring more money from the German team.</p> <p>Then there is the potential for Hamilton, working with a more global name, to further develop himself as a brand \u2013 something that has held an increasing fascination for him in recent years.</p> <p>Remember, people laughed at the notion of David Beckham leaving Real Madrid for LA Galaxy, and Hamilton and Beckham share the same agent. There would be the chance for Hamilton to choose his own sponsors, and avoid the heavy workload that McLaren imposes on its drivers in this area.</p> <p>There will also be an upheaval with the regulations in F1 in 2014, and some suspect that Mercedes will be well placed to exploit these.</p> <p>The attraction of driving for the team was captured by his possible future team-mate Nico Rosberg when he said: \"My perspective is that Mercedes and Ferrari are on one level in terms of the history in F1 and the standing. It's very, very special to drive for the Silver Arrow, and especially to win with a Silver Arrow.\" Rosberg and Hamilton know each other well, dating back to their karting days together at Mercedes.</p> <p>Then \u2013 and this is slightly more complex \u2013 we come to the little matter of love. Rightly or wrongly, the brilliantly gifted but insecure Hamilton feels less than full appreciated in some corners of the Woking-based team. When he was asked, here, whether he felt valued by McLaren, he said, distractedly: \"I don't know.\" He has certainly upset some members of the team by his bizarre and unpredictable behaviour.</p> <p>If McLaren and Hamilton is a stale relationship, a fresh affair with Mercedes carries exciting possibilities and all the blandishments his considerable ego may&#xa0;require.</p> <p>These, then, are the reasons why the febrile chatter going on here ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix is a little more substantial than a silly season story. Hamilton's whole mood suggests a man less than happy with his lot, however wonderful that lot is. \"He looks so unhappy at McLaren \u2013 I think he will go,\" a rival team principal said.</p> <p>But why? Because even when all the reasons given above are taken into account, and added up, they don't amount to a convincing whole. Because he is surely less likely to win more titles at Mercedes than if he remains at McLaren. And titles will bring him all the stardust he craves.</p> <p>Meanwhile, his team-mate, Jenson Button, is convinced Hamilton should stay. He said: \"Moving to another team wouldn't hurt me as much as I think it would hurt him. The most important thing for us in Formula One is to win races. That is what we love. When you cross the finish line first, that is what makes you smile and what gets you emotional after a race.</p> <p>\"Knowing that you are the best in the world on that day, that is what you love. That is one of the main reasons why I moved to McLaren. We might not win the championship every year but every year you have the chance of winning grands prix \u2013 they give you that opportunity with the&#xa0;car.\"</p> <p>But will Hamilton give himself the opportunity to extend a relationship that has lasted for more than half of his 27 years? If he does stay at McLaren, he will have to be totally committed, their team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, warned. \"Ultimately a driver has to drive where he is happy to drive, so the team and I don't want anyone who is not 100% committed to it,\" he said. \"You can't work like that. I've made that clear from the&#xa0;outset.\"</p>",
  "<p>The World Water Week conference in Stockholm put the water-food-energy nexus front and centre in how we as a global community confront water security. More and more we are seeing not just discussion but also action on water scarcity reflecting this nexus thinking.</p> <p>The World Food Programme (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WFP\" title=\"\">@WFP</a>) summed up this nexus approach very simply: \"No Water, No Food Security.\" Population expansion, the rise of the global middle classes and the change in diet that goes hand-in-hand with this increased wealth will place ever greater pressure on our agricultural systems. The OECD (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OECD\" title=\"\">@OECD</a>) reminded us of the scale of that challenge: \"The major user of water is agriculture, facing the challenge of producing almost 50% more food by 2030\".</p> <p>So what are the solutions?</p> <p>Janez Poto\u010dnik (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JanezPotocnikEU\" title=\"\">@JanezPotocnikEU</a>), European commissioner for the environment, pointed to reducing food waste as \"the smartest and most direct route to relieve pressure on water and land resources\", with Conservation International (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConservationOrg\" title=\"\">@ConservationOrg</a>) adding that \"25% of the water we use worldwide is used to grow food that NOBODY eats\". <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNFAO\" title=\"\">@UNFAO</a> reinforced the point: \"the food waste in North America and Europe could feed all of the world hungry 3 times over\". Indeed a lot of food grown never even makes it on to the plate because of poor harvesting techniques and storage, insufficient cooling facilities and wider inadequate infrastructure.</p> <p>Waste must be reduced and not only food waste, but direct water waste too. The US Green Building Council (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGBC\" title=\"\">@USGBC</a>) used World Water Week to remind us that \"If 1% of US homes replaced older toilets w/ an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EPAwatersense\" title=\"\">@EPAwatersense</a> toilet, we'd save enough electricity to power 43K homes for 1 month\". Again, nexus thinking is evident with the link between water and the energy needed to pump it to our homes made clear. In the US, moving, heating and treating water accounts for 13% of all the electricity generated.</p> <p>Water also needs to be conserved in the way in which we grow food. In response to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/twitter-challenge-next-steps-tackling-food-water-issues\" title=\"\">Guardian Sustainable Business' twitter challenge</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/africanscribe\" title=\"\">@africanscribe</a> pointed out that \"Irrigation consumes &gt; 50% of South Africa's water\" calling for \"more investment in rainwater harvesting technology\". Having crunched the numbers for our own business in South Africa, we know that 98.3% of the water used in the making of our products relates to the cultivation of the raw materials. We know that by working with local farmers, on the ground, using tools such as measuring soil moisture, leak detection and irrigation scheduling it is very possible to cut water use and electricity bills with less pumping required. Again, nexus thinking applies.</p> <p>To effect change, the thinking has to be applied at the local level as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfishman\" title=\"\">@cfishman</a> pointed out: \"It's vital to ask: Is there a \"global water crisis\"? My answer: No. We have 1,000 local crises\". Picking up on an International Water Institute (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/IWMI_Water_News\" title=\"\">@IWMI_Water_News</a>) report, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NEPADWater\" title=\"\">@NEPADWater</a> emphasised the need for the local approach, \"Local irrigation linked to food security\", and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vossfoundation\" title=\"\">@VossFoundation</a> highlighted \"Small-scale irrigation could provide a billion-dollar boost to household revenues in Sub-Saharan\". Irrigation, in a sustainable manner, is a vital development too and with \"Over 300 million people living in rural China have no access to safe drinking water\" according to the World Bank (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WBPubs\" title=\"\">@WBPubs</a>), we should not lose sight of this quality.</p> <p>UNICEF (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNICEF\" title=\"\">@UNICEF</a>) underlined the scale of the challenge reminding us that although \"From 1990-2010, &lt;2b gained access to improved sources of drinking #water\", \"783m are still without access\". NGOs, business and governments have to work together to tackle water security. The good news coming from World Water Week is that the evidence of on-the-ground collaboration is growing. Partners are rolling up their sleeves and getting on with it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WWF\" title=\"\">@WWF</a> summed this up well: \"Back to the office after #wwweek. Time to turn all the talk about the \"nexus\" into action\". Or, as Peter Bakker of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wbcsd\" title=\"\">@wbcsd</a>) put it: \"Get your hands&amp;feet dirty\".</p> <p><em>Andy Wales is SVP Sustainable Development at SABMiller</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The Hollywood film-maker <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/10/120910fa_fact_hemon#ixzz25WxpxIOt\" title=\"\">Lana Wachowski has described how she publicly came out as transgender</a> while shooting the Matrix sequels with her brother Andy. \"My biggest fears were all about losing my family,\" Lana (formerly Larry) told the New Yorker magazine. \"Once they accepted me, everything else was a piece of cake.\"</p> <p>Having previously shunned interview requests, Wachowski opened up about her history of gender confusion as the siblings prepared to premiere their latest film \u2013 an adaptation of David Mitchell's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780340822784/cloud-atlas\" title=\"\">Cloud Atlas </a> \u2013 at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/toronto-film-festival-2012\" title=\"\">Toronto film festival</a>. She recalled that, while at school, she was often unsure whether to join the boys' line or the girls' and wound up standing between the two. \"Some part of me figured I was exactly where I belonged,\" Wachowski, 47, told the interviewer, Bosnian-American novelist Aleksandar Hemon. \"Betwixt.\"</p> <p>The Wachowskis made their feature debut with the 1996 thriller Bound before scoring a global success with the 1999 science-fiction blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77528/matrix\" title=\"\">The Matrix</a>. But it was during production on the Matrix sequels, on set in Australia during 2002, that Lana began to struggle. \"For years I couldn't even say the words 'transgender' or 'transexual',\" she said. \"When I began to admit it to myself, I knew I would eventually have to tell my parents and my brother and my sisters. This fact would inject such terror into me that I would not sleep for days.\"</p> <p>Wachowski says that he finally told his mother, \"I'm transgender. I'm a girl\" and has lived as Lana ever since. For his part, brother Andy has said that Lana is \"easier to work with\" than Larry was.</p>",
  "<p>The world is coming to a dramatic end; ice caps are melting, natural resources are being gobbled up by the day and mother nature has humanity under her thumb with flash-flooding, tsunamis and droughts speeding up our rapidly approaching demise. As a concerned citizen, you should be feeling responsible, taking decisive action and doing whatever it takes, no matter what the cost or inconvenience. Standing-by as doomsday approaches is just not an option.</p> <p>Do these warnings of impending disaster engage you as a consumer or inspire you to adopt more sustainable behaviours? The answer is probably, no.</p> <p>As Oliver Balch writes in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/sustainable-living-easy-normal-fun?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">his blog this week</a>, achieving a change in behaviour will not come from this form of hard-line environmental advertising, which only around 10% of consumers buy into. Instead, messages need to be inspiring and perhaps amusing, and most definitely provide easy and fun solutions. Lectures should be banned and clarity and ease are of the essence, writes Balch.</p> <p>This all sounds good in theory but the question is how to do it: how can businesses and governments make sustainable behaviours desirable?</p> <p>There have already been some success stories.</p> <p>In partnership with Oxfam, highstreet retailer M&amp;S has devised \"<a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/Shwop/b/1672188031\" title=\"\">shwopping</a>\", a cross between shopping and swapping. The scheme encourages customers to hand over an old or unwanted piece of clothing whenever they buy a new one. The initiative offers no incentive but with more than 500,000 items donated in the first few months, M&amp;S has clearly tapped into the consumer mindset. The simple nature of the ask and ease at which it can be carried out could be the secret behind its success.</p> <p>Other companies have been shining the spotlight on consumer behaviour as well. Asda has set up a pop up farm for youngsters near its head office to practically educate the next generation on the environment, whilst consumer company Unilever is well know for its behaviour change strategy, <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/news/news/inspiring-sustainable-living.aspx\" title=\"\">Five Levers for Change</a>.</p> <p>While these examples are a step in the right direction, business, governments and citizens still have a mountain to climb.</p> <p>Our live discussion will explore what is needed to make sustainable behaviours fun, easy and normal and how this can be achieved at the scale and pace required. We'll look at how business can help nudge consumers in the right direction, focusing on the role that marketing and communications strategies can play. What products would help make sustainable actions occur naturally, rather than with conscious effort from the consumer, and where do government policy and new frameworks enter the equation?</p> <h2>The Panel</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.scp-centre.org/team/the-cscp-team.html\">Cheryl Hicks</a></strong>, lead sustainable lifestyles, UNEP/ Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Production and Consumption (CSCP)</p> <p><strong>Freya Williams</strong>, director of strategy at OgilvyEarth</p> <p><strong>David Jones</strong>, global CEO at Havas and co-founder of One Young World</p> <p><strong>Professor Fergus Lowe</strong>, professor in psychology at Bangor University and CEO of Food Dudes Health</p> <p><strong>Mark Earls</strong>, author of Herd</p> <p><strong>Stefano Giolito</strong>, director, sustainability at Unilever</p> <p><strong>Dr Mark Cobain</strong>, global new business director at Unilever</p> <p>To debate the topic with our cross sector panel of experts, join us on <strong>Wednesday 12 September 2-4pm (BST)</strong> for this live discussion.

  "<p>Every summer, thousands of music fans from around the world walk up Exhibition Road from South Kensington tube station to the biggest classical music festival in the world: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms\" title=\"\">the BBC Proms</a> at the Royal Albert Hall \u2013 76 concerts culminating in its all-British, flag-waving finale. But with the Last Night of the Proms looming, how does this energy feed into the main 2012/13 music season?</p> <p>The Proms, founded by Robert Newman in 1895, is an eight-week festival of world class music-making that sits rather comfortably in the centre of a summer of festivals. As London's concert halls and opera houses reduce their programming, classical music and opera moves to country houses, city parks, the Edinburgh festival and the Royal Albert Hall, where the Proms took up residency in 1941 after the Queen's Hall was bombed by German planes in the height of the second world war.</p> <p>The Proms receive more coverage then any other classical music venture in the city, with all 76 concerts broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and a further 26 proms broadcast on television, including the famous Last Night, which draws an audience of millions worldwide. But what about the rest of the season? Come late September, will those same audiences be flocking to other concert halls and venues?</p> <p>There's no escaping the fact the Proms offers a totally unique experience: the 'Prommers' pit, filled with excited regulars and newbies alike, offers the best acoustic in the Albert Hall at a mere \u00a35, effectively extinguishing all signs of snobbery you might encounter in the average London concert hall. The \u00a347 top-price ticket, thanks to BBC arts subsidies, also helps to improve access. Musicians often remark on how enjoyable the proms experience is; that a proms audience is somehow special.</p> <p>When Daniel Barenboim addressed one of those audiences on the last night of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/25/daniel-barenboim-boulez-beethoven-proms\" title=\"\">his Beethoven Cycle series this year</a>, the conductor expressed his gratitude to the BBC for giving him the opportunity of performing all the Beethoven symphonies for global ears. \"Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you,\" he told the throng, \"we travel a lot, and there is no country in the world that would do this for music and for culture.\"</p> <p>Barenboim, whose association with London audiences goes back a long way, is right. London is a classical music centre like no other, with more than 10 professional orchestras, two world-class opera companies, 12 concert halls and a season that spans the whole calendar year.</p> <p>This Proms season we have heard some of the world's best orchestra and musicians including Simon Rattle and the Berliner Philharmoniker, Bernard Haitink and the Vienna Philharmonic, Riccardo Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and the aforementioned Barenboim and his West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, as well as their London counterparts. This is talent on a huge scale in a relatively short space of time \u2013 but talent that pays more than a summer visit. Do audiences do the same?</p> <p>\"It is a bit of a myth that the Proms audience disappears in the winter,\" says Nicholas Kenyon, former director of the BBC Proms, now managing director at the <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/music\" title=\"\">Barbican Centre</a>. \"While some Prommers might not attend concerts as often, and you may not get as many audience members on day trips to London, there's actually a lot of overlap between Proms audiences and London concert audiences.\"</p> <p>Some people do travel specifically to see the spectacle of the Proms. When Cameron Carpenter was dining out after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/02/proms-66-67-carpenter-chailly?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">his second Proms appearance this week</a>, a middle-aged Liverpudlian male approached and shook his hand, complimented him warmly on his performance, and went on to say: \"We're from Liverpool and don't travel down here much, but that was amazing!\"</p> <p>Can the Proms, alongside other concert seasons, encourage wider audiences for classical music, not just in London and not just during the summer, but nationwide and all year long? \"At the Barbican we see our wide ranging programme as helping audiences develop their tastes, something that feeds off and complements the Proms,\" says Kenyon, citing his venue's free ticket schemes for 16-25 year olds and concert tickets for as little as \u00a38. \"Audience members in the cheaper seats at the Barbican may not be as visible as Prommers in the Royal Albert Hall arena, but they very much exist!\"</p> <p><em>The Last Night of the Proms is being broadcast live on BBC television and Radio 3 on 8 September from 7.30pm</em></p> <p><em>Paul Guest is a classical music journalist and musician \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/pauljguest\" title=\"\"><em>@pauljguest</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>George Osborne has undertaken a partial U-turn on his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/mar/31/george-osborne-north-sea-tax\" title=\"\">North Sea fiscal regime</a> by unveiling a tax break for oil companies in a bid to halt a major decline in exploration and production which is hitting jobs and investment.</p> <p>Having introduced a supplementary charge to the petroleum revenue tax in the budget last year to fund a cut in road fuel duty, the chancellor announced on Friday that he was now reducing this for older oil and gas fields.</p> <p>The new Brown Field Allowance will shield up to \u00a3500m of income from the charge when firms are boosting production from established oil or gas fields \u2013 potentially cutting their tax bill by \u00a3160m.</p> <p>The move is expected to cost the exchequer \u00a3100m per year initially \u2013 but officials insist the long-term tax revenues will be significantly higher.</p> <p>\"Today's tax allowance is more good news for the North Sea, good news for jobs and good news for the broader economy. It will give companies the incentive to get the most out of older fields, creating jobs and delivering more revenue for taxpayers,\" said Osborne.</p> <p>\"This government has signalled its absolute determination to get more investment in the North Sea, a huge national asset. Just last week, I saw the benefits at a supply chain factory creating many hundreds of jobs in the north-east thanks to government support for North Sea gas which made a major project possible,\" he added.</p> <p>The U-turn comes amid <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/business/north-sea-production-falls-and-looks-set-to-continue-its-decline-1-2395543\" title=\"\">a 19% downturn in UK hydrocarbon production</a>. Half as many exploration wells were drilled last year, compared to 2010, by an industry that is estimated to pay a quarter of all the UK's corporation tax.</p> <p>The offshore industry's lobby group, Oil &amp; Gas UK, welcomed the chancellor's announcement of the new tax relief to encourage investment in older oil and gas fields.</p> <p>\"This is a strong signal of the government's commitment to make the most of the UK's oil and gas resources to the benefit of our energy security, the public purse and jobs,\" said Mike Tholen, the organisation's economics and commercial director.</p> <p>\"Oil &amp; Gas UK is encouraged by the support announced for oil and gas 'brown fields' in the UK which typically have high running costs and are subject to up to 81% tax on production. This initiative will have an immediate impact in that it will help to promote investment and sustain production from many mature fields, enabling more oil and gas to be recovered from them and postponing decommissioning by a number of years.\"</p> <p>Oil &amp; Gas UK believes the move could rapidly lead to a number of new investments amounting to \u00a32bn.</p> <p>John Walker, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, is worried that the tax cut could mean an increase in fuel duty in future.</p> <p>\"The Treasury increased tax on the North Sea oil and gas industry 18 months ago to pay for a cut in fuel duty. Now the chancellor has announced a tax break for the industry,\" Walker said.</p> <p>The environmental movement reacted angrily to the new tax rates.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns Andrew Pendleton said:</p> <p>\"The chancellor should be urgently trying to wean the economy off fossil fuels, not subsidising its addiction.</p> <p>\"Cash-strapped households and businesses have been struggling with the soaring cost of gas and oil for years \u2013 and with experts predicting future price hikes, a long-term approach is needed.</p> <p>\"It's time to stop scraping the bottom of the barrel on energy policy - we should invest in clean British energy from the wind, waves and sun as well as cutting waste to create jobs and give us power we can all afford.\"</p> <p>Tom Pering, an energy analyst at Inenco, described Osborne's move as \"a very small step\".</p> <p>\"Suggestions that this will allow activity to continue for 50 years are mis-placed, as the cost of extracting from almost depleted reservoirs will have long since ceased to be economically viable,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Increased extraction and the creation of jobs in the short term will just use up our own reserves at a faster pace, leading to a bigger energy crunch further down the road.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A long-running attempt to create a multi-billion pound \"powerhouse\" in the global commodities industry took a dramatic turn after an 11th-hour change to the terms of a \u00a356bn deal.</p> <p>The friendly merger between trading group Glencore and mining giant Xstrata was to be voted on at a shareholder meeting in Zug, but an intervention from rich gulf state Qatar put the two companies at loggerheads. Former prime minister Tony Blair has been advising the Qataris.</p> <p>Glencore raised its offer for mining giant Xstrata and pledged to put its own chief executive in charge of the enlarged company instead of his longstanding friend and rival Mick Davis, the Xstrata chief who could now be forced out, having stood <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/31/xstrata-chief-windfall\" title=\"\">to gain \u00a350m in retention packages</a> if the original deal had gone ahead as planned.</p> <p>The last-minute intervention of Blair helped persuade Glencore's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, to raise the terms of his offer for Xstrata, minutes before the shareholder meetings in Switzerland to vote on the original terms.</p> <p>The combined group would be the world's largest producer of zinc, control just under a third of the coal used for power stations and trade wheat, sugar and oil in more than 40 countries around the world, putting it at the centre of the global trade in vital commodities.</p> <p>Friday's drama unfolded after Blair brought together Glasenberg and Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who has taken personal control of negotiations after the gulf state's sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holdings amassed a 12% stake in Xstrata. As the second largest shareholder, Qatar's support is crucial for any deal.</p> <p>Such was the brinkmanship that the boards of both companies, which are listed on the London stock market, were already gathered in Zug even though the deal was expected to be voted down after the Qataris had made clear their opposition to the original terms.</p> <p>Forcing Xstrata to delay the start of its meeting by 10 minutes, Glasenberg proposed higher terms which caused confusion by lacking detail and not being a formal offer under takeover panel rules.</p> <p>But it was far from clear last night that Glasenberg had succeeded in winning the support of the Qataris, particularly if he pressed on with the attempt to put himself in charge of the enlarged company instead of Davis. Glasenberg, arguably the highest profile commodities trader in the world, and Davis, synonymous with the Xstrata mining company, have known each other since their days at Witwatersrand University in South Africa. Glasenberg was originally to have been deputy to Davis, who could now be forced out even though it had previously been argued that lucrative retention packages were needed to ensure that he remained at the helm for the next three years.</p> <p>Under the new proposal Glencore has offered 3.05 of its shares for every Xstrata share \u2013 up from 2.8 \u2013 but still below the 3.25 shares that Qatar had previously insisted was the price at which it would be prepared to back the deal. Glencore was a secretive trading house until it floated on the stock market last year, when it was widely expected to use its 34% stake of Xstrata as the basis for an attempt to take full control of the mining company in a deal <a href=\"ttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/07/glencore-xstrata-confirm-90-billion-merger\" title=\"\">eventually announced in February</a>.</p> <p>Xstrata said the new terms, a premium of 17.6% over Xstrata's share price before the merger was announced, were \"significantly lower than would be expected in a takeover\". Its shares rose 3.5% to 1014p while Glencore fell 3% to 378p.</p> <p>While the City awaited the verdict of Qatar Holdings, other investors made their views known.</p> <p>David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments \u2013 which holds 1.4% of Xstrata and 0.8% of Glencore \u2013 reversed his opposition to the terms. Cumming said: \"We are supportive of the improved terms and the changes to the executive governance arrangements.\"</p> <p>But Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Schroders, remained opposed.</p> <p>\"The Qataris are the kingmakers and it partly depends on what they do \u2026 but it will clearly affect how long we wish to remain an investor in the combined entity if it occurs on these terms,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>\"My gut tells me that Ivan has played this very cleverly \u2026 he's met them halfway, declared this as a takeover and there's no clarity on whether Mick or any of his team are going to be involved,\" he added.</p> <h2>What was Blair's role?</h2> <p>He may not be quite so effective if you're after an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/tony-blair-iraq-war-desmond-tutu\" title=\"\">introduction to Desmond Tutu</a>, but if you want a quick chat with Qatari royalty then Tony Blair's your man. The former prime minister-cum-consultant to the world's billionaires <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/glencore-delay-xstrata-merger-vote\" title=\"\">was the operator who connected Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg with Qatar's PM, Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani</a>, and that little introduction seems to have eradicated an intractable issue that the emirate's sovereign wealth fund had with the commodity trader's bid for Xstrata.</p> <p>This type of financial sorcery does not come cheap but Blair has pulled off the magic before, having acted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/11/court-tony-blair-hotels-bid\" title=\"\">as an intermediary between Irish property investor Patrick McKillen and Sheikh Hamad</a> over a potential \u00a370m hotel investment. His relationship with the Qataris also played a starring role in a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation, where it emerged he persuaded the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/blair-role-in-palestine-contracts-gives-rise-to-conflicts-of-interest\" title=\"\">Israelis to open up radio frequencies allowing Wataniya Mobile</a> (majority owner, Qatari telecoms giant QTEL) to operate in the West Bank.</p> <p>QTEL is also a major client of JP Morgan, which pays Blair around $2m a year. JP Morgan is also Xstrata's lead adviser and allowed its client to accept a lowball bid, until Blair's intervention. It is a novel approach to being an adviser. A third way, some might call it. <strong>Simon Goodley</strong></p>",

He didn't just deliver a great address, he reminded us what political rhetoric can be \u2013 elevating, challenging, informative, respectful to those of us listening, rather than the patronising spew of TV soundbites that passes as oratory these days (we've heard plenty of that this week as well).</p> <p>The spirit of the delegates. They schlepped to Charlotte from all over the country, endured appalling weather, then most of them were told at the last minute they couldn't get into the arena after the larger stadium event was cancelled. And still, after all that, they were singing and chanting and laughing as they filed in to the spill-over room. Now that's dedication.</p> <p>And finally Gabby Giffords. We expect courage in our leaders, and are so often disappointed. Giffords' slightly shuffling walk across the stage, in front of 20,000 delegates and millions more watching on TV, and her delivery of an almost perfect Pledge of Allegiance, was a display of bravery in its purest form. How Americans can watch that, then not rise up as one nation to demand gun control, is beyond me.</p> <h2>Ana Marie Cox</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819912\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The nosebleed-level press seats strategically placed behind the backdrop to the convention podium would be easy to complain about: the lines of sight gave a great view of the black curtains on either side of the stage but you could see neither the speaker nor the giant television projection of the speaker. But Bill Clinton is so good, it hardly mattered. I could see the teleprompter. </p> <p>As the Big Dog waltzed through a thicket of policy points, dropping drawl-inflected catchphrases, the teleprompter stuttered. He gracefully ad-libbed, and the prompter showed in real time the exact degree to which his rhetoric soared without a net. It was a small insight in some ways \u2013 everyone knows Clinton can't stick to a script \u2013 but a big lesson if you compare it to the Eastwood debacle of the week before: there is no amount of acting experience, and extemporizing what to say, that can compensate for knowing what people want to hear.</p> <h2>Gary Younge</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/gary_younge.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My favourite moment was the spunky, rousing and quite eccentric contribution by the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver. Part sermon, part polemic, off-script but on message, he fired up the audience more than any other speaker I saw this week. Theatrical to a fault he called on the audience to persevere against Republican intransigence and support the president in doing the same. Marching on the spot he said: \"Mr President when all hope is gone, hope on!\" he said \"Hope on! It is our hope and faith that moves us to action! It is our hope that instructs us to hope on!\"</p> <h2>Richard Adams</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819914\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/richard_adams.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Adams\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The highlight for me was the difference in tone in Charlotte compared with the Republicans in Tampa \u2013 something that was made clear on the opening day of the DNC.</p> <p>Tuesday's session was packed full of compelling testimony and a realization that the Democrats weren't going to run away from policies on healthcare, equal pay and abortion as they have in the past.</p> <p>While the rescheduled first day in Tampa was a snoozefest, Tuesday in Charlotte had the sight of Cory Booker banging the podium with fervor, Tammy Duckworth walking on stage with two artificial limbs, mute testimony to her service in Iraq, and former Ohio governor Ted Strickland launching into a barnburner, accusing Mitt Romney of \"lying and hiding\" his policies and tax returns. There was the redoubtable Lilly Ledbetter on the fight for equal pay and Maryland governor Martin O'Malley calling Romney unpatriotic, saying \"Swiss bank accounts never built an American bridge.\"</p> <p>And all that was before the night's keynotes from Julian Castro and Michelle Obama.</p> <p>Tuesday's electricity set the stage for Bill Clinton's triumphant speech the following night and gave the DNC an attitude that it never lost.</p> <h2>Adam Gabbatt </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819915\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/19/1334856266547/Adam-Gabbatt-byline-pic-003.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Gabbatt byline pic\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Gabbatt byline pic. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords leading the convention in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance on Thursday was incredibly moving. Giffords, who is still struggling with injuries from when she was shot during a constituency meeting in Tucson last year, was accompanied by close friend and DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz but made her way unaided across the stage, beaming every step of the way. Giffords resigned from Congress in January to focus on her recovery, and was clearly delighted to return to the political arena to deliver the pledge. The pride and passion as she spoke was clear to see, and translated to the crowd, who variously cheered, applauded, and wept.</p> <h2>Ewen MacAskill</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819916\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/21/ewen_macaskill_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Ewen Macaskill\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bill Clinton provided the most memorable moments of either convention. Brilliant, old-fashioned speech, from the days before teleprompters became all-dominant. I have seen him speak lots of times since first hearing him on a rainy night in Belfast in the 1990s, trying to keep the tentative peace talks alive and he did. </p> <p>That night in Belfast was special, but so was his speech in Charlotte. The Obama campaign has been struggling to provide a coherent, consistent message for why voters should re-elect the president: Clinton provided them with one. Ad-libbing for much of the speech, he was able to make detailed policy issues accessible. Towards the end, there was a danger he was starting to lose the crowd, going on a little too long, and just at that point he summed it all up.</p>",
  "<p>It is all about to start again. Some fans will sneer at Scotland's prospects in the World Cup qualifiers, but only because a dogged cynicism is the best way of fending off the troublesome hope that could sneak into Hampden Park. Realism, after all, suggests that Serbia may well be beaten on Saturday.</p> <p>Home advantage could count against opponents who are placed 23rd in the European rankings, three rungs above Scotland. Craig Levein's squad has its merits, but there are some misgivings. Although the players are of reasonable standing, none of those based in England will be taking part in the Champions League unless Darren Fletcher returns to robust health.</p> <p>The Manchester United midfielder had his career halted by ulcerative colitis and has not taken part in a game for club or country since November last&#xa0;year. Fletcher, however, is now back in training and that may be an even greater fillip for Levein than it is for Sir&#xa0;Alex Ferguson.</p> <p>The older of those two managers understands perfectly how gruelling the job can be. Following the death of Jock Stein, the then Aberdeen manager Ferguson was in charge of Scotland at the 1986 World Cup. He collected a single point from the three fixtures, in a goalless draw with Uruguay.</p> <p>Ferguson admitted in his autobiography that an argument with the forward Steve Archibald, who had been left out of the side, distracted him to such an extent that he gave an \"emptily Churchillian\" team talk instead of briefing his men in detail.</p> <p>There is at least a buried consolation within such tales. They are reminders&#xa0;that it is feasible for Scotland to reach&#xa0;the finals of major tournaments, even if the side have failed to do so since the 1998 World Cup&#xa0;in France. The level of performance will still have to leap, considering that Belgium, another rival in Group A, can&#xa0;call on a talent such as Eden Hazard&#xa0;who has no counterpart in Scotland's ranks.</p> <p>The midfielder is now with Chelsea and it is the cosmopolitan nature of the Premier League that makes its matches so lucrative. Scots were once the imported stars, with five of them named Footballer of the Year between 1969 and 1979, even if Dave Mackay had to share the honour with the Englishman Tony Book at the start of that period.</p> <p>Nostalgia should still be shunned. There may have been certain memorable days for Scots, but long stretches of mediocrity were common enough. It is doubtful if the world at large will ever think of any Scotland lineup as one of the great sides. The Wembley Wizards beat England 5-1 in 1928 but when Scotland came back to London two years later there was a 5-2&#xa0;loss for an XI containing five of the men who had cavorted on the previous&#xa0;visit.</p> <p>It is doubtful if Scotland can truly boast of ever having had a great national team. Sustained command is needed before such a claim can be made. Smaller nations will struggle to&#xa0;impose themselves emphatically over&#xa0;a long period. In that context, Scotland should spare a moment to take pride in appearances at the World Cup finals on six out of seven occasions from 1974 to 1998.</p> <p>Scotland have had some wonderful players, ranging from, say, Hughie Gallacher in the 1920s to Kenny Dalglish, even if people used to grumble about the latter's form for his country. Any discrepancy most likely stemmed from the superior talent to be found at Anfield and the rapport he could achieve with Ian Rush.</p> <p>Where Scotland was concerned, Dalglish found himself in a far more taxing environment. It is indisputable that he had some gifted team-mates but there was not much prospect of the lineup taking complete command against the leading nations.</p> <p>Levein has to look further than ever for players. Jordan Rhodes, for instance, was still on Huddersfield Town's books when he scored in a friendly with Australia last month. The English-born player was eligible because he went to school in Scotland.</p> <p>His status has risen since Blackburn Rovers spent \u00a38m on him. Rhodes may&#xa0;have that knack of getting himself a yard clear of his marker at the critical moment. The striker, aiming to feature&#xa0;in the top flight eventually, has&#xa0;a&#xa0;little further to go. The same is true of Scotland. Perhaps they will suit one another.</p>",
  "<p>The news this week that Cristiano Ronaldo, the world's most unwaveringly delighted man, is \"unhappy\" at Real Madrid was, at first, quite hard to digest. It is true that Ronaldo looked if not unhappy then at least magisterially affronted when Barcelona skill-pixie Andr\u00e9s Iniesta was named European player of the year last week, but unhappiness still seems a considerable sideways leap. It is important to remember who we're dealing with here. Philip Larkin once argued convincingly that happiness, in the modern sense of \"a continual emotional orgasm\", doesn't really exist at all: the semi-permanent happiness of people in magazines or of handsome, flinty-eyed men in TV adverts lulled into a state of zen-like vegetative contentment simply by driving along a stretch of deserted A road in a high-spec Japanese saloon car. This kind of tangible, life-styled happiness, Larkin argued, has never truly existed and is in fact a basic human impossibility.</p> <p>But then, Larkin never met Ronaldo, a man who from a distance appears entirely consumed with the business of being almost overwhelmingly pleased with things. A single, nonchalant flare of those rippling, mahogany neck muscles is enough to convey absolute, unshakeable contentment with a life spent either performing arm-waggling feats of playground-football genius or being ferried via fur-lined helicopter from manicurist to masseuse to groupie-thronged penthouse spa while reclining on a herb-encrusted chaise longue dressed in emu-skin bikini underpants and a solid gold top hat.</p> <p>A non-happy, non-triumphant Ronaldo seems not just wrong but baffling. What, in that case, does he think is the point of him? It is a complete dereliction of his basic function. Even the tone and texture of Ronaldo's footballing greatness suggests an indissoluble self-pleasuring certainty. This is a player who each time he receives the ball turns and sprints with a singular abandon that seems to suggests he is being chased not just by the opposition but by everyone in the stadium \u2013 his own team, the referee, both benches \u2013 and it is all he can do to loose off a shot before the entire enflamed, third-rate, sub-Ronaldo world falls upon him in a jealous rage of flying fists and Chinese burns.</p> <p>And yet Ronaldo's unhappiness gained an added thrust with the news later in the week that Cesc F\u00e1bregas is also unhappy. Whatever the collective term is for gaggle of unhappy La Liga superstars \u2013 an open letter of unhappy midfielders, a golfing exile of sullen, freelance goal entertainers \u2013 it seems we have an outbreak on our hands.</p> <p>F\u00e1bregas has, he says, been \"wearing his happy face\", presumably as an additional layer over the top of his furious face after failing to play an entire 90 minutes this season.</p> <p>This dual big-name sadness situation is made all the more surprising by the fact both players moved to their current clubs for reasons connected, above all, with personal happiness. For Ronaldo it was the Iberian lure of Madrid. This was a soul-searcher's transfer, albeit one that pales next to the tear-sodden brouhaha of F\u00e1bregas returning to Barcelona, presented as not so much a transfer as a harmonising of the spheres, the long walk to freedom, a very sad small lonely puppy finally scratching at the back door after eight long years of chasing the wrong station wagon down the freeway and spending its nights mewling at the stars.</p> <p>If Ronaldo's unhappiness is only conceivable as a a very slight disturbance in the corner of his glazed and sealed perfecto-environment, F\u00e1bregas has always in truth had something of the needy ex-girlfriend about him. The sheer overwhelming schmaltz effect of that return to Barcelona always suggested it was likely to be a bit of a disappointment, like the kind of person who goes on about their impending wedding for months, even years, conjuring a sacred ecstasy of flowers and petal strewn first dance routines before, like everyone else who ever made the same commitment, spending a large part of the rest of your life arguing quietly in traffic jams. Of course, the assumption is this is not unhappiness in the way it is understood by the truly miserable, the disenfranchised, or the teenaged. Instead it is a familiar kind of semaphore, a political-economic declaration of future flounce-out capacity, like the Queen placing her handbag on the floor at dinner to indicate she wishes to leave. This is nowthe fashion among superstar players, public unhappiness a form of aggressive, internal marketing, a suggestion that they are already whirling and thrumming on the helipad, an inner ring of dependents and shiny-suited hangers-on scrambling for the lurching undercarriage.</p> <p>In Ronaldo's case some kind of inexplicable pay-rise clog in the Madrid hierarchy has already been fingered as the unhappiness maker, a refusal to provide any advance on his current position as merely the 10th best-paid player in the world. F\u00e1bregas is a more complicated case. He is, let's face it, somehow shaping up as not quite as good as he should be, looking a bit like a Premier League-reared, own-brand version of the incumbent Barcelona real deal, an Aldi Iniesta, a Taste the Difference Xavi. At Arsenal things were so much simpler. He could at least appear elegantly exotic with his \"passing\" and his air of self-possession, an exiled prince, all promise and purpose. Whereas there seems to be an oppressive air of Bar\u00e7a-branded happiness about life at the Camp Nou, a high-visibility familial swank-about, like the rather wearing display-happiness of electioneering America politicians or people on competitive shared family holidays where behind the guffaws and back-slaps everybody secretly hates each other after the first day.</p> <p>And perhaps in F\u00e1bregas's unhappiness there is even some comfort to be taken. It is above all the sense of distance, the disjunct between the captive princes of the elite and those who swoon remotely that seems perhaps the saddest thing about modern football. But unhappiness happens to everyone, even the rich and famous, and it would be a mistake to assume that footballers, as a species, have ever been immune from their own bespoke strain of misery. From the feudal conscription system of early football through to today's gilded Euro superstar imprisoned within the giant clamping headphones of celebrified alienation, perhaps we should stand up in solidarity for the footballer's right to be unhappy. The suspicion is, of course, that this kind of unhappiness may be eminently curable.</p> <p>But while it lasts unhappy Ronaldo and sad Cesc seem not just watchable but oddly likeable too.

  "<p>Proposals for night flights at Heathrow could be back on the agenda after the government said it had told the independent commission into aviation capacity to produce an interim report next year recommending \"immediate actions\".</p> <p>The announcement will help David Cameron deflect claims he is continuing to dither over airport capacity. But the new timetable will reignite controversy over Heathrow well before the 2015 election and has fuelled speculation that night flights, or even dual use of Heathrow runways for both landing and takeoff \u2013 known as \"mixed mode\" \u2013 may be put back on the agenda.</p> <p>Sir Howard Davies, who is leading the inquiry, insisted he was \"genuinely undecided\" and \"logically could not deny\" speculation over any option, but said no one had asked him to examine specific questions about mixed mode, which would bring huge increases in air traffic and noise. He said he would be scrutinising even the government's own forecasts for growing airport demand.</p> <p>The former boss of the Financial Services Authority and the CBI industry group , who resigned as head of the London School of Economics last year, said he believed the key to a successful inquiry was formulating the right questions. He said he would start holding hearings in the spring. According to the announcement from the new transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, his task is \"identifying and recommending to government options for maintaining this country's status as an international hub for aviation\".</p> <p>Davies said he would be recruiting no more than three or four members for the commission, including a \"transport economist, but otherwise you'll probably want people of judgment from a decent balance of backgrounds\". Names would be confirmed within seven to 10 days, he said.</p> <p>The coalition agreement rules out a third runway at Heathrow. But Cameron's removal of Justine Greening from the transport portfolio in this week's cabinet reshuffle, and the apparent shelving of her own planned \"call for evidence\", has been taken by many as a signal that a Conservative U-turn over the building of a third Heathrow runway is in motion \u2013 albeit slowly enough and sufficiently at arm's length to avoid the electoral fallout. Davies's ultimate conclusions will not be delivered until 2015, after the next election.</p> <p>Labour supported expansion at the last election, but proposed the commission to the government a year ago, in part to overcome its own internal difficulties on the issue. Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said Labour would \"engage constructively\".</p> <p>Davies said: \"The issue is the extent to which they are committed to receiving its findings.\"</p> <p>He said he was under no illusions that his findings would dictate policy, and had no assurances. \"It's very clear to me that the government that appointed me is not the one that will receive the report. There is a clear policy for this parliament and they want another \u2013 which could be the same one \u2013 whoever wins the next election.\"</p> <p>Davies will be doing the job part-time, with a \"significant time commitment\" towards the end of 2013, when he must publish the interim report, including \"recommendation(s) for immediate actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next five years \u2013 consistent with credible long-term options\".</p> <p>No 10 did not rule out night flights, but seemed to suggest that a short runway at Heathrow, one of the short-term solutions proposed by advocates of extra aviation capacity, could not be considered as being within these terms of reference.</p> <p>In reality, more night flights would lead to an outcry before a general election, and would be fiercely opposed by two prominent south-west London Liberal Democrat MPs: Vince Cable, the business secretary and Ed Davey, the energy secretary.</p> <p>It is said that mixed mode could allow 120,000 extra aircraft movements a year at Europe's busiest airport, but Heathrow's owners, BAA, and figures such as Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways' parent company, IAG, have accepted that it would be too controversial with local residents to pursue.</p> <p>Given the difficulties associated with all the options, especially at Heathrow, the interim report may prove a bigger flashpoint than the eventual findings if the government commits itself to immediate action.</p> <p>Davies insisted he had an open mind over the need for additional capacity. \"That's not simply just tactical \u2013 I'm genuinely not decided. I'm very interested because I use airports a lot, I honestly have not got a settled view on any of it.\"</p> <p>He warned: \"The point is to have a very clear idea of what the demand is going to be. On the need for airport capacity, and how reliable those forecasts are, I'm going to take myself right back into all of that.\"</p> <p>McLoughlin acknowledged the debate was difficult. \"But the reality is that since the 1960s Britain has failed to keep pace with our international competitors in addressing long-term aviation capacity and connectivity needs.</p> <p>\"The government believes that maintaining the UK's status as a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long-term international competitiveness.</p> <p>\"But the government is also mindful of the need to take full account of the social, environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport capacity.\"</p> <p>The commission will also look at possible expansion at two other major London airports \u2013 Gatwick and Stansted.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Richmond MP, Zac Goldsmith, has stepped up his criticism. Writing for the Guardian, he said that \"the government appears to have been seduced by vested interest\" and warned that building another runway at Heathrow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/07/third-runway-heathrow-betrayal?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">\"would represent an off-the-scale betrayal\"</a>.</p> <p>He said the creation of the commission had \"only one explanation: the government believes it can press on with a third runway, and without fronting up to the electorate\".</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister believes we face a crisis over aviation capacity in London. As a result, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/heathrow-battle-third-runway-ministers\" title=\"\">he has put Heathrow's third runway back into the mix</a>. Given the \"no ifs, no buts\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2012/sep/05/heathrow-third-runway-david-cameron-video\" title=\"\">pledge he made</a> before the election, it's a major leap. Combined with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/04/andrew-mitchell-justine-greening-uk-development\" title=\"\">removal of the well-respected transport secretary, Justine Greening,</a> and the equally respected aviation minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/theresavilliers\" title=\"\">Theresa Villiers</a>, both of whom resolutely defended the government's stated opposition to Heathrow expansion, all this points to an imminent U-turn.</p> <p>Why else would the government have announced (yet another) aviation review that will not report until the summer of 2015? After all, if we face a crisis of undercapacity, it is surely odd that the only policy we have in place is an absolute commitment to do nothing for three years. There is only one explanation: the government believes it can press on with a third runway, and without fronting up to the electorate.</p> <p>This matters for countless reasons. First, political promises need to mean something. As William Hague has said, there's no justification in U-turns unless the facts change significantly, which they have not. If there is a pre-election U-turn, my colleagues will struggle at the next election to persuade voters that their manifesto is worth the paper it's written on.</p> <p>I don't actually believe we will see bulldozers this side of the election. That would represent an off-the-scale betrayal, and would be noted by voters everywhere. It would also be logistically difficult to pull off. But unless the government is clear with voters it will be assumed that it is wedded to a post-election green light.</p> <p>A decision to expand would be the wrong decision, on every level. Despite the scaremongering, it remains a fact that Heathrow already has more flights to business destinations than any other airport in Europe. More passengers fly in and out of London than any other city in the world. We are well-connected, we have ample capacity, and we are starting from a position of strength. The problem is that we don't use that capacity well. If we want to preserve Heathrow's hub status, we need to stop clogging it up with point-to-point flights to places such as Cyprus and Greece, which between them account for 87 weekly flights, and contribute nothing to overall connectivity.</p> <p>We also need to discourage operators guarding their slots by flying half-empty planes. Heathrow has terminal capacity for an extra 20 million passengers, and with fuller and, in places, bigger planes, we'd be able to accommodate many more. In addition, we need to encourage a shift from air to rail wherever possible. Every week, for example, there are more than 300 flights from Heathrow Brussels, Manchester, Newcastle and Paris. In time, a better high speed rail network will help.</p> <p>These measures would relieve pressure on Heathrow, but by improving links to other airports, we can do more. For example, Stansted is massively underused, by nearly 50%, and with proper rail links to the City, it would be the natural place for business flights. There is no reason why we couldn't facilitate a two-hub approach, with Heathrow catering (broadly speaking) for western-facing flights, and Stansted catering for eastern business flights.</p> <p>It has been argued that these measures are inconvenient and complicated. But subjecting 2 million residents to aerial bombardment is far more inconvenient. And making room on London's roads for an extra 25 million road passenger journeys to and from Heathrow is far more complicated.</p> <p>Always on the look out for the quick answer, the government appears to have been seduced by vested interest. But it will pay a high price if it opts for the deeply unfair, and unpopular non-solution that Heathrow expansion represents.</p>",
  "<p>The US economy added just 96,000 new jobs in August, far below economists' expectations and dealing a crushing blow to President Barack Obama after the close of the Democratic national convention.</p> <p>The numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came after a positive independent report had stoked expectations that August might have been a good month for US jobs. In July the US added 163,000 jobs and economists expected that figure to be about 125,000 in August.</p> <p>In fact, the numbers were much worse that predicted, and ensured the would be no post-convention glow for Obama. While the unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.1%, it has remained above 8% for three years, a figure unseen since the Great Depression. In any case, the rate only fell because fewer unemployed people were looking for work.</p> <p>Obama, who was aware of the numbers when he spoke in Charlotte on Thursday night, promised that things would improve. \"America, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won't promise that now,\" he said. \"Yes our path is harder, but it leads to a better place. Yes, our road is longer, but we travel it together.\"</p> <p>Mitt Romney wasted no time in claiming political advantage. He said in a statement: \"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover. For every net new job created, nearly four Americans gave up looking for work entirely.\"</p> <p>He said that Obama had failed to live up to his promises and pushed home the message that the US is not better off than it was four years ago. Promising to create 12m new jobs by the end of his first term, he said: \"America deserves new leadership that will get our economy moving again.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week an independent survey from payroll specialist ADP showed private employers hired 201,000 people last month, the most in five months. raising expectations that the numbers would not be so bad.</p> <p>But in fact, they were worse even than they first appeared. The headline payroll increase of 96,000 is below population growth, and the figures for July and June were revised downwards.</p> <p>The report puts the spotlight back on the Federal Reserve: last week Fed chairman Ben Bernanke made clear the fragile jobs market remained a \"grave concern\", in a speech that raised expectations for a further easing of monetary policy.</p> <p>The US economy has added jobs every month since September 2010. But after a winter that was better than expected, the hiring rate cooled significantly over the last three months to an average of 105,000. Between January and March, the figure was 226,000.</p> <p>Economists blame the slowdown on Europe's continuing economic woes and US worries over the so-called fiscal cliff, the expiration of Bush era tax cuts and imposition of draconian spending cuts at the end of the year unless political compromise can be made in Washington.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG said the details of the report were even worse than the headline numbers. The unemployment rate fell because there were less people in total in the jobs market. The \"participation rate\" fell to a 30 year low of 63.5%.</p> <p>\"As negatively as people will take the headline number, the earnings data is even worse. Average hourly earnings were flat in the month as the year on year rate fell to 1.7%. While this is unchanged from the prior month, it remains at extraordinarily low levels and has been low since early 2010,\" Greenhaus wrote in a note to clients.</p> <p>\"Additionally, hours worked fell by one tenth. Again, this doesn't get nearly the attention the headline number does but declines in this category are also most unwelcome. Each tenth decline is the income equivalent of losing a few hundred thousand jobs.\"</p> <p>Gus Faucher, senior economist with PNC Financial Services, said it now looked increasingly likely that the Fed will act after its meeting next Wednesday and Thursday.</p> <p>\"There's not much to like in this report,\" said Faucher. Estimates for jobs growth for the previous two months were cut back by 41,000 jobs and there were signs that growth in temporary employment \u2013 a leading indicator for recovery in the jobs market \u2013 was slowing, he said.</p> <p>\"The demand just isn't there. People are worried about Europe, the fiscal cliff, the election, no one wants to open their pocketbooks,\" said Faucher.</p> <p>In a speech last week Bernanke described the current economic situation as \"far from satisfactory\" and said high rates of unemployment threatened to \"wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years\".</p>",

Nathan Matias</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.media.mit.edu/\">MIT media lab</a> and data scientist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lynn-cherny\">Lynn Cherny</a> to collect what is to our knowledge, the most comprehensive, high resolution dataset available on news content by gender and audience interest.</p> <p><strong>Why gather this data?</strong> <br>There is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/dec/06/women-representation-media\">evidence</a> that women's byline counts are consistently lower than mens throughout the UK national press. With a similar <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/31/men-rule-media-coverage-of-women-s-news.html\">situation</a> being observed in the US. </p> <p>It's not clear if this situation is related to audience demand or behavior in the newsroom. To give some idea of how newsrooms function the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/janemartinson\">Jane Martinson</a> makes the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/may/31/female-newspaper-editors\">important observation</a> that : Dawn Neesom is now the only female editor of a national newspaper in the UK. Exploring the subtle relationships between supply and demand is a good position to start to talk about how this inequality could change. </p> <p>Over the coming weeks we will be exploring a unique database of every article published by the Guardian, Telegraph, and Daily Mail in the year from July 2011 to June 2012. This was an active and varied time for news including the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots\">UK riots</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking</a> coverage. </p> <p>To give us a deeper understanding we have automatically tagged the articles with the date of publication, section, gender of author, and social popularity data from Twitter, Facebook and Google+.</p> <p><strong>How have we gathered this data?</strong><br>In the past, to measure gender in the news, researchers have counted articles by hand. In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/dec/06/women-representation-media#\">this study</a> Kira Cochrane and a group of researchers went through seven daily newspapers, for almost a month, counting and recording the number of male and female writers. </p> <p>To take the pain out of this process and to gather larger samples with richer background information, we have turned our attention to online news. </p> <p>We used the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform\">Guardian OpenPlatform</a> to download a complete copy of the Guardian online, and Matias scraped the archives of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/sitemaparchive/index.html\">Daily Mail</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/\">Telegraph</a>. </p> <p>To identify the gender we used the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/apr/25/baby-names-data\">database of baby names</a> collated by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/anna-powell-smith\">Anna Powell Smith</a> from the Office for National Statistics <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/all-releases.html?definition=tcm%3A77-28486\">data</a>. </p> <p>Using this database Matias' software classifies articles by byline as: male, female, mixed, or unknown. Most articles with unknown gender come from the newswires with a byline of \"the associated press\" or \"press association.\" A much smaller number include ambiguous names or names which aren't in the UK birth statistics. \"Unknown\" also includes a very small number of articles with empty bylines.</p> <p>A universally available measure of the popularity of the articles is the number of \"shares\" on Facebook, Twitter and Google+. This is just one measure of the impact and influence of news - by no means to only one. To get the shares we used the open source <a href=\"https://github.com/openNews/amo\">Amo software</a> by Knight-Mozilla Fellow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theCole\">Cole Gillespie</a>. Amo can fetch all of the Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ sharing information for any web address. Using this data, we can draw conclusions about the reach of women's voices and the nature of audience demand associated with each news organisations.</p> <p><strong>An introduction to our data</strong><br>In this, our first post, here is an overview of the number of articles published by each newspaper from July 2011 to June 2012: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdDFqXzZFTEUzUms1ZTVVaUVDQWNIR0E&transpose=0&headers=1&range=B1%3AF4&gid=8&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"title\":\"Number of articles\",\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"title\":\"Gender in 3 Major UK Newspapers: July 2011 - June 2012\",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"animation\":{\"duration\":0},\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},\"isStacked\":true,\"width\":460,\"height\":276},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart3\"} </script> </figure>  <p>You can see the Guardian is publishing more and the gender is more regularly defined. The Daily Mail journalists frequently use \"DAILY MAIL REPORTER\" for a byline which means we are being careful when comparing data. </p> <p>Looking closer at just the opinion articles we can see the following:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395816045\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347016532183/Gender-media-008.jpg\" alt=\"Gender-media\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">gender in the media Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Opinion sections can shape a society's opinions and therefore are an important measure of women's voices in society. In his <a href=\"http://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/data-science-for-gender-equality-monitoring-womens-voices-in-the-news\">preliminary analysis </a>Matias notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>We have found women are more prominent in UK opinion pages than they are in American newspapers. According to Taryn Yaeger of the Op Ed Project, <a href=\"http://theopedproject.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/the-byline-survey-2011/\">women write 20% of op eds in America's newspapers</a>. Across the UK papers we studied, the rate is 26%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's our data showing for each newspaper the gender balance of the writers and a first look at the social networks sharing data.

  "<p>If you go down to the woods today, you'd better look out for loud youths dressed as superheroes, and a punk band, and strange, yeti-like creatures humping the trees. The Berlin-based director and choreographer <a href=\"http://www.dorkypark.org/\" title=\"\">Constanza Macras</a> is, by her own admission, \"not an outdoor person\". But this bizarre promenade experience, presented by the <a href=\"http://nationaltheatrewales.org/\" title=\"\">National Theatre of Wales</a>, brings her usually urban physical theatre company, DorkyPark, to <a href=\"http://www.flintshire.gov.uk/wps/wcm/connect/8e192d8049bc6b8ebf59bf85099857e3/Wepre_Park_Booklet.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\" title=\"\">Wepre Park</a>, one of north Wales's most evocative ancient forests. Macras's piece is inspired by the two elements of Welsh culture that struck her most forcefully: the <a href=\"http://www.mabinogion.info/\" title=\"\">Mabinogion</a>, an epic, medieval collection of Celtic mythology; and the hen parties that pour out on to the streets of Cardiff every weekend.</p> <p>You could make a case for combining the two, as both contain grisly episodes concerning the fate of a stag. But Macras rather confusingly adds to the mix a series of lectures concerning the career of the 18th-century economist <a href=\"http://www.mapforum.com/05/law.htm\" title=\"\">John Law</a>, the progenitor of the Mississippi bubble that almost bankrupted France. It climaxes in the lofty ruins of <a href=\"http://www.greatcastlesofwales.co.uk/ewloe.htm\" title=\"\">Ewloe Castle</a>, where the ensemble sing a madrigal and have a punch-up.</p> <p>As a comment on the global economic situation, alas, it feels risibly simplistic, and the experience can be trying on your patience \u2013 not to mention your feet. There's far too much time allocated to peering at interpretative dancing through the undergrowth, and when someone pronounces the dread words: \"We're going to have a bit of a workshop, so I need some volunteers,\" \u2013 all part of the finished show, it seems \u2013 you search in vain for a shortcut.</p> <p>It does have its moments, particularly as the light fades when you're obliged to pick your way around with a torch, and Macras's ensemble presents some surreal encounters. But the overall impression is of a long time spent stumbling around in the dark.</p> <p>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Over the last few months, it has been hard not to pay attention to the continuing debates, worries and speculations of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/cookies-and-web-tracking\" title=\"\">European cookie directive</a>. No matter what side of the issue you're on, one thing is for certain: it is now in effect.</p> <p>Internet advertising companies must disclose whenever they use cookies to deliver targeted advertising. European publishers are making changes quickly, <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/9990-the-bbc-unveils-its-eu-cookie-law-solution\" title=\"\">as evidenced by Econsultancy's roundup</a> of how sites such as the BBC and The Guardian are alerting visitors about the use of cookies. My clients talk about this issue daily, as they refocus their efforts on finding alternatives.</p> <p>I can't help but notice these conversations are missing something. There are more ways to find and target audiences than just using cookies, and many data types have existed for years. We've spent a lot of time and energy concerned about not being able to drive the Mercedes, when there's a BMW parked in the driveway next to it. Namely, I'm speaking of page-level targeting. If one of the aspects we love about user-targeting is the deep connection to the audience, you can satisfy this need without the use of cookies.</p> <p>In fact, the majority of targeted audience data providers gather information about the user based on the content of a site or page they are viewing. By targeting the page content itself, you actually have a more direct path to the user. To illustrate the point, let's say you're looking to reach consumers interested in technology and gadgets. You can use audience targeting to serve one-to-one messaging to a consumer who read an article related to technology 10 days previously, however, your reach will be limited to your ability to find that audience.</p> <p>Using page-level data, you can target 350 million people reading about technology and gadgets in a brand-safe environment, at that very moment, by buying only those relevant impressions in a real-time bidding exchange platform.</p> <p>That brings us to another strong aspect of page-level data. It has unparalleled scale, because it's consistently available on each and every impression. Every page is about something. This consistent variable also offers true apples-to-apples comparison of pages that lets buyers evaluate impressions more accurately and appropriately than ever before.</p> <p>Marrying ads contextually to relevant page-level environments is really the goal of any display campaign \u2013 it's why an advertiser would consider making a direct buy in the first place. It may be too soon to predict the direction of cookie targeting globally, but we can all agree that consumer awareness is at an all-time high.</p> <p>Industry self-regulation efforts and browser plug-ins such as <a href=\"http://www.ghostery.com/\" title=\"\">Ghostery</a> make it easier for consumers to identify that they are being targeted. I doubt the US will ever follow the EU entirely, but it's important to remember that the internet audience is a global one, and advertisers need to consider strategies to reach consumers in all markets. Audience targeting is a great tool, but it shouldn't be the only tool in an advertiser's strategy. Page-level targeting offers a scaleable and cost effective way to reach your desired audience in a world where cookies are limited.</p> <p><em>Stephen Graziano is director, </em><a href=\"http://www.peer39.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Peer39</em></a><em> business development at </em><a href=\"http://www.mediamind.com/\" title=\"\"><em>MediaMind</em></a><em>.

The report was launched last night at a debate (see the Twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%23kfchange&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">#kfchange</a>). On the King's Fund blog, Chris Ham asks <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/transforming_health.html\" title=\"\">can the chrysalis become a butterfly?</a> He writes: <br>Prevention and public health have not received the same attention as treatment, and progress in fully engaging communities in adopting healthier lifestyles and behaviours has been slow, as we saw in Our Future Health Secured? report. While specific services often provide good care, fragmentation between GPs and specialists, physical and mental health care providers, and health and social care hinders the delivery of the high-quality co-ordinated care that patients and service users increasingly require and expect.<br>All of these factors lead us to argue that current models of care need to change fundamentally if they are to be fit for the future. The financial pressures facing public services for the foreseeable future reinforce the case for change and make it imperative that ideas that have been in good currency for some time are now taken seriously. This case is strengthened by the increasing demands of an ageing population in which long-term conditions, and especially multi-morbidity, will become much more common.</p> <p>\u2022 More plaudits for the former children's minister, <strong>Tim Loughton</strong>.

  "<p>Earlier this week Lyn Gardner celebrated outdoor performances that <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/sep/03/piccadilly-circus-circus\">reclaim public space as a place to play</a>. As the director of <a href=\"http://hideandseek.net\">Hide&amp;Seek</a> I've been getting people to play games in public for the last five years, and in so doing, have become evangelical about the value of playing together. So I find it odd that the opportunities to do so are so restricted.</p> <p>Compare the choice we have of ways to eat together: in pretty much every high street in the country you'll find everything from the greasy spoon to the fancy restaurant. New innovations and trends as to what to eat, and how, and where, are pored over in magazines and blogs. Eating a burger has become a cultural pursuit. </p> <p>Following the closure of many of the <a href=\"http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/game-uk-stores-closing-down-11931\">Game Group stores</a> earlier this year, betting shops are now one of the few remaining places where you can play a video game on the high street. It's fun for some, sure, but it's harmful for others and a turn-off for many.</p> <p>We haven't yet paid much attention to what play can do for our minds, bodies, creativity and relationships. My belief is, when we do, we'll end up as enthusiastic and literate about the things that we play as we are about the things we eat. But we have a long way to go to become really literate about play. Games are generally regarded as both too trivial to take seriously and too complex to really understand. It's still a badge of honour with many of the culture professionals I meet to state they have never played a video game.</p> <p>This year's <a href=\"http://weekender.hideandseek.net \">Hide&amp;Seek Weekender</a> at London's Southbank Centre brings games into public spaces with the aim of encouraging everyone to start that journey \u2013 to see that as well as being great fun, they can engage your mind, get you playing with others, inspire you to see your environment in a different way. There are 36 games in the festival, involving choreographers, musicians, visual artists and writers as well as game designers, theatre-makers and technologists. There are games from Canada, Germany, the US, Denmark and the Netherlands. They're all experiments in how we can play together \u2013 this year curated with special attention to games that are as fun to watch as they are to play, bringing in audiences as part of the overall experience.</p> <p>Following the Weekender, the <a href=\"http://weekender.hideandseek.net/conference/\">Playing in Public conference</a> provides a chance for professionals from different disciplines to get together, hear from many of the games-makers at the Weekender, and listen to panels and presentations from leading thinkers. I hope that through events like these we can build a connection between ideas, cultural experimentation and what happens on our high street \u2013 that we can imagine better uses for those public spaces, supplanting betting shops not through legislation but by providing better sourced, more enjoyable and healthier alternatives.</p>",

The new product will have two wi-fi channels for faster transfers.</p> <p>A premium 32GB version with an 8.9-inch screen will cost $499, and will have the capacity to connect to the 4G cellular networks being built by phone companies in the US. A data plan will cost $50 a year.</p> <p>The basic, 7-inch Fire model will cost $159, down from $199 for the original model. Amazon is also dropping the price of its low-end Kindle to $69, from $79. Both will start shipping next Friday.</p> <p>Two of the new models will be available in the UK: the 7-inch Kindle Fire at \u00a3159 and the basic model at \u00a3129. Both will ship from 25 October.</p> <p>\"We haven't built the best tablet at a certain price. We have built the best tablet at any price,\" said Bezos.</p> <p>The company also released a new e-reader, Paperwhite, featuring a new higher resolution monochromatic display and a body that is \"thinner than a magazine, lighter than a paperback\", Bezos said. Paperwhite, priced at $119, is lit from above rather than from the back, which, according to Bezos, made it \"perfect in direct sunlight\". A model with a 3G connection will cost $179.</p> <p>Paperwhite starts shipping on 1 October in the US, and will also be available in the UK.</p> <p>The Kindle Fire has captured 22% of tablet sales in the US in the nine months since it went on sale last November and has been the company's top-selling product since launch, Amazon said last week. But the sales leave Amazon trailing far behind Apple's far more powerful iPad devices which accounted for 68% of global tablet shipments in the second quarter, compared with Amazon's 5%, according to research firm IDC. </p> <p>Apple is rumoured to be looking at launching smaller, cheaper tablets that will further intensify the fight between the two firms while Amazon has considered launching a mobile device that would compete with Apple's iPhone.</p> <p>Amazon's latest move comes after both Google and Microsoft have made forays into the tablet market. In July Google launched the Nexus 7 tablet, a $199 device about the same size as a Kindle Fire but with more computing power and a camera. In June Microsoft announced the launch of a series of tablet PCs dubbed Surface that will go on sale in October. </p> <p>The online retail giant has been building its media ties in order to compete with Apple and its rivals. Earlier this week Amazon announced a deal with film distributor EPIX, which counts recent blockbusters including The Avengers, The Hunger Games and Thor among its titles.</p>",
  "<p>In business, being perceived as good \u2013 as a decent business and neighbour \u2013 is important. The idea of success is increasingly determined by more than profitability. Yet for a business to enter the realm of social value and obtain institutional status while maintaining profitability, it needs to communicate the social purpose at the heart of its brand effectively. In the struggle to be good and profitable, the connecting variable is effective brand communication.</p> <h2>What being good looks like</h2> <p>Never in the history of business has being good been so vital. Richard Branson has been championing the idea that doing good is good for business. And he's right. According to <a href=\"http://purpose.edelman.com/slides/introducing-goodpurpose-2012/\" title=\"\">an Edelman study</a>, \"73% of consumers would switch brands if a different brand of similar quality supported a good cause\". We are all looking for ways to shop with both value and values. This isn't groundbreaking news. Yet in a culture of consumer scepticism and a market flooded with alternative products, being viewed as the best at being good isn't an easy task. In fact, it's damn difficult. Companies are being held accountable in a variety of ways: fiscal consistency, social responsibility and environmental sustainability. No organisation can think long-term without a multi-dimensional, multi-level, multi-stakeholder strategy.</p> <h2>The challenges of communication</h2> <p>There is no question that being a responsible brand is important. However, from a strategic point of view, for a brand to truly capitalise on its efforts to be good (or simply be better), it must start by educating the consumer. And this is where effective communication becomes so vital.</p> <p>Brand communication is a complex task, primarily because few organisations have attained any level of market homeostasis (adjustment), which is not necessarily even desirable. The most progressive companies are systems that constantly evolve, continuously in fluctuation. Communication strategies often reflect a brand's response to shifting environments. The advantage of constant responsive communication is that, if done well, a company will address immediate market demand. The disadvantage is that a brand's communication can be muffled and unclear: one day a brand is touting it's environmental strategies, the next day it's telling me there is a discount on the Triple Bacon Burger, and the following day it's building wells in Africa. The consumer response is that of vast confusion.</p> <p>But there is a simple way forward: placing purpose at the core of communication.</p> <h2>Purpose at the core of communication</h2> <p>Products may progress over the years, but what will remain constant are the values at the core of a business. The approach of talking about values, about what's happening at the heart of the business, ensures a consistency with the shifting external environment. Therefore, having cause at the core of communication is crucial. And I'm not talking about cause marketing here, which is the equivalent of brand Botox. I'm talking about those key values, those primary principles, which make a brand unique and stand out from its competitors. Sharing can be scary; hiding, however, is detrimental.</p> <p>Whether in interpersonal or business domains, the strongest relationships are built on effective levels of transparency. Transparency needs to be viewed not simply as another strategy. Instead, it should be placed in the same category as paying business taxes. Transparency is the social tax for which every brand on this planet is responsible. It is the way forward.</p> <p>The best companies in the world are striving towards longevity, towards becoming institutions. And this durability is built by constructing a brand that has soul. This means going beyond slamming consumers with product campaigns. If a business has sold cups of coffee for the past few decades, the consumer knows that it is going to continue selling cups of coffee. There needs to be a different incentive to support a business. A brand needs to move from selling to telling, from shareholders to stakeholders, and from product to purpose.</p> <h2>Inevitable consequence</h2> <p>To be profitable in business, being good is not good enough. The best brands of the future will have no choice but to go beyond product offering, into to realm of cause and purpose, and then complete the equation with effective communication. It's not easy to speak gracefully about the good that a brand does without coming across as arrogant or self-congratulatory. That's where a cohesive, eloquent and tactical communications strategy is vital. And when communication is done well, the consequence is inevitable: social impact through sales, and sales through honest purpose.</p> <p>Win-win.</p> <p><em>Daniel Baylis is the director of content for </em><a href=\"http://naisgood.com/en\" title=\"\"><em>N/A</em></a><em>, a marketing and communications agency that aims to connect people and brands in ways that affect positive social change</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Prominent figures from the film world, including Jeremy Irons, Charlotte Rampling, Danny Boyle and Kevin Spacey, have urged the Syrian government to release a film-maker detained in Damascus two weeks ago.</p> <p>Orwa Nyrabia, director of the Damascus-based international documentary festival DoxBox, travelled to the Syrian capital on 23 August to catch a flight to Cairo. His family <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/toronto-film-festival-syrian-film-maker\" title=\"\">lost contact with him</a> shortly after he arrived at the airport, and Egyptian authorities say he did not board the plane, indicating that he had been arrested by the Syrian authorities.</p> <p>A letter signed by 51 directors, producers, writers and actors says no information has been forthcoming about where Nyrabia is being held, which security branch is holding him or why he has been detained.</p> <p>\"We, the undersigned members of the UK film community and international friends, implore the Syrian authorities to release Orwa Nyrabia immediately,\" reads the letter, which also counts David Puttnam, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and Colin Firth among its signatories.</p> <p>\"Orwa is a highly respected producer and festival promoter in Damascus who has been pivotal in starting a documentary renaissance in the Arab world,\" it says. Copies of the letter have been passed to the UK foreign secretary, William Hague, and distributed in France and the US.</p> <p>Rosalind Ereira, who has known Nyrabia for seven years and organised the letter, said: \"We are very worried about his wellbeing.\" She described Nyrabia as \"incredibly kind, passionate about film, very funny in a very dry way\".</p> <p>In 2002, Nyrabia and his wife, Diana el-Jeiroudi, started Proaction Film, the only independent documentary film outfit operating in Syria, focusing mainly on films tackling human rights, gender and social justice. In July at the Sarajevo film festival they were presented with the Katrin Cartlidge Foundation scholarship, recognising \"independence, singularity and integrity of spirit\".</p> <p>Nyrabia has been a member of the jury at film festivals including Tehran, Amsterdam, Leipzig and Copenhagen. He and his wife founded DoxBox in 2008, but last year they cancelled the festival to protest against the violence in Syria, <a href=\"http://www.sff.ba/news/show/id/1149/culture/en?symfony=7a8f0f3037d378dd7cdc9caa81734e37\" title=\"\">according to the Sarajevo film festival website</a>.</p> <p>Activists say more than 20,000 people have been killed in a crackdown on opponents of the president, Bashar al-Assad. On 15 March this year, the first anniversary of the Syrian uprising, the couple held a Global Day for Syria, screening Syrian documentaries in 38 cities around the world.</p> <p>Last week organisers of the Toronto international film festival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/toronto-film-festival-syrian-film-maker\" title=\"\">expressed concern about Nyrabia's fate</a>. \"We are extremely concerned by his arrest. Film-makers must be allowed to express themselves without fear of reprisal,\" they said.</p> <p>Thousands of people have gone missing since the start of the uprising against the Assad regime, according to activists. On International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances last month, <a href=\"http://amnesty.org/en/campaigns/enforced-disappearances-in-syria\" title=\"\">Amnesty International said</a> that the Syrian authorities' \"heavy-handed response to the popular uprising, characterised by an utter disregard for human rights, has led to a dramatic rise in cases of enforced disappearance\".</p>",
  "<p>Labour is failing to offer a real alternative to the coalition on the economy and the environment, and the Green party is now the only genuine opposition party to the government, the newly elected leader of the Greens will say on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>Australian-born Natalie Benett, a former Guardian journalist who said there will be a Green councillor in every major town and city within a decade after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/03/green-party-natalie-bennett-leader?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">being elected leader on Monday</a>, will say \"the Labour party has not changed\" in her speech to the party's annual conference.</p> <p>In an attack on Labour's policies on energy, the economy and reform of the public sector, she is expected to say: \"Ed Miliband's Labour party is still championing nuclear power. Still pushing for unsustainable growth. Hasn't moved to support cooperatives and small business against multinational companies. Doesn't support renationalisation of the railways. Isn't speaking out in favour of the minimum wage being a living wage.\"</p> <p>Bennett indicated this week that the Green party would be seeking to win the votes of disaffected Labour and Liberal Democrat voters, in a continuation of tactics by outgoing leader and MP Caroline Lucas, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/09/green-party-caroline-lucas-conference-speech\" title=\"\">used her conference speech last year to appeal to Lib Dem voters</a>.</p> <p>The new leader will claim that Labour has failed to provide opposition to the government's cuts agenda and that the Green party has filled that role. \"We have to be the opposition to this disastrous coalition government. We are the opposition. We can do it because we have the vision of a better, more equal, healthier Britain, and we know how to get there.\"</p> <p>The Green party would strengthen trade unions, restructure the economy in favour of low-carbon industry, cut emissions and increase renewable energy, and make society more equal, Bennett will argue.</p> <p>Despite being disadvantaged by the current first-past-the-post electoral system, she will say that while pushing for proportional representation is still a Green party campaign, the party cannot wait for it \"to bear fruit\".</p> <p>Under Lucas's leadership, who was elected as the party's first leader in 2008 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/13/caroline-lucas-green-party\" title=\"\">in May announced she would not run for another term</a>, the party beat the Liberal Democrats to come third in the London mayoral election contest this year, Lucas herself became the first Green MP in England, and the party has doubled its membership.</p> <p>In her final speech as leader today, Lucas is expected to say: \"New leader Natalie Bennett has all the passion, the commitment and the inspiration needed to lead the party forward. There are huge opportunities for us in the years ahead. On so many of the big issues of our time, Greens are winning the battle of ideas.</p> <p>\"From 20mph speed limits in residential areas and introducing a living wage to lift people out of poverty, to nationalising the railways and replacing the failed policy of austerity with investment in jobs and the green economy, our policies are coming into their own.\"</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/06/ed-miliband-attacks-coalition-green\" title=\"\">Miliband criticised the coalition's green record</a>, saying Labour would not pose \"the environment and the economy as alternatives as the current Chancellor does\", apparently referring to <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_136_11.htm\" title=\"\">remarks by George Osborne last year</a>.</p> <p>Miliband's intervention followed a cabinet reshuffle by David Cameron this week that saw the appointment of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/04/environment-owen-paterson-spelman-reshuffle\" title=\"\">new environment secretary</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/john-hayes-charles-hendry-energy-minister\" title=\"\">energy minister</a> who have both spoken out against wind power subsidies in the past, and the removal of Justine Greening as transport secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/heathrow-battle-third-runway-ministers?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">widely seen as paving the way for the government's backing of a third runway at Heathrow</a>, which Greening opposed.</p>",
  "<p>In 2005, Jeremiah Makori was asleep in his home in Nairobi's Deep Sea slum when he heard a voice outside.</p> <p>\"We went to sleep as usual, and at midnight I heard a strange voice outside, [saying] move out and save your lives,\" he said. He rushed outside with his nightclothes on, carrying his two sons, and watched his home disappear. \"It was all demolished. We lost everything.\"</p> <p>Makori had lived in the slum since 1998, having left his home in rural western Kenya to look for work in the city.</p> <p>Although Deep Sea has since been rebuilt, Makori, who was in Naples this week at the World Urban Forum (WUF), said the threat of eviction still looms: a new road project that would cut through the slum is on the cards, and it's unclear what will happen to those who live there.</p> <p>The population of Deep Sea has doubled over the past 15 years, he says, estimating its size at 15,000. There is no official record of who lives in the slum, but community organisers are conducting their own census. The hope is that collecting detailed information on the lives and livelihoods of those in Deep Sea will protect them from any further evictions.</p> <p>Over the past 20 years, it's become a common strategy for slum dwellers around the world to conduct surveys of their settlements to raise the profile of their communities.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the journal Environment and Urbanisation <a href=\"http://eau.sagepub.com/content/current\" title=\"\">honed in on this trend with a series of case studies</a>. In Old Fadama, in central Accra, Ghana, a community survey revealed a much larger population than government estimates, discouraging authorities from pushing through eviction orders. In Cape Town, a similar survey of the Joe Slavo settlement showed the opposite \u2013 far fewer numbers than expected \u2013 showing it would be easier and quicker to \"upgrade\" the settlement than to move it. <a href=\"http://www.sdinet.org/\" title=\"\">Shack/Slum Dwellers International</a>, an umbrella group of local federations of people living in informal settlements, founded in 1996, has now developed an extensive set of tools and methods to help residents survey and map their communities.</p> <p>\"These surveys started as a way to stop evictions but have become a key tool to support community-led upgrading in informal settlements,\" says David Satterthwaite, senior fellow in the human settlements group at the London-based thinktank the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). These surveys involve the community sitting down together, walking through the settlement numbering each house, and using enumeration as a tool to identify and address their own priorities.</p> <p>It's often quoted that more than 1 billion people live in slums around the world. But informal settlements are typically \"invisible\" in government statistics, and no one really knows how many people live in areas like these. The surveys conducted by communities often produce the first detailed data on these settlements, their residents, the quality of housing, infrastructure, and services.</p> <p>Satterthwaite, who has spent decades working with civil society groups on urban issues, helped organise a session on \"documentation by the undocumented\" at the WUF. \"The detail you get is amazing. In terms of surveys, I expect these are the most detailed, accurate, and insightful \u2013 far better than those of any research organisation,\" he insists. \"These are the experts producing data that no one else could.\"</p> <p>Sarah Nandudu, of the Ugandan Slum Dwellers' Federation, said community-led surveys in her country had helped to pave the way for better relationships between slum dwellers and the government. \"Before, they didn't have any reason to sit with us.\"</p> <p>For Parveen Shaikh, from the Indian Slum Dwellers Federation, conducting a survey is just as much about understanding her community. \"We asked: where are the trees? The toilets? The mosque?... This also helped us to get to know our community very well. Who lives in house number 100, for example?\" Unlike city officials, she said, the community was highly attentive to detail. \"We wanted information about us to be accurate.\"</p> <p>Satterthwaite says these local efforts to document and map informal settlements are symbolic of how members of poor urban communities are best-placed to offer solutions to problems that affect them, but these efforts are not fully recognised.</p> <p>He says the UN human settlements programme (<a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org\" title=\"\">UN-Habitat</a>), which organised the WUF, is one of the few UN bodies to recognise the role of local governments. But in terms of working with community groups, \"it's almost going backwards. There's even less recognition now of the really pioneering work and partnerships by civil society.\" Civil society and representatives of the urban poor shouldn't just get time to speak at the forum, he says, they should also be on the organising committee, defining the programme and deliberating on the conference's themes.</p> <p>For Makori, it's also time for the state to step in and ensure there is sufficient low-cost housing. He moved to Deep Sea, he said, because the money he made working as a watchman was not enough to rent a house. \"Because of its failures, it [the state] is now shifting the blame to the poor,\" he said. \"They call us criminals, but the people who live in Deep Sea are the security guards, the watchmen, the maids, the office cleaners.\"</p>",
  "<p>For most people in south-east Asia, the Javan rhino is effectively already a relic from the past. The stocky herbivore, that once roamed across Burma, Vietnam and Indonesia, is now a rarely glimpsed inhabitant of a single patch of thick forest on the island which gives it its name.</p> <p>No zoo in the world \u2013 even through captive breeding programmes \u2013 boasts a Javan rhino. Even people dedicated to protecting the world's rarest large mammal seldom catch sight of the species.</p> <p>\"I've been to its habitat three times and got very excited just to see its footprints,\" says Kerry Crosbie, project director at the <a href=\"http://www.asianrhinos.org.au/index.php/\" title=\"\">Asian Rhino Project</a>, which funds the efforts of Indonesian rhino NGOs. \"You have to be incredibly lucky to see one.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/28/rare-javan-rhinos-indonesia\" title=\"\">Camera traps</a> and footprints in the Ujung Kulon national park, on western tip of Java, confirm that the rhino does still exist, albeit in perilously low numbers.</p> <p>There are 35 confirmed Javan rhinos in its last bastion \u2013 22 males, 13 females and five juveniles. However, NGOs in the region estimate the total number could, in fact, be as high as 47.</p> <p>What is not in doubt is sharp decline the species has suffered in the past century due to habitat loss and poaching. The cornered animal <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/19495/0\" title=\"\">is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN</a>, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/oct/25/javan-rhino-extinct-vietnam\" title=\"\">confirmed extinct in Vietnam last year</a> and some conservationists privately fret the species is doomed.</p> <p>\"There is potentially a low genetic pool as there are so few of them left,\" says Crosbie. \"Generally, they produce just one calf every three years, and that's in prime breeding conditions. They have a 16-month gestation, which is an issue with raising their numbers.\"</p> <p>\"The fact they are all in one place is better for breeding, unlike the Sumatran rhino, which is in fragmented pieces of forest. But it does mean all our eggs are in one basket. A catastrophic event, be it a disease or a tsunami, could wipe all of them out.\"</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-372167564\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_806480361001_110228JavanRhino-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110228JavanRhino/110228JavanRhino.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>Such a disaster in the region isn't merely theoretical. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa\" title=\"\">1883 eruption of nearby Krakatoa</a> devastated the area, but with humans displaced and new vegetation blooming, the incident provided an ideal staging ground for the Javan rhino's last stand.</p> <p>A second catastrophe won't be quite so helpful to the species. And there are further threats. The vegetation is changing, with the arenga palm tree spreading across the park, crowding out the rhino's food source.</p> <p>\"We are currently working out the best eradication programme for the palm, because it is blanketing the forest,\" says Crosbie. \"There's also a problem with banteng \u2013 a type of local cattle \u2013 which is increasing in number and in food competition with the rhino. We are looking to fence off the western portion of the park to keep out the livestock.\"</p> <p>Unlike their African cousins, poaching isn't considered an imminent threat to the Javan rhinos, with a combination of park rangers, who clear snares from the forest, and the sheer inaccessibility of the creatures ensuring no incidents of hunting in the last decade.</p> <p>However, the continuation of such a tiny population hardly seems viable. Numbers on Java have risen from 25 animals in 1967, but it's a slow increase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395757821\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/28/1346150019100/Java-rhino-map--001.png\" alt=\"Java rhino map \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Javan rhino distribution</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conservationists say they will have to decide whether to split the remaining animals to create another group elsewhere.</p> <p>Adhi Hariyadi, of WWF Indonesia, says: \"Having one single population is not ideal from a conservation point of view. We will have to borrow some of the animals to create a second population somewhere, either in Sumatra or Java.\"</p> <p>\"But the numbers are so low that we will have to be very careful in doing this. If you get it wrong, you've badly damaged the species.\"</p> <p>\"We are hopeful that we can get the numbers up. What gives us hope is the example of the Indian and white rhinos. The Indian rhino was down to 35 individuals and now there are several thousand. The white rhino had just four left in the wild and now they are up to tens of thousands. It can be done.\"</p> <p>\"If a number of factors work out, I imagine we can get the numbers up by 20% in the next 30 to 40 years. But the increase won't be dramatic and it will require the next generation to take responsibility for the species.\"</p> <p>Australian conservationist Tim Flannery, who is a patron of the rhino project, adds: \"They are majestic animals, they play a vital role in dispersing fruit and maintaining a healthy ecosystem and we are bloody lucky to have them. We once had a dozen rhino species and we're now down to five, so every last one should be treasured.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Byrne was not like other boys. When he first heard <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468294/202-0370404-6046244\" title=\"\">Purple Haze</a>, aged 14, the precocious future leader of Talking Heads informed his father that \"the electric guitar has broken free from history\". Two years later he was performing Chuck Berry and Eddie Cochran on the ukulele. At 18 he travelled from Rhode Island to the Bath festival but \"exhausted after hours of listening to music I fell asleep on the damp ground\". Rudely awakened by the main attraction, Led Zeppelin, he returned to his slumbers only to be roused by the appalling discovery that Dr John, playing his New Orleans \"funky voodoo jive <a href=\"http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/djbath.html\" title=\"\">in full carnival drag</a>\", was being pelted with beer cans \u2013 \"the most original act on the bill and he was completely unappreciated\".</p> <p>Ever against the grain, the now 60-year-old Byrne explores a whole symphony of argument in this extraordinary book with the precise, technical enthusiasm you'd expect from the painfully bright art school-educated son \u2013 born in Scotland, raised in the States \u2013 of an electrical engineer, occasionally mopping his fevered brow in the crestfallen manner of a 19th-century poet. The title is perfectly chosen. Music doesn't just work because of its effect on the senses; every aspect of its sound and construction has an emotional impact, right up to the way it's distributed, even marketed, and the machines on which it's consumed. It's fascinating.</p> <p>Even before you hear music, Byrne points out, it has been shaped by the environment it was designed to be heard in, and by the equipment employed to make or record it. Much of the slow, stately western music of the middle ages sounds the way it does because it had to work within the four-second reverberations of stone-walled cathedrals (Bach's was more agile because he mostly wrote on a small church pipe organ). Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby capitalised on the arrival of the microphone as it allowed them to reach their predominantly female following with a whisper not a shout.</p> <p>Arena rock of the early 70s evolved as a way of reaching the back of the sonically unsuitable sports stadia that the expanding market now required its bands to perform in. Talking Heads themselves fashioned their angular funk partly because it suited the acoustics of<a href=\"http://www.cbgb.com/\" title=\"\"> CBGB</a>, the box-like New York club that launched them. Byrne no longer plays at Carnegie Hall, he explains, because it's designed for opera and thus deadens his current brand of highly percussive \"groove music\".</p> <p>No amount of detail seems too much, especially in the section about recorded sound. The arrival of the phonograph in 1878 meant people no longer wrote just for live performance. There's the philosophical issue that \"recording uproots music from its place of origin\", and the \"blasphemous\" moral issue of technicians being brought in to hit the high notes that 1940s opera stars could no longer reach. There's a lovely description of the staff employed in early jazz sessions to physically shift the singer so the soloist could get near the only microphone (Louis Armstrong was so loud he stood 15 feet behind anyone else, Byrne marvelling at the logic that \"the main guy in the band was stuck at the back!\").</p> <p>American boffins gradually realised the Germans must have cooked up a new recording device \u2013 surely their orchestras couldn't be actually <em>playing</em> at three in the morning on Hitler's morale-boosting broadcasts? When this futuristic new secret was uncovered \u2013 tape machines! \u2013 Bing Crosby insisted his label invest in one as he wanted to spend his daily \"live radio shows\" on the golf course.</p> <p>Byrne applies his piercing analysis to each successive format, from the wax cylinder to the shellac and vinyl disc, the cassette, the CD and today's MP3 (about which he is fairly scathing: certain music has a calming and therapeutic influence on psychotic patients when on vinyl but apparently has the reverse effect when played off a computer). He confirms that fewer grooves on a disc allow a greater recording volume which gave shorter pop singles a powerful advantage on the radio and jukebox. He's intrigued by \"compression\" \u2013 like the taste-amplifiers now poured into food, you can make some digital recordings artificially louder than others, <em>Californication</em> by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and most Oasis albums being classic examples. \"They seemed amazing on first listen but rapidly wore on the ears.\"</p> <p>No aspect of the musical experience is left unexplored, even its political dimension. The teenage Byrne felt Bob Dylan's Mr Tambourine Man opened a door he never knew existed and convinced him \"music not only sounded different, it was <em>socially</em> different\". The philosopher Theodor Adorno took <a href=\"http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/SWA/On_popular_music_1.shtml\" title=\"\">the opposite view</a>, essentially that \"pop music was a drug pacifying and numbing the masses so they could be easily manipulated\", and the Soviets had announced in 1928 that anyone caught listening to American jazz would get six months in jail. (The current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/19/pussy-riot-putin-russia-jail\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot controversy</a> suggests things haven't advanced a great deal.)</p> <p>One word of warning: those looking for personal insights into Talking Heads will be wasting their time. They lived in a flat with no shower, toilet or heating on the Lower East Side in the 70s, Burroughs and Ginsberg over the road, and \"you could never tell whether a comatose body on the sidewalk was drunk, high or dead\". And that's pretty much all you get. Every other time the band is mentioned it's about the practical application of Byrne's musical philosophy.</p> <p>But in a strange way this is an advantage too. Anyone can read this book \u2013 though, like me, they may tend to skip pages with pie charts on them, and their blood may run cold at chapter headings such as \"iTunes Album Revenue\" or \"Physical Royalty Breakdown\". Ignorance of the author and his catalogue won't stop you enjoying it. It may be academic \u2013 in fact its photographs are all lettered like footnotes \u2013 but Byrne's theories are robust and original, and his writing lucid and even self-mocking. Who wouldn't be gripped by the idea that Pythagoras noticed that the ping of a blacksmith's hammer was exactly an octave higher than the sound of one weighing twice as much? Or that our brains are so confused by certain frequencies that we can't tell the direction of an ambulance siren?</p> <p>It was wildly ambitious to try and turn this galaxy of theory into a readable work of scholarship but Byrne has done it, and done it with style. Brian Eno might as well cancel that book deal now.</p> <p><em>Mark Ellen is a magazine editor and broadcaster</em></p>",
  "<p>Reality gets a primping in Ben Affleck's version of the true story of Tony Mendez, a CIA operative who helped a group of six American diplomats impersonate a Canadian film crew, in order to escape Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis.</p> <p>Mendez, an \"exfiltration\" expert, was a tenacious and creative agent who, in the midst of the Iranian revolution, tapped his Hollywood contacts to help him launch a bogus blockbuster that would free the six. Scripted, storyboarded and backed by Oscar-winning makeup artist John Chambers (played here by John Goodman), Argo was a movie that was designed not to be. A Star Wars knock-off set in the middle east, it would exist just long enough to provide a good cover story.</p> <p>Affleck's Argo is an oddball mix of political thriller and movie biz satire, flicking between Tehran and Tinseltown to create an entertaining, if shamelessly embellished account of one of the CIA's strangest operations. Mendez's <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art1.html\" title=\"\">fascinating report on \"the Canadian caper\"</a> suggests none of the palpitating tension of Chris Terrio's screenplay. The mission is described as strange, but not particularly stressful, with the first meeting between Mendez and the hostages descending into a fit of giggles over a knock-knock joke based on their phoney movie's title (\"Ahhh go fuck yourself\" is the punchline). There's very little of that levity in the film. The hostages are grim and one-dimensional; Affleck's Mendez is a surly, determined work horse. The joke is included, but co-opted as a clarion call for the cause. \"Argo fuck yourself,\" says Goodman down the line from Hollywood. \"Argo fuck yourself,\" Affleck intones solemnly back.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-395844463\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/8/120908TorontoArgo-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/8/120908TorontoArgo-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120908TorontoArgo/120908TorontoArgo.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/8/120908TorontoArgo_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/8/120908TorontoArgo_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>This is pitched as a patriotic, Hollywood-saves-the-day yarn, a juicy slab of dangling Oscar bait. But there's a danger that its chest-beating could drown out the strength in its subtleties. The film is edited at a clip, the set design is superb and the supporting cast, including turns from Richard Kind, Kyle Chandler and Philip Baker Hall, is a who's who of people you'd like to see more of in the movies.</p> <p>There's a degree of puffery in the writing, however, that makes this drama untrustworthy. The Iranians are portrayed either as raving mob \u2013 Affleck tries to raise the stakes by inviting us to glimpse Tehran from behind the embassy's curtains \u2013 or as honourable servant, putting herself in danger by standing between the crowd and the terrified westerners. The diplomatic crisis created an environment that was extremely dangerous for US citizens in Iran, but the baddies here are so leering, and their victims so weak, that it feels like the schlocky spirit of the B-movie Argo has leaked through.</p> <p>That said, this fantasy does have its excitement. The chase ending is jarringly false, but it pushes the story to a heart-racing conclusion. The post-credits sequence shows real-world photos of Tehran at the time, matched with stills from the film: they're impressively similar. Affleck seems to have simultaneously shot for authenticity and wallowed in a fiction. I needed a little more light and a lot less drama. Argo-t bored waiting for it.</p>",
  "<p>In the coded landscape of Israel's intentions regarding a military strike against Iran, the defence minister, Ehud Barak, made a public statement on Thursday which may signify a shift away from unilateral action.</p> <p>Following a meeting with Admiral James Winnefield, the US vice-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Barak issued the following statement to the media:</p> <blockquote> We face a common challenge but the clock is ticking at a different pace for each of us. We also have our differences; Israel keeps its sovereign right to act independently, and the US understands this. <br> However, there is no doubt about the US readiness to face the challenge on every level.  Only Israel will take decisions regarding its future and security.  However, the US is our most important ally. The intelligence co-operation and the military support are deep and exceptional in scope. I am sure that it will stay this way in any scenario that might happen in the future. </blockquote> <p>One interpretation of this is that Barak is saying: Israel will not give up its right to act alone, but it won't exercise it in the next two or three months.</p> <p>The key phrase is \"the US is our most important ally\" \u2013 a tacit acknowledgement that Israel cannot act in defiance of American disapprobation, which has been made so abundantly clear.</p> <p>A news report in Haaretz offered further quotes from Barak, who was speaking at a gathering of his party members. \"Israel retains its right to make sovereign decisions and the United States respects that. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/barak-hints-u-s-military-preparations-may-eliminate-israel-s-need-for-iran-strike.premium-1.463308\" title=\"\">However, one should not ignore the impressive preparations by the Americans to counter Iran on all fronts</a>,\" Barak said according to this report. The clear implication is that Israel has new faith in its superpower ally.</p> <p>Some observers detect a significant shift in Barak's stance in recent days and weeks, including my colleague Julian Borger, who wrote a couple of days ago that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/sep/04/israel-iran-nuclear\" title=\"\">the odds on a military strike were lengthening</a>.</p> <p>Haaretz carries a piece by Yossi Verter on Friday which starts: \"<a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/reshuffling-the-deck-barak-now-opposes-israeli-strike-on-iran-sources-say.premium-1.463425\" title=\"\">Word is that defence minister Ehud Barak is no longer as gung-ho about an attack on Iran as his media interviews suggest</a> \u2026 A top American source told an Israeli politician this week that the Americans now consider Barak to be a pouring-cold-water-over-things type of person, rather than someone who starts fires. People who have met with him in recent weeks got a similar impression. One said Barak cited his reasons for not attacking now with the same conviction and skill he used to support the opposite approach just two months ago.\"</p> <p>The rightwing Jerusalem Post, however, has a different interpretation of Barak's comments. Its lead story in the print edition on Friday morning says that Barak \"appeared to hint \u2026 that <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=284189\" title=\"\">he believed the United States would join Israel in a strike on Iran</a> to prevent the Islamic Republic from obtaining nuclear weapons\".</p> <p>The fact that the headlines in both papers begin with the words \"Barak hints\" reflects uncertainty over the defence minister's meaning. But a more temperate mood now seems to be prevailing in Israel.</p>",
  "<p>Margaret Thatcher once declared that \"a man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus can count himself a failure\". <a href=\"http://www.tarasgrescoe.com/\" title=\"\">Taras Grescoe</a> is proud to be \u2013 in Thatcher's estimation, at least \u2013 a failure. Although he can drive, the Canadian author, who is in his mid-40s, has never owned a car. And he is not alone. Half the population of cities such as New York, Toronto and London do not own cars. Every day some 155 million people take the underground. And although being a straphanger in North America may be,&#xa0;as Grescoe shows, a \"depressing experience\" due to underfunding and bad planning, elsewhere public transport \u2013 particularly in cities \u2013 is enjoying a renaissance. The heyday of the car has passed.</p> <p>In this passionately argued and important book, Grescoe takes the reader on a whistle-stop tour of world cities and their transport systems. He accuses the private car of destroying cities, turning streets into kill-zones for the vulnerable, polluting the air and burning up increasingly scarce fossil fuels. Although the scope of <em>Straphanger</em> is global, it clearly targets car-loving, gas-guzzling North America and the statistics he cites are truly shocking. In the US \u2013 \"the most extravagantly motorised nation in the history of the world\" \u2013 vehicles now outnumber drivers by five to four. Los Angeles, once hailed as an \"autopia\", is now the most congested city in the US with drivers wasting 72 hours a year stuck in traffic jams \u2013 Americans now spend nine years of their lives sitting in their cars, and the pollution they produce kills 30,000 US citizens each year.</p> <p>But change is in the air. In 2009, the total number of cars in the US shrank. In its early days in office, the Obama administration conjured up visions of a new golden age of public transport, offering funding for ambitious rail and subway schemes. Streetcars, which used to be the main mode of public transport in American cities, are being reintroduced in such unlikely places as Houston and Denver and, in 2010, public transport use reached a 54-year high. In this suburban nation, people are also moving back into the cities. Recently released figures from the 2011 US census show that many of the largest cities are now growing faster than their suburbs, the first time this has happened in a century. This trend is being led by young Americans, many of whom are also choosing not to learn to drive but are instead relying on bicycles and public transport. Even New York's billionaire mayor,<a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/tags/straphangers-campaign\" title=\"\"> Michael Bloomberg, is now known as the \"straphanger mayor\"</a>, riding the subway a couple of times a week. Although, as Grescoe notes, he is taken to the subway stop by chauffeured SUV.</p> <p>Surprisingly for a book about public transport, London is not one of the cities Grescoe visits. Indeed the city is only mentioned for its \"criminally expensive\" tube tickets, the failed experiment of privatisation in 2003 and the lack of air conditioning (\"cruel and unusual punishment\"). Today more than a billion passenger journeys a year are made on the London Underground, a figure equalled by the subway system of New York and the Paris M\u00e9tro. Although Shanghai didn't open its first line until 1995, its rapidly expanding metro has now become the longest subway network in the world and Moscow's underground is one of the busiest, carrying nine million people a day, a figure matched only by Tokyo.</p> <p>Grescoe stops off at all these cities. It was in Paris that <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrosses_%25C3%25A0_cinq_sols&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dcarrosses%2Ba%2Bcinq%2Bsols%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=blJHUOiaDYOt0QWKroCADA&amp;ved=0CCkQ7gEwAA\" title=\"\">Blaise Pascal invented modern urban public transport in 1662 with the \"<em>carosses \u00e0 cinq sols</em>\"</a>, carriages that ran along five fixed routes in the city, although sadly only for the gentry. Today the M\u00e9tro \"is the most ingenious and efficient transit network ever built\". Parisian subway trains have been using autopilot technology since the 1970s but now fully automatic trains are being introduced. Grescoe is impressed by Shanghai's subway. Yet above ground the people have swapped bikes for cars, as they embrace a consumerist lifestyle. The result is congestion and pollution: the air in the city's streets has become a health hazard. Moscow's roads are also choked: it is \"traffic hell\". But its palatial Metro, built in the 30s, is \"designed to ennoble and uplift the long-suffering straphangers of the world\". In the Russian capital it's the only way to travel. In<a href=\"http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3011.html\" title=\"\"> Tokyo he visits Shinjuku</a>, with some 3.5 million commuters passing through every day. In comparison, the busiest station in the US is New York's Penn Station which handles a paltry 600,000 commuters. Grescoe is right to marvel at the \"fantastic clockwork\" of Tokyo's transport system: it is \"the world's best example of a transit metropolis \u2026 a city built, and now kept running, by its trains\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pps.org/reference/epenalosa-2/\" title=\"\">Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa</a>, former mayor of the Colombian capital Bogot\u00e1, which revolutionised its public transport with a bus rapid transit scheme, makes a powerful point to Grescoe: \"I believe a city is more civilised not when it has highways but when a child on a tricycle is able to move about everywhere with ease and safety.\" In too many places multi-lane highways have sliced through the cityscape, destroying communities and creating barriers between districts. But the act of driving also fundamentally changes the way people use the city. Inside cars, people are insulated from the sights and sounds of the city and isolated from other citizens. By contrast, public transport is a democratic and a social experience. In Tokyo someone tells Grescoe: \"To use public transport is to know how to cooperate with other people, how to behave in a public space.\"</p> <p>Good public transport is essential to the success of any world city. Grescoe argues that North America has fallen far behind Asia in its public transport infrastructure, and it \"will be paying the price, in terms of lost competitivity, for decades to come\". This is a warning for every city. But even in North America a quiet revolution is taking place in the way people travel. And this is happening in cities everywhere, as people from Philadelphia (the city with the highest percentage of Americans who commute on foot) to Copenhagen (\"the world's most bikeable city\") realise that the car is no longer an indispensable part of urban life in the 21st century.</p> <p>\u2022 PD Smith's<em> City: A Guidebook for the Urban Age</em> is published by Bloomsbury.</p>",

And in this election, you can do something about it,\" Obama said, to a roar of approval from the hall.</p> <p>The remarks were a pointed and deliberate contrast to Romney. The Republican contender got the biggest laughs of his speech by making fun of candidate Obama's concern on climate change when he first ran in 2008.</p> <p>\"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet,\" <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/08/30/160357612/transcript-mitt-romneys-acceptance-speech\" title=\"\">Romney said</a>. \"My promise is to help you and your family.\" He got a standing ovation.</p> <p>The strong reaction in the hall \u2013 and the outrage from Democrats and others after a summer of heat waves, drought, wildfires and now hurricanes \u2013 all but ensured climate change a mention in Obama's own convention speech a week later.</p> <p>Obama said nothing about taking comprehensive action to limit the emissions that cause climate change.

  "<p>If only condoms weren't such a bore. Whether you want childless sex with a partner, or free-for-all romps in rooms covered in bin liners and baby oil, sexual liberation comes at a price. The most recent scandal focused on the contraceptive implant Implanon, which, it <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198721/Contraceptive-implants-Women-fear-fertility-hundreds-Implanon-gone-missing-body.html\" title=\"\">was exposed this week</a>, can sometimes just disappear. Inside women's bodies. Never to be found again.</p> <p>This is no small matter. Older women were originally prescribed the implant because, post-removal, fertility returns more quickly than with the contraceptive pill. Now those whose implants have gone walkabout could now have lost their chance ever to have children. Implanon is undetectable by x-ray; by the time the implant's hormones run out (they last for three years) these women may no longer be fertile.</p> <p>But it is no picnic to have a contraceptive implant lost somewhere in the body at any age. Though the NHS has now upgraded to an x-rayable version of the implant, this provides no assurance that it won't still travel, requiring surgery for removal. The contraceptive implant is powerful stuff. In the clinical trials, <a href=\"http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=55814%23section-6.2\" title=\"\">almost 20%</a> of women experienced prolonged bleeding. More than 10% experienced headaches, vaginitis, weight increase, acne, breast pain or abdominal pain.</p> <p>Where the global market in contraception is concerned, cost-effectiveness comes first, women's health second. <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/CG030\" title=\"\">NHS guidelines</a> repeatedly note cost effectiveness as a reason for recommending hormonal implants, injections, and intrauterine systems to women. Meanwhile, the contraceptive pill comes with a whole host of similar assorted miseries. Though for many women these can be liberating choices that unshackle pleasurable sex from reproduction, for others, dramatic side-effects make life a trial.</p> <p>Trial is the operative term here. Women have many \"choices\", each as woeful as the last. Implants get lost, barriers might break, or give you cystitis; injections make you fat. Faced with this, women are playing hormone roulette, holding out for the one perfect method that often doesn't exist. At the same time, nobody is asking what it means for <a href=\"http://www.fpa.org.uk/professionals/factsheets/contraceptionpatternsofuse%23VmCn\" title=\"\">up to 44%</a> of British fertile women to be constantly on a cocktail of synthetic hormones.</p> <p>As arguments about capitalist markets in women's bodies go, this is clear cut. The development of male contraceptives has been lagging for years, hobbled by the profit-driven politics of the global pharmaceutical industry. An apparently 100% effective, side-effect free, non-hormonal male contraceptive named <a href=\"http://malecontraceptives.org/methods/risug.php\" title=\"\">RISUG</a> is currently stalled in advanced clinical trials in India. Developed by independent scientists at low cost, international interest in it is tellingly scarce. While stops and starts in developing RISUG might also represent a worthwhile care over its safety, no such qualms are extended to contraceptives for women.</p> <p>The lack of male contraceptives places the onus of contraception squarely on women's shoulders. With condoms sometimes an unsatisfactory solution in long-term relationships, women are made into gatekeepers of sex, responsible for all precautions, reprehensible where precautions fail. Men are imagined to be overgrown children, their interest in family and fertility denied. Hung up on these archaic attitudes, heterosexual sex becomes heterosexual stress. Despite 16% of British men under 70 opting for vasectomy, the likely permanence of the procedure makes it an impractical option for most men. Revealingly, <a href=\"http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/Parsemus/New_male_contraceptives.html\" title=\"\">studies</a> are still being conducted to determine if \"men [would] accept the mechanism of action, a semen-free orgasm?\" Women have no such privilege.</p> <p>In all this, the sometimes grim reality of contraception is skated over by medical industries that do their best to present birth control as a set of easy alternatives. When \u2013 in 2012 \u2013 women are subject to such abject ethical failures as unfindable implants, it may be time to re-evaluate both the options and the way they are talked about. Reproduction should not be just a women's issue, and hormonal contraception is no stroll in the park. <a href=\"http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/1165847-AIBU-to-want-to-get-my-implant-removed-already/AllOnOnePage\" title=\"\">As Mumsnet user \"DaisyFields\" wrote</a>: \"I was I was made to think that it was the best thing since sliced bread; no pills to take, no periods and no pregnancy worries \u2013 the reality was very different.\"</p>",
  "<p>Who can forget that beautiful scene in ET where Elliot's BMX floats past a large moon, defying gravity with grace and serenity, the boys legs peddling, his alien pal in the basket at the front. Well now you can sort of recreate that in Trials Evolution \u2013 but with less grace and more likelihood of horrendous crashes into rocky outcrops. Due out later this month, Origin of Pain is a DLC pack for the wonderful motorbike simulation, and its major addition is BMX.</p> <p>Yes, players will be able to attack a series of swooping, jump-riddled tracks on a cool white BMX, with mag wheels and a furiously peddling rider. We tried two of the new courses: Flow Like Water, which takes players through a mountainous area of the island, past waterfalls and beneath low hanging tree branches; and Cauldron Trail, a fiery romp through a lava filled volcano. The bike is agile and light, which means the handling is super sensitive, with the slightest pump of acceleration sending the front wheel flying into the air \u2013 deft, subtle balance is a key requirement, even more than the friskiest motorbikes. It's fun though, as the bikes are also easier to correct than their motorised cousins, so you can pull back from the craziest wheelies, and also stop on a six pence after hurtling down a sheer cliff face.</p> <p>Set on a new island location (which at 4km x 4km is twice the size of the environment in Evolution), there are 36 new tracks to try out, making excellent use of the varied, mountainous environment. As well as tropical rainforest areas, there's a circus on the island - and a landing strip. Red Lynx has also added a load of extra rider outfits and head gear, including deliciously ostentatious Roman centurion and astronaut helmets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395794205\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347009857657/trials_3.jpg\" alt=\"Trials Evolution: Origin of Pain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A bunch of new track editor features have been included, too. The key additions are the one hundred new obstacles including some super huge set-pieces such as jet planes and boats, giving avid Trials designers some intriguing new scenic possibilities; there's even a cannon that can shoot riders across the circuit. Oh and there's even a grappling hook, allowing bikers to swing their way through certain sections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395794206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347009752242/trials_2.jpg\" alt=\"Trials Evolution: Origin of Pain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Several of the fresh circuits show off these features rather nicely, with one set amid a Lost-style crash site, complete with tricky jumps between sections of fuselage. There are also 30 new special effects ranging from fairy glitter dust to new smoke swirls \u2013 for the real completists.</p> <p>It's a generous selection box for Trials enthusiasts who have played the original circuits to death. And as there hasn't been a decent BMX title since the Dave Mirra years, a whole new audience is about to be lured right in. Indeed, with Trials Evolution: Gold Edition coming to PC soon (combining all the tracks from both Trails HD and Trials: Evolution - 129 in total), Red Lynx is determined to trap as many people as possible in its domain of speed, gravity and momentum.</p>",

  "<p><em>Adrian Fennell is a partner at </em><a href=\"http://www.rochesurveyors.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Roche Chartered Surveyors </em></a></p> <p><strong>The availability of parking is an important consideration:</strong> Parking is essential for local parades, particularly on arterial routes where ease and convenience for the shopper is essential, as it is in out-of-town retail parks. In market towns, ease of parking \u2013 and in particular free parking \u2013 is an important consideration for retailers, and also for the success and vibrancy of the town centre. City centres will have various key anchors \u2013 these could be car parks, transport hubs, department stores, major tourist attractions, markets and so on.</p> <p><strong>The layout of the location is important:</strong> Dwell time is essential for a shopping centre, hence they lay on food courts, entertainment and so on. The physical properties of the street are important. If the street is narrow then it will act as a funnel and people tend not to stop; trees, benches and mall kiosks can all deflect pedestrian flow as well. Pedestrianised streets tend to offer a more relaxed shopping environment, encouraging spend and dwell time.</p> <p><strong>Size matters:</strong> For small businesses, due to the cost of fitting out retail space, smaller shops often look better and more inviting. It is difficult to make a large shop look appealing on a tight budget. Many fashion retailers are spending \u00a3100 per sq ft on their fit out.</p> <p><strong>Generally speaking competition is a good thing for consumers and retailers:</strong> If you look at the high street, phone shops will often be in close proximity, as will shoe shops, jewellers and fashion retailers. Shoppers can identify with a location for a certain product, do their research in this location and then buy. Where it acts against a retailer is where two neighbours are selling the same branded product. This is why, for example, some luxury watch brands only have one retailer per town.</p> <p><em>Paul Bagust is associate director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.rics.org/site/\" title=\"\"><em>Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors</em></a></p> <p><strong>Do your research:</strong> Altering services such as electricity and gas can be extremely expensive, so always ensure that the property has adequate mains services and that they are in good order. Ensure that the premises comply with health and safety requirements, including fire regulations and access requirements under disability legislation.</p> <p><em>Rosie Cann is founder and director of </em><a href=\"http://www.popupspace.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Popupspace Ltd</em></a></p> <p><strong>Consider the benefits of a pop-up shop:</strong> We've seen a big change in landlord attitudes to short-term leasing over the past couple of years. This is driven by the glut of empty shops but also by the use of the pop-up concept by big retail brands. It's sometimes possible to secure bargain deals \u2013 in quieter locations we can sometimes negotiate rent-free terms, where the occupier pays business rates only. Pop-up is not a cheap option if you want a prime location, but the benefits of trading without the commitment (or repairing liabilities) of a long lease are obvious. For our clients, the advantages of pop-up leasing are as much about PR as they are about retail.</p> <p><strong>Talk to other retailers in the area:</strong> Your potential neighbours will have information you can't buy anywhere.</p> <p><em>Bill Grimsey is a customer services expert in the retail sector. He has worked for Tesco, Wickes, The Big Food group and Focus DIY</em></p> <p><strong>E-commerce will become increasingly important:</strong> I anticipate that within five years, 50% of non-food shopping will be online. As online shopping accelerates at an ever-increasing pace, small retailers need to be smarter than ever before. Getting your product to market online is a must for retailers, big or small.</p> <p><strong>Consider negotiating:</strong> Everyone should recognise that retail landlords are experiencing the worst conditions that they have ever encountered in the past 30 years. Like any supply-and-demand situation, the time is ripe for retailers to negotiate more realistic terms with landlords who don't want empty units. Look for partnership with landlords, as retailers and landlords are in this together.</p> <p><em>Richard Jenkings is a lead consultant at </em><a href=\"http://www.experian.co.uk/hp/index-a.html\" title=\"\"><em>Experian</em></a></p> <p><strong>Make sure you've got a good credit history:</strong> A potential tenant will make their life easier if they make sure their personal credit history is good. When a business is starting up, it is obviously harder to persuade a landlord that they are a good bet. If they do not have a past track record for the business, they will look at what information they can get about the individual.</p> <p>Our data has shown many times that retailers get higher sales in places with more competitors. But competition rises as shopping centres and high streets get bigger and better. For most small retailers, they are not the destination for the customer. The destination is the place itself. If you are located in a better place which has more competition and where rents and leases are higher, then you will take more money.</p> <p><em>Des Mulholland is a</em><a href=\"http://www.theretailconsultant.net/\" title=\"\"><em> retail management consultant</em></a></p> <p><strong>Think long and hard before relocating:</strong> If you want to relocate your business, ask yourself if it is really the location that has been your downfall rather than poor business management. Have you made the right decision in deciding on your current location? Are your current trading figures poor because of the location or mis-management of the business? Although location is important, all the other facets of a non-successful business need to be analysed before you consider relocation. Relocation is such an expensive undertaking for a successful business, never mind for one that is underperforming. There are instances where relocation is very much the incorrect decision; the costs associated with the move are usually prohibitive.</p> <p><em>Jaana Jatyri is CEO of the global trend forecaster </em><a href=\"http://www.trendstop.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Trendstop.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>How can you demonstrate your strengths to a landlord?</strong> Apart from being able to show strong commercial credentials in terms of financing of the operations, one option could be to show that the venture has broader appeal, or an interesting concept.

  "<p>This is getting silly. The new environment secretary Owen Paterson has been widely accused of being a climate change sceptic, a serious charge for the holder of his post in a government pledged by David Cameron to be the \"greenest ever\".</p> <p>The accusation may be a false one and if so it would be very easy to dismiss. So the Guardian asked the environment department's press office: \"What is the secretary of state's view on climate change? Will he deny he's a climate change sceptic?\"</p> <p>It took a long time to get a reply, but here it is, in full. A spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Defra is responsible for a range of issues affecting the environment and the rural economy. One of these issues is the impact of climate change and the Secretary of State is committed to exploring and developing the response required by Government, business and communities.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>You don't need to be a \u00a31000-an-hour lawyer to realise that's not a straight answer. So why didn't we get a straight answer? As ever, the answer must be cock-up or conspiracy.</p> <p>The cock-up theory is somewhat undermined by the statement issued by another new minister accused of lacking green credentials. John Hayes, the new energy minister, has publicly opposed wind farms but quickly put out a statement - in his own name - saying: </p> <blockquote> <p>I am proud to assume the role of energy minister at such a crucial time both for our energy security and for tackling climate change. We face a major challenge to keep the lights on in the most cost-effective way. In achieving this, we must not be over-reliant on any one technology, but build a balanced low carbon mix and make the best use of Britain's domestic energy resources and skilled workforce.</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems new ministers can make pretty clear statements quickly if they want to, which leaves us with a troubling situation.</p> <p>Paterson is on the record as describing wind farms as \"clearly a <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=132\">massive waste of consumers' money</a>\" and apparently asked the cabinet to \"<a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/05/unemployment-is-down-exports-are-booming-but-paterson-hague-and-fox-all-urge-chancellor-to-do-more.html\">end of all energy subsidies</a> and fast-track the exploitation of shale gas\". On the other hand, he has referred in passing at least to <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=79\">climate change as one of the \"long-term challenges\"</a> faced by the UK and he has nowhere questioned the science of climate change, to my knowledge.</p> <p>So which is it? When even the sober FT is calling Paterson a \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2206734e-f76d-11e1-ba54-00144feabdc0.html#axzz25lmVqVOR\">known climate sceptic</a>\", you have a problem that needs solving. The longer you don't, the worse it gets (unless of course the aim is to please climate sceptics). </p> <p>If all of this nonsense is a cock-up, then it is a shambles. If not, then David Cameron has placed a climate sceptic at the head of the environment department in order to seriously hamper the sensible green policies the public has repeatedly said it wants. To place the fringe views of some in the Conservative party above the needs of the nation in this way may be seen in time as one of the most stunningly cynical moves ever made by a prime minister. Only an unequivocal statement from Paterson will show us which of these is correct.</p>",
  "<p>What are my views on London's airport capacity? Please don't ask. I'll drone like a jumbo about bus fares, road pricing, cycle hire or any other aspect of the capital's transport policy, but the interminable wrangles over a third runway at Heathrow, a bigger Stansted or a whole new hub in the Thames estuary expose my conviction vacuum. Whose economic modelling should I be swayed by? How do you weigh the respective costs and benefits of each proposition? How strong is the environmentalist case against increasing capacity at all?</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/gwyntopham\">Gwyn Topham</a> neatly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/06/new-runway-heathrow-airport-alternatives\">demonstrated</a> on Thursday, there are pros and cons to every competing proposal for meeting increasing demand for flights, including turning to Birmingham. Meanwhile, the uncertainty and this week's indications that the Conservatives might drop their opposition to expanding Heathrow have fuelled the latest installment of the most tedious political story in Britain - David Cameron's rivalry with Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Still, at least in this instance the difference of opinion between the Tory mayor and the Tory prime minister is significant, unlike with the usual media confections. On every core issue where London's mayor has palpable power - housing, planning, public transport, policing - Johnson is the PM's obedient servant, which is why the capital would have been better off turning again to Ken Livingstone in May. He has no powers at all over aviation policy, other than to voice opinions. That said, he's making the best of it. The Mayor has long advocated the Thames Estuary option, arguing that it would foster the long-term revitalisation of East London - of itself a noble cause which the Olympics legacy too is intended to advance. </p> <p>As the Paralympics approach their end and normal London political business resumes, opinions about airports will continue to be numerous and varied. I suppose I'd better get round to having one. </p> <p><strong>The Guardian on London</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/05/heathrow-battle-third-runway-ministers\">Battle over third runway at Heathrow as government prepares U-turn</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/05/cross-party-heathrow-airport-talks\">Cross-party Heathrow runway talks to begin</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/06/heathrow-third-runway-noise-grows\">Heathrow's third runway: noise grows, but will it happen?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/06/heathrow-third-runway-travel-and-transport\">Heathrow third runway \u2013 timelime of events</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/06/new-runway-heathrow-airport-alternatives\">What are the alternatives to Heathrow?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/05/london-metropolitan-university-protest-foreign-students\">London Metropolitan University staff and students stage Home Office protest</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/05/battersea-power-station-redevelopment-begin\">Battersea power station redevelopment to begin this year</a></p> <p><strong>London blogosphere</strong><br>After taking a break from blogging, Freewheeler, author of Crap Cycling and Walking in Waltham Forest, has returned, every bit as robust as before.

  "<p>Even without the excitement of the latest <strong>Glencore</strong> and <strong>Xstrata</strong> news, mining shares are in focus on hopes for the global economic outlook.</p> <p>Thursday's bond buying plan announced by the European Central Bank gave a lift to markets, on the basis it would give some breathing space to the beleagured eurozone, despite some concerns about how effective it would be in helping the likes of Spain.</p> <p>News that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/07/china-boosts-economy-infrastructure-plan?CMP=twt_fd\" title=\"\">China planned a host of new infrastructure projects worth \u00a399bn</a> to lift its economy inevitably prompted talk that demand for commodities would increase.</p> <p>So the likes of<strong> Evraz</strong>, the Russian steelmaker part-owned by Roman Abramovich, has risen 20.9p to 247.6p, while <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> has climbed 23p to 622p.</p> <p>As for Xstrata, it is up 54.5p at 1033.5p after mooted merger partner Glencore, down 8p at 384.35p, postponed a shareholder meeting to approve the deal, suggesting it might be prepared to authorise a last minute improvement in terms. Disgrunted investors looked likely to scupper the merger, unhappy with the price being offered.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has dipped 3.11 points to 5774.23 as investors turned their attention from the ECB plan to this afternoon's US non-farm payroll figures. Analysts are expecting an increase of 140,000 jobs in August, particularly after strong private employment data on Thursday. But too strong a number could undermine hopes for another round of quantitative easing in the US - markets had taken a statement at Jackson Hole last week by US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that further measures could be on the cards. There could be some disappointment if the prospect of action at the Fed's meeting next week is undermined. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote> Speculation continues to bubble regarding what steps the Fed may take at next week's FOMC meeting, with expectation rising that we could well see some action. Today's release of US jobs data is probably one of the most important non-farm payrolls reports this year, with respect to this expectation. <br> One thing is certain, it will take a very weak jobs report today for the Fed to even consider QE, and as such markets expecting further loosening from the Fed next week are likely to be very disappointed, especially given yesterday's announcement by the ECB. </blockquote> <p>Back among the risers, banks benefited from the ECB move with <strong>Barclays</strong> 7.25p better at 200.3p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> climbing 6.7p to 240.2p.</p> <p>But defensive stocks are out of favour, with the likes of <strong>British American Tobacco</strong>, down 89p at \u00a331.48, and <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong>, off 54p at \u00a322.90, both falling.

  "<p>Striving to \"do the right thing\" has been the principle underpinning a change in culture at Wales &amp; West Housing over the past few years. It's become a mantra for us: we expect our staff to do the right thing, and in return we do right by them.</p> <p>We've made lots of changes to our working practices, including flexible working arrangements, more family-friendly policies, a stronger focus on health and wellbeing in the workplace \u2013 and we have reaped the performance benefits every year. We believe that people come to work to do a good job and, by creating an environment where they can prosper and grow, we can encourage excellence. Staff have welcomed these changes to their working lives, and they have subsequently eased pressure on pay.</p> <p>In the tough economic climate we now live in, addressing pay concerns has proved a little trickier. Staff see first-hand the difficult circumstances of our residents, and many of our employees live in the communities where we own properties. After reading an article about the living wage in our local paper, we decided it made sense for the policy to play a leading role in our 2012 pay review and pay negotiations with staff.</p> <p>We have a strong and vocal staff council in the association, with active representation from all sections of the company and levels of seniority. In the past few years we have agreed pay increases well below inflation that apply to everyone in the organisation, from chief executive to caretaker. The introduction of a living wage was seen by everyone to be fair to the lowest paid staff and consistent with our values about how people should be treated.</p> <p>The association employs 350 people of which nearly 50 work as cleaners on an hourly rate, some only for a few hours a week. Increasing their hourly pay to the local living wage of \u00a37.20 worked out to be an 8.3% pay increase \u2013 and a rise in our overall wage bill of about \u00a315,000 a year.</p> <p>Every organisation is looking for ways to save money but we have resisted making the savings in staff numbers, their pay or their training. We believe that changes like these would have an impact on morale and the service delivered to residents. We have looked for other ways to balance the books while meeting the growing demand for support from residents and cash-strapped local authorities.</p> <p>To make these savings we have brought repairs services and HR work that had been outsourced back in house. Through creating our new maintenance subsidiary, Cambria, we have saved more than \u00a3200,000 in the first year and secured employment for 40 people. Creative and simple changes like these have allowed us to introduce the living wage and operate in a way that is consistent with our values of being fair, open, responsible, supportive and efficient.</p> <p>The papers are full of stories of big bosses providing themselves with big pay rises, so it's a nice change to see the poorest paid benefit the most from a remuneration policy.</p> <p><em>Anne Hinchey is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.wwha.co.uk/Pages/Home%20Page%20-%20Master.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Wales &amp; West Housing</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you </strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>What did you think when you heard that Kate Winslet wanted to record Mr Gum?</strong></p> <p>I was genuinely astounded, I couldn't believe it was really going to happen. I kept expecting her to come to her senses and call the whole thing off. But no - a few months later, there I was in a London recording studio, watching Kate Winslet recording my books in this unbelievably brilliant, crystal clear, Kate Winslet-y voice. Very surreal. I only hope it doesn't ruin her career, I'd feel bad about that.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think she wanted to do it?</strong></p> <p>She probably needed the money. Either that or she lost a bet.</p> <p><strong>If Kate were a Mr Gum character, who would she be?</strong></p> <p>I think that Kate has a lot in common with my heroine, Polly. They both have an unshakeable optimism and sense of fair play, and they're both incredibly determined characters who get things done whatever it takes. (Incidentally, Polly was James Cameron's first choice for Titanic but he changed his mind when he found out she was only nine years old and didn't really exist in certain crucial ways.)</p> <p><strong>Describe Kate in five words?</strong></p> <p>Exists in certain crucial ways.</p> <p><strong>What was the last book that you read?</strong></p> <p>A Clash of Kings by George RR Martin. It's the second in the epic Game of Thrones series. I'm not a big fantasy fan, I'm just reading it to see what all the fuss is about and slowly getting drawn in\u2026</p> <p><strong>Which fictional character would you most like to be?</strong></p> <p>Police Chief Martin Brody. I read Jaws by Peter Benchley when I was eight (it was the first 'grown-up' book I ever read) and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I really liked the sense of this self-contained island community, and how Chief Brody was in this uniquely difficult position and how he was the one who had to step up to the plate and do something about it. I didn't consciously think of it in those terms, of course - I was only eight. But it seemed a very cosy and clear-cut world. And I mean, he faces off with a 25-foot great white shark. He's the coolest.</p> <p><strong>Which fictional character could you fall in love with?</strong></p> <p>Ellen Brody. If I'm going to be her fictional husband, it seems only polite to fall in love with her. Plus she's pretty hot in the film.<br><strong><br>Which book do you think everybody should read?</strong></p> <p>That's a really hard question, because some of my favourite books are not for everybody. So, after much thought: Of Mice and Men or The Great Gatsby. Just because they're such perfect, elegant, measured, universally truthful pieces. Everyone can get something out of them.</p> <p><strong>Where do you most like to read?</strong></p> <p>Bed's the best place to read. The runner up is while dining alone in cheap restaurants, preferably when it's raining outside. (If it's raining inside, it must be a really cheap restaurant.)</p> <p><strong>Where do you most like to write?</strong></p> <p>At home at my desk. Occasionally, when I'm really stuck, I'll try going to a caf\u00e9, but you just spend most of the time rearranging the coffee mug and getting cake crumbs all over your t-shirt and then there'll be some noisy conversation at the next table or the music's annoying or the chair's too uncomfortable. Writing at home's best because you have control over the environment. </p> <p><strong>If you were a superhero what would your superpower be?</strong></p> <p>All the good ones are already taken, aren't they? I bet I'd end up with a rubbish one, like the power to teleport figs over short distances. Or the power to almost guess people's birthdays correctly.</p> <p><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to aspiring writers?</strong></p> <p>Get to the end of the first draft. That's the hardest part. Don't polish it and edit it and worry it as you go along, or you'll never get there. Just get there and get there ugly and get there whatever it takes.</p> <p><strong>What is the weirdest thing a fan has ever said and/or given to you? </strong></p> <p>I've been given a cake made with eggs laid by chickens named after my characters, that was pretty strange but I'm not complaining, it was delicious. Another family named their cats Mr Gum and Billy William the Third, and proudly presented me with a photocopy of their last vet's bill to prove it. Kids ask amazingly strange questions at book events, so I've got plenty to choose from. Here are some of my favourites: \"What was the first mug you remember?\"; \"Can you mend my keyring, it's broken?\" and, from Edinburgh last year, the truly memorable \"Why is your nose so big?\"</p> <p><strong>Can you tell us a joke please?</strong></p> <p>Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?

  "<p>Heritage minister John Penrose met with planning and heritage groups last month to discuss his department's proposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/sep/03/apply-attend-local-government-quarterly-september\" title=\"\">shake-up of conservation</a>. His plans, which include outsourcing the work of conservation officers to the private sector, have drawn fierce criticism since they were published in July. After a lightning-fast consultation, discussions have now commenced in an attempt to reach some kind of compromise with critics, who believe the proposal is tantamount to privatising the role of the local authority conservation officer.</p> <p>Government ministers believe developers of listed buildings should appoint accredited agents to produce conservation reports for each restoration or development they carry out. These agents \u2013 who would most likely be architects, but could also be planning consultants or surveyors \u2013 would submit reports to local authorities, certifying applications as acceptable. Councils \"would normally be expected to follow this recommendation\".</p> <p>Planning and heritage experts are concerned about the lack of impartiality this model provides, with the developer appointing the agent to write the conservation report for its own application. Andrew Matheson, network manager of the <a href=\"http://www.rtpi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Town Planning Institute's</a> historic environment group, says: \"We're unenthusiastic about the idea that the democratic process might be circumvented. The notion that a report might not require the input of the local authority planning or conservation officer is not something we would support.\"</p> <p>The plan is intended to help tackle the lack of conservation officers in local government; the number of staff in the role has fallen by 21.8% since 2008. But Vincent Haines, a spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.planningofficers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Planning Officers Society</a>, says the need for experts in local government who can check the independence of conservation reports would negate any potential benefit. \"This proposal doesn't have the potential to tackle the problem [of reduced numbers of conservation officers],\" he says. \"The local planning authority will still have to assess and consult on the application.\"</p> <p><strong>Diminishing numbers</strong></p> <p>Some fear that the plan could even exacerbate the lack of conservation officers in local government. Faced with a diminished role in the listed-building consent process, there are fears that planning departments will choose to divert funds away from conservation completely. Kate Pugh, chief executive at the <a href=\"http://www.theheritagealliance.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Heritage Alliance</a>, says she believes the proposals could be seen as a green light to shed conservation officers. \"We do understand local authorities are under huge pressures,\" she says. \"Certainly we want to look at ways of streamlining the listed building procedures so that conservation officers can get on with other aspects of their work, but not as an excuse to get rid of them.\"</p> <p>Jane Kennedy, architect and partner at historic building consultancy <a href=\"http://www.purcelluk.com/\" title=\"\">Purcell</a>, says there may be cases when the private sector can support local government in relation to conservation. But she stresses that work must be commissioned by the public sector if it is to be objective. \"The way planning has moved over the last few years, more and more work is done by the applicant,\" she says. \"But you still need the public authority to assess applications. If an agent is paid by the building owner, they can't ever really be independent. As a practice we have taken on work on behalf of a local authority which didn't have a conservation officer. But we were paid by the local authority to review applications on their behalf. That is quite different.\"</p> <p><strong>Consultation queries</strong></p> <p>Given the level of concern about the proposals, the government consultation process was deemed to be lacking. A short window of just four weeks was given for responses, a period which coincided with both the 2012 Olympic Games and parliamentary recess. At least 10 national organisations wrote to criticise the government's approach to the consultation.</p> <p>Last week's meeting suggests the government is now seeking more detailed feedback on its proposals. The <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\" title=\"\">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>, which was among those who objected to the outsourcing plan, said discussions were \"productive and positive\". But for many, the only positive result from discussions will be if the idea of outsourcing is dropped.</p> <p>Hugh Ellis, chief planner at the Town and Country Planning Association, says: \"We're losing massive amounts of expertise from planning. This new regime has the potential to hollow out the planning system. That's what happens when you financially impoverish it and undermine the status and expertise of those within it.</p> <p>\"It's not that I don't think consultants could do the job. But what is the government trying to achieve with this move? If this is about cost saving, heritage assets will be put at risk.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",

Windows Phone 7 already has a good number of slick, well-designed apps that make good use of the OS' key features.</p> <p>What's far more thin on the ground, though, are case studies of developers making good money from those apps. When I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/jun/18/windows-phone-apps-development\">talked to five in June 2012</a>, four of them declined to even provide download figures, let alone revenues.</p> <p>Case studies of developers making money sell the dream best of all, and Ballmer's words at the Lumia event only underscored the fact that \u2013&#xa0;in the mobile world at least \u2013&#xa0;the last several dozen developers who \"hit it really, really big\" were making iOS apps.</p> <p>That's the big challenge for Microsoft and Nokia. Ballmer's 400m-devices-in-the-next-year figure is one clarion call for developers, but it may fall on deaf ears for mobile developers who aren't looking to extend onto PCs, which will make up the largest portion of the 400m devices.</p> <p>Nokia's launch sold the dream, a bit. The two new Lumia phones \u2013 the flagship 920 in particular \u2013&#xa0;look very good. But we don't know their exact launch date and rollout plans, their prices or the level of support from mobile operators.</p> <p>The latter is a really important point, because the Windows Phone 8 ecosystem will struggle to be lucrative for app developers until it's Windows Phones that are being recommended rather than Android handsets when people wander into a shop or ring their operator for an upgrade that isn't an iPhone.</p> <p>Much remains mysterious about Windows Phone 8, too, although Microsoft is promising a proper reveal of its new features in the next few weeks. Developers will be all ears, but many will hold off until then on committing significant resources to Windows Phone 8 in 2013 and beyond.</p> <p>These aren't necessarily criticisms of the Lumia launch event, but a matter-of-fact explanation of why it won't have moved the needle for many developers further than Nokia's efforts already have.</p> <p>Elop said during the event that having passed 100,000 apps, Windows Phone is \"growing three times faster than before Nokia joined\" on that score, and the company has a growing stable of well-known brands and entertainment companies making apps for its devices.</p> <p>Here's the thing: most app developers I meet aren't fanboys, supporting platforms based on their love or hate of Google, Apple, Microsoft or RIM. They're pragmatists who want to do good work, and make money from it.</p> <p>From what we've seen so far, they can certainly do good work on Windows Phone. The next few months will be crucial for Microsoft and Nokia to come up with the goods to provide proof \u2013&#xa0;or at least a convincing dream \u2013 of the money-making.</p> <p>If they deliver on their promises, maybe we'll see that really, really big hit app on a Windows Phone in 2013.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on 6 September 2012 to correct Google's Android daily activations figure from 1bn to 1m.

  "<p>What sets Thailand apart from the rest of East Asia, in social enterprise terms, is genuine government backing. So says Tommy Hutchinson, founder of <a href=\"http://i-genius.org/home/\" title=\"\">i-genius</a>, a global network of social entrepreneurs. \"And, perhaps outside China and India, it has the most sophisticated structural support for social enterprise. There are lots of people building the sector.\"</p> <p>In 2008, when i-genius held a world summit on social entrepreneurship in Phuket, Hutchinson sensed that the sector was about to take off there.</p> <p>The following year, the Thai government and a number of civil society organisations formed the National Social Enterprise Committee to increase awareness of the sector and access to finance.</p> <p>To cement its commitment, it then formed the <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/thai-social-enterprise-office-tseo-\" title=\"\">Thai Social Enterprise Office</a> (TSEO) \u2013 similar to the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/big-society\" title=\"\">UK's Office of Civil Society</a> \u2013 last year, dedicating $3.2m worth of funding.</p> <p>\"There have been two or three years of good government support now, and the King is also a huge backer of social enterprise,\" says Hutchinson.</p> <p>It's the younger generation that seems to be really embracing the movement, according to Hutchinson.</p> <p>\"We have one of our biggest networks in Thailand, and the members are, on average, younger than in the other countries. They are quite international in their outlook and are very sophisticated users of social media,\" he says.</p> <p>Sunit Shrestha, director of <a href=\"http://www.changefusion.org/\" title=\"\">Change Fusion</a> \u2013 a social enterprise foundation and investment organisation \u2013 is working to keep the youth momentum going. He has created a community of youth-led social enterprises, linking them with professional mentors and funders.</p> <p>Shrestha is also a prominent Ashoka fellow and has brought <a href=\"http://www.unltd.in.th/\" title=\"\">UnLtd</a> office into the country with Thai government funding ($100,000).</p> <p>Through Change Fusion, certain sections of the government have started to contract youth-led social enterprises. \"There are a number of different contracts and partnerships, for example with Open Dream, a technology social enterprise focused on providing universal web access for visually impaired people,\" he says.</p> <p>The Thai Social Enterprise Office also contracts a social enterprise called MiniMe for its communications. Various government agencies have commissioned social enterprises to carry out preparation for disasters.</p> <p>While Shrestha feels that the new prime minister \u2013 who came to power last June \u2013 has had less time for social enterprise than the last, there does, on the whole, appear to be a lot of political support for the sector.</p> <p>The TSEO is now halfway through its five-year master plan and there is much happening in the world of social investment in the country, including work with Thailand's stock exchange to encourage investment in social enterprise and ethical business.</p> <p>It's estimated that there are about 116,000 social enterprises in the country, many of which are in their early stages and needing investment. Some, such as the social entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/kongkiat-kespetchara\" title=\"\">Kongkiat Kespechara</a>, aim to make deep changes to life in Thailand.</p> <p>Another Ashoka fellow, Kespechara has developed a management information system called Hospital OS, which helps small hospitals in rural areas be more efficient in helping disadvantaged people.</p> <p>Other prime fields for Thai social entrepreneurs are sustainable tourism, healthcare, alternative energy and recycling. The highest numbers are in the agricultural and forestry sectors, according to Change Fusion's Thailand Social Enterprise Landscape Report, out this month.</p> <p>Most are set up in a similar way to UK social enterprises. However, in a definite departure from the structure here, some have been formed by the government itself.</p> <p>Social enterprises set up by private companies as a separate entity also exist, a type of business which will perhaps also become popular in the UK in the coming years.</p> <p>By the end of this year, the social enterprise movement in this part of South East Asia could look quite different again, with several further developments planned, particularly in the area of social investment.</p> <p>As well as working with the stock exchange, the TSEO is looking into tax incentives for investors and for social enterprises themselves. It's also working on common social impact measurement standards.</p> <p>In addition, TSEO has said it will spend at least 30 million baht on a pilot loan and equity funds scheme this year, which supporters keenly hope will help develop the capacity of the sector.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Homes and offices in Glasgow could be warmed by water pumped from far underground after geologists surveyed a vast network of old mine shafts beneath the Scottish city.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">British Geological Survey</a> (BGS) mapped the mine workings to help developers identify pools of warm, subterranean water that could be used as a source of heat for homes and businesses.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/britishsciencefestival/\" title=\"\">British Science Festival in Aberdeen</a> on Thursday, BGS scientists unveiled 3D maps that showed groundwater could be tapped from a flooded network of disused coalmines.</p> <p>\"The mine workings are hugely extensive. Perhaps 50% of the Glasgow conurbation sits above them,\" said <a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/staff/profiles/0116.html\">Diarmad Campbell</a> of the BGS.</p> <p>Rather than circulating the water through new, dedicated boreholes to draw out heat from surrounding rocks, heat could be extracted directly from water in the mine system. The groundwater would be cooled, depositing the heat extracted from it at the surface, before being returned underground.</p> <p>Already demonstrated locally in a successful housing project, the new survey \u2013 produced with Glasgow City Council \u2013 shows where the heating technique could be used.</p> <p>The flooded mines could provide up to 40% of Glasgow's heating requirements, and similar levels could be reached in other UK locations that overlie mine workings.</p> <p>Dave Banks, from geology consultancy Holymoor in Derbyshire, said that while Britain's use of the technology lagged behind Germany and Sweden, interest was growing. There are now around 10,000 heat pumps installed in the UK compared with only nine in 1999.</p> <p>In some parts of the world, upwelling heat from inside the Earth turns groundwater to steam, providing a free and plentiful supply of energy. But even away from these hotspots, the warming of the ground by sunlight still traps enough energy to heat water to a useful temperature.</p> <p>At \u00a310,000-\u00a315,000 per home, ground heat pumps in the UK are relatively expensive to install. But they are economical for large developments, and once installed, are cheap to run. The pumps circulate ground water through heat exchangers, using a process similar to that found in refrigerators.</p> <p>Water pumped from the ground reaches only modest temperatures in the UK \u2013 around body temperature \u2013 but that is enough for underfloor heating.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome back to the political season. After weeks of sporting entertainment like no other and days spent on the sunloungers, Westminster is back with a bang.</p> <p>Almost exactly half way through the current parliament, David Cameron has not just reshuffled his team but showed his ruthless streak in ditching a number of ministers whom, he felt, had not lived up to expectation. </p> <p>With the 2015 general election in prospect, the watchword for ministers now will be \"delivery\", for inside Downing Street the fear is not that the policies that the coalition is pursuing to get growth are wrong, but that the Whitehall machine is not delivering them anywhere near quickly enough.</p> <p>Cue therefore the no nonsense Chris Grayling moving to justice secretary, the Conservative tough guy, Michael Fallon moving to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the political bruiser, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-patrick-mcloughlin-transport?newsfeed=true\">Patrick McLoughlin </a>taking over as transport secretary. It is on shoulders such as these that David Cameron will be hoping to deliver on the government's core objectives on economic growth and to toughen its record on crime and punishment.</p> <p>All well and good, or at least understandable. But for northern England, little can be expected from the reshuffle. With Dewsbury-born Lady Warsi being demoted from Conservative party chair and the Hazel Grove MP, <a href=\"http://andrewstunell.org.uk/\">Andrew Stunell </a>losing his post at the Department for Communities, based on minor appointments made so far, there is just one extra northern MP in government. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395822853\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2010/10/19/1287500082219/Budget-Chris-Huhne-and-An-001.jpg\" alt=\"Budget: Chris Huhne and Andrew Stunnell and Danny Alexander\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liberal Democrat losing out: Andrew Stunnell, centre, helped negotiate the coalition in 2010 with colleagues Chris Huhne and Danny Alexander.

But there is something far more fundamental at issue: the persistent attention being given to London and the south-east as the hub of growth.</p> <p>Yes, it was not that long ago that the Department for Transport <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/jul/16/cameron-clegg-rail-investment-politics-live\">announced</a> a substantial package of investment in the Northern Hub and rail routes between the north and London but I am far from the only northerner to wonder what impact these will have for now. Such projects are a long way from actually happening. </p> <p>So what then of the next big transport project: namely whether or not Heathrow should have a third runway or if an entirely new airport is needed in the south-east? Whatever the answer might be post-Olympics, the issue shows again that ministerial attention is focused not on the north and unlocking its potential, but on a major infrastructure project which overwhelmingly stands to benefit southern England.</p> <p>As the new \"team Cameron\" gets to work, the voice of the north at the top table will be no more stronger and with an increasingly outspoken mayor of London on our TV screens on a near daily basis, one wonders how our regions can best gain a voice and reposition themselves as a place that can kickstart UK plc. Perhaps directly-elected mayors would work to provide the stronger, visible leadership the region needs, not just on a city basis, but regionally too. We might have rejected them last time round but if we consider deeply, is the current system of local government, comprised of many councillors most of us have not voted for, let alone heard of, being managed by officers with fancy titles, really working in our best interests? </p> <p>I've lost count of the number of conferences I've attended in the region at which the same faces crop up over and over again. What do they achieve? The point is simple \u2013 we now have a situation in which there are no big hitters from the region, beating the drum for the north in government. We therefore have to create our own to counter the daily stream of Boris TV we currently get on the news. </p> <p>If the current incumbent of No 10 fears the prospect of going down as a one-term prime minister he may live to regret the lack of attention he has given to northern England. There is a very real danger that without high-profile ministerial muscle from the north we are in danger of witnessing a continued path towards a disunited kingdom as the north and south begin to resemble very different places.</p> <p><strong>What do you think?

  "<p>It's been an hour and the group of volunteers aboard the rickety fishing boat are still yet to spot a Yangtze finless porpoise, known as jiangzhu or \"river pig\". Thirty years ago, when they numbered 2,000, the mammals could be seen from the shore here dancing on Dongting Lake in the sludge-coloured waves. Now there are about 85 jiangzhu here. As Xu Yaping, the patrol's chief, peers through the haze, and coal barges and dredgers churn the lake, the chance of encountering this ancient creature seems remote.</p> <p>The jiangzhu's survival is not guaranteed. Since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/aug/08/endangeredspecies.conservation\" title=\"\">the official extinction of the baiji, a river dolphin, in 2007</a>, the porpoise is the only cetacean inhabiting the Yangtze River and two connecting freshwater lakes, Dongting and Poyang, China's largest. It's estimated there are around 1,200 jiangzhu living in the wild \u2013 two-thirds less than a decade earlier. The species is decreasing at a rate of 6.4% a year, making it rarer than China's national treasure, the giant panda.</p> <p>A spike in deaths this year is causing experts renewed anxiety. In April WWF China expressed \"deep concern\" over the deaths of 32 porpoise in 2012. At the current rate of decline, the jiangzhu is set to follow the baiji into extinction in 10-15 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395752151\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/9/5/1346845022306/inless-porpoise-are-seen--008.jpg\" alt=\"inless porpoise are seen on the busy Dongting Lake in Hunan province, China\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In this undated photograph released by Yangtze Finless Porpoise Conservation Society, two finless porpoise are seen on the busy Dongting Lake in Hunan province, China. Photograph: Courtesy YFPCS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy YFPCS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Our children will benefit from the GDP we created and the buildings we built for them,\" says Xu Yaping, a journalist and jiangzhu activist who founded the Yangtze Finless Porpoise Conservation Society in Yueyang in January. \"But how healthy is the environment we're leaving them? I can't fathom how we can let an animal as intelligent as the finless porpoise just disappear. Our grandchildren will shame us when they ask why.\"</p> <p>That question lingers over the memory of the baiji. Once known as the \"goddess of the Yangtze\", the long-nosed freshwater dolphin \u2013 which lived on Earth for 25 million years \u2013 was declared extinct after a trawl of the Yangtze by an international team of scientists.</p> <p>The reasons behind the baiji's extinction mirror those threatening the jiangzhu. Dongting, which is 880 square miles, is crowded with container ships, sand dredgers and speedboats. Propellers are often undetected by the jiangzhu, who use sonar to navigate the murky waters of the Yangtze River basin. Snaring and long-line fishing are in common use, as is the illegal practice of electrofishing, which claimed the lives of at least two porpoise this year, according to the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395752152\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/9/4/1346773288673/River-fish-species-deplet-008.jpg\" alt=\"River fish species depletion due to electro-fishing featuring finless porpoises, Hunan province\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A father with his son looks at a poster featuring finless porpoises and warning about river fish species depletion due to electro-fishing in Hunan province.

Jiang Yong, head of WWF China in Changsha, says there are 40% fewer fish in the Yangtze than a decade ago. Sand dredging disturbs spawning ground, and the Three Gorges dam upriver adds to the decline of fish. Factory chimneys lining Dongting Lake are crowned with smoke clouds.</p> <p>On the lake, a shout from He Daming, a volunteer, wakes up the patrol. Bobbing inky orbs in the distance announce a family of jiangzhou having breakfast, to the backdrop of a coal barge.</p> <p>Each day Xu Yaping's team patrols the Yangtze, tracking illegal fishing practices. Educating residents through self-financed advertising is part of their campaign, as is sweetening local officials. But when Xu mentions the government from his desk in the Hunan Daily bureau, he breaks into a shout. \"The jiangzhu here are disappearing at the fastest rate of the Yangtze basin,\" he says, \"but Dongting still has no conservation centre. We've never had a penny of support, and are considered meddling. The officials say the country's development relies on putting people first. This kind of <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chop_logic\" title=\"\">choplogic</a> excuses their negligence.\"</p> <p>In the observatory of the IHB's conservation centre in Wuhan, a jiangzhou presses its nose against the aquarium glass, following the finger of a keeper. Another blows bubbles, forming a ring of oxygenated pearls. It balances the ring on its nose, before whipping through the middle.</p> <p>This graceful and highly intelligent animal is famed for its ugliness. According to legend, the baiji is the reincarnation of a young princess who jumped into the Yangtze to escape the clutches of a wealthy landowner. When a sudden wind capsized the landowner's boat he became a \"river pig\".</p> <p>Wang Ding, a professor at IHB and China's leading jiangzhu expert, likens them to the girl next door. \"The baiji was very beautiful but difficult to get close to,\" Wang says. \"The porpoise likes to interact, to chat and play. It's a lovely animal.\" Wang, who is observing the seven porpoise living at the centre, says the jiangzhu is \"strong\". His team estimates they entered the Yangtze 100,000 years ago. Are human beings the reason this animal is nearly extinct? \"Yes, that is the only reason actually,\" he says.</p> <p>Yet Wang remains cautiously optimistic about the fate of the river pig. He's buoyed by the success of a conservation project at Tian-ezhou, a protected oxbow lake that was once part of the Yangtze. Five jiangzhu were introduced there in 1990; today there are 40.</p> <p>\"The attitude of both the public and government is changing,\" says Wang. \"Now the government at least says, 'OK, let's talk about this', even if they don't do much.\" Conservation efforts should get a boost when the jiangzhu receives an expected and overdue upgrade to the first tier of endangered species (the list was drafted in 1989). In the second tier, bureaucracy often blocks local governments from reform. Wang says that sort of inaction will mean the jiangzhu is lost.</p> <p>The thought is difficult to reconcile. As the keepers head upstairs, one jiangzhu remains hovering in the water, rotating its fins in response to the waves goodbye. As it dips its head for a moment it forms a suspended silver question mark, before pivoting to swim into the gloom.</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by Xia Keyu</p>",

If it really succeeds, it could even draw developers out of the wider Android Market and into the Amazon app store exclusively. Once that starts to happen, Google will have a dilemma: is it good or bad if more of the money being made out of Android app sales is going to someone else? Will Amazon lock out rival tablet makers such as Samsung from its app store? (I expect so.) Is that good or bad for Android on tablets? What should Google do?</p> <p> And there's Google's problem. Its relationship with its users is too like Microsoft's. Instead it needs to be more like Amazon. But competing there would cause problems too.

Or it could be by advertising, which was also curiously absent from Bezos's pitch today.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HSbhyaH0vw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">OIS on Nokia Lumia 920 &gt;&gt; YouTube</a></h2> <p>Nokia showing its image stabilisation. Honestly.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/09/06/an-apology-is-due/\">An apology is due &gt;&gt; Nokia Conversations</a></h2> <p>The official Nokia blog: </p> <blockquote> <p>We're excited about the Lumia 920 and the ground-breaking PureView imaging capabilities we announced today.</p> <p> In an effort to demonstrate the benefits of optical image stabilization (which eliminates blurry images and improves pictures shot in low light conditions), we produced a video that simulates what we will be able to deliver with OIS.</p> <p> Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but we should have posted a disclaimer stating this was a representation of OIS only. This was not shot with a Lumia 920. At least, not yet. We apologize for the confusion we created.</p> </blockquote> <p> One suspects cock-up rather than conspiracy. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2012/09/06/positioning-lumia/\">Positioning Lumia &gt;&gt; asymco</a></h2> <p>US smartphone penetration has hit 50%, according to ComScore numbers. So: </p> <blockquote> <p>The changing character of competition will need to be reflected in product strategies. Non-consumption is typically an easier competitor to beat with features. Switching users from a comparable product is harder and may require pricing pressure. To solve this in a time of transition, new products will have to split into a set offered to new users and another set offered to switch users.</p> <p> You can see the pressure of this on the Windows Phone platform most of all. As a late comer, does the Lumia range from Nokia fit the bill as targeting non-consumers or switchers?</p> <p> In other words, has the brand been positioned as a \"better\" smartphone or as a \"good enough\" smartphone? It matters because the \"good enough\" position has been held by Android overall while the \"better\" position has been held by iPhone. However, not exclusively. We've seen \"better\" positioning from Samsung's Galaxy S and Verizon's Droid brand and \"good enough\" positioning from the older variants of iPhones.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://sammyhub.com/2012/09/06/samsung-sells-20m-galaxy-s-iii-units/\">Samsung sells 20m Galaxy S III Units &gt;&gt; Sammy Hub</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Samsung has confirmed that the global sales of their Galaxy S III flagship phone has reached 20m units. The phone reached the sales milestone in just 100 days and averaged about 200,000 units every day, making it the fastest selling phone in Samsung's history.</p> <p> Samsung has sold about 6m units in Europe, 4.5m in Asia, 4m in North America and 2.5m in South Korea.</p> </blockquote> <p> Faint quibble is that the \"sale\" is to carriers, so is what analysts call shipments (since we're not certain they've all been activated). But still, that's a lot of phones.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/5/17/7-lessons-learned-while-building-reddit-to-270-million-page.html\">Seven lessons learned while building Reddit to 270m page views a month &gt;&gt; High Scalability</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>The essence of this lesson is: don't worry about the schema.</p> <p> [Reddit's builders] used to spend a lot of time worrying about the database, keeping everthing nice and normalized. You shouldn't have to worry about the database. Schema updates are very slow when you get bigger. Adding a column to 10m rows takes locks and doesn't work. They used replication for backup and for scaling. Schema updates and maintaining replication is a pain. They would have to restart replication and could go a day without backups. Deployments are a pain because you have to orchestrate how new software and new database upgrades happen together.</p> <p> Instead, they keep a Thing Table and a Data Table. Everything in Reddit is a Thing: users, links, comments, subreddits, awards, etc. Things keep common attribute like up/down votes, a type, and creation date. The Data table has three columns: thing id, key, value. There's a row for every attribute. There's a row for title, url, author, spam votes, etc. When they add new features they didn't have to worry about the database anymore.</p> </blockquote> <p> Two tables for the whole of Reddit. That's Third Normal Form and decades of teaching about database optimisation thrown out the window.</p> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.
