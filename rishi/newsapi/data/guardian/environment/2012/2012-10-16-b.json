There was more drama in the ninth inning than there was for the first eight innings combined, but the Detroit Tigers managed to hang on to a 2-1 lead, thanks mostly to a strong eight plus inning from Justin Verlander. The Detroit Tigers now have a commanding 3-0 ALCS lead over the New York Yankees.</p> <p>It feels like all signs point to the New York Yankees getting swept tomorrow for the ALCS Game 4, but they will have C.C. Sabbathia going for them, second only to Justin Verlander in guys you want on the mound in an potential elimination game. We'll be liveblogging that game here at 8:00pm EST, not to mention Game 3 of the NLCS between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals at 4:00pm EST. Hope you'll be there. That will be all from us tonight, however, so thanks to everyone who followed along with us and especially those who chose to contribute.

This is starting to bring up bad memories of the 9th inning of ALCS Game 1.</p> <p>Raul Ibanez is up in the ninth inning with a chance to tie or win the game. This is a frightening situation for Detroit considering recent events. The first pitch? Just outside, ball one.</p> <p>Think these hitters are glad to not be facing Verlander anymore? Nick Swisher is on-deck, he will pinch-hit for Russell Martin if it gets to that. Ibanez takes ball two. I wouldn't give him anything to drive either, Mr. Coke. Ibanez takes a mighty hack at 2-0, everybody knows what he wants to do. 2-1. Coke throws him a fastball out of the zone to see if Ibanez will chase, but it's too far outside. 3-1. Hitter's count on the 9th Inning Home Run Specialist.</p> <p>Ibanez fouls it off. 3-2. The Yankees are down to their last strike for their third straight batter. If they had put together at-bats like this for most of the series they would be the ones about to take a 3-0 series lead.</p> <p>Ibanez fouls off another one. Still 3-2. He swings and misses at a breaking ball and it's all over! The Tigers have won!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e26a6c0e361310bc6d07e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:31:50.942Z\">4.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jayson Nix is in to run for Teixeira, representing the tying run. Robinson Cano is in to face Phil Coke. Cano takes the first pitch for ball one. Cano just doesn't want to make the last out of the game here, forget ending any hitless streak.</p> <p>Cano takes the next pitch for a ball. Raul Ibanez is on deck, remember. The Tigers do NOT want to see him. Coke throws Cano a strike. 2-1. Cano fouls the next one to play, the rain is falling and the Yankees are again down to their finally strike. Holy crap is it LOOOOOOUD in Comerica.</p> <p>Coke gets the sign. 2-2, Cano slaps in a base hit to end a 0-29 hitless streak. There are runners on first and second for the Yankees! We have... DRAMA!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e25c5c0e361310bc6d07d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:28:05.844Z\">4.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mark Teixeira is out next. He's still representing the tying run remember. Coke starts him off with a strike as well. Teixeira takes the next pitch for a ball, and then fouls one off to fall behind 1-2. The Tigers are just a strike away, and, thankfully, are not facing the St. Louis Cardinals in this situation.</p> <p>Teixeira takes the next pitch. It's a ball. 2-2. The crowd is LOUD. The set and the pitch... and it's just outside. 3-2. The crowd is loud AND mad now. Full count, the struggling Cano on deck. Teixeira hits the next one foul. Pitcher and hitter do this again. Coke takes a sign form Avila.</p> <p>Teixeira hits a base hit to keep the Yankees alive!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e24ed58f91d7bbadac75e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:24:29.290Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ichiro takes a strike. 0-1.

Ichiro hits a bouncing ball to Infante on the next pitch, and the Tigers are one out away from taking a 3-0 lead in the ALCS.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e24a158f91d7bbadac75c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:23:14.155Z\">4.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jim Leyland wants Coke to finish up this game.

I'm just going to bring up that factoid.</p> <p>The first pitch to Brett Gardner? A strike. The crowd, buoyed by Leyland's decision, cheers this one loudly. Gardner takes a ball, 1-1, and then fouls one off, 1-2. </p> <p>Gardner is following Nunez's lead, fouling off pitches and either waiting for a mistake or trying to get him out of this game. Gardner takes the next pitch. 2-2. Verlander's at 129. Nobody is out, nobody is on. Gardner fouls off yet another pitch. He's still throwing gas at 98 mph. Gardner hits another one foul. Gardner might be ending Verlander's complete game chances in this at-bat.</p> <p>Gardner finally hits a grounder back to Verlander, who finishes the play, and that will be it for Verlander who receives the loudest ovation of the night. What a job from Verlander. I say that every start it seems, but it's true.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e232058f91d7bbadac75a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:16:49.126Z\">4.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>HOME RUN!</strong> Eduardo Nunez is out, and he falls behind 0-2 before I can even figure out who is hitting. The crowd is noisy-as-heck, like exactly how loud New Yankee Stadium wasn't (except for the booing). Verlander's 0-2 pitch is in the dirt. 1-2. Nunez laces the next one foul into the seats, oof hope that didn't hit anybody.</p> <p>Still a 1-2 count, Nunez fouls off another one. Just keep making him throw pitches, he's at 120. Leyland can't let him pitch into infinity. Nunez hits another screaming liner that just goes foul. Verladner throws another ball, I wonder if those line drives are a sign that he's fading a bit here. Nunez swings at 2-2, fouling off another one, a 99 mph fastball. Just a great, great at-bat from Nunez here. The Yankees want to see the bullpen right here.</p> <p>Nunez hammers a hanging breaking ball that Dirks can't catch it The crowd is stunned!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e21ebc0e361310bc6d078\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:11:40.115Z\">4.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 0 - Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The bad news for the Yankees?

Why? I have no clue. We are on full midges alert here in Michigan. Omar Infante hits a flyball off him, but like most flyballs this evening that one's not going out. It's just an out.</p> <p>Leyland has his bullpen up just in case, I imagine he doesn't want to wait too long for going to it after the decision not to bring in Octavio Dotel in Game 1.

The last thing anybody wants is a rain out, except maybe the Yankees since that seems to be the only way they could get Verlander out of the game.</p> <p>Boone Logan is still in the game, because why mess with something that's been working, and gets Peralta to line out to Gardner who makes a nifty play in the outfield to rob him of a hit. Gardner then makes another catch on an Avila liner and that will do it for Logan. Girardi wants a pitching change, but fantastic effort by Logan to keep the Yankees in this one.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e1fa058f91d7bbadac758\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:01:52.466Z\">4.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 0 - Tigers 2, Bottom 8th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Kirkby Perspective:</p> <p>Quake in Maine, was to keep us all awake, where are the aftershocks New York Yankees?</p> <p>It seems that only Earthquake Valverde was enough to awaken these Yankees bats.

The New York Yankees enter tonight's Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park in a tough spot. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/15/new-york-yankees-detroit-tigers-derek-jeter\">The New York Yankees have already dropped the first two games of the series</a> and now go on the road to face Justin Verlander, arguably the best pitcher in the game.</p> <p>The Yankees <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/detroit-tigers-new-york-yankees-alcs-game-1-live\">lost their first game against the Tigers </a>despite tying it up in the ninth inning off of now-reassigned Detroit closer Jose Valverde. In the loss, first ballot Hall of Fame shortstop Derek Jeter suffered a season-ending injury, leaving the team without a captain and a flailing New York offense without one of its key contributors. His loss felt even more devastating than the Yankees dropping the series opener. The next game, thanks to a non-existent offense and one <a href=\"http://mlb.si.com/2012/10/14/joe-girardi-yankees-instant-replay-game-2-alcs/\">particularly bad blown call</a>, t<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/detroit-tigers-new-york-yankees-alcs-game-2-live\">he Yankees lost 3-0</a>, blowing an outstanding outing by starter Hiroki Kuroda pitching on three day's rest for the first time in his U.S. career.</p> <p>The Yankees offense, so potent in the regular season, has sputtered so badly in the postseason that the focus isn't on how the Tigers have been managing to keep New York at bay. The turning point came in the extra innings of Game 1 after Valverde blew a 4 run lead in the most horrifically comic way possible. Detroit could have collapsed then and there, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/13/st-louis-cardinals-washington-nationals-nlds-game-5-live\">the Washington Nationals coming unglued in NLDS Game 5</a> against the St. Louis Cardinals comes to mind, but they held on. In Game 2, even when Kuroda was holding them off the basepaths, Detroit's hitters never seemed to worry. The Detroit Tigers are playing with a lot of confidence and tonight they have Justin Verlander, who is good for a complete game shutout every time he's on the mound, while the Yankees have to rely on the still inconsistent Phil Hughes.</p> <p>As far as New York fans go, they won't have Alex Rodriguez or Nick Swisher to kick around anymore, at least not to start the game. The third baseman and the outfielder (if you want to be generous here) are out of Girardi's starting lineup against Verlander. It's a move that would seem absolutely absurd at the start of the MLB Playoffs but now is almost unsurprising. At the very least, with A-Rod and Swisher out this is the most likable Yankees lineup they've put out in eons. (And at least Nick Swisher <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5951809/yankee-fans-are-really-harshing-nick-swishers-buzz-bro\">won't get his feelings hurt </a>today.)</p> <p>Is this a Yankees lineup that is good enough to defeat the Tigers on the road, against the best pitcher alive, and avoid falling into a 0-3 hole in the ALCS?

  "<p>We glimpsed the future in Toulouse at the weekend. Ga\u00ebl Fickou is only 18 years old and, facially, looks not unlike the England forward Courtney Lawes. When he runs he moves with the balletic grace, pace and balance of a Jeremy Guscott. A French version of Jeremy Guscott? This really is the point at which top-level rugby and fantasy football merge into one. Such players normally materialise only in an attack coach's wildest imagination. If Monsieur Fickou can stay fit, he has all the makings of a global superstar.</p> <p>Even his opponents are already cooing. \"He's the next Wesley Fofana, isn't he?\" observed Leicester's Toby Flood. \"He looks fantastic. He's big, he's rangy, he's going to fill out further and he's got good acceleration. He's certainly one to watch.\" Having already polished the gleaming jewel that was Yannick Jauzion, Toulouse also know how to nurture such prodigious talents. The game as a whole should be grateful. Only twice previously in my press box-dwelling, splinter-collecting career have I seen a young centre who has stood out to the same spectacular extent. Both Guscott and Brian O'Driscoll went on to have half-decent careers and it is hard to believe Fickou will not do the same. Ga\u00ebl force indeed.</p> <p>It revives memories of the first time I saw Guscott play, away at London Irish's old ground in Sunbury circa 1985. People tend to overuse the phrase \"poetry in motion\" but in this case it was entirely accurate. The coltish pretender did not so much run as glide, an occasional swing of the hips leaving defenders utterly confounded. He knew he was good, too, which added an additional frisson.</p> <p>Fickou, to judge from his cheerful post-match demeanour, also looks a thoroughly decent kid. Toulon must be kicking themselves for letting him slip away but just imagine the warm, pleasurable sensation Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 must be feeling. Fofana, Fickou, Maxime Mermoz \u2026 France suddenly have gifted young centres oozing from every pore at a time when English rugby cannot seem to rear any blemish-free homegrown 12s.</p> <p>Is this mere coincidence? The French Top 14, as we know, is hardly a free-flowing try-fest. There are dozens of long-striding, free-running centres worldwide who have their X-factor knocked out of them by the age of 21. Fickou was born in 1994, which makes him too young to have seen the likes of Denis Charvet or Didier Codorniou in the flesh.</p> <p>But whereas Guscott was a virtual one-off in an environment which churned out considerably more bashers than artistes, Fickou appears to be the latest descendant of a rich heritage. For some reason France do not seem capable of producing many world champion fly-halves \u2013 too much responsibility, too fearful of letting their gargantuan forwards down, too many coaches preferring to use their scrum-halves as the tactical hub? \u2013 but they have cornered the market in languid midfield sorcerers as no other country, New Zealand included.</p> <p>The nearest athletic English equivalent to Fickou in recent times, one could argue, is Delon Armitage, the best No13 the English national team have never had. And where did Delon spend his formative rugby days? Why, in the south of France at Racing Club de Nice. Instead of basing their new elite talent-honing academy near Reading, perhaps the Rugby Football Union should send them all to the C\u00f4te d'Azur for six months.</p> <p>Then again maybe Fickou is simply a once-in-a-generation player who, like Guscott, would have made it regardless of nationality but I am not entirely convinced. Toulouse dropped a lot of ball in damp conditions against Leicester on Sunday but the lofty ambition of their inter-passing was in a different league from much of what passes for midfield trickery in the Premiership.</p> <p>So was their speed of thought. When Thomas Waldrom spilt the ball 45 metres from his own posts on Sunday, most opposing players would simply have hacked it blindly forwards. Not Fickou. He had the presence of mind not merely to pick it up in one lithe movement but to kick it immediately into a space he had identified in the previous split-second.</p> <p>After that his pace took him past several trailing Leicester players, who were still mentally adjusting to the fact Waldrom had lost possession. This, remember, was the young man's Heineken Cup debut. No fear, no hesitation, no boundaries. Genuinely ambitious young British three-quarters should consider adopting a similar creed.</p>",
  "<p>In the 2012 US presidential election, it is clear the brief age of political blogs shaping the political narrative has passed and we are now in <a href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2012/08/a-new-barometer-for-election.html\">the era of Twitter</a>. The proof is in Twitter's big role in shaping the coverage and the winners and losers of this month's presidential debates. </p> <p>At a seminar on the influence of social media on the presidential election \u2013 held at the Democrat convention in Charlotte \u2013 Garance Franke-Ruta, a senior editor for the Atlantic, declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[The] last cycle was all about blogs and the incremental journalism of blogs. This cycle we have really a Twitter campaign where a lot of the conversation has moved off the blogs onto Twitter especially for political insiders.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hamish McKenzie, a reporter for the tech site Pandodaily <a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2012/10/03/heres-what-the-presidential-debate-looked-like-tonight/\">who writes on social media and politics</a>, says political blogs have gone from being the \"first and fast reactors\" to being made \"almost obsolete by Twitter\".</p> <p>Twitter's advocates have big numbers on their side. Adam Sharp, with the barely tweetable job title of \"head of government, news and social innovation\" at Twitter, noted there had been 360,000 total tweets during the two conventions in 2008. The total for both in 2012 was nearly 14m. Mitt Romney's speech peaked at 14,000 tweets per minute. (tpm) Michelle Obama in her convention speech doubled that to 28,000 \u2013 and Barack Obama then took it up to 54,000tpm.</p> <p>The first presidential debate earlier this month smashed those records. There were a total of 10.3m tweets, with the peak of 159,000tpm for moderator Jim Lehrer's \"Let's not\" knockback of a Romney request. Obama's personal record was lifted to 153,000tpm for his \"I had five seconds left\" counter to a Lehrer reminder on time limits.</p> <p>Adam Sharp argues that these numbers are evidence of \"a return to retail politics, the idea that people can be directly engaged in the political process on a one-on-one basis again, not only interacting with the candidate and issues but with one another.\" He claims Twitter is showing the moments when people across the country \"were turning to people next to them on the proverbial global couch and saying, 'Did you see that?'\" Social media is \"measuring for the first time natural conversation \u2026 that a cycle ago would have been behind the closed doors of coffee shops and office water coolers\".</p> <p>While some are skeptical \u2013 McKenzie argues that the number of tweets is a crude gauge, while <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/debate_watchers_use_of_social_media_can_create_instantaneous_consensus-218160-1.html\">Carroll Doherty of the Pew Research Centre</a> warns that only 13% of Americans are using Twitter \u2013 everyone agrees that the main impact of Twitter has been to speed up the news cycle.</p> <p>Franke-Ruta gave the example of a 21-minute news cycle, from incident to report to counter-report, all driven by a tweet: Mitt Romney joked that no one had ever asked to see his birth certificate. This was tweeted three minutes later, was on Politico's website after four minutes, video was available on Buzzfeed after five minutes, and the Romney team had a clarifying statement out within 21 minutes. In Sharp's words:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We have shifted from a 24-hours news cycle to a 140-character one.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Twitter has challenged the hallowed status of post-event media punditry, which seems increasingly irrelevant as verdicts are declared long before the talking heads get a turn. Sharp noted that the peak Twitter moment for convention speeches was the minute they ended, as the flow of tweets then tailed off very quickly. The mocking of Clint Eastwood and his empty chair was under way well before the pundits got a word in.</p> <p>Twitter also set the tone for the first presidential debate. Focus groups dialing minute-by-minute responses and post-debate polls all showed Romney winning. But it was liberal comedian Bill Maher's savage Twitter commentary on Obama's flat performance that dominated the early coverage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/billmaher/status/253680489850892289\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-left\" width=\"460\"><p>i can't believe i'm saying this, but Obama looks like he DOES need a teleprompter</p>&mdash; Bill Maher (@billmaher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billmaher/status/253680489850892289\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-04T02:18:36+00:00\">October 4, 2012</a></blockquote> <script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </figure>  <p>Obama supporters tried a \"style versus substance\" line in post-debate media appearances, but you could see their hearts weren't in it.</p> <p>Joe Rospars, head of Obama 's digital campaign, argued in Charlotte that Twitter has made \"the elite conversation a much bigger spectacle now\". He wryly noted that previously after a big speech, attention turned to the three or four pundits reacting on each television channel. But now:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's not just these people but everyone who has ever been on television all weighing in at once online.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There is certainly a risk that Twitter will lead to ever faster but shallower politics. Romney's response to the killing of the US ambassador in Benghazi was widely criticized as intemperate, premature and in breach of longstanding protocols of political unity in the face of attacks. <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/nov05election/2012/09/12/analysis-romneys-attack-on-obama-over-libya-assassination-could-backfire/\">John Pitney, a politics professor in California, attributed Romney's response</a> to \"a Twitter-driven media environment [where] candidates feel pressure to react to events immediately\". The Jack Welch tweet questioning the official September job figures triggered off a day of bizarre media coverage on whether official statistics could really be manipulated, as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/10/jack-welch-conspiracy-jobs-tweet_n_1954176.html\">Welch seemed to claim</a>.</p> <p>Stories emerge faster and burn out faster, while fuller consideration of their importance is lost. Romney's comments on the killing of the US ambassador might have proved his \"3am phone call failure moment,\" according to McKenzie, but the caravan quickly moved on to the \"47%\" observations of Romney from a secretly-taped fundraiser. </p> <p>Helped by the Twitter reaction, Romney's debate win reset the polling numbers, with Obama now clinging to bare leads in some swing states. In the coming debates, it is a sure bet the campaigns will be lining up surrogate tweeters to respond \u2013 and it's likely that the left-leaning ones will be more loyal next time around.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government is coming under mounting pressure to stop dragging its feet on reforming international tax rules in the wake of revelations that Starbucks and other large companies are shifting profits around the world and paying small tax bills.</p> <p>The calls come after a string of controversies over the low levels of tax paid by US companies operating in Britain, while analysis by the Guardian shows that four of America's best known businesses \u2013 Amazon, Facebook, Google UK and Starbucks \u2013 have paid just \u00a330m in tax over the past four years despite generating more than \u00a33.1bn in sales.</p> <p>As well as shifting profits outside the UK, campaigners also argue that the current system leaves a higher burden falling on British companies.</p> <p>Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said: \"The [UK] government says that it has created a competitive tax system. The problem is that UK companies are paying the tax and the result is that it is an uneven playing field. UK businesses are disadvantaged against foreign businesses in the same market place. They are letting foreign companies do business here and not pay any tax.\"</p> <p>Murphy's criticisms of the current system were echoed by David Spencer, a US attorney and adviser to campaign group Tax Justice Network, who said: \"There is more and more evidence of the fact that multinationals are shifting substantial income from high tax to low tax jurisdictions. This is because the OECD's [rules] are very complex and very difficult to enforce.\" So abused have tax rules become, he added, that even the best resourced tax authorities \u2013 in OECD countries themselves, including the US \u2013 were straining to police the corporate world.</p> <p>The calls for a revamp come after it emerged on Monday that the US coffee shop chain Starbucks had paid \u00a38.6m in UK taxes on \u00a33bn of sales since 1998, while last week Facebook UK \u2013 which paid its average employee more than it did the exchequer last year \u2013 was accused of depressing UK sales figures. Neither the Treasury or HM Revenue &amp; Customs would comment on specific cases. A spokeswoman for the Treasury said: \"The government is committed to ensuring that the right amount of tax is paid on all profits made in the UK.</p> <p>\"Companies which are resident in or have a permanent establishment in the UK are subject to corporation tax on the profits from their UK trading activities, including e-commerce. Cross-border trading is taxed in line with OECD guidelines and the UK's wide network of tax treaties. These ensure that businesses are not taxed twice on the same profits and that British companies can compete effectively globally.\"</p> <p>A Revenue and Customs briefing paper earlier this month said: \"Recent reforms to the UK's corporation tax system mean that the UK has an internationally-competitive corporate tax system, which is designed to attract and retain economic activity here.\"</p> <p>John Christensen, a director of TJN, also said pressure was mounting on Europe and US to overhaul what he said were increasingly abused and discredited rules governing how multinational companies can apportion profits around the world. Speaking outside the annual meeting of the UN committee of experts on international tax co-operation in Geneva, Christensen said current guidelines from the OECD were under attack from increasingly powerful countries, led by India, China and Brazil. \"The emerging countries say they don't want the OECD model any more. There is widespread recognition these rules are no longer fit for purpose. But until there is agreement abusing will continue \u2013 costs will be piled up artificially in some countries or profits are shipped out to low tax countries.\"</p> <p>Emerging economies want the rules to be overhauled so that multinational companies are required to apportion their taxable profits according to factors such as where in the world sales are made, where the workforce is located and where capital is invested. Such tight rules are already well-established within the US, but they do not affect how American groups behave internationally. Moves toward tighter apportionment rules are most fiercely resisted in Europe by countries with the most aggressively competitive corporate tax arrangements, among them Ireland, Britain and the Netherlands.</p> <p>Before this week's meeting of the UN tax committee, the body's head of tax co-operation, Michael Lennard, received <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/tax/eighthsession/USCIB_letter_on_UNTPM_October_9.pdf\" title=\"\">a lobbying letter</a> from the US Council for International Business urging the UN to rethink or ditch elements of its campaign to reform tax rules for multinationals. <a href=\"http://www.uscib.org/index.asp?documentID=1846\" title=\"\">Members of USCIB</a> include Amazon, Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that any of the companies that have been identified as paying low taxes in the UK have broken any laws, and all say they comply with local tax rules.</p> <p>Google has said it makes \"a big contribution to the UK economy by employing over a thousand people\", while Facebook, which last week was accused of transferring UK profits to Dublin, said it had selected the location as its international headquarters as it was \"the best location to hire staff with the right skills to run a multilingual hi-tech operation serving the whole of Europe\".</p>",
  "<p>The SNP begin its annual conference in Perth on Thursday after an extraordinary week. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/alex-salmond-scotland-referendum-deal\" title=\"\">Edinburgh agreement</a> signed on Monday is a watershed moment in Scotland's home rule journey. Paving the way for the most important decision our country will make in 300 years, the agreement ensures that we have a referendum designed and delivered by the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>The Edinburgh agreement ensures that, not only is the referendum made in Scotland, but that whatever the decision taken by the people of Scotland, it will be respected by all. That respect for process and outcome is vital as we move forward in forging a new partnership among the people of these islands.</p> <p>My passion has never been to cross some imaginary constitutional finishing line and think the race is won. My aim now, as it always has been, is to deliver a better and fairer society for the people of Scotland. It happens that independence is the way to do this. The Scottish government has an ambitious vision for Scotland as a prosperous and successful European country reflecting Scottish values of fairness and opportunity, promoting equality and social cohesion.</p> <p>Independence will allow us to create an exciting new Scotland \u2013 fit for the 21st&#xa0;century. We will have the power and the responsibility to find our own solutions to the challenges we face, and to engineer fairness, confidence, innovation and prosperity. At the same time, it will mean a partnership of equals with other nations, protecting vital Scottish interests like our fishing industry by having a seat at the top table while playing our part in the global community through organisations such as the European Union and United Nations.</p> <p>I have always believed that civic nationalism should go together with internationalism. An independent Scotland will embrace the interdependence of the modern world, but we would do so on our own terms. For example, a written constitution for an independent Scotland should explicitly ban nuclear weapons from our country.</p> <p>Over the next two years, Scotland will be involved in its most important debate of the past 300 years. Donald Dewar once said, when the Scottish parliament reconvened in 1999, that devolution was about more than our politics and our laws. It was in part about \"<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDsQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scottish.parliament.uk%2FEducationandCommunityPartnershipsresources%2FNew_Parliament_Levels_A-F.pdf&amp;ei=BYt9ULj6JMOq0AXq04DgBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHz_WkZBSQHuWTURku-ENd0OjZOqQ\" title=\"\">who we are, how we carry ourselves</a>\". His words were true of devolution, and will be true of independence. I think they will be particularly true of the debate that will determine our future.</p> <p>It is right that people should feel passionately about the question of independence. But that passion must extend to a recognition that Scotland's future will best be served by a debate which is thorough, thoughtful and constructive.</p> <p>Above all, the campaign for a yes vote will stress the need to protect the advances Scotland has made with the limited home rule that devolution has brought. The social contract, which has delivered universal benefits such as free university education and personal care for our elderly, is now threatened by both Labour and the Tories, and only a&#xa0;yes vote to an independent Scotland can properly protect these gains.</p> <p>Scotland in autumn 2014 must emerge as a united nation: united in recognition of the referendum result; in a shared belief in our potential; and in a hopeful view of our shared future.</p> <p>Politicians, and media commentators, therefore bear a great responsibility in how we conduct ourselves during this debate. As first minister, I will fulfil mine, continually setting out a positive case for an independent Scotland.</p> <p>That case is based on a simple but fundamental premise. The people best placed to take decisions about Scotland's future are those who choose to live and work in Scotland. I believe the people of Scotland will be persuaded of that case.</p>",
  "<p>European car sales have fallen for the twelfth consecutive month and are heading for a double-digit decline this year, in the latest indication of the continent's economic struggles.</p> <p>New car registrations in the European Union fell 10.8% in September compared with the same month last year, providing a darkening consumer backdrop to another day of mounting speculation that Spain is close to seeking a formal bailout. The eurozone's fourth largest economy was the second worst performer in figures published by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, posting a 36.8% slump in sales that was surpassed only by Greece, with a fall of 48.5%.</p> <p>However, analysts said the main point of concern in the ACEA data was the confirmation of a slowdown in northern Europe, where the UK was the only bright spot with a sales increase of 8.2%. Elsewhere, even the continent's strongholds are struggling with Germany posting a decline of 10.9%, followed by a slump of more than a quarter in the Netherlands and 18% in France. Total new registrations in the EU were just under 1.1m, compared with 1.23m in the same period last year.</p> <p>Neil King, automotive analyst at Euromonitor International, said weak consumer sentiment caused by the eurozone crisis appeared to be filtering into Germany. \"With Germany turning negative, that is having a knock-on impact on the few resilient areas such as northern Europe and the premium brands.\"</p> <p>Although mass-market brands bore the brunt of the declines, with Renault falling by more than 30% and Fiat tumbling by 15%, premium vehicles were also affected. According to the ACEA, Jaguar sales in the EU fell 10% year-on-year, Lexus declined by 13% and Mini fell by the same amount. Mercedes declined by 6.4% although other German premium brands fared better, with BMW rising by 10.5% and Audi managing growth of 1.4%.</p> <p>The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the UK's domestic industry was still far from its pre-boom heights and will not be immune from the eurozone's troubles. Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, said British consumers had benefited from a weak pound and European manufacturers targeting the more vibrant UK market with aggressive pricing. But that has had a negative impact on car retailers and manufacturers in the UK, he said. \"It means that margins are very thin for vehicle manufacturers and their retail networks. It is not a situation that can continue that much longer,\" said Everitt. \"It's a great time to be buying a car because there is a lot of good quality product being offered at exceptional values, but it makes it a tough environment to be working in.\"</p> <p>The SMMT expects UK car sales to rise by around 4% this year to just under 2m. However, the ACEA estimates that Europe could be heading for a decline in car sales of between 8% and 10% in 2012, with the upper end of that estimate representing the continent's worst car sales performance in nearly two decades. In the year to date, EU car sales fell 7.6%.</p> <p>The figures come as car manufacturers grapple with a capacity glut that has saddled the likes of Fiat, Vauxhall and Peugeot with underused plants. Western European plants made just under 16m cars and vans in 2007 but this year that total is expected to be 12.5m, according to forecasts by IHS Automotive. Mark Fulthorpe, analyst at IHS Automotive, said Tuesday's numbers made it even more likely that there will be further factory closures. \"All of the evidence points towards that being the most likely outcome of the situation that we have at the moment.\"</p> <p>Fulthorpe added that manufacturers are beginning to cut back production \"because the opportunity of a better tomorrow in terms of western European demand is just not evident\".</p> <p>GKN, the FTSE 100 company that makes driveshafts, also signalled a European slowdown on Tuesday when it warned of \"more challenging European automotive and industrial markets\", forcing analysts to reduce profit forecasts. The company said: \"Macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated in recent weeks and some softening in order books is now evident, particularly regarding European automotive and industrial markets.\"</p> <p>The continent-wide slowdown and car sales has triggered a wave of temporary factory closures. Last month the Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton stopped production for a week due to the \"downturn in mainland Europe\".</p> <p>Vauxhall's move was replicated on the continent, with even bigger shutdowns in Italy where Fiat mothballed its Naples plant for a fortnight and Vauxhall's sister company Opel close its Russelsheim site for a total of 20 days this year. Despite the hiatus at Vauxhall, the SMMT expects the UK to produce up to 1.5m cars this year, compared with 1.34m in 2011, due to strong production numbers from premium producers including Mini and Jaguar Land Rover, as well as the Japanese manufacturers with established UK operations, Nissan, Toyota and Honda.</p>",
  "<p>Google's changes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/15/google-privacy-policy\" title=\"\">its privacy policies</a> have been criticised by 30 European data protection commissioners for resulting in 'uncontrolled' use of personal data without individual's clear consent, relating to their use of YouTube and Gmail.</p> <p>The commissioners told Google on Tuesday to give people more detailed control over personal data, and said the changes the search giant introduced in March amounted to breaking European data protection law, because the company was storing without consent cookies and data about sites people visited for between 18 months and two years.</p> <p>The French data protection commissioner, the CNIL, led the inquiry and said that Google in effect let users pick and choose how their data was used among different services such as Gmail, Youtube and Google+ \u2013 a dramatic rewrite of the single privacy policy Google introduced in March.</p> <p>CNIL's demand stops short of demanding a wholesale rollback of the changes introduced in March, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/01/google-privacy-policy-analysis\" title=\"\">Google unified its privacy policies \u2013 and data</a> \u2013 from about 60 services into a single data store.</p> <p>Google said it would consider its next steps, but said it had not broken the law. Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel said in a statement: \"We have received the report and are reviewing it now. Our new privacy policy demonstrates our long-standing commitment to protecting our users' information and creating great products. We are confident that our privacy notices respect European law.\"</p> <p>Google's latest privacy policy means that users get a simpler experience when signing up for a new Google-owned service. But it also means that Google can build up a more comprehensive picture of the user for advertising \u2013 for example, monitoring a person's use of YouTube to help better target adverts within Gmail.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.cnil.fr/english/news-and-events/news/article/googles-new-privacy-policy-incomplete-information-and-uncontrolled-combination-of-data-across-ser/\" title=\"\">CNIL's press release</a> is highly critical of Google, noting that it \"provides insufficient information to its users on its personal data processing operations\", doesn't tell people how long data will be held, and allows \"uncontrolled\" combination of data across its service.</p> <p>The CNIL notes that for Google users, merely visiting a site which displays one of its \"+1\" buttons is recorded and kept for at least 18 months and can be associated with other data from other Google services. Data collected via a DoubleClick ad cookie \u2013 which is then associated with a unique identifying number \u2013 is stored by Google for two years, and can be renewed without consultation.</p> <p>CNIL also criticised the company for being unco-operative in its responses to queries from the commissioners. \"Google did not provide satisfactory answers on key issues such as the description of its personal data processing operations, or the precise list of the 60+ product-specific privacy policies that have been merged in the new policy,\" the CNIL said.</p> <p>The CNIL report was applauded by privacy groups, though the US search company remained unruffled. Sources close to Google indicated that the CNIL report mostly outlined actions that the search giant \"should\" carry out rather than that it \"must\" carry out, which is being interpreted as light-touch regulation rather than full-on confrontation.</p> <p>But the CNIL may be biding its time. The UK Information Commissioner's Office said that it would wait for Google's response to the report before deciding what to do next. Bradley Shears, a US lawyer who has watched the process unfold, said: \"It appears that the CNIL is providing Google one last opportunity to take the appropriate actions necessary to properly address its concerns before going down the litigation route.\"</p> <p>Marc Dautlich, a partner specialising in data protection law at Pinsent Masons in London, said: \"If Google's get-out is that it's only being told 'should' rather than 'must', then it becomes a question of trust. How does a company purport to be transparent and trusted if they're put to the test and use a legal nicety to avoid it?\"</p> <p>There is no set timetable for a response from Google.</p> <p>The CNIL wants Google to give users the chance to decide when their data is combined into services, to give better control over the combination of data. The regulators also want to centralise the change to opt out of use, decide which services their data goes into, and change its tools so that data is only used for the intended purpose \u2013 separate those used, say, for security from advertising.</p> <p>The CNIL led the group of 30 data protection commissioners from across the EU, who began examining Google's proposed changes to its privacy policies in February. The company had said in January that it would alter them from the start of March, and went ahead with the changes despite requests from the CNIL to delay them, and warnings from senior European Commission officials that they could be illegal.</p> <p>The CNIL has now called on Google to adhere to the EU's data protection principles. \"European Data Protection legislation provides a precise framework for personal data processing operations,\" the CNIL said. \"Google must have a legal basis to perform the combination of data of each of these purposes and data collection must also remain proportionate to the purposes pursued. However, for some of these purposes including advertising, the processing does not rely on consent, on Google's legitimate interests, nor on the performance of a contract.\"</p> <p>Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: \"Consumers have been kept in the dark about how much data Google collects and what happens to that data, and Google's new privacy policy only further disguised what really happens when you use their services.</p> <p>Pickles added: \"It's absolutely right that European regulators focus on ensuring people know what data is being collected and how it is being used. Unless people are aware just how much of their behaviour is being monitored and recorded it is impossible to make an informed choice about using services. This ruling is an important step to putting consumers in control of their personal information and ensuring that companies like Google are not able to easily disregard people's privacy in pursuit of more information and greater profits.\"</p> <p>Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: \"It's good to see European data protection authorities take action so that users gain control of their data. This must be backed by strong new data protection powers, for fines based on turnover, and rights to retrieve and to delete your data.\"</p> <p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said: \"We await Google's response which will be considered by the CNIL, on behalf of the ICO and the other European data protection regulators. A decision will then be made on whether further action is required.\"</p>",
  "<p>The chief executive of Citigroup abruptly quit on Tuesday after five years in the top job, amid reports of a boardroom clash.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.citigroup.com/citi/news/2012/121016a.htm\" title=\"\">Citi said</a> Vikram Pandit, 55, was stepping down as chief executive and leaving the company's board with \"immediate effect\". Within minutes of the bank's announcement, Pandit's name was gone from Citigroup's website. Chief Operating Officer John Havens, a long-time associate of Pandit, also resigned.</p> <p>Pandit said the decision to leave was his own and he was quitting because it was \"the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup\". However, the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443854204578060280201488530.html?mod=WSJEurope_hpp_LEFTTopStories\" title=\"\">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Pandit resigned after clashing with the board over strategy and performance.</p> <p>There has also been speculation that Pandit may have quit over a row about his pay. In April Citi shareholders voted down his $15m (\u00a39.3m) pay deal, but the vote was non-binding and his pay rise went through.</p> <p>Michael O'Neill, Citi's chairman, said the board respected Pandit's decision to leave the bank. \"Since his appointment at the start of the financial crisis until the present time, Vikram has restructured and recapitalised the company, strengthened our global franchise and refocused the business,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>However Citi's shares, which were trading 1% higher on the back of Pandit's resignation, have lost almost 90% of their value since he took the helm in December 2007.</p> <p>Pandit told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday night: \"The bank is actually in damn good shape.\" He said confidence had been restored and capital rebuilt.</p> <p>Citi said Pandit will be replaced by Mike Corbat, the bank's current head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and a former Harvard University footballer who once planned to play professionally in the NFL, the top American football league.</p> <p>Pandit said he \"could not be leaving the company in better hands\" and the announcement came just 24 hours after the bank reported better-than-expected profits.. \"Mike is the right person to tackle the difficult challenges ahead, with a 29-year record of achievement and leadership at this company,\" he said. \"I will truly miss the wonderful people throughout this organisation. But I know that together with Mike they will continue to build on the progress we have made.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Citigroup+%28C%29+Pandit+Memo+to+Employees/7795400.html\" title=\"\">In a memo to Citi's 260,000 employees,</a> Pandit added: \"Only you can understand the effort and hard work that was put in to get our company where it is today.</p> <p>\"I am proud of each and every one of you and I have the utmost confidence in your future success.\"</p> <p>The bank's president and chief operating officer John Havens, and long-time associate of Pandit, also quit. The bank said Havens \"had already been planning retirement from Citi at year-end but decided, in light of Mr Pandit's resignation, to leave the company at this time.\"</p> <p>The departures remove a leadership team that navigated Citigroup through 2008's global credit crisis, when US taxpayers rescued the bank from collapse with a $45bn bailout.</p> <p>Matt McCormick, banking analyst and portfolio manager at Bahl &amp; Gaynor in Cincinnati, Ohio, said: \"What Pandit and Havens did was increase the uncertainty around Citi. There's a perpetual cloud of uncertainty surrounding Citigroup. There's always turmoil ... that's had to affect the stock price.\"</p> <p>Following Pandit's departure, just two men who ran Wall Street banks during the financial crisis remain in their posts: Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan Chase and Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>If no changes are made to Pandit's compensation package, Citigroup will have paid him about $261m in the five years since he became chief executive, including $165m it paid to buy his Old Lane Partners hedge fund in 2007 in a deal that led to him taking the top job, according to Bloomberg.</p> <p>The shake-up at Citi came as Goldman Sachs reported profits of $1.46bn in the three months to the end of September, compared with a $428m loss in the same quarter a year earlier.</p> <p>The bank said higher profit and revenues allowed it to more than double salaries, benefits and bonuses to $3.7bn.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which is calling for a 0.5-1% tax on financial transactions to fund welfare projects, said: \"These eye-watering profits and pay are further evidence that banks are a law unto themselves. While the rest of us are belt-tightening, banks are yet to change their ways.</p> <p>\"If banks can afford to dole out such lavish bonuses, they can afford to pay more to get the economy they helped derail back on track.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two startling things happened in the Commons on Tuesday. A British home secretary was not only cheered, but applauded. And Nick Clegg fought back at his tormentors. If anything, that was even more surprising.</p> <p>Theresa May's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-not-extradited-may\" title=\"\">decision not to let Gary McKinnon be extradited</a> to the US not only cheered up every MP, but saw her odds as the next Tory leader cut by the bookies to 12-1. (These days we don't follow the politics of power, but the predictions of Paddy Power.)</p> <p>As for Clegg, he amazed everyone. It was as if a gang of school bullies had gathered round their favourite victim only to find him knocking their teeth out with his feet, like Bruce Lee on a caffeine high.</p> <p>He didn't start too well. Tom Greatrex asked a question about the non-sexist royal succession laws. It turned out that Greatrex was merely asking the question to humiliate Clegg. \"Given his unenviable record of success in relation to constitutional change\" shouldn't he pass the job to another minister, \"so that there will be some&#xa0;chance of it actually being introduced?\"</p> <p>The deputy prime minister replied thus: \"Um.\" He continued, \"um.\" Then&#xa0;he said something about Christmas cracker jokes. It was all pretty feeble.</p> <p>But deep inside him, a fire was lit. Or he ate a can of spinach. Or he nipped into a phone box and changed into red pants. No longer was he the wimp laughed at by everyone. He was Superclegg, able to pull trains with his teeth, kicking whole sand dunes into evil-doers' faces.</p> <p>Peter Bone, the human skull, can't stand Clegg. Bone's maths may be awry, because he seems to imagine that the Tories can govern without the party he loathes. He accused Superclegg of lacking integrity because he wasn't going to vote the new boundary changes into operation. This is the Lib Dems' revenge for the collapse of Lords reform.</p> <p>In the past, Clegg would have ummed and ahhed and erred, and generally looked as if he'd like to crawl into a hole. This time he just flipped Bone aside.</p> <p>Next a Labour MP raised the subject of the Tories' co-chairman, Grant Shapps, the man of a thousand names. Shapps (or Green, or whoever he is today) has offered a deal. The Lib Dems would get the party funding laws they want, in exchange for supporting boundary changes that will benefit the&#xa0;Tories.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" said Superclegg, \"I suppose that is finally a get-rich-quick scheme he is prepared to put his name to!\"</p> <p>At this, Labour MPs let out an immense \"whoop\" of sheer pleasure. Clegg mocks Tory chairman! They adored it.</p> <p>Bernard Jenkin, another Clegg-detester, asked if he was voting against boundary changes on principle, \"or is it about getting what one can for one's own political advantage? Should we ever believe anything he says?\"</p> <p>What he got in reply was a scornful lecture about the politics of coalition, as if delivered to a particularly obtuse and lazy student. A few Labour MPs also tried to rile him, but he smashed them each in the kisser, too. Then he&#xa0;strode off back to the Daily Planet,&#xa0;or the Batcave, or even the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 17 October. The home secretary was applauded in the Commons on Tuesday, not Monday as we said in the original version. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>When we set out to investigate young people's job skills for the 10th Education for All Global Monitoring Report, <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/reports/2012-skills/\">Youth and Skills: Putting education to work</a>, it soon became clear that unless we focused on the disadvantaged, we weren't going to change anything. This was true in rich countries like the UK just as much as in the developing world.</p> <p>Young people who have a hard time making their way in life because of poverty, rural isolation or disability \u2013 or because they face discrimination on the basis of their gender or ethnic identity \u2013 face more trouble when it comes to acquiring the skills they need to get decent work. In the job market they face a steep uphill struggle against the combined forces of discrimination and a lack of skills.</p> <p>The problem starts at lower secondary school, which is where young people should consolidate their basic knowledge so that they can learn more sophisticated job skills. In some European countries, a fifth of those aged between 18 and 24 years-old drop out with no more than lower secondary schooling, and lack the skills they need to find a job.</p> <p>Some countries, such as the Netherlands, offer these young people a chance to re-enter education. But such alternative pathways to learning skills are not being offered to Europe's youth on a large enough scale. One in five adults in the UK, our report reveals, have such poor literacy that they struggle to complete a job application form.</p> <p>This lack of skills further detriments youth employment. New figures today show that long-term youth unemployment in England has increased by 23% since May 2010.</p> <p>The struggle to obtain skills and jobs feeds into the kind of frustration that was an ingredient of last year's riots. As part of our research for this year's Global Monitoring Report, we interviewed some young people from Tottenham, the epicentre of the riots.</p> <p>\"They keep saying for us to have experience, but they don't really give us the opportunity to have an experience on that type of job, or any job,\" one young man told us.</p> <p>Apprenticeships are one way out of that trap, but our report finds that in many cases apprenticeships mirror and perpetuate wider discrimination. Apprentices are more likely to be men, and young women who take apprenticeships get paid less while in them, find it harder to get a job and receive lower pay once they are in work.</p> <p>In the UK, young women earn 21% less, on average, while in apprenticeships. The wage benefit for a woman who has completed an apprenticeship is 4%, compared with 20% for a man who has done the same training. And the share of black and other ethnic minority youths already employed who enter apprenticeships is 32%, compared with 44% for white youths.</p> <p>The UK could do worse than take a leaf out of Germany's book. The success of Germany's apprenticeship system is a major reason why youth unemployment there is around 8% \u2013 lower than other parts of Europe. Open to all students who have completed lower secondary school, the system combines structured training in a company with part-time classroom tuition. About 60% of young Germans enrol in this dual system and 57% of those who complete an apprenticeship are immediately employed by their training company.</p> <p>The young people we listened to in Tottenham were desperately aware of the handicap they face when applying for a job without work experience \u2013 the kind of experience that a successful apprenticeship system would provide.</p> <p>While governments have a crucial role in setting up apprenticeship programmes and qualifications, employers also need to confront their responsibility to help build the skills that can give young people better lives and contribute to economic growth. When we asked the young people from Tottenham what they needed from employers, their answer came across loud and clear. \"Offer training and just give people a chance,\" one young woman said.</p> <p>It's time we took her advice and gave todays' generation the skills \u2013 and hope \u2013 that they need and deserve.</p> <p><em>Pauline Rose is the director of the <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/\">Education for All Global Monitoring Report</a></em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>The lofty ambition of making British Champions Day a truly global celebration of racing as yet remains largely unfulfilled as Ascot prepares to stage the event for a second time on Saturday, but the excitement of seeing Frankel face what should be the stiffest challenge of his career has evidently crossed The Channel.</p> <p>\"He is a very special horse, anyone can see that,\" said the high-profile trainer Alain de Royer-Dupr\u00e9 while watching his horses work on the gallops here on Tuesday. Andr\u00e9 Fabre, interrupted from minding his own business on the gallops next to Chantilly racecourse, was even more fulsome in his praise.</p> <p>\"It's just like looking at a museum piece,\" said Fabre, with the authority of a man who is soon to be confirmed as France's champion trainer for the 24th time. \"He's probably the best horse ever bred. He has a combination of power and charm. He seems to have a great personality. An extraordinary animal.\"</p> <p>Both men will have runners in the supporting races on Saturday but their less well-known neighbour Corine Barande-Barbe has hope of beating Frankel with her top-class gelding Cirrus Des Aigles. With little more than two dozen horses in her team, Barande-Barbe shares with De Royer-Dupr\u00e9 and Fabre little more than a postal address on the Chemin des Eglises, the immaculate Chantilly gallops and her admiration of Frankel.</p> <p>Classic success with the French Oaks winner Carling in the mid-1990s failed to spark a stampede of owners to her door and nor has the success of Cirrus Des Aigles, the details of whose 16 victories all seem to be etched upon his trainer's mind and are recited with glee.</p> <p>But instead of harbouring resentment about her status as one of the sport's smaller players or her ongoing battle with the French racing authorities over a positive drugs test produced by Cirrus Des Aigles earlier this year, Barande-Barbe seemed too busy enjoying herself.</p> <p>\"I am a specialist at fairy tales,\" she said, smiling. \"I don't want this to end. I want Cirrus Des Aigles to go on forever. Maybe he is still improving. Maybe he will be even better next year as a seven-year-old. Why not? It's all been a dream.\"</p> <p>Unfashionably bred and virtually a gift horse, Cirrus Des Aigles arrived in her care as a weak yearling in 2007 and suffered an early loss at his new home when gelded within months, Barande-Barbe having discovered that one of his testicles had not fully descended and was causing him pain.</p> <p>But since making his debut the following year when fourth of 14 in a maiden race, Cirrus Des Aigles has improved steadily to the point where, according to the latest World Thoroughbred Rankings, he is officially the second-best racehorse anywhere on the planet.</p> <p>\"I am not afraid of Frankel. Why should I be?\" asked Barande-Barbe. \"The better the field, the better my horse is. Frankel didn't come to France, so we will have to go to his place.</p> <p>\"It should be a good battle. The humble and the king-bred. &#xa0;That's the magic side of racing. Nobody can be sure that they have the best horse until they are on the track. Frankel really is an <em>extra-terrestre</em>. Everybody thinks it is impossible to beat him, but unless you try you won't find out.\"</p> <p>&#xa0;As for the drugs test which saw France-Galop initially threaten to withdraw Barande-Barbe's licence, the trainer is awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a fine she received for the positive sample, taken after the horse finished second at Longchamp in May. A separate police inquiry, instigated at the trainer's request, also remains open.</p> <p>\"France-Galop have written a long letter to the laboratory that did the testing and we will wait to find out more,\" she said. \"In my opinion, you first ask those questions before having an enquiry, but who knows?</p> <p>\"I was upset because they tested the urine but not the blood and I want to know how he came to give a test for such a massive dose of anti-inflammatories. Did someone put something in his food or his water? We saw the video of him in the racecourse stables and there were so many people coming and going that day. Was it someone who wanted to hurt him? The sort of dose he was given could have been toxic.</p> <p>\"It was a hard time and I still have so many questions. Did he receive it after the race or before? How did it get into his system? Why didn't they test his blood? Was it contamination at the laboratory? All I want to do now is know the truth.\"</p>",
  "<p>The imminent pilot cull of badgers in Gloucestershire and Somerset could face being voted down by MPs next week after opponents were granted the first Commons debate on the issue. Campaigners called for the cull, which could start any day, to be suspended until after the debate.</p> <p>Ministers approved the cull of up to 100,000 animals in an attempt to curb the growing problem of tuberculosis in cattle. In 2011, 26,000 cattle were slaughtered and bovine TB measures cost taxpayers \u00a390m.</p> <p>But the plan has provoked the largest animal rights protest since those over fox hunting in the 1990s, and more than 155,000 people have signed a <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">government e-petition</a>. The success of the petition enabled MPs to win parliamentary time for the debate on 25 October.</p> <p>Angela Smith MP, chair of the all-party group on wildlife, said: \"I am delighted because public opinion on the proposed cull is clearly against it. It is only right, in the interests of democracy, that parliament should be able to make a decision.\"</p> <p>\"If we win the debate in the Commons, it will be incumbent on the government to respond. If they ignore parliamentary opinion they will stand accused of arrogance in the face of parliament, public opinion and science.\"</p> <p>Jeff Hayden, of the Badger Trust, said: \"Government policy must reflect the wishes of the people and that is expressed through parliament. Now the possibility of the cull has become real and near, more people are starting to understand the facts. We are now confident that an even bigger majority of people oppose the government's cull.\"</p> <p>The trust's solicitors have written to Natural England, which issues culling licences, stating: \"In light of the government's own evidence that starting a cull only to stop it shortly afterwards would make matters worse in terms of spreading the disease, please confirm that Natural England will not set a start date until the debate has taken place.\"</p> <p>Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, who is a firm supporter of the cull, told an NFU meeting recently: \"This [cull] is the stated policy of the democratically elected government of this country.\" However, no vote has been held on the issue in parliament. A commitment to a \"science-led\" badger cull was in the Conservative party election manifesto and the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/coalition-documents\" title=\"\">coalition agreement</a>, but not in the Liberal Democrat election manifesto.</p> <p>The Lib Dem agriculture minister, David Heath, said: \"This is such an important issue for both the farming industry and wildlife campaigners that I'm not surprised there's a lot of demand for a parliamentary debate. It's an opportunity to put right a lot of the misleading information I've seen recently from opponents of the cull.\"</p> <p>The Green party MP Caroline Lucas, one of the sponsors of the debate, said: \"The voices of all those who signed the e-petition against this reckless badger cull are now being heard loud and clear in parliament. In choosing to plough ahead with the barbaric cull in our countryside, the coalition government has shown complete contempt for scientific evidence on bovine TB.\"</p> <p>On Sunday the nation's leading animal disease experts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">wrote to the Observer</a> demanding that the \"mindless\" cull be abandoned and stating that much stricter measures on controlling the spread of TB between cattle and a vaccination programme were necessary.</p> <p>Farmers and landowners are running out of time to begin the cull this year in two pilot areas in Gloucestershire and Somerset, as once begun it must continue for six unbroken weeks before winter keeps badgers underground. The Guardian understand that Paterson is holding daily morning meetings on the issue to expedite the cull.</p> <p>The call for the parliamentary debate was supported by a cross-party group of 36 MPs. The motion to be debated states: \"This house recognises that significant, independent scientific research has demonstrated that culling badgers will have little effect on reducing the rate of bovine TB; acknowledges that culling may even exacerbate the problem; notes that the e-petition against the current plans for culling passed in a very short period of time the 100,000 figure required to make it eligible for debate in parliament and that it continues to attract impressive levels of support from members of the public; calls on the government to stop any planned or present culling of badgers; and further calls on the government to introduce a vaccination programme and measures to improve biosecurity with immediate effect.\"</p>",

  "<p>For this year's <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/worldfoodday/en/\" title=\"\">World Food Day</a>, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) is focusing on agricultural co-operatives, heralding them as \"key to feeding the world\". This marks an exciting development for organisations of smallholder farmers, which are finally being placed at the centre of the debate on how to fight world hunger.</p> <p>In many developing countries, smallholder farmers have to grow their produce on limited land, with little access to vital inputs such as seed and fertiliser. They are often isolated from the information and training they require to maximise their yields and subsequently their incomes. This is why these farmers have been coming together and forming co-operatives in recent years, to pool resources such as finance, technology, land and water, in order to work more effectively as a unit. In collaboration, farming co-operatives not only have stronger market bargaining power but wield greater influence over business and agricultural policymakers.</p> <p>However, it is not just physical resources that co-operatives can pool. The most powerful resource that farmers are able to share \u2013 once organised into co-operatives \u2013 is knowledge. Rural public and private advisory services work directly with co-operatives and farmer organisations around the world, to provide them with the information and services they need to produce more food for their families, and build booming local businesses. This support can range from linking farmers to the latest innovations in scientific research, to improving the efficiency of water use, to providing training on how to successfully market their produce.</p> <p>When they partner with existing co-operatives, whose members can range from 20 to 10,000 men and women, rural advisory services are able to disseminate good practices and knowledge quickly and effectively.</p> <p>The work that is carried out by rural advisory services to share knowledge between the farmers and others is a crucial part of the fight against hunger. By ensuring that farmers have the information, skills, markets and technologies they require, advisory services can improve the quality, diversity, volume, and accessibility of food. Furthermore, education on health and nutrition will go even further to combat the \"hidden hunger\" that afflicts many people in the developing world, who lack the vital nutrients to stave off illnesses that are themselves caused by malnutrition.</p> <p>But this crucial stream of information does not flow in just one direction. Farmers themselves also have important knowledge and innovations that are specific to their particular circumstances.</p> <p>There are abundant success stories about knowledge-sharing systems within co-operatives around the globe. Take the <a href=\"http://spesmru.intnet.mu/sepac/ugc.htm\" title=\"\">General Union of Co-operatives</a> (UGC) in Mozambique, for example. It began life as a group of 250 women from Maputo who pooled their tools, resources and knowledge to grow crops and raise poultry as a group. The women sold their excess produce and created a business that now has around 2,900 members, mostly women farmers. As the numbers have grown, they have expanded the reach of their operation and begun passing on knowledge to help others gain credit to start businesses. Today, the network supplies much of the vegetables, fruits, and poultry available in Maputo, with members making on average 50% more than the national minimum wage.</p> <p>Systems like this need to be scaled-up, to offer smallholder farmers the chance to work themselves out of hunger and poverty.</p> <p>We need a standardised way to share information that takes into account the diversity of rural life, and offers best-fit approaches for plural situations, rather than scaling-up a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. A database that draws together the scattered contact information for farmers' organisations in Africa, for example, is currently being set up. Such a system, covering not just Africa but the entire world, would go a long way to pooling the available information that can enable effective knowledge-sharing and collaboration.</p> <p>Knowledge is power. Let us invest in building the capacities of those most in need, who will use this know-how to combat hunger.</p> <p><em>Dr Kristen Davies is the executive secretary of the </em><a href=\"http://www.g-fras.org/en/\" title=\"\"><em>Global Forum for Rural Advisory Services </em></a><em>(GFRAS)</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Fifty years after the Cuban missile crisis, three generations of American policy-makers have cut teeth on those events that brought the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink in October 1962. This generation is now winding its way upwards as twenty- and thirtysomething speechwriters, special assistants, reporters and congressional candidates. </p> <p>The basic outline of what they have been taught remains the one <a href=\"http://live.belfercenter.org/publication/1334/second_look.html\">canonized by Harvard's Graham Allison</a> some 25 years ago, in four lessons. First, \"nuclear war is really possible.\" Second, \"the principal risk of nuclear war arises from the uncontrollable\" events that take place during genuine crises \u2013 such as simple mistakes or errors of perception \u2013 and not from the risk that rational human beings will intend war as a matter of policy. Third, \"the reality of nuclear interdependence\" means that states depend upon other states to avoid war for their own survival. Taken together, these \"perils of crisis management\" in the nuclear age ultimately teach that \"crisis must be prevented.\"</p> <p>In other words, if it is true that the only way to win a nuclear war is not to play, the only way to guarantee we don't find ourselves in an accidental pick-up game is to prevent crises before they occur. </p> <p>These lessons still hold; but they are far less obvious than they were in 1987, when the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact still existed, Osama bin Laden was fighting alongside US allies, email was for universities and Twitter was for the birds.</p> <p>Is nuclear war really possible? <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/12/cnn-poll-public-divided-on-eliminating-all-nuclear-weapons/\">Americans today still worry</a> about the possibility of a nuclear attack, though by a stateless terrorist group, rather than from Russia or China. But we are less likely to believe a nuclear war \u2013 as opposed to a one-off terrorist attack \u2013 is possible. So, even as military planners increasingly find nuclear weapons less useful than decades ago, the public responds to the possibility of nuclear terrorism with the desire for the US to keep its weapons, which are <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/08/06/top_air_force_officer_backup_supply_of_nuclear_warheads_larger_than_needed/\">more numerous now</a> than in the 1980s.</p> <p>What is uncontrollable? During the cold war, or by the 1980s at any rate, conventional wisdom held that our Soviet opponents were rational, interested in regime survival, and thus deterrable. Therefore, the threat of accident and misperception was as great as that posed by Communist aggression. Today, arguing that Iran's leaders are rational, and deterrable, is enough to get you called out from a presidential campaign podium \u2013 even if you are <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/03/01/435346/dempsey-iran-rational-actor/?mobile=nc\">chairman of the joint chiefs</a>.</p> <p>The irrationality of North Korea's leadership is an article of faith on the right, though <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kim/them/hermit.html\">not among experts</a> who have actually spent time there. (It seems necessary to note that \"rational\" is not the same thing as \"moral\".) If the threat from \"the uncontrollable\" now is perceived to arise from the character of regimes and terrorist groups, rather than circumstance, then lessons three and four of Allison have been placed in doubt. And so, we have the Pentagon worried about misperception and accident, showing interest in hotlines and incidents-at-sea agreements with Cuba and Iran \u2013 and political leaders saying no.</p> <p>What about nuclear interdependence? Developments in the last two decades or so have brought this core tenet of deterrence theory very much into question for those countries that must plan to deter the United States \u2013 and thus, for us as well.</p> <p>First, Ronald Reagan's dream of national missile defense remains so attractive precisely because it seems to offer a path out of interdependence (which, back in the day, we used to call \"mutual assured destruction\"). Experts, however, continue to tell us that watertight coverage is <a href=\"http://armscontrolnow.org/2012/10/03/for-missile-defense-it-depends-is-not-good-enough/\">unlikely to impossible</a>, and systems to counter such defenses will always be cheaper and advance faster than the systems themselves \u2013 both thanks to the laws of physics.</p> <p>Second, we are moving rapidly toward hyper-powerful, hyper-effective non-nuclear weapons with destructive powers that, decades ago, would have required nuclear weapons. If the United States is one day able to make a credible, non-nuclear threat to cripple another state's nuclear forces \u2013 which future systems like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/world/europe/23strike.html\">Prompt Global Strike</a> are moving steadily toward \u2013 then does that end our nuclear interdependence? Could cyber weapons one day achieve similar effects? Some US commentators and political leaders believe this would be a good thing.</p> <p>But a moment's thought about how the leaders of a smaller nuclear power could be expected to respond to such a threat should be disquieting. Hard as it may be to imagine for those old enough to have grown up with nuclear nightmares and duck-and-cover drills, we might come to miss that interdependence once it is gone.</p> <p>Lastly, do we still believe in crisis prevention? The debate continues, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/cuban-missile-crisis-russian-roulette\">including here</a>, about who got the better of whom 50 years ago. But we know that both Kennedy and Khrushchev believed it was important to de-escalate, important to control the hotheads in each of their governments, and important enough to risk their own leadership to do so. Each spent a great deal of time, before and after, publicly criticizing the other. But each could withdraw to private diplomacy and crisis management when he needed to.</p> <p>Is this still true? Fifty years ago, the discussion and debate over how to manage the crisis was influenced by an extremely small number of voices. The sources of information the American public \u2013 and decision-makers \u2013 had were limited. And neither the media nor the public had the ability to know and comment on everything as it happened. For better and worse, it is now simply impossible to control the media and public environment as Kennedy, to say nothing of Khrushchev, did. This year alone has seen <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/12/social-media-and-the-assassination-of-an-ambassador.html\">Twitter turn</a> a series of demonstrations and a terrorist attack in North Africa into a central issue of the presidential campaign, outstrip policy-makers in managing the sensitive case of a would-be Chinese defector and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/250129-obama-camp-hammers-romney-on-47-percent-through-social-media\">magnify</a> gaffe, after gaffe, after gaffe. </p> <p>Fifty years after Cuba, in short, nuclear war is still possible. Crisis management is more perilous and the international environment is, if anything, less controllable. America is now as interdependent in economics, health and well-being as we were in nuclear strategy then. We have not learned to live with our interdependence any more gracefully.</p>",
  "<p>The Vatican has distanced itself from a row over Muslim immigrants in Europe triggered by the showing at a synod of a video that claims \"Europe as we know it will cease to exist.\"</p> <p>Cardinal Peter Turkson, the president of the Vatican's council for justice and peace \u2013 and seen as a possible future pope \u2013 played the disputed video in a discussion period on Saturday during a synod attended by 262 bishops from across the world.</p> <p>Entitled Muslim Demographics, and viewed more than 13m times on YouTube since its release in 2009, the seven-minute long video claims Muslim immigration and higher birth rates means France will become \"an Islamic republic\" within 39 years.</p> <p>But many of the statistics used have been shown to be false or unproven, including a claim that French Muslim families have 8.1 children on average, and that 25% of Belgians are Muslims \u2013 the true figure is 6%. A German government official is falsely quoted as saying Germany will be a Muslim state by 2050.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a Vatican spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, sought to distance the holy see from the video, saying: \"This video does not express the view of the synod or the Vatican. Turkson has said he is sorry if the video was wrongly interpreted since he did not intend it to be anti-Muslim, merely a comment on the nihilism in western society.\"</p> <p>Bishops who watched the video were reportedly shocked by its content.</p> <p>\"I think it would be fair to say that several in the room questioned the veracity of the facts followed by, 'who can this be attributed to?' and 'who actually wanted this film to be shown?'\" said Father Thomas Rosica during a press briefing on the synod.</p> <p>Vatican radio was more critical, calling the video \"fear mongering\", adding: \"Why one of the curial cardinals chose to show this piece of anti-Islamic propaganda is quite unclear.\"</p> <p>Pope Benedict has stressed the importance of defending Europe's Christian identity, but he has also promoted dialogue with Muslims, most recently during his visit to Lebanon last month. Last week he read out a greeting in Arabic for the first time during his weekly general audience in a bid to ease religious tensions.</p> <p>Turkson, who is from Ghana, has said over the years that theological dialogue with Muslims is impossible. Known for his strong views, the cardinal also proposed the creation of a global bank after the global economic crisis began in 2008.</p> <p>One bishop at the synod asked about the spurious video shown was less critical, telling the National Catholic Reporter: \"At least it got us talking about something more important than what order confirmation and first communion ought to be in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of billions of pounds will need to be spent on preserving the world's biodiversity, if the destruction of habitats, species and natural resources is to be slowed, <a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/fin/hlpgar-sp-01/official/hlpgar-sp-01-01-report-en.pdf\" title=\"\">a new report for the United Nations has found</a>.</p> <p>But the amounts needed are insignificant compared with the costs of allowing the destruction to continue, according to the study. These costs include water scarcity, declining agricultural productivity, climate change and the exhaustion of fish stocks. Taken together, the perils of our destruction of biodiversity represent one of the most serious threats to the world's future, so actions taken now to tackle these threats will pay off, in the both the short and the long term, it said.</p> <p>Pavan Sukhdev, the economist who was chief author of the report, said: \"While there are some big numbers in this report [in terms of the money that must be spent], our panel found that the greatest resource needs are around reducing the direct drivers of biodiversity, those which occur throughout our economies and societies, and those which \u2013 if addressed \u2013 will deliver benefits far beyond biodiversity, to human health, livelihoods, and sustainable development based on a healthier and more secure natural environment. In this context they should not be seen as a bill to the biodiversity community, but a call for action to develop our institutions and governance structures to ensure biodiversity is taken into account in decisions in all sectors of our society.\"</p> <p>The costs of preserving different habitats vary widely, especially depending on how they are to be managed. For instance, conserving fish stocks would cost about $800m to $3bn a year from 2013-2020, but this would be far outweighed by the benefits \u2013 currently, according to the report, global fisheries could be worth $50bn a year more to fishermen and consumers if they were better managed. Spending on making agriculture more sustainable would cost a total of $12bn by 2020, but the result would be greater productivity and better nutrition for millions.</p> <p>Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said the money needed should be regarded as an investment rather than a cost, because it would not only preserve valuable ecosystems but generate jobs and preserve resources.</p> <p>One of the ways of trying to preserve biodiversity is to take \"natural capital\" into account \u2013 estimating how much our natural resources are worth in monetary terms. This includes putting a value on \"ecosystem services\" \u2013 for instance, the fact that well-kept forests are of key importance in providing fresh water for human consumption, and prevent soil erosion \u2013 that are normally not valued. When these services are not valued, it is easy for them to be destroyed without taking the consequences into account.</p> <p>Steiner said there were \"immense\" returns to be made on investing in forests alone. He pointed to an estimate that restoring 15% of degraded forest landscapes worldwide could generate up to $85bn worth of ecosystem services a year, which would benefit rural dwellers and the poor. Investing $40bn a year should be enough to halve deforestation rates around the world, he said.</p> <p>The report was published at the start of <a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/cop11/\" title=\"\">the high-level negotiating session of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity</a>, which is taking place in Hyderabad, India, this week. Reacting to the findings, the Indian government made a landmark pledge to spend $50m on biodiversity, both within India and with other developing countries.</p> <p>Campaigners praised the pledge as a good example to other nations. Lasse Gustavsson, international executive director of conservation at WWF, said: \"This is a welcome show of leadership from one of the world's fastest growing \u2013 and biologically rich \u2013 countries. It's now up to other countries to make similar commitments and show the world how serious they are about protecting our planet's natural wealth.\"</p> <p>Governments are meeting in Hyderabad to discuss ways of meeting biodiversity targets that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/29/biodiversity-talks-ministers-nagoya-strategy?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">were set two years ago at a UN conference in Nagoya, Japan</a>. The key target is a halving of the rate of the loss of the planet's natural habitats by 2020.</p> <p>Richard Benyon, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister responsible for biodiversity, attending the CBD conference, said: \"[The report] has shown how important it is to mobilise resources of every kind \u2013 human, technical and financial, both public and private \u2013 in order to achieve the challenging targets we set ourselves at Nagoya.\"</p>",
  "<p>Adversity in early childhood \u2013 in the form of anything from poverty to physical abuse \u2013 has measurable changes in the function of the brain and body well into adulthood, according to researchers.</p> <p>Growing up in worse socioeconomic circumstances can impair working memory as an adult and affect the size of different parts of the brain, while abuse can lead to a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later life, they report.</p> <p>In a series of presentations at the annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience in New Orleans on Tuesday, scientists reported on work studying critical periods of development for the brain. Eric Pakulak, at the University of Oregon, found that people who grew up in homes with a lower socioeconomic status <a href=\"http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=734b1ccd-cfcf-4394-a945-083ca58f8033&amp;cKey=707aae9d-766c-4309-8368-9f4d37117bf1&amp;mKey=%7b70007181-01C9-4DE9-A0A2-EEBFA14CD9F1%7d\" title=\"\">had greater deficits in working memory</a>, compared with those from wealthier homes, even when he controlled for the participants' education.</p> <p>Working memory, Pakulak said, was broadly associated with general intelligence. \"As a four- or five-year-old, if you have very good attention and regulations skills, it's a foundational skill that would spill over into other areas of cognition \u2013 if you're trying to learn your letters, or to read, or learning numbers or math or a musical instrument. When you're learning a musical instrument, you're really training attention.\"</p> <p>He asked 72 adults to complete a test of working memory, where they had to remember the final words from a series of sentences. On average, adults from lower socioeconomic backgrounds could remember two words whereas those from more wealthy backgrounds, on average, got up to four words.</p> <p>Suzanne Houston, of the University of Southern California, <a href=\"http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=734b1ccd-cfcf-4394-a945-083ca58f8033&amp;cKey=3e29ca4d-ee94-4a1d-abec-f1ad9e0f0353&amp;mKey=%7B70007181-01C9-4DE9-A0A2-EEBFA14CD9F1%7D\" title=\"\">showed that</a> the size of different parts of the brain could be affected by growing up in different homes. \"We found higher parent education, smaller amygdala. The higher the income, the larger the hippocampus.\"</p> <p>The overall size of brain regions was not of primary significance, she said, but the fact they were measurably different would allow scientists to tease out what sorts of differing environmental factors might be affecting the brain development of children from different backgrounds.</p> <p>Understanding environment can also help scientists to modify it. Pakulak said his work had informed the development of teaching courses that could, by working with parents and pre-school children from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds, improve aspects of parents' behaviour and reduce their stress, as well as improving children's behaviour and cognition within weeks.</p> <p>\"Most powerfully, we've shown that, after eight weeks, children in our intervention training group show the same [result for] brain function for selective attention that their higher [socioeconomic backgrounds] peers show,\" Pakulak said.</p> <p>Layla Banihashemi, of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the enduring effects of physical abuse in childhood. She <a href=\"http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=472a87ad-f4c1-4530-8c99-a8f59cccbfe6&amp;cKey=85b160e7-a2ca-4500-8851-c543bb542650&amp;mKey=%7B70007181-01C9-4DE9-A0A2-EEBFA14CD9F1%7D\" title=\"\">found that</a> adults who suffered physical abuse as children had greater increases in blood pressure when they engaged in stressful tasks as adults. Overall, she said, this would put them at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>She asked 155 healthy adults, who were 40 years old on average, to complete a childhood trauma questionnaire, a standard way of assessing the level of physical abuse someone may have suffered as a child. \"As physical abuse scores increased from none to moderate to severe levels, we saw significant increases in the change in blood pressure in response to stress,\" said Banihashemi.</p> <p>The mean arterial blood pressure in people who had suffered no abuse during childhood changed by 2.73mmHg, from a baseline of around 90mmHg, when they were stressed in Banihashemi's experiment. In the low abuse group, the average change was 4.71mmHg, and moderate or severe abuse in childhood elicited an average change of 5.45 mmHg. \"People that have these heightened blood pressure responses, in magnitude and duration, are more at risk at developing cardiovascular disease,\" she said.</p> <p>Banihashemi added that most of the participants in her study were not in the severely abused category. \"They are primarily within the minimal range \u2013 I think this is unique because it indicates that even minimal to moderate levels of abuse can influence stress responses of the brain and body.\"</p> <p>Andrea Danese, a clinical lecturer in child and adolescent psychiatry at <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/\" title=\"\">King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry</a>, said the series of studies addressed important questions in the understanding of how childhood experiences shape adult lives.</p> <p>Pakulak's work, he said, was particularly interesting because it showed how it was possible to remediate the consequences of a lack of opportunity early in life. \"These changes might support upward social mobility and improve family environment across generations.\"</p> <p>He added that replication of developmental studies would be crucial in working out which effects are real and which are not. \"A key limitation is that human studies linking early experiences to later brain, psychological, or health outcomes are observational in nature,\" he said. \"For ethical and practical reasons, researchers can seldom actively manipulate children's experiences and more often have to passively observe differences in experiences and relate them to certain outcomes.</p> <p>\"However, because different experiences or vulnerabilities \u2013 poverty, insufficient stimulation, maltreatment, parental mental illness, low IQ \u2013 often occur together in the same children, it is challenging to confidently point to the effects of one specific experience without its active manipulation.\"</p> <p>Previous meta-analyses have shown that being sexually or emotionally abused as a child <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/13/childhood-abuse-growth-brain-emotions\" title=\"\">can affect the development of a part of the brain</a> that controls memory and the regulation of emotions. In addition, people with a history of abuse or maltreatment during childhood are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/15/depression-childhood-abuse-maltreatment\" title=\"\">twice as likely to have recurrent episodes of depression in adulthood</a>. These individuals are also less likely to respond well to psychological or drug-based treatments.</p>",
  "<p>Around 350 years ago, the famous diarist, MP and English naval adminstrator, Samuel Pepys, wrote in his diary that a man had come to his door with an envelope containing several gold coins from a potential contractor. Pepys had asked his servant if the contractor was a reliable one. The servant had assured him that he was, so the gift was accepted.</p> <p>I was reminded of Pepys's principle that he only received payments from reliable contractors by <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/insight/article1147765.ece\" title=\"\">the explanations</a> of Admiral Trevor Soar, Lieutenant General Richard Applegate, a former head of army procurement, and Lord Stirrup, a former chief of the defence staff, that in effect they lobbied only if they were satisfied that the equipment was of suitable quality.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that the former armed forces chiefs were corrupt. They should no longer have any direct influence on procurements. But there is a question mark over, for example, the \u00a3500m funding alleged to have been released by the UK government for the procurement of a helicopter safety programme, which was expected to benefit an Israeli company. Could the money have been spent more wisely? How was the decision arrived at? Once the decision to spend the \u00a3500m was made, was it inevitable that the Israeli company would get the business?</p> <p>These questions demand an urgent and transparent enquiry. There is also the issue that the rules set down by the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), which specify that senior officers to wait up to two years after leaving the armed forces before they can lobby on behalf of defence companies, appear to have been ignored.</p> <p>Watchdog <a href=\"http://bpi.transparency.org/bpi2011/results/\" title=\"\">Transparency International research</a> suggests that defence is a fairly corrupt industry and a little research on the internet will identify plenty of examples.</p> <p>Lobbying is a fact of life. It is inevitable that companies seek public sector business because it is so vast \u2013 I estimate that global public sector procurement could be worth around $7tn a year. If paying several hundred thousand dollars, or even several million dollars, to a lobbyist helps to secure a tiny proportion of this business, that would represent a good deal. Even where there is a competitive process, lobbying can influence specifications and evaluation criteria in such a way as to favour a particular company. Is that corruption? Perhaps not, if the outcome of the tendering exercise is a better specification or outcome. At the other extreme, however, the National Audit Office should always investigate corruption as a possibility where a business case for a major contract has, after it has been let, been shown not to stack up.</p> <p>Lobbying is affordable only for major companies. Senior officers from such companies, because of their profile, are also likely to rub shoulders with politicians and senior public sector officials. That makes sound commercial sense, but it automatically gives them an advantage over companies that do not have such access.</p> <p>This reinforces the disadvantage that smaller companies suffer as a result of the expensive tendering process. One company found that by employing a full-time tendering team, it increased its proportion of public sector wins from one in 20 to one in four. In this sort of environment, most medium-sized and smaller companies don't stand a chance.</p> <p>The government is pressing for pre-commercial procurement \u2013 ie, engaging with industry before the procurement process starts. This policy was included in the Treasury financial \"bible\" for government departments 23 years ago. If done properly, it enables a transparent process for arriving at decisions to procure and tender, and for what goes into the tender documentation. Such a policy reduces the power of lobbyists and creates a more even playing field for private sector competitors.</p> <p>Of course, the Ministry of Defence engages with industry over potential significant procurements, as do other public sector organisations. However, signing up to a transparent process for its pre-commercial engagements, with strong oversight by the National Audit Office, may be long overdue.</p> <p>Given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/03/west-coast-rail-fiasco-procurement\" title=\"\">the west coast main line contracting fiasco</a> and <a href=\"http://www.publicservice.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=17788\" title=\"\">the 2011 report </a>by the National Audit Office on some ICT projects, public sector departments and departmental families might be well advised to follow suit.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

  "<p>Reduce, minimise, small, less, neutral... Grow, big, achieve, more, positive.</p> <p>The language of sustainability and the language of business couldn't be more different. It's the symptom of a deeper divide that many businesses struggle to overcome.</p> <p>It's a problem of scale. The traditional argument for business sustainability is that companies need to minimise their impact or reduce their footprint; in short, to do less bad. Cut the carbon, reduce the waste, minimise the water use. It's all vitally important but couched in a terminology almost guaranteed to get it sidelined as \"housekeeping\". Sustainability and CSR have been about making business small. That's like asking a large powerful person to crouch down, talk quietly, and do less. They may try for a while, but eventually they'll just have to stretch.</p> <p>Which is exactly what some progressive companies are now doing. Last night Kingfisher (the parent of DIY companies B&amp;Q and Castorama) announced it will become <a href=\"http://www.kingfisher.com/netpositive/\" title=\"\">Net Positive by 2050</a>. They don't just want FSC wood, they want global net reforestation. Not only energy efficiency, but for all their consumers' homes to be zero carbon or net generators of energy. These aren't small commitments. In fact they are almost unimaginably ambitious, from standing where we are today.</p> <p>I was in the Kingfisher boardroom the day they decided to go Net Positive. I've been in a few other boardrooms recently in which similar conversations are taking place. Something interesting is going on. Businesses are learning to talk about sustainability in their own terms, and those terms are big.</p> <p>The lexicon of the boardroom isn't about doing less. The business mindset is about doing more. The language is big, hairy and audacious. In their 1994 book, Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies, James Collins and Jerry Porras invented the concept of big, hairy and audacious goals or BHAGs. A truly audacious goal will take 10 to 30 years to meet. You believe it utterly inside the business, but realise that the outside world might take some convincing. You know a BHAG is going to take serious amounts of work and probably crush some old mindsets along the way. The best BHAGs are truly visionary, even if you're not quite sure how you'll get there.</p> <p>That's why the CEO and board need to get involved. Transformative sustainability is risky. Kingfisher has spent almost a year selling the idea into the business, war-gaming the targets and working out how the hell to re-engineer processes and performance targets to face towards the new goal. I have no doubt a lower ambition would have been easier to embed. There would have been fewer hard questions, smoother sign-off, and a much gentler journey. But that would be medium, bald and coy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/\" title=\"\">Unilever Sustainable Living Plan</a>, GE's <a href=\"http://www.ecomagination.com/\" title=\"\">Ecomagination</a> and Marks and Spencer's <a href=\"http://plana.marksandspencer.com/about\" title=\"\">Plan A</a> are all big hairy audacious goals, and now Kingfisher's <a href=\"http://www.kingfisher.com/netpositive/index.asp?pageid=1\" title=\"\">Net Positive</a> has joined them. These are ballsy, growth-focussed and competitive approaches to sustainability. The new cadre of campaigning CEO's have worked out that scary, difficult and transformative goals are hugely more motivating than easy, simple and small ones. The issues are familiar, but the framing sounds more Harvard Business Review than sustainability report.</p> <p>It's a pity that so few businesses have cracked this way of thinking, talking or goal setting. Business in the Community's new <a href=\"http://www.maydaynetwork.com/)\" title=\"\">9 Billion Challenge</a> could help. They are challenging their members to design, inspire, prod and engineer nine billion sustainable lifestyles. They acknowledge that needs more than incremental footprint improvements, and so are calling for fundamental business model transformations instead. Right now they are asking businesses what they think. Hopefully more will answer \"hell yes, let's do it\" than have so far.</p> <p>And about time too. The challenges we face require some boldness. With a population of 9 billion people, climate change, rampant poverty and resource scarcity, a hugely ambitious mindset is appropriate. That doesn't mean near-term targets are irreverent; businesses need to have achievable measures to work towards. But those measures are simply milestones on the way to greatness. It's also not good enough to randomly pick a direction and develop a catchy slogan. The leaders carefully identify the material sustainability issues for their business, match their business skills to them, and set an ambitious goal to fix them for their business and for everyone else by default. Then they find the catchy slogan.</p> <p>This is meta-sustainability. It's business strategy and environmental/social goals merging into new business models.</p> <p>Don't ask business to be smaller. Ask them to be bigger, more impactful and more influential. Ask business to take sustainability to scale.</p> <p>Welcome to the era of big sustainability.</p> <p><em>Solitaire Townsend is co-founder, </em><a href=\"http://www.futerra.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Futerra Sustainability Communications</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>When he was five years old, <a href=\"http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/newshome/15132745/the-drawing-that-proves-daredevil-felix-was-born-to-fly\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner drew a picture for his mum</a>. Twelve years later, when the first man to break the sound barrier unaided had just made his first ever skydive, Baumgartner's mother gave the picture back to him: it showed him floating down to earth, suspended \u2013 horizontally, but you can't have everything \u2013 from a large parachute. There's a happy, smiling sun beaming down on the scene, and what looks like his family standing on the ground, with drinks, waiting for him to land.</p> <p>Tom Daley, who became a world diving champion at the age of 15 and has represented Great Britain at the last two Olympics, similarly prefigured his achievement, drawing a picture of himself aged nine. Titled My Ambition, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomDaley1994/status/234568659115319296\" title=\"\">the drawing, which he tweeted after winning a bronze medal in the individual competition this summer</a>, shows him in a handstand on a diving board, with the Olympic rings and the words \"London 2012\" on either side (London was, at the time, just one among several candidate cities).</p> <p>Psychologists have long known that art created by children can be an accurate reflection of their inner worlds. Children create art for the same reasons as anyone: to express thoughts or emotions. Art can provide them with a safe environment to delve into their memories and negotiate present-day realities, telling a story that that can capture a moment \u2013 or a sequence of moments \u2013 in their physical, emotional or psychological life.</p> <p>Much of the attention paid to the interpretation of children's art in recent years has tended to concentrate on its role in \"understanding negative events\", <a href=\"http://www.chi.ac.uk/staff/dr-esther-burkitt-ba-oxon-msc-oxon-phd-cpsychol-csci\" title=\"\">says Dr Esther Burkitt</a>, reader in developmental psychology at the University of Chichester, a specialist in the field who has published widely on many aspects of children's drawings. Painting and drawing can help children in psychological distress to confront issues such as trauma, depression or abuse, and allow therapists to help them externalise and discuss problems.</p> <p>Children's terrifyingly simple, brutally clear drawings of war and atrocity <a href=\"http://www.idee.org/chchilddraw.htm\" title=\"\">have been extensively used</a> to help young victims recover from the traumatic experiences they have lived through with their families, and even have been accepted by the International Criminal Court as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7923247.stm\" title=\"\">supporting evidence of violations of the rules of war</a>.</p> <p>It is rarer, says Burkitt, to see a more positive representation of images created by children. \"But children's drawings of themselves can, certainly, be representative of their hopes and dreams,\" she says. \"And the act of focusing and visualising can help them to realise their dreams. The act of drawing can be about ambition and value clarification: helping children to crystallise a particular goal, to really focus and go on to achieve what they want to become.\"</p> <p>While we should be wary of predicting on the basis of a drawing, \"it's pretty amazing that we can make these links back,\" Burkitt adds. From where we are now, drawings such as Baumgartner's and Daley's seem to \"show incredible foresight, but also the sacrifices they might have made. They can certainly be seen as representations of vision and motivation\".</p>",

  "<p>Simon is squeezed into a chair, trapped in the pharmacy consultation area, waiting for his prescriptions. Last year he retired from a career in teaching, and has been gaining weight ever since. He is well aware his waistline shapes his health, and believes I'm about to nag him.</p> <p>At the beginning of the year, pharmacists, along with GPs, nurses and other health professionals, signed up to the government's Making Every Contact Count campaign. Sounding more like the exhortations of a rugby league coach, it is actually one of the NHS Future Forum proposals to reduce health inequalities. Each and every contact with the public is to be seen as an opportunity to help them improve their health. Although it is considered to be a core responsibility in the NHS, there is no funding, and the evidence base to support it is limited.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I'm&#xa0;heading Simon's way. I remind him that as a non-smoker, if he were to gradually lose that abdominal fat \u2013 I've previously suggested goals at six, 12 and 18 months \u2013 the likelihood of his premature death from heart attack or stroke would plummet. Not only that, but he probably wouldn't need his considerable medications. No more physical and mental slowing down caused by beta blockers, or the disabling muscle discomfort statins can cause, or the need for antacids, laxatives and haemorrhoid treatments. In his shoes I imagine myself binning the bus pass and walking home for a&#xa0;salad supper. But knowledge alone seldom changes behaviour.</p> <p>The conceptualisation of obesity as a straightforward issue of energy balance \u2013 calories in versus calories out \u2013 has been described by obesity expert <a href=\"http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/rutter.harry\" title=\"\">Dr&#xa0;Harry Rutter</a> as \"<a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61272-5/fulltext#article_upsell\" title=\"\">seductively simple</a>\". There may be genetic factors involved, but, either way, an individual has much less choice in the matter of their weight than is commonly assumed.</p> <p>Supermarkets sell foods rich in salt, sugars and fats; the food and drink industry lifestyle advertising and product placements encourage ever more consumption; increasingly sedentary lifestyles and being overweight have become accepted social norms. The behavioural and environmental influences are such that it is much more likely that people gain weight than lose it. The behaviour demonstrated by Simon has been described <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2961356-1/fulltext\" title=\"\">in a Lancet editorial</a> as \"a&#xa0;normal response by a normal person to an abnormal environment\".</p> <p>The difficulties of choosing healthy lifestyles in deprived communities are well established. Simon enjoys a pensioned retirement, but he lives in an obesogenic environment in which the ability to exercise choice is fundamentally compromised.</p> <p>Public health is clearly at odds with the vested interests of the food and drink industry, whose profits are fuelled by the obesity and alcohol epidemics. The impact of my targeting Simon with health promotion, or prescribing drugs to modify his fat metabolism, pales to nothing in the face of ubiquitous and malign social promotions.</p> <p>The government's protracted emphasis on personal responsibility deflects attention from these broader determinants of health. Rather than regulating to create an environment in which individual prevention and treatment could be effective, the government actively seeks the food industry's advice in partnership arrangements. Capitalism has replaced public health advisers with corporate moguls.</p> <p>Tax bad food, subsidise good food, and I'll have a fighting chance to make every contact count. But without social change, when I next see Simon he will probably be contributing to the diabetic epidemic, and still thinking I'm a nag.</p> <p>Peter Dawson is a locum pharmacist in West Yorkshire</p>",
  "<p>Apparently, the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc) \u2013 the body responsible for managing UK environmental sciences \u2013 feel it's its job to help \"de-risk\" major investment decisions in the polar regions. It's page four, point 19 of <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/consult/bas-noc-merger-consultation.pdf\" title=\"\">their submission</a> to a recent government consultation on <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2012/10/counting-the-cost-of-antarctic-research\" title=\"\">merging research centres</a>. The last bullet point is the key one, but it should be read in the context of the whole section, along with the extra reporting from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/14/environmental-science-agencies-oil-polar\" title=\"\">the Guardian's Terry Macalister</a>. There are many reasons to be angry about this. Here are three.</p> <p>First, \"de-risking\". This isn't just annoyingly management speak, it borders on the disingenuous. It's unclear what these \"major investments\" might be. Duncan Wingham, Nerc's chief executive, denied this necessarily included drilling in the Arctic, but there are all sorts of possible human-caused natural hazards involved in working here: threats to biodiversity or contributions to climate change, to name just a couple of headliners. There are possible financial risks too. As Macalister reports, many banks have decided not to support operations in the far north. Nerc can try and \"de-risk\" if it wants. I think it will just exchange old ones for new. And I for one want an open public debate about which risks we're OK with. I don't want bullet points in rushed consultation documents.</p> <p>Second, it reflects a misapplication of policies designed to encourage publicly funded scientists to show how their work contributes to society. These are thoughtful policies, built in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3802.htm\" title=\"\">the BSE crisis and fights over GMOs</a>, designed to make science publicly accountable, not industrially so. Wingham said all scientific institutes were now under pressure to ensure they were providing value to the UK economy. But there are a variety of ways to support the economy. There are also other ways to show the public value of science than merely financial ones, and other connections to make than industrial ones. Yet policies like the <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_88_12.htm\" title=\"\">Research Partnership Investment Fund</a>, announced last week, focus public funding on projects that are matched with money from private companies or charities, and Nerc feels a need to find ways to demonstrate its willingness to support even the more controversial business decisions.</p> <p>Back when times were a bit more financially booming, Demos published a lovely pamphlet on the <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/publicvalueofscience\" title=\"\">public value of science</a>, reflecting an increasingly accepted view in the UK that science should engage the public in decisions about research. Now we're all more occupied with talk of cuts, this political discourse seems to be increasingly captured by industrial interests. I really don't see why. If anything, now more than ever we should have a science by the people for the people. Honestly, I suspect part of the problem is down to the lack of imagination and political savvy of some scientists. Still, I doubt if government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/17/government-officials-schmooze-athon-shell\" title=\"\">\"schmoozeathons\" with Shell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15034526\" title=\"\">official ministerial \"buddies\" for GlaxoSmithKline</a> help. I wonder where the public are meant to be in all of this.</p> <p>Third and finally, this Nerc statement just seems to go against the spirit of the <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geopolitical/treaty/update_1959.php\" title=\"\">1959 Antarctic Treaty</a>, one of the most beautiful bits of international policy you're likely to read, which set aside Antarctica as a site for peaceful scientific research. Yes, arguably politicians only agreed because they could get some politicking out of it, David Willetts \"dropping by\" the Falklands on the way back from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/9085781/David-Willetts-to-visit-the-Falkland-Islands.html\" title=\"\">a visit to the British Antarctic Survey</a>, for example. But the treaty stands as an expression of hope, agreement and desire to learn about and protect a bit of the world, and is worth respecting. If anything, we should be <a href=\"http://savethearctic.org/en/pages/faq\" title=\"\">following Greenpeace's call</a> to extend this approach north, and strengthen international policies and public ownership of both polar regions, not finding ways to unravel one of the few global commitments for peace, nature and knowledge we have going. Or maybe the Arctic is the new \"hydrocarbon frontier\", to borrow a phrase from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Opposites-Opportunities-Guardian-ebook/dp/B0076KWQ7M\" title=\"\">Terry Macalister's book on the Arctic</a>. But if so we should talk about it first. Again, we need an open, public debate; not bullet points in consultation documents.</p> <p>Why on Earth does Nerc think it should be part of selling off polar science in such a way? Its scientists shouldn't let Nerc be so cheap. The public shouldn't either.</p>",

From my random browsings through the Bible I have naively assumed that the central tenets of the teachings of Jesus Christ were love and humility, quite opposite to the view expressed by Hans K\u00fcng that the Roman Catholic church is besmirched by corruption, pomposity and addiction to hierarchical rules and material wealth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/catholic-revolution-nazi-dictatorship-pope\" title=\"\">(Theologian leads church revolt, 12 October)</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unlike the world's other great belief systems, the Vatican enjoys political power far above its size, having been created as the world's smallest state in 1929 through the influence of the then Italian prime minister Benito Mussolini, who was more noted for his brutality than his piety. While millions of laity and priests receive solace and supernatural comfort from Christ's teachings, there is much distress about church dogma, which forbids the ordination of women, insists on priestly chastity, deplores homosexuality and yet takes inadequate action against priestly paedophilia.</p> <p>The Abrahamic religions of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, together with Hinduism, the philosophies of Buddhism and Daoism, and many atheists have developed ethical principles which, if followed co-operatively, could repair that potentially fatal global deficiency disease: lack of wisdom. A start might be made if the restless stirrings within the Catholic church described by K\u00fcng could lead to the conversion of the Vatican to Christianity in its original sense. <br><strong>Bryan Furnass</strong><br>Canberra, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 I thought Tom Holland's article on the \"Jesus's wife\" document was bad scholarship <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/19/jesus-wife-christianity-authorised-history\" title=\"\">(Jesus's wife adds fresh perspective, 28 September)</a>. It repeats the old idea that Christianity was formed in the fourth century by the Roman state and that prior to this it was a rich profusion of sects allowing almost everything, especially lots of sex.</p> <p>In fact the books of the New Testament were fixed by the early Christian community in the early second century. It is quite clear from these books that the early Christians believed in a divine, celibate and unmarried Christ. In the second and third centuries, Gnostic gospels appear as various people of a sort of \"new age\" mindset hopped on the Christian bandwagon, and these are indeed quite alien to the original Christian position, which was after all very Jewish.</p> <p>Would your writer have chanced this sort of drastic re-interpretation of the Qur'an?

  "<p>For Kenyan gospel rapper Eko Dydda, words are more than mere signifiers. They can be life-or-death markers of who you are.</p> <p>\"I almost got killed by people of my tribe because I couldn't speak the language. I can't speak vernacular. I grew up in the streets. I speak Sheng,\" he said, referring to the ever-evolving slang blend of Kiswahili and English, Kenya's two official languages.</p> <p>The incident happened during post-election violence in Nairobi's Mathare slum in 2007, and it illustrates the importance of language as an identifier in Kenya, home to more than 40 tribes and over 60 tribal languages.</p> <p>For Eko Dydda, Sheng's mongrel-like quality has always been appealing, for aesthetic and political reasons, but on that one day five years ago, this favouritism almost cost him his life.</p> <p>He was saved by a stranger. \"He can't speak vernacular. He's a born-town,\" the man explained, using slang to describe a Kenyan who has never lived outside the city. The gang left him alone.</p> <p>As Kenya gears up for its first presidential election since the disputed 2007 poll, the question of language and national identity is again being debated. In the cosmopolitan capital Nairobi, where upmarket malls stock shoes that cost more than a month's wages for people in nearby slums, English, Kiswahili and Sheng dominate, often merging seamlessly in the mouths of the younger generation.</p> <p>Linguists say the balance of power between these three, and some of the more widely spoken vernacular or tribal languages such as Kikuyu or Luo, is constantly evolving, with a new voice also rising \u2013 Kenyan English, a version of the standard English bequeathed by British colonial rulers.</p> <p>Standard English is still seen as the must-have language for upwardly mobile Kenyans. It is the language of instruction in schools, where Kiswahili is taught as a subject. Yet outside Nairobi's malls, Kiswahili and Sheng, itself a 1970s child of the slums, dominate the city's low-income neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Further away, in the arid north of the Rift Valley, tribal languages come to the fore, such as Kikuyu, Luo, Maa, Turkana or Kipsigis.</p> <p>Kiswahili, a Bantu language that has borrowed heavily from Arabic and is widely spoken in east Africa, was given the status of an official language in Kenya's 2010 constitution, but Professor <a href=\"http://www.ahadi.org/projects/katiba/29-kimani-njogu-phd.html\" title=\"\">Kimani Njogu</a>, a respected linguist and Kiswahili scholar, says English is favoured, at least among a certain class.</p> <p>\"The two languages are competing for space, and to the extent that English is still privileged in terms of status, in terms of prestige, in terms of job placement ... it is way ahead of Kiswahili,\" he said.</p> <p>However, Kiswahili remains the national language, and this confers a special status. \"It's the language of national consciousness \u2026 in terms of building nationhood across ethnic groups in a very fragile state, it is important it is made available across the country,\" Njogu said, mindful of early signs of rising tensions ahead of next March's election in a country where people tend to vote on tribal lines.</p> <p>Although English appears to be thriving, its nature is changing. English schoolbooks are now written by Kenyans and the language is taught by Kenyans. In its daily use, it is being shaped into a unique form, dubbed Kenyan English.</p> <p>Njogu gives some examples, highlighting the common use of double pronouns, such as \"me myself, I don't know,\" or \"we, ourselves\".</p> <p>He does not see Kenyan English taking over from standard English but admits this will depend to a degree on how committed teachers are in upholding the more academic, written form.</p> <p>Sheng is also growing up, slouching from the streets into the classroom, and into mainstream media: a multimedia production <a href=\"http://shujaaz.fm/\" title=\"\">Shujaaz.FM</a> (\"heroes\" in Sheng) won an International Digital Emmy Award in April.</p> <p>Njogu said research done by a graduate student he worked with found that Sheng, which he describes as a \"youth communicative code\", is finding its way into English compositions in high schools. \"What will happen eventually is ... it will no longer be a youth-driven slang. I think it will be an urban population-driven slang so that older people who were initially excluded from Sheng will be speakers of Sheng,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The salience of standard English and the salience of Kiswahili will not be as central because of Sheng. It's attractive, it allows for greater flexibility, if you get stuck with terminology you are able to borrow from anywhere and just insert,\" he said.</p> <p>In Sheng, a person might greet another by saying \"Sasa?\" (How are you now?), to which the reply might be \"Fit sana\", where \"fit\" comes from English and \"sana\" means \"very\" in Swahili.</p> <p>Some Kenyan officials have warned that Sheng's popularity is affecting the quality of Kiswahili and English among schoolchildren. In 2011, then minister of education Sam Ongeri blamed Sheng for students' poor performances in final exams in the two official languages.</p> <p>Analysts say the real problem more likely lies in the quality of education being offered at state schools.</p> <p>John Mugo is the country co-ordinator for <a href=\"http://www.uwezo.net/\" title=\"\">Uwezo Kenya</a> (\"capability\" in Kiswahili), which produces annual literacy and numeracy studies among children aged between six and 16. Only around 30% of children in Grade 3 (aged around eight to nine years) can do Grade 2 work, Mugo says.</p> <p>The reasons are varied and include teacher and pupil absenteeism, a lack of materials, lack of parent participation, and the national focus on performance in the final primary school exam, which leaves lower grades stuck with the least motivated, least talented teachers.</p> <p>Within that context, however, English is privileged because, Mugo says, teachers and parents believe it is essential for success. \"The attitude of parents and teachers is that whoever speaks English earliest will pass [the exams] after eight years.\"</p> <p>Njogu says the linguistic changes must be placed in a global context, and that no language need necessarily lose out. \"We are really talking about Englishes, and these Englishes are predominantly English as spoken in Britain but with twists and turns that are localised,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I have always taken the view that the way to do this is not to discourage Kenyan English but to teach English well and to teach Kiswahili well but to take into consideration the emergence of all these varieties, and not to be prescriptive in an insulting way but to appreciate that human beings are creative beings and they will play around with language.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2012 because the original incorrectly said 'In Sheng, a person might greet another by saying \"Sasa now?\"'.</p>",
  "<p>Pensioner representatives have warned that people relying on the state pension for the bulk or all of their income could struggle to pay for food and energy in 2013 if the basic state pension rises as expected by just 2.5%, to \u00a3110 a week.</p> <p>The warnings follow publication of the consumer price index (CPI) inflation figure for September, one of the benchmarks in the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/18/benefits-inflation-what-government-proposals-mean\" title=\"\">\"triple lock\" guarantee</a> used to set the annual increase in the basic state pension.</p> <p>The guarantee, which means the state pension will rise in line with whichever is higher out of prices inflation, earnings or 2.5%, was introduced in 2010. Until now it has been set in line with the rate of CPI as measured every September: state pensions increased by 5.2% last April, the rate of CPI in September 2011.</p> <p>But last month the rate fell to 2.2%, so the benchmark used will be the 2.5% minimum level of increase, the highest out of the three triple lock benchmarks. The provisional earnings inflation figure released last month was 1.5%, and the revised rate is not expected to exceed the 2.5% triple lock minimum.</p> <p>The fall in the CPI reflects a sharp decline in gas and electricity price inflation, as increases introduced in September 2012 have now dropped out of the calculation. But Vince Smith-Hughes of the insurer Prudential said pensioners are likely to be hit by a fresh round of rising prices.</p> <p>Four energy providers, British Gas, NPower, Scottish Power and SSE, have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/15/scottish-power-raises-gas-electricity-prices\" title=\"\">all recently announced increases</a> in the cost of gas and electricity, ranging from 6% to 9.1%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/un-rising-food-costs-weather\" title=\"\">Food prices are also expected to soar</a> this autumn following a drought in the US and Russia, and cold wet weather in the UK. The United Nations has warned that the price of wheat has already risen 25% in 2012, and maize 13%, while dairy prices rose 7% just last month. It says that food reserves, held to provide a buffer against rising price, are at a critically low level.</p> <p>Smith-Hughes pointed out that the 2.5% increase would be less than half that received last year, and added: \"Pensioners typically spend a higher proportion of their income on fuel and other essentials and this can result in inflation typically costing pensioners around \u00a31,000 a year more than the rest of the population.\"</p> <p>Until the introduction of the triple lock, state pensions rose in line with the retail prices index, which has been consistently higher than the CPI and was 2.6% in September. The National Pensioners Convention said the switch from RPI to the triple lock guarantee meant pensioners would miss out on an additional \u00a35.20 a year, but that the effect would be greater for millions of older women who don't qualify for a full state pension.</p> <p>\"Their increase will be just \u00a31.60 a week. In addition, the state second pension and millions of public sector pensions won't even rise by the 2.5% \u2013 but by the CPI figure of 2.2%,\" the organisation said.</p> <p>Saga has calculated an inflation index based on the spending patterns of older people: this indicates that inflation has risen by 19.9% for those aged 50 to 64 since September 2007, 23.2% for those aged 65 to 74 and by 22.9% for those aged 75 and over. The retail prices index, which is higher than CPI, has risen by 17.4% for the whole population.</p> <p>Dot Gibson, NPC general secretary, said: \"While the difference might not sound very much to government ministers, we know that over 2 million pensioners are living in poverty, 3 million pensioner households are in fuel poverty and millions more are struggling to make ends meet. The change from the RPI to the CPI was a cynical move that almost overnight weakened virtually every single pension scheme in the country and its effect will be far reaching for years to come as people see their incomes fall by around 15% over just ten years.\"</p> <p>Most other benefits and tax credits, including unemployment benefit and disability living allowance, will be raised in line with the September CPI rate of 2.2% next April.</p>",
  "<p>With the polls reporting that Scots are currently two-to-one against breaking up their 300-year-old union with England, the part-time unionist papers in London are already taunting Alex Salmond that he is engaged in \"mission impossible\" in seeking to win <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/15/alex-salmond-scotland-referendum-deal\" title=\"\">the referendum he agreed with David Cameron</a>. Don't you believe it; that is foolish, complacent talk.</p> <p>No one can safely predict the outcome of the ballot the first minister plans to hold in the autumn of 2014 \u2013 around the time of the 700th anniversary of Scotland's famous (rare) military victory over the English at Bannockburn. In turbulent times like these too much can happen in the next two years to swing the result either way. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/scottish-independence-essential-guide\" title=\"\">Here's Severin Carrell's excellent guide</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cartoon/2012/oct/15/scotland-independence-referendum\" title=\"\">here's Steve Bell's view from the Green People's Republic of Brighton</a>.</p> <p>The governments in both London and Edinburgh can do things that make them deeply unpopular with voters. Or events outside their control can tilt the outcome either way. Consider the wider world, which \u2013 against the trend of decades \u2013 is getting more fractious and difficult to govern in so many ways that the go-it-alone appeal of small states is attractive to many, delusional to others.</p> <p>It's not just Scotland or even crisis-torn Europe. It didn't command many column inches in the London press or Scotland's own, but <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/14/uk-belgium-elections-idUKBRE89D0F720121014\" title=\"\">Flemish nationalists made sweeping gains</a> at the socialists' expense in local elections across northern Belgium on Monday with the New Flemish Alliance's Bart de Wever set to become mayor of Antwerp, a major European city. It ratchets up pressure for an independence referendum to separate them from the French-speaking south (cue for Flemish chatter about lazy Catholic welfare addicts).</p> <p>In warmer southern climes, the Guardian and other papers have been full of articles about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/13/catalonia-million-march\" title=\"\">Catalonia's renewed demands for an independence referendum</a> from Madrid \u2013 something the Spanish conservative government is refusing to concede, in sharp contrast to David Cameron's accommodation of the SNP demand in Monday's Edinburgh agreement.</p> <p>Barcelona fell to Spanish armies in 1714 \u2013 seven years after Scotland's parliament signed itself into the union \u2013 and the rivalry between Real Madrid and Bar\u00e7a is still reflected on the football field. But Catalonia is one of the richest parts of Spain (7.3 million people out of 47 million, against Scotland's 5.2 million out of 62 million) and its historical relations far more fraught \u2013 not least in the Spanish civil war of 1936-39 when it was a republican stronghold. Orwell's Homage to Catalonia is still a gripping read.</p> <p>Every case is different but let's not stop there. Among the world's more stable and mature societies, Canada is again threatened with a divisive battle over the independence hopes of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois\" title=\"\">Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois</a> now that the PQ \u2013 up and down over the decades \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/quebec-separatists-success-parti-quebecois\" title=\"\">has again won power in Montreal</a>. Pauline Marois is now provincial premier in francophone Quebec. Under economic pressure centrifugal forces vie with centripetal ones.</p> <p>Does Salmond follow these developments? You bet he does. So does Whitehall, which, so the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/scottish-independence-editorial\" title=\"\">Guardian's even-handed editorial</a> notes, has surprised Ottawa as well as Madrid by the ease with which it has exercised its reserved constitutional power to allow (not block) a Scottish referendum. It's a gamble for both sides.</p> <p>As noted everywhere, Salmond has also won over timing \u2013 a long runup \u2013 and over votes for 16 and 17-year-olds, though how this will be done is unclear, as Alan Trench writes on UCL's ever-authoritative Devolution Matters website at some length <a href=\"http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com\" title=\"\">here</a>. Cameron has won the battle to impose a binary question \u2013 yes or no \u2013 and to see that the neutral Electoral Commission supervises the detailed question (always important) and the referendum itself.</p> <p>Listening to Salmond and his deputy/successor Nicola Sturgeon at their press conference on Monday \u2013 Cameron thought it unwise to hold one too \u2013 I couldn't help but be struck by their emollient tone. That's only sensible. This vote will, as usual, be won by the undecideds who are neither passionate for the union nor for independence. Best to be civil and persuasive, best to ignore the uncouth heckling of Thatcherite hardliners like Lord Mickey Forsythe, a not-very-successful ex-Scottish secretary who accuses Cameron of being a Pontius Pilate. Politics is more subtle than that.</p> <p>But both Salmond and Cameron agreed that the deal was fair and that they would respect the result. The SNP claim to have won the battle for a \"Made in Scotland\" referendum \u2013 London had the power to block it \u2013 is important, because it makes it harder to cry foul if the polling results in 2012 are repeated in 2014. Alex Salmond says he is confident of victory, but he has to say that, just as his team has to say they will respect a no verdict, which we doubt, don't we?</p> <p>Yet Trench makes an important point when he says that by excluding the most popular option from the referendum ballot in the interests of a clear result the Edinburgh agreement makes Scottish voters the big losers. What option? English voters (more of whom would like to say goodbye than Scots would on some polling evidence) don't know much about \"devo-max'', the soft-independence option Salmond wanted included. But most Scots seem to favour more devolved powers, something London may concede after a no vote.</p> <p>It's possible in the unknown circumstances of 2014 that voters forced to say yes or no may decide that a yes is closer to their wish to see what Salmond \u2013 echoing the Irish debate of 100 years or so ago \u2013 is now calling home rule. The analogy is not perfect (no Ulster problem) but London's failure to grant it to Dublin in the 1880s and before the first world war led to the tragedy of 1916 and partition in 1921. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/15/uk-arms-northern-ireland-loyalist-massacre\" title=\"\">As Ian Cobain reports here</a>, the poison still drips.</p> <p>Though I'm a gut unionist I can see that life will go on if Scotland wants to go its own way, though it will consume unimaginable time, money and energy to unpick the union for uncertain outcomes. I'd say the effort would be better spent on improving the UK's economic and social performance as the unit it currently is. But sometimes the heart rules the head, which must be why Alex is so keen on giving votes to 16-year-olds. It does not suggest great confidence \u2013 and may well backfire.</p> <p>My problem in recent years has been the extent to which the SNP has chopped and changed on pretty important building blocks of the new state it hopes to create. In the 70s the message was a small modern state in a thriving new Europe, free of the anchor which was fuddy-duddy old England. That model doesn't look so clear-cut during the eurozone crisis when small peripheral states like Ireland are having more problems \u2013 and consequently less independence from EU control \u2013 than makes them comfortable.</p> <p>At least they are our own mistakes, say Irish patriots. It's a fair point. But Salmond now wants to keep the pound rather than embrace the euro, two states with one currency, not a fashionable formula. He wants to keep the Queen as head of state \u2013 much as James I and his heirs sat on two thrones from 1603-1707. It's a case of cheerfully making it up, adapting to changing times, which is what politicians are supposed to do. But it does make it all feel a bit rackety.</p> <p>Until recently Salmond also argued that both Scotland and Rump UK would have to reapply for EU membership \u2013 clearly not true, as Brussels has since made clear. Paris doesn't like the idea of breakaway states any more than other EU leaders do: 27 is quite enough of a headache without adding more, they feel. You can see their point of view too. Scottish business leaders, still unionist at heart most of them, want the uncertainty ended.</p> <p>But there has to be a proper debate and it has now been formally launched in a civil atmosphere, a good start. If I were Cameron or the \"Better Together\" campaign team \u2013 \"no camp\" sounds too negative \u2013 I'd be busy number-crunching the SNP's dramatic claim that an independent Scotland would be the sixth richest country in the world. It's a powerful claim. Let's find out how they did the sums.</p>",

Writing for <a href=\"http://moreintelligentlife.com/content/arts/american-exotic\" title=\"\">Intelligent Life</a>, he called the film \"a howl-at-the-heavens ode to being child king, feet planted in the mud and mess of America, head filled with myth and magic\". And he continued: \"Maybe that's the American genre now: magic realism. It used to be realism, at the movies as much as on the page, but the role of national chronicler has largely fallen to television these days.\"</p> <p>I've already had a few thoughts myself in this column <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/feb/07/whatever-happened-to-american-blockbusters\" title=\"\">about the decline of American realism at the movies</a>. But is Shone right? Could Southern Wild's thundering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs\" title=\"\">auroch</a> hooves, the echoes of cataclysm in the mind of its six-year-old heroine, Hushpuppy, be beating a new path forward for US cinema towards magical realism? Shone has even been bold enough to coin a name \u2013 American exotic \u2013 to parcel up Southern Wild with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/136977/winter-s-bone\" title=\"\">Winter's Bone</a>, and kindred films with a very topical interest in the country's hinterlands; \"a subtle but damning indictment, both of how broken-down America has gotten around its edges, but also of his just how foreign the country now seems, even to Americans,\" as he writes in <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/07/john_ford_s_westerns_hitchcock_s_north_by_northwest_woody_allen_s_upper_east_side_remember_when_american_movies_were_set_in_america_.html\" title=\"\">another piece for Slate</a>.</p> <p>That's not explicitly magical realism, though: the genre of fiction in which the fantastic shakes hands with the everyday. But setting Winter's Bone (which also has its roots in an older lineage of unruly backwoods forefathers such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76560/deliverance\" title=\"\">Deliverance</a>) aside, I think there have been signs in recent years that, surrounded by difficulties at home and abroad, America has turned from doing to thinking, and that its imagination is growing heavy to the point of overflowing; the emergence of a film like Southern Wild was only a matter of time.</p> <p>Generation X always had a fondness for surreal diversions and episodes of gentle, self-imposed exile from reality. And this spirit of pothead poesie \u2013 not too far from magical realism \u2013 has been breaking through with ever-greater frequency as Gen-Xers continue their directorial careers and get closer to the mainstream. To name a few examples: the quarry episode in Zach Braff's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/104215/garden.state\" title=\"\">Garden State</a>; the feeling in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/136970/monsters\" title=\"\">Monsters</a> that the whole alien invasion was just a convenient backdrop of ephemeral wonder \u2013 like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96936/lost.in.translation\" title=\"\">Lost in Translation</a>'s Tokyo \u2013 for its irritating lovers to conduct their Converse-sneakered romance; the quirky detours that are inevitably en route on any movie crush involving what has been christened the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl\" title=\"\">Manic Pixie Dream Girl</a>.</p> <p>Apr\u00e8s Zooey Deschanel, the deluge. The growth in the American imagination seems to be in inverse proportion to the country's inability to shape the world any longer, and fend off the overweening threats it's always been so good at conjuring up for itself. Keira Knightley and Steve Carell made it excruciatingly clear in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148376/seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-of-the-world\" title=\"\">Seeking a Friend for the End of the World</a> that this ethic of flaky whimsy was now the only right-thinking way of dealing with apocalypse, and closer to mainstream thinking than ever. And what greater sign do you need that end times are nigh, and the natural order of things has been overturned, than the fact that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/terrence-malick\" title=\"\">Terrence Malick</a>, whose voice-in-my-own-head narration and impressionistic style always situated him on the cusp of magical realism, has started pumping out almost a film a year? The patron saint of subjective experience has returned, and the imagination is ready to run riot.</p> <p>Beasts of the Southern Wild could be where these forces stampede into a full-blown magical realist movement: the film has had a lively critical whirling, and stands as good a chance of being an aesthetic game-changer as any. But there are no guarantees, either. Southern Wild can be read as some kind of response to a national mood of marginalisation and crisis \u2013 but if that's true it might equally result in an outbreak of films that refuse to let themselves be swept off towards unknown destinations, and instead try and shore up the fortifications of old, outdated tales: cue a multiplex full of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131950/expendables\" title=\"\">Expendables</a> clones.</p> <p>What's interesting about the possibility of magical realism flowering in North America is how much this species may differ from the original South American variety. South American magical realism also occupied the fringes, the marginal zones where the individual mind, not the consensus of the real, could rule. But in Latin American fiction, this often took place in a joyful, florid explosion of inner identity; from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/gabrielgarciamarquez\" title=\"\">Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_Water_for_Chocolate\" title=\"\">Like Water for Chocolate</a>, indigenous fables and aromas burst through from a pre-colonial past through the hard paving of the Europeanised present.</p> <p>Beasts of the Southern Wild hollers exuberantly, but there's something frenzied about it as well. It's an intoxicated wake, as well as a celebration. American magical realism, if it comes to pass, could mean a retreat into the imagination, rather than a reunion with an inner self. America's golden-age protagonists \u2013 its chatty hacks, taciturn PIs and secretive dames, eyes always ahead \u2013 never had much time for the inner self. Hushpuppy, drunk on dreams of ancient creatures and impending floods as she searches for her lost mother, certainly has one, but it threatens to wash away the whole of reality in the film.</p> <p>Maybe the apocalypse is actually in Hushpuppy's head, the fever dreams of the dispossessed; maybe that's the real lesson magical realism has to offer America. The danger might have been building on the inside all along \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/homeland\" title=\"\">Homeland's premise</a>.

This list of uses will only keep growing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/Assets/Docs/Reports/3D%20printing%20paper_FINAL_15%20Oct.pdf\" title=\"\">New research by the Big Innovation Centre</a> explores some of the implications of 3D printing. For a start, it allows each product to be customised, getting you closer to exactly what you want than mass-production allows. More importantly, it enables things to be produced where they are needed, rather than assembled in a single factory and shipped around the world.</p> <p>That could be very good news for the UK economy. It poses a welcome challenge to low-cost manufacturing imports, allowing UK businesses to print bespoke objects rather than make them overseas. It will put a big emphasis on design and online retail, something the UK happens to be very good at. If it takes off, 3D printing could lead to a great many manufacturing jobs being \"re-shored\" to the UK.</p> <p>All of this sounds fantastic, but these changes aren't going to happen overnight. 3D printing will throw up some serious issues for the UK's legal system, and government needs to act quickly to avoid strangling this industry at birth.</p> <p>What are the issues? First, 3D printing poses several challenges to our intellectual property system. If you are \u2013 say \u2013 printing a smartphone, you will need to use designs from a wide range of different companies, from the microchip to the battery. The current legal system means you would need to engage in costly rights negotiations with a variety of other businesses each time you wanted to produce an object. That is unworkable in a world of 3D printing.</p> <p>Second, there are pressing questions around regulation. If something goes wrong with your bespoke 3D-printed cycle helmet, who should be at fault? The original designer? The business that printed the helmet? Or the supplier of materials? And how do we stop individuals from buying their own 3D printers to produce guns or other illegal objects? These are questions that policymakers need to address as soon as possible, to reassure both consumers and businesses about their legal rights and responsibilities.</p> <p>Third, new infrastructure, vastly different to the ships and lorries that dominate today's manufacturing industry, will be required. The challenges include sourcing more sustainable materials for use in 3D printers, ensuring our planning system does not prevent 3D printing \"factories\" being located on high streets, and providing the world-class digital infrastructure to connect suppliers and users of digital designs. The government will have a big role to play in meeting all of these.</p> <p>Of course, there is no guarantee it will take off in a big way, even with the right support from government. Revolutionary technologies are by their nature uncertain, and trying to predict exactly how they will evolve is near impossible.</p> <p>But none of this should distract from the government's role. 3D printing exists and, without an appropriate policy framework, we run the risks of repeating mistakes in dealing with online copyright and file-sharing that are only just now being addressed a decade on. 3D printing faces similar challenges, but the stakes, potentially a significant proportion of the global manufacturing industry, are much higher. We need the state to be proactive in confronting the challenges and opportunities. Anything else risks missing out on some much needed growth.</p>",
  "<p>In northern Ghana, young people are no longer simply divided between those who have and those who have not attended school. Now there is a third category \u2013 \"education widows\", a term that captures growing recognition that even those with an education are not always better off.</p> <p>\"Education widows have been failed by the education system,\" says Dolores Dickson, executive director of girls' education organisation <a href=\"https://camfed.org/where-we-work/ghana/\" title=\"\">Camfed</a> in Ghana. \"These are young people who have been to school, but the quality of their education was so poor, they can't get a job. The family has invested in their education and they are expected to go out and earn an income. So they can't go home, they can't go to the farm, but they can't get a job either.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/16/mdg-education-missed-fears-aid\" title=\"\">Like many low- and lower-middle income countries</a>, Ghana is coming to terms with the increasing complexity of its education problem. The <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/\" title=\"\">Unesco report, Putting education to work</a>, launched on Tuesday, found that more than half of women and more than one-third of men in Ghana aged 15 to 29 who had completed six years of school could not read a single sentence.</p> <p>Camfed \u2013 which has provided funding for more than 66,000 children to attend primary and secondary school in Ghana since 1998 \u2013 believes it has found a way to supplement the poor quality education on offer in state-run schools. In 2002 it created a Ghana \"Cama network\" of Camfed alumni, which brings together young women who have graduated with its support.</p> <p>Cama members are able to access skills training on financial literacy, business, leadership and life skills through the network's twice-monthly meetings. And since last year, those who complete training are eligible for \"innovation bursaries\" \u2013 a Camfed/Mastercard Foundation collaboration that offers small grants to female entrepreneurs to kickstart their businesses, together with work experience in relevant industries. Since the first nine bursaries were awarded in Ghana last September, six women have launched businesses, and all are turning a profit, says Camfed.</p> <p>In Fuo, a rural suburb of Tamale, the capital of Ghana's northern region and one of the poorest parts of the country, 31-year-old Balchesu Iddrisu has turned her husband's family compound into a small food processing hub. Outside are mounds of rice, which she has employed a local elderly woman to sift, removing stones.</p> <p>A room inside the building contains piles of wheat, soya and maize, which Iddrisu blends with milk creamer and groundnuts to make her own recipe for \"weenie mix\" \u2013 breakfast porridge. Iddrisu sells more than 1,200 units of weenie mix a month \u2013 at about \u00a31 a bag \u2013 and she has begun approaching large supermarket&#xa0;chains and hospitals to buy in bulk. By buying her ingredients directly from local farmers, she says she has cut out middle men and is able to influence the quality of producers' crops.</p> <p>\"I am very happy with the way my business is going,\" Iddrisu says. \"It helps me and my family a lot. I didn't even know I could reach this level, with people working under me and creating jobs in my community. In 10 years' time I believe that I will have my own factory, and I will be training many people to become entrepreneurs.\"</p> <p>In Tamale, Cama member Sohua Alhassan, 31, says school alone did not give her the skills she needed to start a business selling a range of solar energy products. Alhassan, who grew up in a poor home with parents who were subsistence farmers, says she was inspired to set up her business by the lack of access to electricity in the region and the danger posed by traditional kerosene lamps, known as \"wanbongasi\".</p> <p>\"I went into solar because in northern regions most of the houses don't have access to electricity. In the villages, children can't study, or they use wanbongasi which are hazardous \u2013 they produce smoke and dim light which creates a lot of eye problems for young people.\" Alhassan is living off the profits she makes from selling the lamps \u2013 around \u00a33 from a small desk lamp, and around \u00a317 from a \"powerpack\" \u2013 a four-bulb home lighting system.</p> <p>But her personal story speaks volumes about the challenges of starting small businesses in northern Ghana. The youngest of six children, with both her parents now deceased, Alhassan is the only one of her siblings to attend school, thanks to a Camfed bursary. She is married, and has no children of her own, but one of her brothers, who has two wives and 10 children, is sick and now relies on her to help support his family. Alhassan has adopted one of his daughters, and is sending her to school.</p> <p>The pressure on Cama graduates to support their extended families makes it difficult for them to reinvest profits in their businesses. In spite of her obvious enthusiasm for her new business, Alhassan breaks down when speaking of her brother's illness and the burden of caring for his large family. \"It is very hard for me,\" she says.</p> <p>\"It's not an easy burden to be the only person that is educated in your family,\" says Dickson. \"They also feel that if they don't help their family members, they will be in the same situation they have just escaped. But the other side of the coin is that they grasp their opportunity to have an education themselves with both hands. The moment they get into school and see what they can become, we see them gaining confidence and becoming more articulate about what they want in life.\"</p>",
  "<p>An Ecuadorean shaman and his British wife will embark this week on a house-to-house campaign in their Amazonian village to dissuade locals from granting exploration rights to an oil company in an area of pristine forest close to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2012/sep/03/yasuni-national-park-gift-humanity-video\" title=\"\">Yasuni national park</a>.</p> <p>Patricio Jipa and Mari Muench hope to thwart the advances of <a href=\"http://www.bloque15.com/en/\" title=\"\">PetroAmazonas</a>, which has promised villagers from the Kichwa indigenous group that they will get cash, new schools, a new eco-lodge, better healthcare and university education for their children if they accept plans for a seismic survey.</p> <p>Muench, a businesswoman from London, said they have until a village meeting on 27 October to win over a majority of the 422-member community on Sani Isla, which has land usage rights over an area of 70,000 hectares in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/03/ecuador-yasuni-conservation\" title=\"\">one of the most biodiverse areas in the world</a>.</p> <p>Scientists say a single hectare in this region contains a wider variety of life than all of North America. But it is under a growing threat from loggers and energy firms.</p> <p>Oil companies have promised to minimise the environmental impact of exploration and extraction, but the paths they cut and the roads they build tend to lead to immigration and destruction of the the forest for agriculture. Freshwater ecosystems have also been polluted by the traffic along the Napo River and creeks that lead into this tributary of the Amazon.</p> <p>The villagers are part of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/03/uncontacted-tribes-wildlife\" title=\"\">Kichwa indigenous group</a>, which has moved from hunting with blowpipes to promoting eco-tourism within two generations.</p> <p>The villagers have tried to lift their incomes by jointly investing in an <a href=\"http://www.sanilodge.co.uk/\" title=\"\">eco-lodge</a> but it has failed to break even in recent years, prompting a growing number of residents to look more favourably on the offer from the oil firms.</p> <p>Patricio said they face a heart-wrenching decision.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-395500309\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/31/120831Yasumipark-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/8/31/120831Yasumipark_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120831Yasumipark/120831Yasumipark.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/31/120831Yasumipark_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/8/31/120831Yasumipark-720.mp4\"/> </video>   <p>\"The oil companies have made great in-roads this time. They have found our people at an all-time low emotionally and financially, and have seized their chance. How can we help the community give up such wonderful opportunities? They are offering what we need and want, but the cost is immeasurable for us and the rest of the world. We are isolated and fighting alone.\"</p> <p>He is appealing for expertise, financial help and media coverage to protect the forest from the developers.</p> <p>With huge financial opportunities for developers interested in extracting the area's resources, the stakes are high. Several years ago, Patricio was told that someone had been paid to kill him. As the most prominent opponents of potentially lucrative oil development in this extensive tract of land, the couple continue to face risks.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jun/19/environment-activist-deaths\" title=\"\">The NGO Global Witness has reported a growing trend of killings of environmental activists</a>, particularly in the Amazon, where laws are poorly enforced.</p> <p>The couple do not consider themselves activists, but they are at the frontline of efforts to leave the forest intact, having loaned the villagers money to keep the eco-lodge afloat and now campaigning against the oil exploration.</p> <p>Muench \u2013 who married Patricio two years ago in a ceremony where she wore a head dress and an outfit made from tree bark \u2013 said the couple would take their 14-month-old child with them on their backs when they walk or canoe between homes that can be several kilometres apart and only accessible through forest paths or along creeks.</p> <p>\"It is frightening. I have been laying in bed wondering what we should do,\" she said. \"But how can I look my daughter in the eye when she is older and tell her we were too afraid to fight for her and her land?\"</p> <p>Their situation mirrors what is happening to the wider resource-rich Yasuni region where the government has carved up much of the land into oil-exploration blocks. One area of about 200,000 hectares has been targeted for protection under <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/03/ecuador-yasuni-conservation\" title=\"\">a plan called the ITT Initiative</a>, which the government has promised to leave intact if the international community provides compensation worth at least half of the $7.2bn oil reserves believed to lie beneath the surface.</p> <p>Conserving the Sani Isla region is potentially cheaper but politically more difficult. Maintaining an eco-lodge and ensuring the community of 422 indigenous people have a decent school, jobs and university opportunities for their children would cost a fraction of the money sought by the ITT Initiative. They have fought off oil company advances and promises for many years, but without government support, it is hard to imagine the community will be able to resist the oil companies indefinitely.</p>",
  "<h2>The winners</h2> <p>It's the weekend after the release of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149515/taken-2\" title=\"\">Taken 2</a>, it's a fortnight until the arrival of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144416/skyfall\" title=\"\">Skyfall</a>, and the October half-term holiday is on its way: perfect conditions, in other words, to create a lull in the release calendar for films targeting adult audiences. With nothing too commercially appealing coming against it, Taken 2 posted a decent hold, and has now achieved a gross of \u00a314.5m after just 11 days of release. Only five films so far this year had taken more after two weekends of play: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (\u00a330.55m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">Avengers Assemble</a> (\u00a329.85m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot\" title=\"\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> (\u00a318.85m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a> (\u00a317.21m) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> (\u00a315.47m). <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> was released in a staggered fashion, and after two weekends of full national release had reached \u00a317.66m. The original <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125815/taken\" title=\"\">Taken</a> movie grossed \u00a36.39m over its entire run in 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/09/uk-box-office-taken-2\" title=\"\">Taken 2 is clearly headed for a total at least triple that sum</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/15/argo-taken-2-box-office\" title=\"\">In the US</a>, the sequel has grossed $86m (\u00a353m) so far. Based on that figure, going by rule of thumb, you'd expect a UK total in the \u00a38-9m range, so it's clearly overperforming in this country.</p> <p>Likewise benefiting from a lack of fresh competition, horror film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149042/sinister\" title=\"\">Sinister</a> has posted a sensational hold, with a drop of just 12% from the previous weekend. After 10 days, the Ethan Hawke movie has grossed \u00a33.70m, following a very similar trajectory to 2011's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141338/insidious\" title=\"\">Insidious</a>, from the same distributor and producer, which opened on exactly the same number (\u00a31.44m) and then fell just 9% for a 10-day cume of \u00a33.87m.</p> <h2>The family battle</h2> <p>Although not officially released until this Friday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147830/madagascar-3\" title=\"\">Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted</a> enjoyed extensive previews on Saturday and Sunday, and was the top family film in the market. These takings, rumoured to be around \u00a32m, will be added in to the film's official tally next weekend. Despite this competition from the DreamWorks Animation hit, Sony's own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149648/hotel-transylvania\" title=\"\">Hotel Transylvania</a> debuted with a decent \u00a31.73m. Tim Burton's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149787/frankenweenie\" title=\"\">Frankenweenie</a> played at 24 Imax cinemas only, ahead of its full national release on Wednesday. The arrival of all these animated features saw Universal/Laika's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148980/paranorman\" title=\"\">ParaNorman</a> plunge by 73%, the biggest drop among films in the top 10.</p> <h2>The disappointments</h2> <p>There's been talk of an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142861/on-the-road\" title=\"\">On the Road</a> movie ever since its 1957 publication; Francis Ford Coppola optioned the film rights in 1979, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/walter-salles\" title=\"\">Walter Salles</a> has been on board to direct since 2004. Anticipation has been high since production began in August 2010, and the film received a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/may/23/on-the-road-review\" title=\"\">high-profile world premiere in Cannes</a> in May earlier this year, with cast members Garrett Hedlund, Sam Riley, Kristen Stewart, Kirsten Dunst, Viggo Mortensen, Tom Sturridge and Danny Morgan in attendance. For all these reasons, On the Road's debut of \u00a3219,000 from 100 sites, including \u00a346,300 in previews, seems fairly lacklustre. And considering the film took a whopping \u00a313,361 from London's Curzon Soho over the three-day weekend, compared to a site average of \u00a31,724 over the same period, it's clear that it enjoyed very mixed fortunes across the country.</p> <p>Still, On the Road is a poster child for box-office achievement next to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149509/ruby-sparks\" title=\"\">Ruby Sparks</a>, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/114024/little.miss.sunshine\" title=\"\">Little Miss Sunshine</a> directors <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/27/perfect-couple-for-ruby-sparks\" title=\"\">Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris</a>. With just \u00a3299,000 from 308 sites, including \u00a311,800 in previews \u2013 delivering a per-theatre average of just \u00a3972 \u2013 this is another case of a film being released unsustainably wide. Little Miss Sunshine was released in September 2006 on just 114 screens (grossing \u00a3350,000), and expanded steadily over the next couple of weeks to 173 venues. After five weeks in the top 10, the sleeper hit had grossed a decent \u00a32.57m.</p> <p>Landing in disappointing 17th place, the English-language remake of Nicolas Winding Refn's Danish thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147989/pusher\" title=\"\">Pusher</a> grossed a feeble \u00a349,300 from 122 sites, including \u00a315,100 in previews. Even if you generously add the preview takings in, that's a site average of just \u00a3404. Similarly undistinguished is Dax Shepard's road comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/92010/hit-and-run\" title=\"\">Hit &amp; Run</a>, with \u00a328,900 from 54 screens, and a \u00a3535 average. Both titles will struggle to hold on to their play dates this coming weekend, and will hope for better when they arrive on their natural home, DVD.</p> <h2>The live event</h2> <p>Not included in the official reporting, but rumoured to have grossed at least \u00a3170,000, is the satellite relay of the <a href=\"http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/liveinhd/LiveinHD.aspx\" title=\"\">New York Met Opera's production of Donizetti's L'Elisir D'Amore</a>. Kicking off the seventh season of The Met: Live in HD, the result once again confirms that audiences nationwide are willing to pay premium prices for this kind of high-end content in cinemas. The lunchtime slot in New York works perfectly for evening UK presentation, with the five-hour time difference. Verdi's Otello is next, on 27 October.</p> <p>The event created a competitive environment for all arthouse films on Saturday, but German drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149279/barbara\" title=\"\">Barbara</a> once again posted a solid hold, down just 8%, and the film will expand into new screens from Friday.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Thanks to those \u00a32m in Madagascar 3 previews not being included in official tallies, overall the market is 8% down on the equivalent weekend from 2011, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141426/johnny-english-reborn\" title=\"\">Johnny English Reborn</a> held on at the top spot and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143595/three-musketeers\" title=\"\">The Three Musketeers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143302/real-steel\" title=\"\">Real Steel</a> were the top new releases. Had the Madagascar 3 previews been reported, the market would in fact be up on 2011 for the weekend. Although most schools don't break up for half-term until 26 October, cinemas are gearing into action, with Frankenweenie's expansion on Wednesday, and the official release of Madagascar 3 on Friday. Adults and teens will also have the option of Paranormal Activity 4, which arrives Wednesday and should then enjoy a good run through to Halloween.

<p>\u2022 This post by Aditya Chakrabortty analysing the graph that shows how far <strong>David Cameron </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/graph-cameron-wants-shrink-state\" title=\"\">wants to shrink the state</a>. Drawing on new IMF figures, the graph compares what will happen to government spending in Britain up to 2017 with predictions for Germany and the US. Chakrabortty explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fan or critic, nearly everyone now agrees that this government wants to shrink the state, but very few take on board what that means. This graph shows just how radical those ministerial plans are. Particularly striking is the fact that Britain will end up spending less as a proportion of its national income than even the US, the international byword for a decrepit public sector. According to Peter Taylor-Gooby, professor of social policy at Kent, this will be the first time it has happened since at least 1980 and possibly in recorded history. For it to take place within half a decade is a shift so dramatic that few people in frontline politics, let alone among the electorate, have understood its implications.<br>Forget all that ministerial guff about the necessity of cutting the public sector to spur economic growth. Had that argument been true, British businesses would be in leonine form by now, instead of their current chronic enfeeblement. It was notable at last week's Tory party conference how Osborne and David Cameron didn't even try to argue for the economic benefits of austerity \u2013 how could they? \u2013 but grimly asserted that there was no alternative.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>And he concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From compassionate Conservative to growth rainmaker to state-shrinker, Cameron has gone through a huge change since 2005. But that is nothing like what lies ahead for the rest of Britain in the next five years. Prepare yourself for welfare to be downsized into American-style workfare, for public-sector jobs to be turned into a second-class employment and for services, from school to healthcare, to demand that users pay more to get something decent. The future is American.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A new report from the Voluntary Organisations Disability Group (VODG) on what the care sector can learn in the wake of the <strong>Winterbourne View</strong> scandal. <a href=\"http://www.vodg.org.uk/news/203/111/New-report-shows-that-after-Winterbourne-advocacy-is-a-voice-for-our-future.html\" title=\"\">VODG's report</a> calls for more advocacy, which it says will lead to better safeguarding, greater personalisation and improved support planning. The group is also hosting a conference today on the lessons from the Winterbourne reviews, see the Twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23winterbournelessons&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">#winterbournelessons</a>. On the VODG blog, general secretary John Adams says <a href=\"http://www.vodg.org.uk/cgblog/64/105/After-Winterbourne-advocacy-is-a-voice-for-our-future.html\" title=\"\">advocacy is a voice for our future</a>. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Advocacy is a tried and tested method of support that allows everyone a say in how they live their lives. We hope the best practice in adult advocacy that the report showcases will explain what independent advocacy looks like, how accessible it is, how it can be applied and how it boosts the quality of life, rights and safeguarding of vulnerable people. We want advocacy to be more widely recognised for its role in helping to achieve good quality care and support as well as helping to make the best use of increasingly limited public funding.<br>Effective advocacy is absolutely critical to disabled peoples' citizenship; many vulnerable people and their families still live on the margins of society without a voice. This is truer than ever in today's tough economic climate and with radical welfare reforms underway. Advocacy can make the difference between people merely existing from day-to-day, or living fulfilled lives.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Coincidentally, Panorama is due to run <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2012/44/panorama_winterbourne_view.html\" title=\"\">a follow-up programme on Winterbourne View</a> later this month</p> <p>\u2022 A new report by <strong>Action for Children </strong>on the impact of the recession and government spending decisions on the children it supports. The <a href=\"http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/news/archive/2012/october/new-report-flawed-support-for-most-vulnerable-children-creating-time-bomb-for-society\" title=\"\">Red Book 2012</a> finds two-thirds of the most vulnerable families are struggling with more severe issues than a year ago - yet by April this year, just 12% of the planned public spending cuts had taken place. The charity's chief executive, Dame Clare Tickell, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Red Book 2012 highlights problems that, while new to individual children and families, have persisted for decades. We are sitting on a ticking time bomb that has the potential for both human and financial repercussions. <br>We welcome the coalition government's commitment to early intervention but the current system of short-term, quick-fix funding is simply exacerbating existing need and instability, creating a false economy that could cost society more than \u00a31.3 billion a year.<br>As changes to welfare, unemployment and the recession look set to continue, we desperately need a shift from short-term thinking to long-term strategies that put children first and short-term politics second.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>On the Community Links blog, Will Horwitz has also <a href=\"http://www.community-links.org/linksuk/?p=3598&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Linksuk+%28linksUK%29\" title=\"\">picked up on the report</a>. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The report expresses particular concern over a gradual erosion of these preventative services, as increasingly scarce resources are concentrated on those in greatest need, running the ambulances at the bottom of the cliff while the fences at the top gradually disintegrate.<br>The report points the finger at statutory duties which force local authorities to fund acute services; with no counterweight meagre resources inevitably cluster around the most serious situations.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong>Police and crime commissioners</strong>. On the Institute for Government blog, Tom Gash asks <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/4954/police-and-crime-commissioners-teething-problems/?source=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Publicsectorblogs+%28PublicSectorBlogs%29\" title=\"\">how many voters will turn out for next month's elections</a> and whether candidates will be prepared for office. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... many observers remain concerned about the profile, diversity and quality of candidates \u2013 perhaps unsurprising given the slowness of party leaders to call for the best and brightest, and the reluctance of the parties to look beyond the usual suspects identified by traditional party selection processes. In hindsight, the decision to bar those with even childhood misdemeanours from standing also looks like it has unnecessarily shrunk the pool of candidates.<br>The promised glut of non-party-political commissioners is also unlikely to materialize. Many independents have already been deterred by the expense of running campaigns without any government funding, and those who remain seem likely to lose out against party machines far better equipped to engage voters across what is are exceptionally large geographical areas.<br>Low turnout can throw up surprising results \u2013 and some independents may win through. But the risk is clearly that too many areas end up with both low turnout and low calibre PCCs.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>(thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davebriggs\" title=\"\">Dave Briggs</a> for the link)</p> <p>\u2022 An interesting event being hosted by the <strong>Government Communications Network</strong> today, which asks <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/4471863464\" title=\"\">Britain 2012: Who Do We Think We Are?</a> The network says the feelgood Olympic summer offers \"some good opportunities for policy-makers and communicators\".

  "<h2>Location</h2> <p>Appropriately for a cinema that trades on its heritage, the Astor Theatre sits on the corner of Dandenong Road and Chapel Street in St Kilda, on the last of Melbourne's tram routes to still employ the city's green \"rattler\" trams.</p> <h2><strong>The building</strong></h2> <p>A single-screen cinema with a two-tiered auditorium, the Astor has been left relatively untouched since it opened in 1936, and has never been anything other than a cinema since that time.</p> <p>Externally, the Astor isn't much to look at. Though it is one of Melbourne's art deco buildings, it is also a solid brick structure with few obvious aesthetic qualities. Inside, however, is another matter. It's like walking on to the set of a Poirot episode: an expansive curved foyer with a terrazzo floor is overlooked by a huge oval-shaped balcony cut into the ceiling. The balcony and the seats in the circle (the stalls are only used for the most popular events) are accessed by a wide staircase that wouldn't have looked out of place on the Lusitania.</p> <p>Tickets are sold out of a small, glassed booth, liberally decorated with film posters. Dotted throughout the foyer and first floor are antique projection equipment and radios, cinematic memorabilia and comfy sofas, giving the place an almost museum-like quality.</p> <p>The cinema was one of the last to be built in Australia with stalls and a dress circle both, though only the upstairs circle is usually used now. The cinema itself is vast, with the circle positioned high above the stalls. Upon taking your seat, you realise that unlike most modern cinemas, you actually look down on to the screen rather than up. This can feel a bit unusual at first, although that passes once the film gets underway.</p> <h2><strong>The clientele</strong></h2> <p>Regardless of the film that is showing, there will always be hipsters chaining up their single-speed bikes outside, but the audience is not restricted to those in skinny jeans. Elderly couples reliving their younger days with a night in the cinema's evocative surroundings, fanboys wanting to see one of their favourites back on the big screen, couples on dates, families, children's parties (when an appropriate film is screening) \u2013 the Astor attracts all sorts.</p> <h2><strong>The programme</strong></h2> <p>The Astor publishes a popular quarterly calendar in poster form, listing all films scheduled for the next four months. These can be picked up from most nearby cafes and shops, as well as from the cinema itself, and find their way on to the walls and doors of many local residences.</p> <p>Each calendar reveals the same style of programming for each quarter: a mix of new and old, some classics and some not-so classics. Popular draws are the double bills \u2013 usually, two films that would appeal to a similar audience, one of which may be a current release not long out of the multiplexes, providing great value for money. Other films are scattered throughout the schedule: B-movie nights (often with commentary by a couple of local film-loving comedians); retrospectives of individual directors running on the same day of concurrent weeks; genre-specific themed nights; special events such as marathon screenings of trilogies, or singalong nights for musicals; weeklong nightly screenings of a restored classic; and the occasional special guest appearance \u2013 one of the original Von Trapps introduced The Sound of Music, while George Lazenby came by to present On Her Majesty's Secret Service.</p> <h2><strong>Further comments</strong></h2> <p>In a city probably better served than most by independent cinemas, the Astor is regarded as a treasured heirloom, and not just for its film selection and architecture. The price of admission is reasonable, which is a big deal in a country with incredibly expensive cinema tickets. No other cinema I know of has a resident cat: Marzipan, who patrols the theatre while the films are on, terrifying anyone who catches sight of her out of the corner of an eye while watching a horror. She also usually finds a perch on one of the many foyer sofas during the interval so as to maximise the amount of attention she gets. </p> <p>Alongside the usual cinematic fare, the concession stand also sells homemade cakes, adding to the quaint vibe and appeal in a way that a multiplex couldn't hope to emulate. And while most (if not all) Australian cinemas sell choc-tops, the peculiar antipodean chocolate-covered ice-cream cone that is possibly the least practical thing to eat in a darkened cinema, the Astor staff make their own version, usually while the films are screening \u2013 and you can taste the results.</p> <p>The Astor recently faced threat of closure as the building's then owners, a nearby private school, did not agree to extend the lease beyond 2015. It was suggested that the school wished to use the cinema solely for their own productions and the lobby as a uniform shop. This was met with a great deal of local resistance, and support for the Astor in the media and from the public was manifold. Happily, the Astor was saved when a local cinema-loving businessman's bid to buy the property was accepted by the school. The new owner and the cinema's management have arranged for the Astor to continue in its present form, preserving for future generations this wonderful place to watch a film.</p>",
  "<p>Our diversity programme has, over the past two years, had a particular focus on increasing the diversity of our UK audience, but more concentration is now going into improving diversity and inclusion within GNM itself.</p> <p>One of the objectives of our diversity and inclusions strategy is to increase the diverse applicant pool for all new job vacancies by 10% during the current financial year. </p> <p>A training programme on \"unconscious bias\" is being developed to assist managers interviewing for roles within GNM.</p> <p>This is in response to the fact that the percentage of staff from diverse backgrounds has levelled off due, partly, to the numbers of staff, minority and mainstream, leaving the organisation as part of overall structural changes.</p> <p>There was a marginal improvement around ethnicity to 9.6% in the last financial year, which is below the national average of 12%. However, our recruitment rate for members of ethnic groups improved to 15% between January 2011 and January 2012. </p> <p>GNM's head of diversity and inclusion, Yasir Mirza, has also been working to support the development of programmes in the commercial parts of the business.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://careers.theguardian.com/diversity\">diversity content hub</a> has been created on the Guardian's business-to-business careers network that generates debate on a host of issues ranging from the challenges faced by minority ethnic and disabled graduates, to the problems faced by women when they return to work after having children.</p> <p>Also, a marketing campaign has been created to target Asian \"progressives\" in an attempt to attract new readership from diverse backgrounds. This will be pegged to the film season in September 2012.</p> <p>Mirza continues to work with senior editors on two interconnecting programmes to stimulate new readership from diverse sections of society in an attempt to increase our market share in this area.</p> <p>The strategy is to help ensure that people from all minority backgrounds, covering the strands of ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual orientation, age, religion and belief, feel affiliated to the Guardian and Observer, and that they become their papers \u2013 and website \u2013 of choice.</p> <p>The overall aim is to ensure our editorial coverage of these groups is more inclusive and representative and moves away from stereotypes and labelling. The initiatives also aim to increase the breadth and depth of minority voices within our papers and online.</p> <p>Journalism can be a powerful tool in creating dialogue, understanding and cohesion, while promoting pluralism. If we open up our platform to draw in often unheard, marginalised voices, then this presents the opportunity to enrich our coverage, and fulfils our commitment to social justice and open journalism, which is underpinned by the Scott Trust values.</p> <p>These initiatives aim to broaden our feature coverage, and to inform our commissioning editors of stories that we are not yet telling. For this reason, the editorial diversity initiatives have focused on the G2, features, culture, comment, Weekend, Society and sport sections.</p> <p>The programmes are:</p> <h2>Minority writers' workshops</h2> <p>These workshops are designed to bring diverse voices into our freelance contributor base. We have run advertisements across the paper, website and a wide range of minority press outlets asking people from diverse backgrounds to send in story ideas to the G2, culture, comment, sport, Weekend and Society sections. We want to make this process as inclusive as possible, yet attract serious writers or those aspiring to be.</p> <p>We ran three minority writers' workshops in the last financial year. These are designed to inject diverse voices into our freelance contributor base. Advertisements are run across our paper, website, and a wide range of minority press asking people from diverse backgrounds to send in three pitches.</p> <p>The workshops resulted in 32 commissions in G2, culture, comment, CiF, news, and Society, with many writers being commissioned to write more than once piece. This is only marginally less than the 35 commissions in the previous year.</p> <h2>Diversity ambassador programme</h2> <p>The Guardian launched this programme two years ago, partnering with 70 minority voluntary and charity organisations that have reach and leverage with minority communities. We created a relationship, whereby these organisations advocate on our behalf as an employer and paper of choice, consult on our inclusion of the groups in our coverage, and create a new channel for new stories by drawing in marginalised voices.</p> <p>In May 2012, the members of the ambassador programme took part in a series of focus groups with the&#xa0;editorial comment desk&#xa0;on how we can better commission articles on race and Islam, as well as encouraging more responses in the comments section below articles.</p> <p>The participants explored, with our editors, ways of tackling the large number of Islamaphobic and racist comments under particular&#xa0;comment articles, and how best to encourage their diverse networks to contribute to our comment threads. </p> <h2>Inclusive culture</h2> <p>A series of internal events in the fields of food, art, music and theatre were held during the last financial year with the aim of creating a more inclusive, interactive, fun and learning environment for staff during lunchtimes. The learning points from this initiative have been merged into our current \"employer branding\" project and employee engagement work. </p> <p>A \"buddy\" scheme is also in the process of being developed as a result of this inclusion agenda.</p> <p>Eight culture season events took place.

  "<p>There were two celebrations this week on consecutive days, one which dominated media headlines and the other which was largely ignored.</p> <p>On Sunday Felix Baumgartner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/video/2012/oct/14/felix-baumgartner-skydive-space-video?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">plummeted 24 miles</a> in a rapid descent to Earth from the edge of space, and the day after saw the fifth anniversary of <a href=\"http://globalhandwashing.org/ghw-day\" title=\"\">Global Handwashing Day</a>.</p> <p>While Baumgartner's daredevil exploit will live on only in the record books, 600,000 people continue to die a year from infectious diseases that could, in part, be prevented by the simple act of washing hands or having access to a toilet.</p> <p>This human disaster was the subject of a debate I attended in New York with, among others, Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, Unilever CEO Paul Polman and Robert Orr, the United Nations assistant secretary general for policy co-ordination and strategic planning.</p> <p>What was clear is that, while Global Handwashing Day may have helped raise public awareness in developing nations, it has failed to inspire the world's institutions and governments to act.</p> <p>Sachs, who announced a partnership with Unilever and his <a href=\"http://www.millenniumvillages.org/\" title=\"\">Millennium Villages</a> project to demonstrate the difference that hand washing can make, said the main glimmer of hope on the horizon is that some of the big multinationals are taking action and putting pressure on the UN and others to follow suit.</p> <p>Sachs has been tasked by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to lead the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, a new initiative which will mobilise scientific and technical expertise from academia, civil society, and the private sector in support of sustainable development problem solving. However, Sachs pulled no punches in his criticism of the UN, the World Bank and Unicef for their failure to take adequate steps to solve the crisis.</p> <p>He said: \"You need the UN to create scale and to create the public/private partnerships that actually make things work.</p> <p>\"But when it comes to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, we don't have the public side, we have the private side.</p> <p>\"The UN itself is a little bit in disarray because there are a dozen agencies that have water somehow associated with it and we have none on sanitation, to put it bluntly.</p> <p>\"I have been 12 years with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and sanitation is the biggest failure. There are a billion people in the world who will defecate in public today, not even in a hole, because they don't have a toilet or a place to wash their hands afterwards.</p> <p>\"UN agencies mainly promote knowledge about toilets, but not the toilets themselves, and people cannot afford the $100 slabs to make a latrine.</p> <p>\"The public sector needs to stand up and say 'we see what Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble are doing and see that there are partners in the private sector ready to lead'.\"</p> <p>One piece of good news was that Sachs said that at a meeting last week with Ban Ki-moon and the MDG advocates, it had been \"agreed that sanitation would go top of the list\" of priorities.</p> <p>However, he also made it clear the planned Sustainable Development Goals, which will replace the MDGs post-2015, would not include handwashing as a specific target \"because then there will be 6,000 specific goals. It won't come at a high level because we need enough goals that a fifth grader can recite them.</p> <p>\"There is no way that on that list handwashing will make it. Ending poverty will make it, preserving the environment will make it but we need to do thousands of things that are really important.\"</p> <p>Sachs said the key obstacle to progress was the lack of a funding source such as the GAVI Alliance or the Global Fund and accused the World Bank of failing to support the process of change.</p> <p>He also offered up the possibility that Bill Gates may provide the first major financial support for water, sanitation and hygiene.</p> <p>\"We don't have a funding source for sanitation,\" he said. \"If a country is in need of scaling up sanitation there is no place to turn. The World Bank is not the place you can approach, where you can actually get financing. You do not go to the bank for your toilet and this is why after 12 years we don't have toilets. It's a failure of mechanisms.</p> <p>\"Bill Gates is interested and he might start a fund which will partner on the WASH agenda which is really what we need and that may be the right answer as they are the biggest single funder in the world right now.</p> <p>\"The only other mechanism that is a thousand times better is the market but the problem is the markets do not reach people who don't have money.\"</p> <p>Sachs also had this message for Unicef: \"You are our lead on this in the UN system so scaling up has to be the call. Unicef does not have the money to support but you have a great brand to get the money.\"</p> <p>Orr admitted that not much progress has been made in the last 100 years on sanitation, and that the issues were not costly to solve. But he did say that the <a href=\"http://www.everywomaneverychild.org/\" title=\"\">UN's Every Woman Every Child</a> movement has grown rapidly and \"we are literally bending the curve on investment and lives saved of women and children,\" in part due to the involvement of the private sector.</p> <p>\"Business can do something that governments alone cannot do. The reach of business helps us get to the people that we try to reach. We know the solutions and business is there on innovation not just in products but in marketing and market development. Business is there on supply chains, Polman reaches parts of the world that we can't.\"</p> <p>\"Success in whatever area you are trying to make major changes depends upon making it a process of bidding each other up. Governments do more so business does more so therefore civil society does more. If we see a race to the top on something as simple as this, this is actually easy. Yes we need the money, yes we need the systems and political leadership but ultimately we need behaviour change on a mass scale. Make it cool, do it together and everyone will see success.\"</p> <p>Polman defended the record of the UN and pointed out the importance the Secretary-General had placed on partnership in his second term in office.</p> <p>\"The Secretary-General is very smart and he could have been head of marketing for Unilever,\" quipped Polman. \"His campaigns such as Energy for All and Every Women Every Child get the mind focussed. For business it is extremely helpful to link it to your business model and help create a critical mass.\"</p> <p>He said the partnership with the Millennium Villages will encompass nearly 500,000 people in rural villages, across 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and will support the company's goal to help more than one billion people take action to improve their health and wellbeing.</p> <p>\"The big issues the world is facing require new approaches, new business models and new partnerships,\" he said. \"Responsible businesses must take a more active leadership role. Innovative partnerships between governments, civil society and business have a critical role to play in promoting better hygiene practices and in tackling the world's deadliest diseases.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Maggie Smith has berated Hollywood for catering only to younger cinemagoers, claiming studios should stop treating audiences \"as if they were five years old\".</p> <p>Speaking at a press conference to promote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148763/quartet\" title=\"\">Quartet</a>, which is set in a retirement home for opera singers, the 77-year-old star of the Harry Potter films and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\" title=\"\">TV show Downton Abbey</a> said she hoped more films for older people would begin to be made to cater for shifting population demographics.</p> <p>\"It seems to me there is a change in what audiences want to see,\" she said. \"I can only hope that's correct, because there's an awful lot of people of my age around now and we outnumber the others.</p> <p>\"I don't think films about elderly people have been made very much. But I think of [films like] Cocoon and Driving Miss Daisy and they always seem to be fairly successful, so it's a bit baffling as to why everybody has to be treated as if they were five years old.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, Smith starred with Judi Dench in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145794/best-exotic-marigold-hotel\" title=\"\">The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</a>, a film about British retirees travelling to India that made an impressive \u00a3134m at the global box office on a budget of just \u00a310m. \"I think it's because a lot of grownups would like films for grownups and about grownups,\" she said of the movie's success.</p> <p>Quartet, which is directed by feature film-making debutant Dustin Hoffman and also stars Pauline Collins, Tom Courtenay and Billy Connolly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/11/quartet-dustin-hoffman-review\" title=\"\">premiered at the Toronto film festival in September</a>, before enjoying a gala at the London film festival yesterday.

  "<p>There may not be enough money to solve the world's increasingly complex problems, but capital is gravitating towards investments that have a positive social or environmental impact.</p> <p>Delegates at the recent <a href=\"http://socap12.socialcapitalmarkets.net/\" title=\"\">SOCAP 12</a> conference, an annual event dedicated to increasing the flow of capital towards social good, heard how the emerging field of \"impact investing\" is seeking to achieve more than just making a buck.</p> <p>As financial returns from traditional investments limp along at low levels because of the global economic and financial crisis, impact has become an important differentiator among investors.</p> <p>\"Impact investing is an enormous opportunity for people, not only to get a return on their investment, but to also help make an impact on major societal needs at the same time \u2013 the two can go hand in hand,\" said Jed Emerson, chief impact strategist at <a href=\"http://www.impactassets.org/\" title=\"\">ImpactAssets</a>, a non-profit social investment company.</p> <p>Impact investing has gained traction in the philanthropic community in the past few years, with hundreds of new funds set up. The market could reach $1tn in investments in the next 10 years, estimated <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/impact_investments_nov2010.pdf?blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1158611333228&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs\" title=\"\">a report by financial services firm JP Morgan</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Rockefeller Foundation</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.thegiin.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home/index.html\" title=\"\">Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN)</a> in 2010.</p> <p>Even though the market is growing, it is fragmented and inefficient, leaving the 'demand side' \u2013 the social entrepreneurs seeking funding \u2013 struggling to get the money they need to help them grow their businesses.</p> <p>The flow of capital is dominated by high net worth individuals and family foundations, largely due to the perceived high risk of investing in the social impact sector.</p> <p>The Rockefeller Foundation was an early explorer of this type of finance, according to its president, Judith Rodin.</p> <p>\"We recognised, if you put a price tag on all the social and environmental needs around the world, it is in the trillions,\" she told SOCAP12 delegates. \"All of the philanthropy in the world is only $590bn. So the needs far exceed the resources.\"</p> <p>Even though there are trillions of dollars in private capital markets, none of the world's richest philanthropists has enough resources alone to tip the balance on the most pressing problems.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, many large funds have been developed to help roll out proven social enterprise models. <a href=\"http://www.acumenfund.org/ten/\" title=\"\">Acumen Fund</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lgt.com/en/private-banking/philanthropy/index.html\" title=\"\">LGT Venture Philanthropy</a>, for example, are expanding high-impact social ventures in some of the world's least developed economies.</p> <p>But even though there is pent-up capital waiting to be invested, much-needed smaller-scale investments in fledgling enterprises are still rare. Acumen Fund's investments, for example, range from $300,000 to $2.5m, and it tends to work with proven social enterprises that have well-established business models.</p> <p>There are encouraging signs nonetheless. Some investors, such as <a href=\"http://www.globalafc.org/Global_Agents_for_Change/GlobalCatalystInitiative.html\" title=\"\">Global Catalyst Initiative</a>, have begun to focus on providing funding in smaller amounts to early-stage social enterprises, aiming to show that their business models reduce poverty.</p> <p>\"Our goal is to help the most innovative, high-potential ideas to prove themselves in action, and then expand through further access to these larger pools of capital,\" said Sean Peters, the firm's president.</p> <p>Global Catalyst Initiative, which works in Africa, Asia and Latin America, typically provides grants of up to $40,000 and guides entrepreneurs in testing their model and being investment-ready in the social capital marketplace.</p> <p>Social enterprises that Global Catalyst Initiative works with include <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/TakaTaka-Solutions/101240103296048\" title=\"\">Taka Taka Solutions</a>, a social enterprise that provides affordable and environmentally friendly waste management services in Kenya's capital Nairobi and <a href=\"http://ecofuelafrica.com/\" title=\"\">Eco-Fuel Africa Limited</a>, a technology company that helps communities in Uganda to convert locally sourced farm and municipal waste into clean cooking fuel and organic fertiliser.</p> <p>Retail investors can also play a part in creating a more efficient market and bridge the gap between philanthropy and impact investing and big players are forging ahead to reach these customers.</p> <p>Investment bank Morgan Stanley has launched <a href=\"http://www.morganstanley.com/globalcitizen/investing-impact.html\" title=\"\">Investing With Impact</a>, a platform to help retail investors \"to start thinking about this space\", according to Audrey Choi, its head of global sustainable finance. Throughout the platform, investors have access to a range of investment vehicles, which have been evaluated for their financial return potential and social impact.</p> <p>Delegates at last week's conference in San Francisco also heard that throwing money at problems through charitable giving has not provided lasting solutions for the world's social ills.</p> <p>\"Everything that non-profits have been trying to fix for the past 30 years or so has become worse \u2013 despite new records for philanthropic giving almost every year,\" according to Majora Carter, founder of <a href=\"http://www.ssbx.org/\" title=\"\">Sustainable South Bronx</a>.</p> <p>\"It's not because the people running charitable institutions don't care or are not talented,\" said Carter, who coined the term 'green the ghetto' in 2003 as she pioneered one of the first US urban 'green collar' job training and placement systems in New York's Bronx district, and spearheaded legislation that fuelled demand for those jobs.</p> <p>\"I believe it has more to do with the position of capital within the relationship between those who need help and those who can help,\" said Carter.</p> <p><em>Astrid Zweynert is deputy editor of the Thomson Reuters' Foundation's websites </em><a href=\"http://www.trust.org/alertnet/\" title=\"\"><em>AlertNet</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/\" title=\"\"><em>TrustLaw</em></a><em>.

  "<p>I am very keen on walking. I have spent a lot of time walking in wild spaces over the years. It's a meditative thing, an extremely necessary antidote to my otherwise hectic life.</p> <p>I like walking with good friends \u2013 some of my deepest conversations have taken place while walking with friends \u2013 and I like walking alone. I never listen to music when I walk; I prefer to listen to my mind and my thoughts.</p> <p>But I am intrigued by what music and sound can do to an environment. I remember my first Walkman, how it transformed the place I found myself in \u2013 usually walking around a city, or sitting in the back of a band van on a seemingly endless journey, when the ability to have your own personal soundtrack was truly amazing. Driving through a grim industrial area in the rain with John Coltrane playing through my headphones, I felt like I was watching a film. My perception was changed entirely.</p> <p>This sonic journey is about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/16/portishead-adrian-utley-stroll-trees\" title=\"\">seeing and being with these amazing ancient beautiful trees</a> \u2013 the chestnut avenue, crooked and sculptural, that will not conform to the lines they were put in 400 years ago (the time of the plague in England). I felt pretty calm around them, even though they probably have the potential to fall on you. I loved the dead ones just as much \u2013 it would be hard to invent these shapes.</p> <p>The hawthorns at the end of the walk seem very special too. I love their history and their link to the past \u2026 their connections to folklore and pagan religion and thought, a symbol of protection and fertility, their association with Beltane or May day. The beautiful and pungent smelling flowers traditionally (and before global warming) in May bring joy to me when I'm walking. And behind the flowers, nasty, very sharp thorns \u2026 juxtaposition and duality \u2026 balance?</p> <p><a href=\"http://thespace.org/items/e00018aq.js\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video</a></p> <p>I had the privilege, on my first visit, to walk and talk with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/aug/01/green-shoots-britain-ancient-trees\">National Trust ancient tree expert Brian Muelaner</a>, who has an incredible wealth of deep knowledge and experience, who gave me many tree facts and disputed some of the myths that surround these ancient ones here. The chestnut avenue was supposedly grown from chestnuts found on ships from the Spanish Armada. It's probably not true, but it's a good story \u2013 the great English oaks looking across from the field above on to the Spanish chestnuts.</p> <p>The beginning of the journey starts at the lake and goes past some extraordinary looking trees \u2013 the twisty one on the left as you go up the hill and three beauties on your right. Then the extraordinary 1,000-year-old quarry oak on the left. (<a href=\"http://www.dot-domesday.me.uk/arrow.htm\" title=\"\">King Harold was getting an arrow in his eye</a> around that time.)</p> <p>I would suggest walking at the end of the day, towards twilight, when our perception is sharp and we seem to have a more primeval outlook. There is a focused sense that we need to get back before it gets dark.</p> <p>I have made a map and there are three sections to my music and thoughts. If you watch the film made by my friend and often collaborator John Minton it will give you a good sense of what I was thinking \u2026 but it is also for you to discover as you want and to make your own journey.</p> <p>\u2022 The new track, which will be accompanied by a hand-drawn route map by Adrian Utley, will be available to download for free on to smartphones and MP3 players until 15 October 2013 via <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">nationaltrust.org.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sonicjourneys.co.uk/\" title=\"\">sonicjourneys.co.uk</a> and also on MP3 players at Croft Castle.

  "<p>Given all the hysteria over biofuels you'd be forgiven for believing that wiping out the biofuels industry will solve world hunger. It won't. Firstly, agriculture is not a zero-sum game. As well as offering genuine greenhouse gas savings today and even better prospects in future, biofuels have already led to big investments in sustainable farming practices which can improve agricultural productivity in the round.</p> <p>Here in the UK, our home-produced biofuels provide as much high-protein animal feed as low-carbon liquid fuel \u2013 essential for our hard-pressed livestock industry. This feed in turn displaces imported soy, which is often associated with high carbon emissions.</p> <p>Many NGOs also neglect to remind us that one-third of world food is wasted \u2013 a staggering figure which casts a very different light on how best to use land and tackle hunger. And extreme weather events consistent with climate change itself are destroying crops \u2013 yet transport is a major contributor to carbon emissions.</p> <p>Of course, if the biofuels industry were to endlessly expand there would be inevitable conflict between food and fuel. But what is vital to understand, and what is missing from the debate, is that biofuels are at an early stage in their technological learning curve. With the right framework, this technology will have moved on long before conflict need be inevitable, and agriculture will have become more sustainable and productive in the meantime.</p> <p>The European commission's new proposals, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/21/biodiesel-industry-eu-policy-changes\" title=\"\">announced last month</a>, aim to dramatically reorientate support towards advanced biofuels. We've been asking for a clear 2020 pathway to reward exactly that. But having been ignored, the measures now put forward are so drastic and fast, they present the UK industry with a canyon it simply cannot leap.</p> <p>Why would investors who stand to lose hundreds of millions of pounds put their hands in their pockets for several hundred million more? The commission proposals \u2013 to allow crop-based biofuels to reduce our fossil fuel use by only 5%, and to withdraw the market for these biofuels altogether after 2020 - mean that around \u00a3700m of investment in the UK biofuels industry could be in peril.</p> <p>You'd think we can go on using oil forever. We can't. And neither can we decarbonise transport at the pace we need to with electric vehicles (EVs).</p> <p>In fact, EVs are not environmentally perfect \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/05/electric-cars-emissions-bad-environment\" title=\"\">a recent report in the Journal of Industrial Ecology</a> shows EVs can contribute more to climate change than cars running on oil and they can create more toxic waste. Does that mean we trash EVs? Of course not. It means we work hard on the technology and green our electricity supply to improve their performance. However, as the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/sectors/surface-transport/biofuels\" title=\"\">Committee on Climate Change acknowledges</a>, biofuels will be necessary over the next 20 years at least to decarbonise our transport sector.</p> <p>Domestic UK biofuels already deliver greenhouse gas <a href=\"http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/letter-commission-energy-20110729/letter-commission-energy-20110729.pdf\" title=\"\">savings of up to 77% versus fossil fuels</a>. Despite our domestic industry's small size (it makes up only 20% of the overall UK biofuels market, which also includes imports), it is also delivering technological innovation, in particular with plans to develop more biofuels from waste.</p> <p>However, rather than recognising our responsible achievements in difficult circumstances, commentators often demonise biofuels indiscriminately. The work of NGOs in exposing appalling biofuels practices overseas is indeed valuable. The UK biofuels industry also condemns these practices, over which we have no control. But there are, and will always be, bad businesses in every sector \u2013 banking, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, food \u2013 you name it.</p> <p>But what is particularly galling for the biofuels industry is that we have been attacked with considerably more venom than other non-food uses of land, such as cosmetics, cotton for our disposable clothing culture, or detergents. None of these industries are being made to account for land-use changes. Equally galling was finding ourselves alone this time last year in calling for the UK to legislate against the import of unsustainable biofuels of unknown origin into our domestic market. Government had the powers to do so and it certainly took its time.</p> <p>Today, 50% of Brazil's transport system is running on biofuels produced from around 1% of its land with greenhouse gas savings of up to 90%. It's a stunning result. Is Brazil really the only country whose technicians can pull off successful biofuel technology? If the EU proposals go through, we may never find out, as any hope of further investment in the UK industry will be destroyed.</p> <p>Grossly simplifying the issues and creating bogeymen may play well with the media but it risks crushing desperately needed solutions.</p> <p>It is so easy to demonise and destroy. It is considerably harder to apply careful considered thought and to secure an intelligent pathway through these complex issues. And it may also be hard to really listen to the industry's achievements given the scent of blood.</p> <p>But that is what we need, and we need the NGOs and politicians who recognise that to step forward and work with the UK industry, which is among the best in the world. The fate of this industry, and the climate, is all down to whether we can really develop the much more grown-up energy discourse we need in the UK, or whether we will remain stuck in this comic-book level of analysis and debate.</p> <p>\u2022 Clare Wenner is the head of renewable transport fuels at the <a href=\"http://www.r-e-a.net/\">Renewable Energy Association</a></p>",
  "<p>We glimpsed the future in Toulouse at the weekend. Ga\u00ebl Fickou is only 18 years old and, facially, looks not unlike the England forward Courtney Lawes. When he runs he moves with the balletic grace, pace and balance of a Jeremy Guscott. A French version of Jeremy Guscott? This really is the point at which top-level rugby and fantasy football merge into one. Such players normally materialise only in an attack coach's wildest imagination. If <em>Monsieur Fickou </em>can stay fit, he has all the makings of a global superstar.</p> <p>Even his opponents are already cooing. \"He's the next Wesley Fofana, isn't he?\" observed Leicester's Toby Flood. \"He looks fantastic. He's big, he's rangy, he's going to fill out further and he's got good acceleration. He's certainly one to watch.\" Having already polished the gleaming jewel that was Yannick Jauzion, Toulouse also know how to nurture such prodigious talents. The game as a whole should be grateful. Only twice previously in my press-box-dwelling, splinter-collecting career have I seen a young centre who has stood out to the same spectacular extent. Both Guscott and Brian O'Driscoll went on to have half-decent careers and it is hard to believe Fickou will not do the same. Ga\u00ebl force indeed.</p> <p>It revives memories of the first time I saw Guscott play, away at London Irish's old ground in Sunbury circa 1985. People tend to over-use the phrase \"poetry in motion\" but in this case it was entirely accurate. The coltish pretender did not so much run as glide, an occasional swing of the hips leaving defenders utterly confounded. He knew he was good, too, which added an additional frisson.</p> <p>Fickou, to judge from his cheerful post-match demeanour, also looks a thoroughly decent kid. Toulon must be kicking themselves for letting him slip away but just imagine the warm, pleasurable sensation Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 must be feeling. Fofana, Fickou, Maxime Mermoz \u2026 France suddenly have gifted young centres oozing from every pore at a time when English rugby cannot seem to rear any blemish-free homegrown 12s.</p> <p>Is this mere coincidence? The French Top 14, as we know, is hardly a free-flowing try-fest. There are dozens of long-striding, free-running centres worldwide who have their x-factor knocked out of them by the age of 21. Fickou was born in 1994, which makes him too young to have seen the likes of Denis Charvet or Didier Codorniou in the flesh.</p> <p>But whereas Guscott was a virtual one-off in an environment which churned out considerably more bashers than artistes, Fickou appears to be the latest descendant of a rich heritage. For some reason France do not seem capable of producing many world champion fly-halves \u2013 too much responsibility, too fearful of letting their gargantuan forwards down, too many coaches preferring to use their scrum-halves as the tactical hub? \u2013 but they have cornered the market in languid midfield sorcerers as no other country, New Zealand included.</p> <p>The nearest athletic English equivalent to Fickou in recent times, one could argue, is Delon Armitage, the best No13 the English national team have never had. And where did Delon spend his formative rugby days? Why, in the south of France at Racing Club de Nice. Instead of basing their new elite talent-honing academy near Reading, perhaps the Rugby Football Union should send them all to the C\u00f4te d'Azur for six months.</p> <p>Then again maybe Fickou is simply a once-in-a-generation player who, like Guscott, would have made it regardless of nationality but I am not entirely convinced. Toulouse dropped a lot of ball <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/toulouse-leicester-heineken-cup-report?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">in damp conditions against Leicester on Sunday</a> but the lofty ambition of their inter-passing was in a different league from much of what passes for midfield trickery in the Premiership.</p> <p>So was their speed of thought. When Thomas Waldrom spilt the ball 45 metres from his own posts on Sunday, most opposing players would simply have hacked it blindly forwards. Not Fickou. He had the presence of mind not merely to pick it up in one lithe movement but to kick it immediately into a space he had identified in the previous split-second.</p> <p>After that his pace took him past several trailing Leicester players, who were still mentally adjusting to the fact Waldrom had lost possession. This, remember, was the young man's Heineken Cup debut. No fear, no hesitation, no boundaries. Genuinely ambitious young British three-quarters should consider adopting a similar creed.</p> <h2>Predictive text</h2> <p>A colleague made a few quid on an accumulator bet over the weekend. He backed Clermont and Harlequins to win well at home and also predicted Leinster, Saracens, Northampton and Toulon would score victories on the opening weekend of this season's Heineken Cup. It all duly came to pass, with the home sides winning 10 of the 12 games. Does this mean Europe is becoming a slightly more predictable competition this year?</p> <p>Best to reserve judgment until after this weekend when, by my reckoning, there could be as many as eight away wins from 12 fixtures. If the likes of Clermont, Leinster, Ulster, Harlequins and Toulon return home as losers the tournament's reputation for knocking everyone down to size at some point will be gloriously intact.</p> <h2>Hold on tight for \u2026</h2> <p>Saracens v Racing M\u00e9tro in Brussels on Saturday. The King Baudouin Stadium is Saracens' latest temporary stop as they continue their nomadic trek towards their new plastic-pitch home in Barnet. Will the Belgians be bovvered? Will Olly Barkley kick Racing to victory again as he did against Munster last weekend? And how many times will Plastic Bertrand, Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Eddy Merckx be mentioned in the build-up?</p>",
  "<p>This year, the <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201210021195.html\" title=\"\">poaching of over 430 rhinos</a> in South Africa has rightly dominated the news. The massacre of these animals has forced the government to respond with more rangers in Kruger national park and stronger surveillance in the airports. Sadly, the energy and hand-wringing to protect one species is not extending to another. South Africa's lions are down to the last few prides, with just 2,000 living in the wild. But the failure to curb the nascent but burgeoning trade in lion bones could see this drop even further.</p> <p>In illicit auctions in Beijing and Ho Chi Minh City, lion bone wine has stepped in to replace its tiger bone cousin as a supposed cure-all. A complete lion skeleton <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-07-04-sa-breeders-embrace-growing-asian-demand-for-lion-bones\" title=\"\">can sell for as much as $9,000</a>. For the traders, lion bones are a big business. <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article966456.ece/Over-1400-Lion-Leopard-trophies-exported--Minister\" title=\"\">Over 1,400 lion and leopard trophies were exported</a> from the country in 2009 and 2010 and while much of this trade comes from private lodges, poachers <a href=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2012/08/26/2003541237\" title=\"\">have been detained at Johannesburg airport</a> for attempting to smuggle out lion bones, an indication that the threat is now spreading into the country's famous national parks.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.cites.org/\" title=\"\">CITES</a>, between 2009 and 2010 exports of lion bones from South Africa have <a href=\"http://www.ru.ac.za/perspective/perspectivearticles/name,68678,en.html\" title=\"\">risen by 250%</a>. Hundreds of thousands of people have called on the government to act to save these majestic creatures. The reaction so far: stubborn denials and political censorship to silence the growing drumbeat of lion campaigners.</p> <p>Dr Pieter Kat, a trustee of LionAid, says that by creating a supply for the trade in lion bones, South Africa has created <a href=\"http://www.lionaid.org/blog/2012/07/south-africa-wildlife-conservation-and-international-pressure.htm\" title=\"\">growing levels of lion poaching across Africa</a>, fuelled in large part by the much higher premium paid in East Asia for wild lion bone over its farmed alternative. But environment minister Edna Molewa has refused to acknowledge this risk, <a href=\"http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-09-27-the-lion-the-prez-and-the-airport\" title=\"\">slapping a target on the forehead of the last remaining lions</a>. The statistics are alarming. In the last 40 years, the African lion population has plummeted from roughly 200,000 to around 20,000 today.</p> <p>More than 700,000 people, many of them in South Africa, have <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/stop_lion_slaughter_for_sex_aides_d/?slideshow\" title=\"\">backed a campaign</a> by the online campaign organisation Avaaz calling on President Zuma to save Africa's last lions. Rather than allow the debate to flow, however, it has been gagged. When ads asking Zuma to take action went up in the Johannesburg airport next to the baggage carousel, they were torn down by the airports authority.</p> <p>The adverts \u2013 which were being seen by tens of thousands flying into the city \u2013 were powerful but not insulting: a picture of Zuma looks on as a lioness stares down the barrel of a gun, with the caption reading: \"Our lions are being slaughtered to make bogus sex potions for Asia. Will President Zuma save them? Urge him to stop the deadly lion bone trade now.\"</p> <p>These adverts break no law and are a protected form of free expression under the South African constitution. As this campaign to save the lions in South Africa has been censored by the government-owned airport authority, <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/legal-battle-looms-after-removal-of-lion-ads-1.1367262#.UGMErqTyY0M\" title=\"\">Avaaz has launched legal proceedings</a> against Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) and its advertising firm Primedia (which had approved the ads before their hanging). Acsa announced this week it planned to dig in its heels and defend its political censorship.</p> <p>South Africa is committed to conservation and it has forcefully protected at-risk species from poachers in the past, including taking swift action to save the rhino. But failing to act on lions exposes a conservation policy that can seemingly only cope with one burning issue at a time.</p> <p>The first step to solving this problem is for the government to first admit that there is a problem. This is not confined to canned lions \u2013 where animals are kept in a confined area to facilitate the hunt \u2013 but threatens a dangerous escalation in illegal poaching. Zuma has the power right now to institute a ban. Prohibitive sentences for commercial poachers and enhanced monitoring of airports and harbours to reduce the flow of these products would go a long way towards stemming the proliferation in illegal poaching. Effective laws must be put in place to cut off any legal loopholes and extinguish this shameful trade before one of the world's most majestic and celebrated creatures is relegated to a greed-fuelled and needless demise.</p>",

  "<p>It requires persistence to visit Al Evans. After you have surrendered your passport, declared any explosives and locked your mobile you must wait for the next openings of two sets of electronic doors. Then it's a quarter of a mile of concrete corridors, some inside between locked steel gates and some across the grounds, caged in metal. \"I've overdosed on Night Nurse,\" says the drugs counsellor when I reach her, \"so I'm sorry if I'm a bit out of it!\"</p> <p>If the woman I meet is out of it I'm alarmed at the thought of the force she must be when she's in it. No quantity of barred windows or locked gates could thwart Evan's determined energy. Her ambition is to penetrate every jail in Britain within 10 years and coaxing inmates out of substance addictions in a bid to slash the national reoffending rate. \"I like a fight,\" she says.</p> <p>Evans, 49, is an area manager for The Rehabilitation For Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPt), a charity founded 21 years ago. Then there were no drug rehabilitation programmes in UK prisons; now RAPt runs intensive recovery regimes in 17 jails and shorter courses in a further nine. Evans manages its work in six prisons around the Home Counties, including The Mount, a Category C jail near Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which has just contracted the charity to add an alcohol dependency programme and a scheme for non-addicts who need help with lesser substance abuse.</p> <p>\"Take your life back,\" reads a poster on the wall behind Evans. And, it seems, hundreds do, for a survey of police data validated by Manchester University found that fewer than a third of RAPt graduates reoffend compared to over half of other addicted prisoners. \"The association between addiction and crime is overwhelming, but it's always been a missed market,\" she says. \"Addicts are just seen as problematic, but are victims themselves, usually with horrific backgrounds.\"</p> <p>Evans was studying psychology and had gained a diploma in counselling when, seven years ago, she applied to RAPt, but another qualification has been crucial to her work: she is herself a recovered addict and memories of her own unsupported battles keep her motivated. \"There's a different level of passion when you've been through it yourself,\" she says. \"I draw on my own experiences hugely.\"</p> <p>Despite her small stature and a disability which leaves her partially dependent on a wheelchair, she says she was unfazed by her first encounter with inmates at an all-male prison: \"I never saw them as prisoners, just as suffering human beings. These people have never been shown respect or taught boundaries. It took me back to when my three children were growing up and my maternal instincts kicked in. I don't condone their behaviour, but I try to lovingly support them and if they become challenging I use my counselling training to bracket my natural reactions and not take it personally. The most difficult people are often the most wounded.\"</p> <p>Occasionally abusive behaviour has threatened to become violent, yet Evans says she feels safer inside prison than out. \"The prisoners have an in-house moral hierarchy and are quite protective of women. Once when a new inmate became abusive they all grouped round me as a shield.\"</p> <p>Most prisoners enrol voluntarily on the six-week intensive rehabilitation courses and follow-up rolling programmes and at The Mount those who do are housed separately in their own wing so that they can support each other through the process. \"The risks these people take in exposing their vulnerability in group sessions humbles me,\" says Evans. \"Their perception is that vulnerability is weakness and they can't show it in a predatory environment, but learning to manage this vulnerability helps them start coping with other emotions. Peer support is intrinsic to success and empathy is a key element that they learn.\"</p> <p>As area manager much of Evans' work is deskbound, line managing the managers of around 40 staff in the clutch of prisons she oversees and establishing supportive relations with the prison staff to ensure the rehabilitation work complements their own. However, she tries to mix with the inmates as often as possible and knows every prisoner at her Surrey base in Coldingley prison by name: \"To be an effective manager you have to be on the front line. I have informal chats and lecture them if they're pushing boundaries and being disruptive.\"</p> <p>It may be the fact that Evans rebuilt her own life from the ruins of addiction that she possesses such extraordinary zest. She has survived two gangrenous legs, a stroke and a benign brain tumour, yet considers herself lucky: \"I look at what I've got, not what I haven't got, and I've no time for 'why me?' Why not me?\"</p> <p>The fact that she is alive, smiling and in motion must, alone, be an inspiration to inmates who struggle to see a future. To the many who keep in touch long after they have served their sentence, she is the nearest they have to a mother. \"One of them told staff that if they'd threatened him with the all-powerful prison security governor or me he'd pick the security governor every time,\" she says. \"Because when I told him off it hurt.\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Salary:</strong> \u00a340,000-\u00a345,000.</p> <p><strong>Hours:</strong> \"Forty a week, although often I do more because I feel so passionate about the work.\"</p> <p><strong>Work/Life balance:</strong> \"I love the fact that there's no set routine; every day is different. And the hours are flexible so that I can fit work round the demands of my disability. My training allows me to switch off and leave the burden of other people's problems behind at the end of the day.\"</p> <p><strong>Best thing:</strong> \"That light-bulb moment when you and the prisoner glimpse the difference the treatment can make.\"</p> <p><strong>Worst thing: </strong>\"Bureaucracy. If you never saw the human results, you'd get so demoralised by all the red tape. Having to quantify everything we do gets so depressing.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Danny Boyle featured weatherman Michael Fish's \"no hurricane tonight\" forecast in the Olympic Games opening ceremony, the failure of the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Met Office</a> to predict <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2012/oct/15/great-storm-1987-interactive-map?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the Great Storm of 1987</a> was recognised as a significant British event.</p> <p>In fact, the Met Office had forecast the storm \u2013 25 years ago, on the night of October 15-16 \u2013 but had massively underestimated its intensity. The official excuse is that in 1987 there was no understanding of a phenomenon now called the \"sting jet\". This is what happens when cold dry air descends into storms high in the atmosphere; it has the effect of adding energy, which translates into much stronger winds.</p> <p>\"In 1987, no one knew sting jets even existed, but now they are well understood and included in forecast models\", said a Met office spokesperson.</p> <p>The other 1987 myth was that this was the most powerful storm to have hit Britain since the last great \"hurricane\" in 1703. In fact, there are regular storms of this strength hitting the north coast of Scotland and the Cairngorms, even the Scilly Islands off Cornwall. What was unusual about 1987 was that the storm hit London and a swath of the most densely populated towns and countryside in Europe, causing more insurance damage than usual.</p> <p>The point was proved only three years later in 1990, when, in what is now known as the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns%27_Day_storm\" title=\"\">Burns Day storm</a>\", much of England and Wales \u2013 but not London \u2013 was battered by similar winds, causing many more deaths and injuries, but the news received far less notice.</p> <p>Missing a great storm is something the Met office says \"just does not happen any more\". \"It sometimes takes your darkest hour for a professional organisation to learn lessons, and we have learnt many lessons, \"says Ewen McCallum, the chief meteorologist. \"The science, technology and the way we communicate has come a long way since 1987 \u2013 our whole game has been upped.</p> <p>\"In 1987, computing capacity limited the resolution of the global model the Met Office used for weather prediction to gridboxes of 150km; now the model works at 25km on a global scale, giving vastly improved resolution.</p> <p>\"Our four-day forecasts today are as accurate as our one-day forecasts were in 1987. This means that we can now provide more advance warning when severe weather is expected to affect the UK.\"</p>",
  "<p>A drive to get more children into school in the developing world is grinding to a halt as aid for education stagnates, amid fears that this will fall faster than overall aid levels. The <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/\" title=\"\">education for all (EFA) global monitoring report, Putting education to work</a>, said that on current trends, the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/education.shtml\" title=\"\">millennium development goal (MDG) of universal primary education by 2015</a> will be missed by a large margin.</p> <p>The number of primary school age children out of school has fallen from 108 million to 61 million since 1999, but most of this reduction was achieved between 1999 and 2004. Progress stalled between 2008 and 2010, with the number of children out of school stuck around the 60 million mark.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/education/wef/en-conf/index.shtm\" title=\"\">At the world education forum in Dakar, Senegal, in 2000</a>, 164 governments pledged to provide education for all and identified <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-all/efa-goals/\" title=\"\">six goals to be met by 2015</a>, but the report expresses concern that progress is slowing as donor contributions decline. \"More money alone will not ensure that education for all goals are reached, but less money will certainly be harmful. A renewed and concerted effort by aid donors is urgently needed,\" the report said.</p> <p>The report said a fifth of young people in developing countries \u2013 200 million people aged 15 to 24 \u2013 fail to complete primary school and lack skills for work. \"Youth and skills is a burning theme,\" said Pauline Rose, director of the EFA report. \"A large number is not even making it to the end of primary school. It's partly fuelling youth frustration, which played a part in the Arab spring. The voices of these people are getting forgotten, they are getting left behind. Donors need to pay attention.\"</p> <p>In 2010, aid for education hit a plateau of $13.5bn (\u00a38.4bn), reflecting a reduction in overall aid as donor governments tightened their belts after the 2008 financial crisis, with only $1.9bn allocated for basic education in low-income countries, well short of the amount needed to fill a $16bn funding gap. The report said key donors may make education a lower priority, leading to a faster drop in education aid than in overall aid.</p> <p>The Netherlands, one of the top three donors to basic education in the past decade, no longer considers education a key priority and is expected to cut aid to education by 60% between 2010 and 2015. It is set to withdraw from Burkino Faso, for example, at the same time as four other donors have said they intend to pull out of education in the country.</p> <p>\"There are worrying signs that aid to education may be slowing down just when children and young people need it most,\" said Rose. \"Governments and donors must find the money and energy to help young people most in need to acquire the skills they and their countries' economies desperately need.\"</p> <p>Rose suggested that the private sector could step in. The private sector contributes the equivalent of 5% of total official aid to education, with most of that money given by five corporations.</p> <p>\"Reallocating aid could help fill the funding gap,\" said the report, which points out that $3.1bn of aid to post-secondary education never reaches developing countries as it is used to fund foreign students in donor countries. In 2010, for example, France spent four times as much on foreign students studying in France as it did on aid to general secondary education and vocational training.</p> <p>\"These funds could be better spent addressing the skills deficit for disadvantaged youth in poor countries,\" said the report. \"The cost of one Nepalese student's scholarship in Japan could give 229 students access to secondary education at home.\"</p> <p>Countries with natural resources could invest more in education to fill the funding gap. Nigeria, for example, is a large exporter of oil and gas, but has the largest number of children out of school \u2013 10.5 million or one in six of the world's out-of-school children. By contrast, Botswana has financed education during past decades on the back of diamonds that have made it one of sub-Saharan Africa's richest countries.</p> <p>The report cited Ethiopia as a country that is making skills development a cornerstone of its national growth strategy, with the ambition of reaching middle-income status by 2025. Ethiopia aims to achieve universal secondary school enrolment by 2020 while emphasising skills in agricultural and industrial sectors. It is focusing on increasing the productivity of micro and small businesses, where many disadvantaged people work.</p> <p>Sandra Dworack, education expert for Oxfam, said: \"The report says that for every dollar spent on a person's education it will bring back $10 -15 in economic growth over that person's working lifetime. Investing in education is a way of investing in a future generation who won't need aid, because they have the skills and education to build a life free from poverty.\"</p> <p>There is an urgent need for donors to commit to skills development in three ways, said the report: by supporting country programmes to ensure all young people can stay in school at least until lower secondary level; by supporting second-chance programmes for young people who missed out on basic literacy and numeracy skills; and by giving disadvantaged youth training to improve their chances of earning a decent wage. Enrolling all people up to lower secondary level would cost $8bn annually, in addition to the $16bn needed to achieve universal basic education by 2015.</p>",
  "<p>\"Just a little bit of charity work\" \u2013 that's how the chairman of a private company described the multi-faceted career of a top, female voluntary sector leader earlier this year. He made the comment to Lynne Berry, who is leading Cass Business School's <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1154843/ftse-boards-reject-female-voluntary-sector-leaders-study-finds/\" title=\"\">research on the lack of female charity sector leaders</a> on the boards of corporates.</p> <p>Berry herself is a five-times voluntary and public sector chief executive, previously holding the top jobs at the <a href=\"http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/GraphicsFolder/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Equal Opportunities Commission </a>and the<a href=\"http://www.newpin.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Family Welfare Association</a>. Along with six other women of similar experience, she is taking part in Cass Business School's research exploring the private sector's attitude to women voluntary sector leaders.</p> <p>\"It wasn't long ago that 'charity' jobs were seen as something that the director's wife did. It wasn't seen as professional. I think some are still in that mindset,\" said Berry, delivering the findings of the first six months of the project this morning.</p> <p>In half a year there's been precious little to get excited about in terms of responses from the private sector. \"The founder of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_250_Index\" title=\"\">FTSE250 </a>company was very interested when we told him about the experience of one of the women. He said she sounded 'fantastic' and 'just what he was looking for', said Berry. But, when he found out she worked in the voluntary sector, he changed his mind, saying: \"not-for-profit, not-for-me\".</p> <p>\"I've heard lots of people say that working in the voluntary sector has caused them to have a 'toxic CV', said Berry, who added that headhunters have told her that they think non-executive director roles are \"too sophisticated, complicated and nuanced\" for those from the voluntary sector.</p> <p>The two-year research project was launched by <a href=\"http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/research-and-faculty/centres/cass-centre-for-charity-effectiveness\" title=\"\">Cass Centre for Charity Effectiveness</a> / Sir John Cass Business School, <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NCVO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Newton Asset Management </a> after the Lord Davies report on private sector boards and gender was released last year.</p> <p>Newton's chief executive, Helena Morrissey, is also founder of the<a href=\"http://www.30percentclub.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> 30% Club </a>- a group of chairs and organisations committed to bringing more women onto UK boards because they say they believe it is good for the overall effectiveness of the business.</p> <p>Lord Davies' report highlighted the slow rate of progress towards gender diversity in FTSE 100 and 250 boardrooms and argued that boards could be strengthened by adding senior women from government, academia and professional entrepreneurial backgrounds.</p> <p>There was no mention of voluntary sector women, which Lord Davies now says was an unintentional oversight. But, the Sir John Cass Business School is eager to highlight the potential of the sector's senior women. \"These women typically bring a wide breadth of knowledge to the table \u2013 charities are leaders in accountability, demonstrating impact, building public trust, motivating staff, stakeholder engagement and the need to produce high quality results to a strict bottom line,\" said Richard Gillingwater \u2013 the school's dean \u2013 earlier this year. \"Often they do this in competitive and international environments.\" But Berry said that in the past six months the women have only had a handful of meetings with private companies between them, and nothing has materialised from these.</p> <p>Careers expert Douglas Board also spoke at the project's six-month breakfast briefing. He runs a careers business and has worked as a headhunter in the voluntary and private sectors. Board said previous claims that there were hundreds of voluntary sector staff waiting to be discovered by private sector boards were wrong.</p> <p>\"But are there 30 or 40? I think so,\" he said. \"Many of the skills picked up at charities are more than relevant to needs of private sector boards. They've worked in the toughest conditions overseas, have \u00a3100m turnovers, they're leading thousands of people in a very ethical environment, they earn public trust, they grapple with government, thrive in a world of uncertain income, and some are trading,\" he said.</p> <p>Board believes there's a \"blind spot in corporate Britain when it comes to seeing the value of charity sector staff\".</p> <p>There was a discussion at the event \u2013 which attracted about 65 people from the corporate and voluntary worlds \u2013 on whether the issue was one of private companies not valuing the skills learned in the charity world, or whether they were concerned that charity staff would scrutinise them too much.</p> <p>There was also a sharp reminder from James Allen, head of public services at NCVO, that the voluntary sector itself hadn't got the issue sorted either. \"Yes, two thirds of voluntary sector staff might be women, but this drops sharply the higher up you get,\" said Allen.</p> <p>In terms of gaps in skills and knowledge discovered in the six months, Berry said the pace of decision making was often much quicker in private companies and that leaders from the voluntary sector had much less experience/ background in finance and law, compared to those in the private sector.</p> <p>She added that there was a general feeling that all of this could be easily developed, and if some mentoring was added in, the women would be more than equipped for private sector board roles.</p> <p>She also said the women realised when looking for such roles that they needed to package their skills and experience in another way and use different vocabulary to explain their impact in terms of the bottom line. She said she wanted to encourage a 'Plus One' campaign so that there is at least one person on every board that has a completely different background from the others.</p> <p>One delegate also suggested that chairmen of FTSE100 companies should be encouraged to mentor women specifically from the voluntary sector. Another said there could be merit in approaching smaller private companies too.</p> <p>Many participants referred to Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of Save The Children International, who is also a non-executive director at BT. According to the panel, she is the only such example of a voluntary sector leader on a corporate board, and she was considered an exception because she worked in the corporate sector at the start of her career. \"Even she was told that her work in the charity sector could seriously affect her ability to get positions in the private sector,\" said Berry.</p> <p><em>Claudia Cahalane is a freelance journalist.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
