  "<p>Mo Farah, the British 10,000m gold medal winner, is expected to be among a clutch of sports figures to attend a world-hunger summit with David Cameron on Sunday.</p> <p>The Downing Street meeting is likely to set a target to reduce the number of children stunted by malnourishment worldwide by as much as 17 million by 2016. Cameron is co-hosting the mini-summit at the Olympics' close with Michel Temer, vice-president of Brazil, where the next Games will take place. The event is designed to show that the Olympic family is aware of the gaping inequalities from which competitors come.</p> <p>David Beckham, a Unicef ambassador, has already been to Downing Street to discuss the plight of the young malnourished.</p> <p>Although it is not a pledge-making summit in terms of donors, the government sees the meeting as a way to provide an international legacy of the Games and send a signal that Cameron wants to make malnourishment a big issue in the lead-up into the British presidency of the G8 next year \u2013 the first time Britain has held the presidency since Tony Blair's ground-breaking aid-pledging G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005.</p> <p>The primary goal is to highlight child malnutrition and its resulting physical stunting as the chief issue where progress is lacking in the development field.</p> <p>A new global target to reduce the number of stunted children by 40%, or 70 million, by 2025 has been agreed by the World Health Assembly.</p> <p>The Cameron meeting is likely to focus on more short-term targets. The event will be attended by officials from the US agriculture department on Friday, who will talk about how the worst drought in 60 years in the US mid-west is pushing up global food prices and increasing hunger in Africa. Wheat prices rose by 19% on international markets in July alone.</p> <p>Farah, who came to Britain from Somalia, has already set up his own aid charity, to help ease the impact of famines in his former country. His attendance on Sunday may depend on his physical state after competing in the 5,000 metres final on Saturday night.</p> <p>Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of the charity Save the Children, said malnutrition is the Achilles heel of development. \"We just cannot stumble from one food emergency to another. It is not just about how much people eat, but also the nutritional value, as well as breast feeding.</p> <p>\"There are techniques to fortify crops, or provide specific products such as fortified biscuits. Cameron should be praised for taking this up. When Britain adopts an issue in the field of aid, the momentum changes. Probably a million lives have been saved since Cameron called the vaccines summit [in June 2011].\"</p> <p>Britain has been a supporter of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement since it began in 2010.</p> <p>The charity Oxfam warned ahead of the summit that rising global food prices could pile more pressure on an overstretched humanitarian system, which is already struggling to cope with food crises in the Sahel region of West Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Yemen.</p> <p>A recent multi-country study showed that for every 10% increase in levels of stunting among children, the proportion of children reaching the final grade of school dropped by almost 8%. One study in Guatemala demonstrated that improving physical growth among children under two resulted in a 46% increase in adult wages when these children grew up.</p> <p>It is estimated 80% of stunted children live in 24 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. More than 45% of children under five years of age are stunted in 18 countries.</p> <p>Forsyth said that while more children survived past their fifth birthday and attended school at the end of the 2000s than a decade before, a rise in acute malnutrition could undermine those unprecedented gains.</p> <p>Dfid claims nutrition-specific initiatives such as high-energy wheat biscuits can only reduce global stunting by a third, the remaining two-thirds will need to be tackled through nutrition-sensitive development. This involves adjusting and redesigning programmes across a range of sectors including agriculture, environmental health and cash transfer programmes to ensure that they deliver nutrition results.</p>",
  "<p>Usain Bolt strolled on to the track, number 2170, cap back to front. He encouraged his younger fellow Jamaicans, chatted to a Locog volunteer, tried out a new wave, crossed himself, and made history.</p> <p>Thursday was Jamaica day in London. The Olympic stadium turned yellow, green and black, as it roared the fastest man on the planet home. Boys and girls Lightning Bolted for all they were worth. Even the worlds's biggest McDonald's, with its great yellow M and black backdrop, looked as if it was flying the flag for Jamaica.</p> <p>The narrative seemed to be predetermined \u2013 Jamaica was competing for gold and silver in the 200m. Yohan Blake, as he had done in the 100m, would be the noble runner-up. The leonine Blake is known as the Beast, and never has there been a more loveable one \u2013 all happy-to-be-here smiles, and cutesy waves. The Jamaicans adore Blake. But not as much as they adore Bolt. Bolt is out on his own \u2013 in every respect; taller than his fellow runners, more popular and faster. If Bob Marley were still around today, even the great reggae god might have to play second fiddle to Bolt.</p> <p>Everybody was swearing allegiance to Usain at the Olympic park. The Abrahams family from Kingston wore Usain flags, T-shirts, face transfers and inflatable arms. Twelve-year-old Adam Abrahams was thinking big. \"I want a Jamaican one, two, three \u2013 Bolt, Blake then Warren Weir for bronze.\" He got his wish. It's not just the Jamaicans who claim Bolt as their own. Since 2008 he has become a one-man supranational. Non-Jamaicans like to think of him as a global citizen, batting for the world. (And, naturally, he is a fine cricketer, too.)</p> <p>Tamara Neish and Temola Rodney were draped in Jamaican flags, despite the blistering heat. \"I don't care who comes first and second, so long as they're Jamaican,\" said 30-year-old Tamara unconvincingly. She paused. \"To be honest I want Usain to take it.\" \"Me too,\" said 29-year-old sister Temola. They said that at any other time in Jamaican history Blake would be the special one. But not now. What was so special about Bolt? \"He's not just a fast runner, he's got personality. He's lovable. Everybody wants to be like him,\" said Temola. \"And it will be fantastic if he could do the double double,\" said Tamara.</p> <p>\"When he says he's the greatest, you know he means it. But he says it with such charm, you think 'OK, fair enough, we'll let you have it'.\" They were amused that so many non-Jamaicans were wearing their flag. \"Well we can't deny our connection to the British. I'm happy for them to claim us. Any love is good love.\"</p> <p>Four-time Olympic gold winner Michael Johnson made an interesting observation when asked if he thought Bolt intimidated his rivals \u2013 the size, his records, his mere presence. No, Johnson said, there is nothing intimidating about him; he talks to everybody, jokes around, high-fives. More importantly, he added, his fellow runners are not intimidated because they do not really regard themselves as being on the same sporting planet \u2013 with the possible exception of Blake, his training partner, who beat him over both 100m and 200m at the Jamaican trials in June when Bolt wasn't fully fit. Yet you couldn't help thinking that even Blake would feel a tiny bit upset if he won .</p> <p>The awe with which he is regarded was apparent when Bolt first walked through the dining hall in the village, and some of the world's greatest athletes queued up for autographs.</p> <p>Bolt defies the laws of pretty much everything. The ideal size for a sprinter is said to be six foot while he is six foot five; he has scoliosis which resulted in one leg being half an inch shorter than the other; he is a slow starter, often tails off at the end to wave to the crowd, and breaks records with his laces undone.</p> <p>Wherever he runs, myths trail in his wake. So we like to believe he doesn't try, that he doesn't train, that he eats a bucket of jerk nuggets and a sack of yams before a race, and that he never worries. All of which is rubbish. Before setting a world record at the junior world championships he was so nervous he put his running shoes on the wrong feet, and he works himself so hard in training he vomits. Yet the myths persist because we want to believe them \u2013 and he rather likes them too. So when he posted photographs on Twitter of him in his room at 3am with three Swedish handball lovelies after his 100m victory earlier this week, it seemed natural. Of course that's how Usain would celebrate victory.</p> <p>At the end, he bolted and danced, prayed and preened, and took photos of the press taking photos of him. The fastest man on the planet had achieved another first \u2013 winning the 100m and 200m in successive Olympics. He knew he had secured his legend status. The Jamaican trio did the slowest lap of honour ever. Blake and Weir, with their silver and bronze, were ecstatic \u2013 and probably relieved not to have stolen the boss's thunder.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>As difficult as it would seem for Ian Poulter to do anything under the radar, the Englishman arrived at Kiawah Island with next to no focus upon him. Given his earlier failure to endorse success on both sides of the Atlantic with a major victory \u2013 when subjected to no shortage of scrutiny \u2013 perhaps that low-key build-up in itself was worthy of note.</p> <p>This is a highly significant weekend for Poulter. His Ryder Cup hopes hang in the balance, with the 36-year-old adamant once again that he will not travel to Glen-eagles for the Johnnie Walker Championship in a fortnight. The US PGA Championship represents Poulter's last attempt to force his way into Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal's plans as an automatic pick.</p> <p>Poulter thrives on pressure situations, and so it has proved so far in South Carolina. An opening round of 70 leaves him in decent shape to make a challenge over the final 54 holes at the Ocean Course. \"This is Thursday, you can't win golf tournaments on a Thursday,\" Poulter said.</p> <p>\"You can only lose them. There are worse positions to be. I obviously just need to go out there and play well tomorrow. I have only played this course twice and I shot two under par so I feel pretty comfortable out there, hitting fairways and hitting greens.\"</p> <p>A round of 14 pars, three birdies and just a single bogey endorsed Poulter's point. His biggest Friday danger may be his afternoon draw amid fears the weather could turn rough at that juncture. In the morning, Poulter played in highly favourable conditions, by his own admission.</p> <p>Olaz\u00e1bal's feelings towards Poulter are unknown but the Spaniard is believed to be impressed by the world No30. Olaz\u00e1bal values Ryder Cup experience and, having seen Poulter up close in the team room during that competition, knows how valuable a team asset he would be. In pure playing terms, Poulter retains a formidable matchplay record.</p> <p>Still, Olazabal has spoken so positively about Sergio Garc\u00eda's probable worth to the European team at Medinah that it is easy to infer only one wildcard selection is still up for grabs. Poulter could clearly take a meaningful step towards claiming that place, or catapult himself into an automatic berth, by building on his Thursday work here.</p> <p>\"That's not on my mind,\" insisted Poulter of the Ryder Cup. \"I am trying to win the Wanamaker Trophy at the minute. If I win that trophy then the next tournament that will be on my mind is the Barclays, FedEx event.</p> <p>\"There are plenty more weeks to play yet before that Ryder Cup. I'm not thinking about it, I need to go out and play this week and things will take care of themselves.</p> <p>\"I'm not in the side right now. As it stands, I would need a pick. I don't want to be a pick, so I am going to do everything I possibly can this week \u2013 my last week \u2013 to make sure I am in automatically.\"</p> <p>Poulter himself dismisses the notion that the absence of a major win thus far leaves his career in a similar position to those of Lee Westwood and Luke Donald.Poulter is self-deprecating when insisting that he lacks the talent of his compatriots, therefore by his logic, failure to achieve victory in a major is less of a big deal. This comes, of course, from the man who once famously claimed: \"I know I haven't played to my full potential and when that happens, it will be just me and Tiger.\"</p> <p>Poulter received undue criticism for that remark, made in 2008. His record of 11 European Tour victories and a single success in the United States proves Poulter has the mental capacity to win under pressure.</p> <p>Further sniping, about Poulter's interest in fast cars and wacky clothing distracting him from on-course ambitions, is also unfair. He has actually scrapped and scraped to make the very most of his golfing talents, as endorsed by five finishes of 10th or better in major championships since 2006.</p> <p>Here, Poulter had reached three under par with six holes of the front nine \u2013 his second half \u2013 to play. There will be a slight irritation that, from there and with supposedly favourable holes to play, he could not edge closer to those right at the top of the leaderboard.</p> <p>\"When I got to three under I wanted to get to four, I didn't get there because of a little error where I missed the green with a five-iron and ended up in a wasteland bunker from which I couldn't get up and down,\" he added.</p> <p>Keeping those mistakes at a premium over the weekend would have a deeper meaning for Poulter. A more high-profile end to the season would await.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\" title=\"\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>, usually an exemplar of self-restraint, lost his temper last week. In a closed-door meeting discussing the military and intelligence chiefs who oppose an air strike against Iran, the Israeli prime minister snapped, \"I'm responsible, and if there's a commission of inquiry later it's on me,\" according to well-orchestrated leaks by his aides.</p> <p>Netanyahu seems to feel a historic \u2013 almost messianic \u2013 calling to stop Iran's nuclear programme. Even if retaliation by Iran and its allies in Hamas and Hezbollah takes the form of a lethal rain of rockets on Israel, he is adamant that a nuclear-armed Iran would be far worse.</p> <p>His latest set of outgoing signals seemed to suggest that an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities may be likely before America's presidential election in November. It is unclear if that is a coincidence, because of assessments that Iranian progress in uranium enrichment and bomb design will have reached a highly dangerous point by then; or maybe it is based on Netanyahu's calculation that President Barack Obama will be more supportive of Israel prior to election day \u2013 and perhaps not at all after he wins or loses on 6 November.</p> <p>Some of Israel's security chiefs, who do not hide their opposition to bombing Iran, say privately that they cannot discern if their PM is bluffing. Netanyahu may be creating the impression that an attack is imminent so as to goad the US into a firm promise to obliterate Iran's nuclear plants. He is certainly sincere in his concern about Iran's radical Islamists, who time and again call for the liquidation of the Jewish state. In this sense Netanyahu walks in the footsteps of Menachem Begin, prime minister from 1977 to 1983, who had a doctrine named after him: the absolute Israeli determination that no other nation in the Middle East will have nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begin_doctrine\" title=\"\">Begin doctrine</a> was successfully implemented twice: by Begin himself in June 1981, when Israel's air force destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor; and in September 2007, when PM Ehud Olmert sent Israeli warplanes to flatten a Syrian nuclear reactor. Olmert's decision was even bolder than Begin's: President George Bush had refused to order an American air raid, but Israel went ahead anyway. And, unlike Iraq, Syria is an immediate neighbour and had thousands of missiles that could hit every conceivable installation in Israel.</p> <p>Netanyahu may well be encouraged by the world's reaction. In 1981, even the pro-Israel president Ronald Reagan denounced the bombing of the Baghdad reactor; but a decade later, during Desert Storm, the US was thanking Israel for having ensured Saddam had no nuclear arms.</p> <p>In 2007 the initial reaction was less harsh, because the air raid on Syria was never acknowledged by the attackers in Jerusalem. But Israeli leaders justifiably feel that the international community might now be grateful to them again. There is concern in the US and Israel that Syria's chemical weapons might fall into the hands of al-Qaida or Hezbollah. Just imagine if the danger now involved what proliferation experts call \"loose nukes\".</p> <p>The unspoken motivation of both attacks was to preserve Israel's nuclear monopoly in the Middle East. While the Israeli arsenal is not confirmed officially, it is taken as a regional fact of life, even as Israel cannot countenance other nations in the region having the same weapons. For reasons both overt and covert, then, it should come as no surprise that Netanyahu may be feeling that a third time \u2013 in Iran \u2013 could be another attractive option. Hopefully it is not too late to prescribe an important dose of caution. Netanyahu and his few cabinet supporters \u2013 with defence minister Ehud Barak lately swinging back and forth between anti- and pro-attack positions \u2013 ought to know that the situation is different from 1981 or 2007.</p> <p>Iran is not Iraq or Syria. The Iranians have drawn lessons from those two events. They dispersed their nuclear facilities and buried them underground, making them more difficult to reach and destroy. Success is thus less assured. Instead of a quick, surgical strike, Israel will likely find itself in a long war of attrition against Iran and Shia Muslims everywhere. In the name of national pride and defending its Islamic revolution, Iran was willing to lose millions of people in a long war against Iraq through the 80s.</p> <p>Above all, perhaps, Israeli leaders must consider that striking Iran could drag the US into a war against its wishes. This would be bad for one of Israel's core survival strategies: the defence and intelligence alliance with America. It would be far wiser for Netanyahu and Barak \u2013 Israel's two prime decision makers \u2013 to focus their efforts on helping the international community \u2013 with America in the lead \u2013 do everything possible to eliminate the Iranian threat. They have to guard against talking themselves into a simple but bloody bilateral conflict that Israelis could well come to regret.</p> <p>Netanyahu has already achieved a lot with his innovative campaign to garner global attention. He can be satisfied his sabre-rattling has persuaded the world that Iran cannot be allowed to procure nuclear weapons. One can understand his fears that the world will let down Israel, a nation that prides itself on taking care of its own defence. Yet the wiser course now would be to tighten the alliance with the US and stand together against a common enemy.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article will open tomorrow (Friday 10 August) morning</p>",
  "<p>George Monbiot (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation\" title=\"\">Putting a price on the rivers and rain diminishes us all</a>, 7 August) is right to say the logic behind valuing ecosystem services is coherent and plausible. If they have no monetary value, their assumed value is zero. If their value is zero, then destroying them is harmless, despoiling them no loss, poisoning them no problem. For half a century, the green movement has urged greater awareness, more conservation, reducing our footprint on nature. Yet despite some limited successes, this approach has failed overall. Our demands on the natural environment are rising, not falling.</p> <p>Valuing natural capital requires us to train accountants to value every tiny, implausible detail of the biosphere around us. Will it work? Who knows? But so far nothing else has. We pay museums and galleries to act as stewards of our heritage assets. Who do we pay to look after our natural assets? If the answer is \"nobody\", what result would we expect?</p> <p>Valuing assets is one thing, but trading them is another. Monbiot's concerns about the prospect of a \"market\" in ecosystem services are well-founded. There is little doubt that if this government could find a way of doing it, it would but as Monbiot points out, it is almost impossible to do. Despite the risk of some bizarre kind of market emerging, valuing natural capital is still the right thing to do.<br><strong>Alastair McCapra</strong><br><em>Chief executive, </em><a href=\"http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Landscape Institute</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Monbiot does well to compare the monetisation of ecosystem services to the enclosures of common land. What price the biosphere? Before we rush to financialise ecosystem services, or to counter this tendency with cries of horror about corporate greed, why not acknowledge that we don't yet know how ecosystem services \u2013 or biodiversity \u2013 actually work? Ecosystems have functional values in dimensions that science can measure. Surely the first thing to do is to demonstrate the dependence of all terrestrial life on ecosystems in a practical, measurable way that everyone&#xa0;can understand. It should then be obvious that humanity has a special responsibility in respect of the biosphere which cannot possibly be discharged by selling chunks of it to anyone.<br><strong>Michael Dunwell</strong><br><em>Staunton, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is making a big mistake in arguing for a market-free world. Demand for access to fragile areas for tourism and extraction of resources, combined with scarcity, creates a market whether he likes it or not. The issue is whether it is shaped in a rational way and how it is regulated. The creation of incentives to invest in the conservation of biodiversity creates the possibility of a win for communities (investment in eco-tourism and its community infrastructure), for nature (price denotes real value creating a disincentive to destroy), and for investors (income from bonds over time). Those following the mythical path, denying the reality of market mechanisms, create obstacles to sustainable conservation.<br><strong>Jeremy Ross</strong><br><em>Ashtead, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 When land is taken into private ownership, in effect duty-free land enclosure, the landowner levies a charge on all that that land produces. This means all who do not have free access to land but need to use it for whatever work they undertake have a portion of the fruits of their labour paid to someone who does not work. Monbiot reveals that the UK has a natural capital committee,&#xa0;an ecosystem markets task force which proposes to pay landowners, \"the providers of ecosystems\", for their services, either by the government or by \"users\". This would further increase&#xa0;the&#xa0;cost to society of almost everything,&#xa0;as most of our land is&#xa0;privately owned.</p> <p>As the value of the land is determined by the community, why not tax the landowners for the use of it \u2013 land value taxation. This would resolve many&#xa0;problems, particularly speculation by those holding land in disuse to&#xa0;increase its value. This would encourage them to either use the land more profitably, or make it available for others&#xa0;to do so.<br><strong>Mary Law</strong><br><em>St Albans, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot flits from being a hard-headed pragmatic green \u2013 pro-nuclear power \u2013 to dreamy romantic all too readily. His opposition to \"pricing nature\" seems very principled, the principle being of course that one day capitalism is going to up sticks and walk away. I disagree with him wholeheartedly, since capitalism seems perfectly capable of withstanding even the shocks it creates for itself. This must partly be explained by its readiness to exploit human or natural resources at less than their actual value. The greatest challenge \"greening\" society faces is to make us pay the actual value of what it is we consume, and if that means pricing rivers, so be it.</p> <p>But long before that we will perhaps develop an effective system of paying for the embedded carbon in our goods, the exploitation of child labour, the true cost of our waste and even for the legacy of our current tenancy of this planet. The task is to \"commonise\" the commons, and make us all pay our fair share for our use of it. If we did that, such abominations as the Alberta tar sands, as much a part of \"nature\" as a pretty stream, would be less attractive to the money grubbers.<br><strong>Colin Challen</strong><br><em>Scarborough, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Anyone worried about George Monbiot's article on commodification of nature may like to read Antonio Tricario's piece about the global nature of financialisation or privatisation of common resources, in Red Pepper this month. And if you thought the free marketeers had learned a lesson from the financial crash of 2008, they are voracious in seeking new ways of making money. In other words they know the price of everything and value of nothing. It is sad that this began in Britain under Labour, but Nick Clegg perpetuated government policy when he addressed the Natural Capital summit in Rio in June advocating natural capital accounting. If you put a price tag on nature, you create a market.<br><strong>Dr Graham Ullathorne</strong><br><em>Chesterfield, Derbyshire</em></p>",
  "<p>The Marine Conservation Society was disappointed to read the misguided piece of writing by Tanya Gold (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/plastic-bag-conspiracy-deadly-distraction?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">This carrier bag conspiracy is a truly deadly distraction</a>, 4 August). We would have thought any scheme that has the support of 70% of the population and has seen carrier bag use drop by 90% would be worth celebrating, not sneering at.</p> <p>This campaign is not a \"feel good\" effort by environmentalists. Cutting litter and waste is a complex problem and often involves tackling the waste stream bit by bit. These small efforts will, and do, add up to make a difference, even if not in a spectacular \"cure all at once\" event.</p> <p>As the majority of governments, the public and retailers agree that a levy is the best way to tackle this issue, we are at a loss to understand this rant against a popular and effective scheme. Just because Ms Gold feels no guilt as she shoves yet another item she doesn't need into yet another plastic bag she doesn't want, it doesn't mean the rest of the population doesn't care. <br><strong>Dr Sue Kinsey </strong><br><em>Pollution policy officer, </em><a href=\"http://www.mcsuk.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Marine Conservation Society</em></a></p> <p>\u2022\u2008I was surprised to see Tanya Gold labelling the people of Ireland and Wales as useless. While it is true we must do much more if we are to tackle the many environmental problems we face, deriding the advances we do make will ultimately discourage any personal action to address the issues. She might want to give the matter a little more thought before rubbishing a scheme that is proven to work and has the support of many people, including retailers.<br><strong>Samantha Harding</strong><br><em>Campaign manager, Campaign to Protect Rural England</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Tanya Gold is right to point out the relative insignificance of plastic bags as a form of pollution, compared with the inflated feeling of doing something it gives to the smug using designer reusable ones. But she does not draw the right conclusion. The environment is a common property and can only be protected if we elect a common authority to put into practice the measures needed to protect it.</p> <p>The carrier bag experience is the perfect example of this. Nowhere has a major fall in use been achieved by exhortations to individual action; everywhere governments have chosen to act, it has proved easy and sensationally effective. It has also been very popular.</p> <p>The public understand that some things cannot be done without governments. Tanya should be trumpeting this point.</p> <p>It's true for most, perhaps all, environmental measures, up to the big one, population growth.

Still smarting from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/10/house-of-lords-reform-halted\" title=\"\">House of Lords reform</a> debacle, Nick Clegg faces both in equal measure.</p> <p>The increasingly strained relationship with the Conservatives provides him with room for manoeuvre, perhaps more than he realises. For the first time, the Liberal Democrats can operate in the way they should always have done \u2013 as an independent party that has chosen to ally itself with another to run the country for a specific period. They need make no more claims than this. They need to keep their options open and to be seen to be doing so.</p> <p>Clegg trades on the fact that he is the first peacetime Liberal in a century to preside over government. That is no mean feat and, by the nature of coalition, requires compromise. The public appears to appreciate, better than the Westminster village, that give and take is a sign of a mature political system.</p> <p>His problem, however, has not been the fact of compromise, but its nature. Most of the cases that he can demonstrate are negative ones. The Lib Dems have played a vital role in making Tory legislation less extreme, less red meat. The health reforms could have been worse; Europe policy would have been more barking; welfare changes would have hurt the vulnerable even more.</p> <p>The same would have applied had a post-2010 Lib-Lab coalition been formed. Labour is showing every sign of tacking to the right on criminal justice and civil liberties, continuing a miserable tradition established under the Blair and Brown administrations. What galvanises the troops, however, is positive change. <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">The Protection of Freedoms Act</a>, which received royal assent in May, was a small but important step forward in limiting the authorities' use of individual data. This is in danger of being more than offset by the hideous \"snoopers' charter\" and plans to introduce secret courts for intelligence-related criminal cases, such as the use of torture.</p> <p>The pupils' premium and the raising of the income tax threshold are the most visible Lib Dem contributions so far. They need to be developed more in policy terms and trumpeted more as achievements. But these two parts are less significant than the bigger picture \u2013 a more coherent vision for social justice and social mobility. Clegg has dipped in and out of this agenda. He should stick with it.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have shown an internal discipline that the other parties would not have done had they been in a similar position. (Remember the Maastricht rebels; remember the Blair-Brown hatreds.) Their restraint is, in one respect, admirable. Taken too far, though, it can also suggest an unhealthy ability to cling on to baubles that accompany political power. Compromise is good as long as comfort does not dull the senses or quell the anger that is the lifeblood of radical politics.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have been far too bashful. Largely untainted by the bankers' scandals, they could and should be leading the way on radical reform. The proposals in the Vickers report were a step in the right direction, but they are far too mild and slow to take effect, reinforcing the legitimate view that all governments \u2013 Labour and Conservative \u2013 are subservient to the wealthy. This is an area that Clegg should have been crawling all over from the start. The brief flurry of collectivist-voluntary endeavour from the Olympics \u2013 coinciding with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/09/standard-chartered-iran-sanctions\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered </a>becoming the latest bank to face allegations of dodgy dealing \u2013 should be used to reinforce that message.</p> <p>Another area where he should be making more noise is the environment. The Tories' attempts to limit the growth of renewable energies should be resisted more noisily.</p> <p>Ultimately, it comes down to who needs whom most. It is conventional wisdom that the Lib Dems are clinging on because the collapse of the coalition would lead to electoral annihilation. With the shelving of boundary changes, their task becomes marginally less difficult. But who will blink first?</p> <p>Driven by a born-to-rule mentality, many Conservative MPs feel insulted by the fact that David Cameron failed to win the 2010 general election and that, as a result of their party's poor performance, they have had to work with others. Yet, unless their fortunes improve markedly (and with the economy flatlining, there is no prospect of that for the next year or two), they have nowhere else to go.</p> <p>They could take the ultimate risk and go to the polls before 2015, but they would run the risk of leaving office as quickly as they assumed it. They could try minority administration, but the stuttering and haggling would be even more frustrating. So they are stuck; and Clegg, ever so politely, should use every opportunity to remind Cameron of this unpalatable truth.</p> <p>The forthcoming party conference season marks the halfway point in the cycle of this coalition government. This period, which is also likely to include a cabinet reshuffle, is a moment for Clegg to change gear. He should treat both rival parties with equal distance and courtesy. He governs with the Tories but should start preparing for life after 2015 \u2013 with either of them.</p> <p>The less tribal among Ed Miliband's team are already thinking these thoughts, which is a considerable improvement on Labour's arrogance in 2010. Some, however, are talking about a deal only if Vince Cable is in charge. Labour strategists should be reminded they will not be in a position to choose another party's leader.</p> <p>The prospect of a rapprochement between Labour and Liberals is causing consternation among Tories, as Tim Montgomerie wrote this week on <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/08/public-blame-the-conservatives-for-breaking-coalition-agreement.html\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a>: \"We have to win outright next time or we're likely to be out of power.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dems have taken the blows, over tuition fees and more. They have lost the opportunity to modernise our moribund constitution. They have kept stumm for the sake of stability, and been accused by the left of treachery and by the right of petulance. Clegg has two and a half years to put a strongly liberal stamp on government as it seeks a path out of the economic mire.</p> <p>That is a desperately tall order but, as the past two weeks have shown, success comes to those who show muscle and no little guile.</p>",
  "<p>The last time Great Britain's men's hockey team reached an Olympic final they came away with a gold medal, having soundly beaten Germany 3-1. For a brief moment the team who put their 9 to 5 jobs on hold to compete in Seoul became superstars, their win celebrated by British sports fans anxious for any medal success to improve on the meager tally of four golds.</p> <p>The match also gave us a memorable, and unexpected, gem from the commentary box, when the BBC's Barry Davies' impeccable impartially slipped for once. On witnessing GB winger, Imran Sherwani, scoring an emphatic third gold, Davies uttered the immortal line: \"Where, oh, where were the Germans? And frankly, who cares?\" </p> <p>Later that year, the team were further rewarded as the British public voted them as BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year.</p> <p>In the Guardian's match report, GB' s win over Germany was described as a 'heart-warming success'. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394483668\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344535494919/hockey(report1).jpg\" alt=\"match report\" width=\"505\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Published in the Guardian 3/10/1988.

  "<p>In a story that could have been minted in Holywood, Ireland's very own \"Million Dollar Baby\", Katie Taylor, put a smile back on a country more used these days to the doom and gloom of the recession.</p> <p>Minutes after the judges in London awarded the gold medal to the 26-year-old pioneer of female boxing at the Olympics, Ronan Donahue from Athlone in the Irish Midlands summed up the nation's relief and euphoria.</p> <p>\"It's absolutely brilliant for the country,\" Donahue said, struggling to be heard among the cheering and whooping of up to 10,000 people on the playing fields of Bray's Shoreline leisure centre.</p> <p>\"It will cheer people up. It's what we needed because of the recession. It's a few moments of happiness. That's all we have but still it's great.\"</p> <p>The 18-year-old took the day off work to travel to Ireland's east coast and watch the match, shown live on giant television screens in Taylor's home town.</p> <p>Amid the throng of green, white and gold was his friend Shay Lennon, also from Athlone.</p> <p>\"It's the best atmosphere ever and there will be some party tonight. Can you believe it? Ireland has gold medals! How are ya Ireland!\" Lennon yelled.</p> <p>Standing near a woman punching the air repeatedly with a pair of giant green plastic boxing gloves was a former schoolmate of Taylor's. Shane Thompson attended Sallynoggin community college in County Wicklow a year below Taylor. Throughout the four rounds of the bout he screamed himself hoarse barking out encouragement to her.</p> <p>Thompson, from nearby Greystones, said: \"She was always well known at school and even played for our women's football team. She was actually a quality player even while she was boxing early on. You could tell she was determined even back in school with her sport. Everyone is buzzing, everyone. Especially those of us from Wicklow are so proud.\"</p> <p>Half of the 60 boxers who train at Taylor's gym overlooking Bray harbour and the Irish Sea are women. After her triumph in London more Irish women will be inspired to get into the ring.</p> <p>Sarah Collins, 17, who travelled down from Dublin with a party of friends to watch the fight in Taylor's backyard, said: \"Yeah, I might take up boxing yet if only to get fit or maybe even to be in the next Olympics. Everybody is so proud of Katie. She has really lifted our country.\"</p> <p>Prior to the final, Bray town council provided free shuttle buses from the town's rail station and its commercial centre to ferry thousands into the grounds of a multi-sports complex under the shadow of the Wicklow mountains.</p> <p>The euphoric atmosphere before, during and after the historic bout resembled that of the Italia '90 and USA '94 World Cups when the whole of Ireland celebrated the underdog exploits of Jack Charlton's men in green.</p> <p>Every shop window in the town displayed one of the official Taylor posters produced by the local council.</p> <p>Taylor's progress from a 15-year-old fighting novice to Olympic champion has been compared to the plot of the Oscar-winning Million Dollar Baby \u2013 Clint Eastwood's film about a fictional female pugilist's rise to fame and fortune.</p> <p>The PR man Max Clifford has seen in Taylor the potential for global celebrity, even after she hangs up her gloves. He told a Dublin newspaper that Taylor \"could make a million a year\" once she steps out of the ring for good.</p> <p>Before stepping into any ring at the London Games, Taylor had to fight around the world to have female boxing included in the 2012 Olympics. Her struggle did not involve upper cuts or jabs but rather quiet diplomacy as she toured the world convincing boxing authorities to allow women to fight at the Games.</p> <p>The Amateur International Boxing Association president, Ching-Kuo Wu, agreed with her. Paying the ultimate compliment, Wu added that without Taylor women would not be boxing in this summer's Olympics.</p> <p>She has turned out to be one of the most famous faces of the Games after Team GB's champions, Mark Phelps and Usain Bolt.</p> <p>Just prior to the bout beginning, the centre of Bray suffered a power cut, forcing the organisers of the Shoreline event to switch to emergency generators in order that the pictures were beamed back from London. The power reserve in the park near the Taylor home worked effortlessly \u2013 in much the same way as Ireland's new sporting hero had fought her way to Olympic glory.</p>",
  "<p>Where you find a company's name can be telling. Samsung was once ubiquitous on rather battered airport trolleys. Now it is found on Chelsea shirts and plastered all over the Olympics.</p> <p>The English translation of Samsung \u2013 three stars \u2013 once inadvertently summed up the Korean company's microwaves and televisions, which were viewed as a cheap alternative to Sony. These days, Samsung is the world's biggest technology company by sales, selling more flatscreen TVs than anyone else and trouncing Apple in smartphones. And it is not just a question of quantity; increasingly gadget fiends are tossing away their iPhone 4S to drool over the new Samsung Galaxy S3.</p> <p>The rapid rise of South Korea's largest company has placed this secretive behemoth at a crossroads. When its phones are promoted in the Olympic opening ceremony there is bound to be growing scrutiny of the way it organises itself, and where it goes next.</p> <p>Samsung is famed in business circles as a \"fast follower\" \u2013 letting others innovate before flooding the market with excellently-made, rather imitative products. Now it is the market leader, there is no one left to follow. And fast following can cause trouble: Samsung is locked in a vicious patents dispute with Apple in courtrooms around the world.</p> <p>Samsung is South Korea's biggest <em>chaebol</em>, a traditional, family-run conglomerate with a dizzying array of almost 100 subsidiaries. Samsung Electronics is its flagship but Samsung also makes ships, weapons, sells insurance and even runs Everland, a Korean amusement park.</p> <p>The company's rise has mirrored that of South Korea, which was poorer than Ghana 50 years ago. Samsung began making noodles and selling dried seafood in 1938 before founder, Lee Byung-chull, moved into sugar, textiles and, in 1969, electronics. Lee Kun-hee, the 70-year-old son of Samsung's founder, has been its visionary, controversial \"emperor\", as Professor Sea Jin Chang, author of Sony vs Samsung, puts it, for 25 years. In the early 90s, Lee, an amateur wrestler, famously pronounced that Samsung was second-rate and employees should \"change everything except your wife and children\". He once made a bonfire of 150,000 of his own company's mobile phones and, two years ago, tweeted: \"It's a real crisis now ... Most of Samsung's flagship businesses and products will become obsolete within 10 years. We must begin anew.\"</p> <p>Driven by such crisis-laden rhetoric, \"the real strength of Samsung is its speed,\" says Chang. \"Korean people eat fast, talk fast and walk like crazy. It's the spirit of the Korean people and Samsung is the best example of their competitive nature.\" Samsung has always moved fast. Two months after it built its first black-and-white TV in 1970, it was exporting them to Panama. \"For Koreans, being number one, getting the gold medal is the thing,\" says Tony Michell, author of Samsung Electronics and the Struggle for Leadership of the Electronics Industry.</p> <p>\"Samsung is an also-ran in the global smartphone market,\" observed the Economist 18 months ago. Now, Samsung is the market leader, selling around 50m smartphones in the second quarter of 2012 to Apple's 26m. While there is one basic iPhone, Samsung offers smartphones at every conceivable price.</p> <p>\"They've got the entire market covered,\" says Jason Jenkins, editor of CNET UK. Samsung's latest high-end phone, the Galaxy S3, \"is the hottest phone on CNET by a long way\" judges Jenkins. \"What Samsung has proven over the last five years is that they are very conscious about what consumers want and very quick to manoeuvre to serve those consumers,\" says Stuart Miles, founder of gadget reviewers Pocket Lint.</p> <p>To describe Samsung as speedy, militaristic and secretive might appear a stereotypically western judgment but it is the view of Chang, a South Korean. He says Samsung's ability to get good products to market quickly is because it is a \"militaristic organisation, very disciplined, [with] top-down management\", shaped by the fact that Koreans undertake military service. Staff are loyal, highly disciplined and work long hours: it is unusual for staff in research and development, for instance, to take more than one Sunday off each month.</p> <p>South Korea has a \"love hate\" relationship with Samsung, according to Chang. \"We are proud of Samsung because they are very successful and we're grateful for that but at the same time there are internal problems.\" Even the country's right-wing party has taken up chaebol-bashing in the run-up to elections in South Korea. Some critics argue chaebols stifle innovation and strangle small suppliers. Others question issues of tax, accountability and succession. In 2008 a Seoul court found Lee guilty of financial irregularities including tax evasion. He was fined $109m (\u00a369.8m) and given a three-year suspended sentence. Resigning as chairman of Samsung, Lee returned in 2010 after he was pardoned by the South Korean government.</p> <p>The Lee family only own about 1% of the entire group's shares and yet control Samsung through a bewildering array of holding companies. Lee's family are squabbling in court over the succession question with Jay Y. Lee, the Harvard Business School-educated son of Lee Kun-hee, now the clear \u2013 albeit unproven \u2013 successor. \"There's a legitimacy question,\" says Chang. \"The same legitimacy question that you may have for Kim Jong-un in North Korea.\" Chang also points to the tax arrangements which appear to have allowed \"JY\" to acquire huge wealth while partly avoiding the country's stiff inheritance tax.</p> <p>Samsung is facing increased scrutiny over workers' rights and working conditions. Traditionally, no Samsung employees were members of South Korea's fairly assertive unions although by law Samsung has an employee-management council, and there is now a Samsung union. Meanwhile, China Labour Watch this week claimed it discovered evidence of child labour at HEG Electronics, a Chinese supplier to Samsung and other companies including LG. Samsung said it was dispatching inspectors again to investigate the allegations.</p> <p>Samsung is more innovative than popular perceptions hold. Around a quarter of its 220,000 employees work in research and development and It holds a huge number of patents, not so much for products such as phones but for processes \u2013 clever production techniques. Apple's lawyers, however, think Samsung's smartphone success has come by \"slavishly\" copying its iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>Horace Dediu, founder of analysts Asymco, worked as a competition analyst for Nokia during its heyday in the early 2000s. \"Samsung was always on our radar. They made no secret of their intention to become more powerful than Nokia,\" he says. According to Dediu, Samsung went from \"fast following\" Nokia to \"fast following\" Apple.</p> <p>This analysis is reinforced by a Samsung memo produced by Apple in a Californian courtroom this week. \"Influential figures outside the company come across the iPhone and they point out that 'Samsung is dozing off,'\" wrote JK Shin, head of Samsung's mobile communications shortly after the 2007 launch of the iPhone. \"When our UX is compared to the unexpected competitor Apple's iPhone, the difference is truly that of heaven and Earth. It's a crisis of design.\"</p> <p>Consumers may not care about such skirmishes but the case could actually damage Apple, thinks Michell, because many people \"were never really aware that Samsung was even in the same league. All the court cases are actually saying, 'well, they are very similar'\". They certainly look it these days but so do cars and televisions. As Jenkins puts it: \"Personally I don't feel that companies can copyright a touch-screen rectangle.\"</p> <p>What is more intriguing is the interdependence of these patent pugilists. Samsung also makes components \u2014 semiconductor devices such as LEDs, microchips, computer memory and flash memory for phones and tablets. In fact, Samsung is the sole manufacturer of crucial chips used in iPhones and iPads. Apple is Samsung's biggest customer and accounts for 8.8% of Samsung's revenue, according to analysis by Bloomberg. If Apple stopped buying Samsung parts, Samsung's profits would dive. Then again, Apple would struggle to find a supplier as reliable as Samsung.</p> <p>Another damning court revelation was when British judge Colin Birss ruled that Samsung could not have copied Apple because it was \"not as cool\".</p> <p>Samsung has attracted many fans among Apple-haters (some geeks are fascinatingly tribal about brands) but the consensus is still that Samsung is not as cool as Apple. \"It can't be because they make so many things,\" says Jenkins. He is mystified by Samsung's desire to dominate every unfashionable electronics sector. \"Why are Samsung killing themselves to flog hard drives or MP3 players? Why not just admit Apple won that battle years ago?\"</p> <p>Samsung has strived to become cooler by spending heavily to be a \"top\" Olympic sponsor alongside legendary brands such as Coca-Cola and McDonalds.</p> <p>\"Most of us had never heard of Samsung before their Olympics sponsorship, but now we can't imagine a world without them,\" says John Davis, author of The Olympic Games Effect. Samsung became a top sponsor in 1997 and its brand value increased from US$3.1bn two years later to $23.4bn in 2011, according to Interbrand. Its presence at London 2012 \u2013 also opening a flagship, Apple-style store in Westfield Stratford \u2013 shows its desire not merely to be known, but to be desired. Davis judges Samsung will emerge a clear winner from the Games \"if you define winner as having visible and memorable advertising and products that generate 'buzz'\".</p> <p>Samsung dominates smartphones but for how long? The marketplace is littered struggling former giants such as Nokia and BlackBerry's RIM. \"It won't be Apple or the litigation that brings Samsung down,\" says Dediu. \"It will be some unknown Chinese OEM [original equipment manufacturer]. That's going to be the story of the next few years.\"</p> <p>Samsung's basic phones will be trumped by cheap Chinese brands; at the top end, Samsung depends on Google for the Android operating system so beloved of phone geeks. \"If Google doesn't match Apple, Samsung will get caught in a trap,\" says Dediu. Samsung might also flounder if Google makes a superior version of Android for its own handset company, Motorola.</p> <p>Dediu predicts a near future where all hardware is \"good enough\" and big profits will only be made from software and services \u2014 music services, cloud hosting, voice recognition, apps. Jenkins agrees. \"Whoever controls the gateway to these services will own the next decade,\" he says.</p> <p>Samsung may excel at making phones but Dediu is not impressed by its approach to software. \"There is no buzz, not even rumour of Samsung having a presence in any software services area. Normally you'd see some acquisitions or an office built in the Valley,\" he says. Stuart Miles of Pocket Lint sees the S3 as evidence Samsung are trying to understand how software works but Jenkins is not hugely impressed. Samsung's services \"have stupid names and don't work very well,\" he says.</p> <p>Samsung is looking beyond the world of phones, however. Traditionally, Korean chaebols have been reluctant to move into new areas by purchasing smaller companies \"but somewhere in the DNA of Samsung there is a more acquisitive mentality,\" says Michell. Samsung is investing $21bn up to 2020 in five areas \u2013 solar panels, LEDs for lighting, electric car batteries, medical equipment and biotech drugs \u2013 in what appears an astute repositioning in an era of ageing populations and renewable energy challenges. Its initial success is mixed, according to Michell, with only medical technology an unqualified success. Like others in Seoul, however, he believes the threat from China is overstated. \"The Chinese have a long learning curve in product quality and the ability to produce a million items without defects,\" he says.</p> <p>Samsung may be emblazoned over our products and sports for some years yet.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's oldest shipping company has sunk into liquidation after 282 years of trading \u2013 the latest victim of a global slowdown in the movement of \"dry\" bulk goods such as grain and iron ore.</p> <p>Stephenson Clarke, which was established in 1730 to carry coal from Durham to London, had earlier sold ships to cut costs in the face of plummeting world freight rates.</p> <p>\"Whilst previous economic downturns have been weathered, the current market is one of the worst experienced for many years with no upturn forecast for at least 12 to 18 months,\" said a company spokesman.</p> <p>But industry experts said Stephenson Clarke sowed some of the seeds of its own demise by investing late in new tonnage to take advantage of China's industrialisation programme which had spawned the biggest boom in shipping history.</p> <p>The new vessels arrived just as China's boom slowed down and a liquidator, Tait Walker, was appointed earlier this month to handle the problems at the shipowner.</p> <p>Richard Fulford Smith, a director of the shipbroker Platou in London, said the demise of Stephenson Clarke was a sad day for a once proud ship-owning nation. He pointed out that the more glittering names of the domestic industry such as Cunard and P&amp;O had been saved only by foreign ownership.</p> <p>But it is not only smaller companies such as Stephenson Clark that have had financial problems as a result of the slowdown in the industry. John Fredriksen, regarded as the world's leading independent shipowner, recently had to pump $500m of his own fortune into his Frontline tanker company to keep it afloat.</p> <p>But the Norwegian has since unveiled controversial plans to start buying at a time when shipbuilders are desperate for orders. Fulford Smith said in a perfect world Stephenson Clarke would be doing the same.</p>",
  "<p>By most accounts, the United Nations Rio+20 summit in Brazil was a failure. Having been there, as government leaders quibbled over where to place commas in the negotiating text, I can say this is not entirely true. While global political action generally fell far short of what is needed, individual entities \u2013 companies, the private sector, and NGOs \u2013 stepped in with visionary pledges that salvaged the summit.</p> <p>Case in point: the US government and 20 of the world's largest companies in the <a href=\"http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/\" title=\"\">Consumer Goods Forum</a> (CGF), which together represent more than a trillion dollars in sales, announced a partnership to eliminate deforestation from supply chains by 2020, starting with palm oil, soy, paper and beef. This is a game changer. Production of these four commodities in four countries alone causes 50% of all deforestation globally and contributes to the destruction of some of the world's most biodiverse regions, home to threatened species like tigers, orangutans and elephants.</p> <p>This is why I'm such a supporter of strategic partnerships and in particular of corporate actions to reduce the impacts of production. I have been working with the CGF for two years, first to encourage them to develop their deforestation commitment, later to help them refine their strategy, and now to help create the conditions on the ground that will let them see it through. To achieve this commitment, four key sets of activities will encourage and enable actors along the supply chain to scale up food and fibre production in ways that conserve global biodiversity.</p> <p>First, large companies such as Unilever, Coca-Cola and Walmart must use their market demand to stimulate the supply of sustainable products, and their influence to encourage other retailers and brands to do the same. In particular, their producers will need to become certified through credible global sustainability standards to ensure that there is enough product worldwide to meet the CGF commitment.</p> <p>Second, the CGF and others must drive agricultural productivity using technology and innovation to improve efficiency so that we can produce more with less \u2013 less land, water, fewer inputs and zero habitat loss.</p> <p>Third, to avoid deforestation in their supply chains, the CGF should encourage the rehabilitation of degraded and underperforming land to produce new crops, stemming the conversion of natural habitat.</p> <p>And finally, while it is important to take deforestation out of supply chains, it is equally important to find ways to bring carbon in, that is, to encourage producers to reduce and avoid GHG emissions as well as sequester carbon. If developed in a responsible way, this approach could offer a host of benefits by making food production more sustainable, marginal lands more viable, and producers more financially secure.</p> <p>The next step is a meeting this fall in Washington DC where leaders from CGF companies, representatives of the US and other governments and leaders from NGOs will work together to identify a series of practical actions to achieve the deforestation commitment. If they succeed, these companies can effectively create an estimated \u00a316m market for more sustainable purchases for these four commodities alone. This is true market transformation.</p> <p>Paul Polman, the CEO of Unilever, said it best in Rio: \"Individually both governments and business have already mobilised significant resources to address the challenge of deforestation, but we all recognise that much more can be achieved if we align our efforts and work in partnership.\" This is the kind of thinking we need if we're going to conserve the planet we all depend on for food, life, and inspiration.</p> <p>But none of this can happen without co-operation, with each sector of society working together, in a pre-competitive manner. To some this is seen as unattainable, pie-in-the-sky thinking. But the CGF commitment and the actions to date prove that major corporate players are prepared to work together and put aside their competitive difference to confront shared challenges. Now we need to make this the new normal.</p> <p><em>Jason Clay is </em><a href=\"https://support.wwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>WWF</em></a><em>'s senior vice-president of market transformation</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The international community has been urged to act quickly to curb cyber espionage after security researchers discovered the latest state-sponsored attack targeting financial systems in Lebanon.</p> <p>Thousands of people in the Middle East were targeted by the latest cyber snooping assault, named Gauss, according to the security experts Kaspersky Lab.</p> <p>Researchers said they believed Gauss was state sponsored and developed by the same group behind the sophisticated Flame and Stuxnet attacks, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities. No government has ever admitted to being behind Stuxnet or Flame, described as the most complex cyber attacks ever known, although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/obama-sped-up-cyberattack-iran\" title=\"\">the US and Israel have been widely reported as principal players in their development</a>.</p> <p>Vitaly Kalmuk, the chief malware officer at Kaspersy Lab, urged the United Nations to wake up to the threats \"because disaster may happen any day\".</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"We still think there is a lack of attention and lack of response in the area of nation-state supported development of malware.</p> <p>\"We think it should become a global problem and it should be discussed on an international level, probably in the United Nations, and there should be treaties. But that is not happening now. There is not enough changes.\"</p> <p>The latest cyber threat was designed to steal passwords and sensitive data from several Lebanese banks, according to the researchers.</p> <p>The discovery is the latest in a string of cyber espionage assaults targeting victims in the Middle East since early 2009.</p> <p>Gauss began in September 2011 and was shut down shortly after being discovered in June this year. It is believed to have infected more than 2,500 machines since May 2012, with tens of thousands of estimated victims.</p> <p>Researchers said the one-year-old virus mainly targeted banks including Bank of Beirut, EBLF, BlomBank, ByblosBank, FransaBank and Credit Libanais.</p> <p>It is not believed that the hackers stole money from the bank accounts, but were primarily interested in tracking and monitoring payments.</p> <p>Kamluk said the hackers' servers were initially based in the US, before moving to Portugal and then to India. It was apparently named by hackers after the famous mathematician, Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss.</p> <p>Kaspersky Lab said it was not yet clear exactly how Gauss managed to infect and steal data from computers.</p> <p>Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at Kaspersky Lab, said: \"Gauss bears a striking resemblance to Flame, with its design and code base, which enabled us to discover the malicious program.</p> <p>\"Similar to Flame and Duqu, Gauss is a complex cyber-espionage toolkit, with its design emphasising stealth and secrecy; however, its purpose was different than Flame or Duqu. Gauss targets multiple users in select countries to steal large amounts of data, with a specific focus on banking and financial information.\"</p>",
  "<p>Researchers from Michigan State University in the US have found nearly as many as <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57487619-10391704/parents-publicly-spank-their-kids-in-surprising-numbers-researchers/\" title=\"\">one in four parents or caregivers slap their children in public</a>. Or, to use the academic term, the children are at the receiving end of what their study calls \"negative touch\" \u2013 anything from arm-pulling to pinching. Lead researcher Dr Kathy Stansbury wrote: \"I was very surprised to see what many people consider a socially undesirable behaviour done by nearly a quarter of the caregivers.\"</p> <p>The first part of Stansbury's statement made me pause. Is smacking really a \"socially undesirable behaviour\"? I was reminded of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/science/08tier.html\" title=\"\">psychologist Jonathan Haidt</a>'s argument that there is a liberal bias in academics, especially in the social sciences. So I asked the question on social media. All but one respondent replied with a \"yes, it's undesirable\", with some stretching to \"undesirable and (it should be) criminal\". Hmm. Perhaps I was the one out of touch here.</p> <p>I was also surprised at the percentage of caregivers who operated with a \"negative touch\" policy \u2013 I'd have expected it to be considerably higher. Full disclosure: I was smacked as a child. At home, I had taps on the backs of my legs, rulers on the flat of my hands and \u2013 a couple of memorable times \u2013 the tongue of a belt on the palm.</p> <p>This form of discipline had pretty much ceased by the time I was about 10, but then I went to secondary school. Corporal punishment was normal and sanctioned by the school system (as it had been in most Nigerian primary schools), and I felt the sting of more than a few canes across my backside over the years. I can barely remember the \"crimes\" committed, or the actual caning encounters, but at the time I must have cried like a baby and raged like a movie super villain.</p> <p>There's a Yoruba saying: \"<em>Aya omode ni were di si, egba la o fi tu</em>\", which roughly translates as \"the madness which resides in the chest of a child can be undone with a cane\". Interestingly, the Michigan State study found that \"kids disciplined with positive touch were more likely to comply more often and more quickly with less fussing\".</p> <p>As an adult, I have made a conscious decision that if and when I have children, I will not smack them. My decision does not stem from a deep well of emotional trauma: I do not consider myself to have been abused. I think that is due to the environment I was in: the context was that almost everyone I knew was smacked. It was, for want of a better word, \"normal\". But for all of my positive (an odd word, I know) experience of this form of punishment, I just reckon that smacking is not the variable that guarantees \"good\" children.</p> <p>I, along with a bunch of friends, was smacked and we turned out undamaged. But then, a lot of my friends and peers weren't smacked and they're responsible, undamaged adults too. Of course, it works the other way too, which suggests to me that smacking is not the deciding factor here.</p> <p>The language we use when we talk about smacking children is interesting. There is obviously a clear line between \"smacking\" and \"abuse\" but both are often used interchangeably in the course of this debate. There are children who have been brutalised by their caregivers under the umbrella term of \"smacking\" and \"discipline\". This was not my experience, and I doubt it is for the millions of children who are smacked. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting\" title=\"\">Parenting</a> is a personal thing, often done publicly. And it's worth remembering that the social stigma of smacking does not seem to be stopping a determined set of parents from \"disciplining\" their children this way.</p> <p>The law as it stands has a \"reasonable chastisement\" clause, which permits mild smacking. And that's how it should stay \u2013 parents need some autonomy in deciding on how to raise their own children.</p>",

The hologram was actually just one piece in an otherwise global communication strategy, which had two main objectives \u2013 create awareness and drive people to the store.</p> <p>This global strategy also included meeting with bloggers, advertising on fashion blogs and with social media insiders, posting a hologram video on YouTube, and a PR strategy targeting consumers and women's magazines</p> <p><strong>How does the hologram work?</strong></p> <p>It's an advanced form of photography that allows an image to be recorded in three dimensions \u2013 it's in fact a recording of an interference pattern made by the interaction of two beams of light.</p> <p>Holograms work by creating an image composed of two superimposed two-dimensional pictures of the same object seen from different reference points. Holography requires the use of light of a single exact wavelength, so lasers have to be used.</p> <p>Basically, when viewing any object, the human eyes each receive a distinct image but from slightly offset reference points. The brain combines them into a three-dimensional image \u2013 the hologram just produces the effect artificially.</p> <p><strong>How have customers and consumers reacted?</strong></p> <p>We've had great feedback so far and for two main reasons. Firstly, because using technology in this way helps create a new brand experience, one that allows customers to engage and interact with the brand and its products in a sensorial way.</p> <p>We have also received good feedback because consumers are looking for innovation online and in real life too \u2013 that's what we tried to give them by using something new and unique.</p> <p><strong>Why did you choose to display the hologram after 9pm? Why not in the day-time?</strong></p> <p>It's a projection (with a video projector) so it works only in a dark room or a similar environment \u2013 the hologram needs to be played after 9pm, during sunset.</p> <p><strong>Do you think 3D technology will change the way retailers interact with customers?</strong></p> <p>Brand value has increasingly been defined, not through the narrow lens of price, but in terms of the total experience that consumers have when they interact with a given brand. That's why <a href=\"http://www.empreintelatelierlingerie.com/indexen.html\" title=\"\">l'Atelier lingerie Empreinte</a> has developed a total digital experience thanks to this hologram and to a touch-screen interactive table that gives product and service presentations.</p> <p>Retailers are working to redefine the shopping experience with new technologies, such as 3D. In any case, technology must be useful and feed the brand content \u2013 shoppers don't want technology just for the sake of it.</p> <p><em>Alexandre Rostaing is strategic planner at </em><a href=\"http://www.carlin-international.com/web/en/\" title=\"\"><em>Groupe Carlin International</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Broadcasters were in the spotlight again, ending among the leading risers in an uncertain FTSE 100.</p> <p><strong>ITV - </strong>which was<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/aug/07/itv-cash-return-ftse-rises\" title=\"\">boosted earlier in the week by talk of a \u00a31.3bn return to shareholders</a> <strong>- </strong>closed 1.95p higher at 83.2p after forecasts of a good advertising performance next month. Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Initial feedback from a major media buyer suggests September has seen a rebound in advertising for ITV. If correct, this supports our view that July and August advertising weakness was caused more by a temporary shift of spending from TV to newspapers to capture Olympic audiences rather than a more negative general stance on advertising. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>BSkyB</strong> climbed 9p to 752p after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/08/bskyb-sky-sports\" title=\"\">it won an appeal against an Ofcom ruling </a>that it must sell its sports channels to rivals at regulated prices. The move could boost the company's profits, according to analysts at Espirito Santo:</p> <blockquote> Sky may receive a one-off payment of around \u00a325m (2% of 2013's estimated pretax profits) from the escrow account where competitors continued pay the difference between regulated prices and BSkyB's original rate cards. Moreover, Sky may receive an additional \u00a315m incremental wholesale revenues from existing contracts, going forward. </blockquote> <p><strong>BT</strong>, which recently won rights to Premier League football matches, fell 5.4p to 216.3p after the ruling. <strong>Virgin Media</strong> lost 15p to \u00a317.51, although there is the still the prospect of a hearing at the court of appeal.</p> <p>Overall the market celebrated five years since the start of the financial crisis with a modest gain. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 5.59 points higher at 5851.51, in quiet trading, proving the summer lull has finally arrived.</p> <p>Poor UK trade figures had little real impact, while lower than expected Chinese inflation figures prompted talk the country could take more measures to boost its economy. This lifted mining shares, with <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> rising 100p to \u00a362.90, after a 32% increase in second quarter earnings, while <strong>Xstrata</strong> added 12.5p to 925p following its results earlier in the week.</p> <p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> continued its recovery following Tuesday's 16% drop in the wake of New York regulators accusing the bank of $250bn worth of illegal transactions with Iran.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/08/standard-chartered-chief-defends-bank\" title=\"\">The bank came out fighting</a> in a press conference on Wednesday, attempting to repair its battered reputation and accusing the regulator of \"factual inaccuracies\" in its attack. It did admit that $14m of transactions did breach US rules.</p> <p>Buyers have now come back for the banks shares, pushing them 47.5p higher to \u00a313.63 and making them the biggest riser in the leading index. Ian Gordon of Investec kept his buy recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> We wouldn't expect any bank's press conference to prove pivotal, but chief executive Peter Sands' performance yesterday afternoon should, we believe, act as a source of further comfort to shareholders. This doesn't look like a bank \"in crisis mode\", as one might reasonably expect. Standard Chartered is taking the unusual, but courageous, stance of facing down a regulator because it believes that the regulator is factually wrong. Let justice prevail on 15 August [when a hearing takes place]. We expect the end-game to be a fine (of unwarranted size), and then we move on. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved its rating from underperform to neutral.</p> <p><strong>Unilever</strong> added 17p to \u00a322.95 as fellow consumer goods group Nestle said it believed pressure from high food prices would ease in the second half of the year.</p> <p>But <strong>Amec</strong> fell 56p to \u00a311.03 after its half year results. Jon Bell at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> We note a more cautious tone from management around the operating margin which has fallen by 70 basis points to 7.5%, mainly due to a shift in business mix. Given [the caution], evidence elsewhere of the effects of the global slowdown (e.g. Cape) and with the shares trading at the top end of their recent range, we downgrade our recommendation from buy to hold. We also take this opportunity to lower our full year forecast, reflecting some pressure at the Kearl project in Canada where key performance indicators were not met. We now forecast pretax profit of \u00a3330m (previously (\u00a3342m). </blockquote> <p>Insurer <strong>Aviva</strong> dipped 1.5p to 316.7p. Its half year profits fell by 10%, more than analysts had expected, after \u00a3186m of restructuring costs and \u00a340m of claims related to the recent UK floods. It wrote down the value of its US business by \u00a3876m, which increased speculation the division could be sold off before long.</p> <p>Online grocer <strong>Ocado</strong> was among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 3p to 73p after UBS issued a sell note and slashed its price target by more than a half to 51p.</p> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Enterprise Inns</strong> jumped 4.25p to 59.75p after the pubs group said like-for-like income improved in the 18 weeks to the start of August. Simon French at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> Given the improving trading trends and falling bank debt we think the stock continues to offer significant upside potential and reiterate our buy recommendation and 87p target price. </blockquote>",
  "<p>The term character comedy doesn't quite cover what San Francisco standup <a href=\"http://willfranken.com/\" title=\"\">Will Franken</a> does in an underground cave, late at night on the Fringe. Yes, he flits in and out of personas \u2013 so restlessly, in fact, that it starts to look like a psychiatric condition. But the vivacity of his characterisations is just an incidental pleasure of this twisting and twisted set, in which the contents of Franken's subconscious \u2013 now absurd, now antagonistic \u2013 are paraded across the stage. The sharp-clawed satire on US culture and liberal piety, and the constant upending of what it is we think we're watching, make for a unique and compelling hour.</p> <p>Franken's take on the modern world comes at us in shards and splinters. We scramble for context while our host pursues his own odd logic and obliges us to keep up. Here is Bill Jacobs, the motivational speaker encouraging business to \"celebrate diversity\", with some key exceptions; here's a campaigner for Parents of Pick-Axe Murdered Children (POPAMC), eager to differentiate her plight from that of other murdered kids' parents. We see multicharacter scenes, too, such as the one with the Victorian prostitutes given condoms to save them from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/19/walter-sickert-dance-of-death\" title=\"\">Jack the Ripper</a>. Franken plays all the roles himself: partly, one suspects, because no one else would have the stomach for the job.</p> <p>The fluidity recalls <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/pajama-men-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">the Pajama Men</a>, while the darkness of Franken's imagination is like Chris Morris: this is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Jam\" title=\"\">Blue Jam</a> with a wilder look in its eyes. Middle American inanity is skewered: witness the hick who thinks the sun is a UFO. But left-liberal orthodoxies are subverted, too, as Franken baffles conventional thinking on race and imagines the amplify-ad-absurdum charity event Global Massive Earth Existence Day. Occasionally, a scene overruns or a satirical point proves elusive. More often, you can't take your eyes off these inspired outpourings.</p>",

  "<p>Before last year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami\" title=\"\">triple disaster</a> in north-east Japan, Tsuchiyu Onsen drew tens of thousands of tourists in search of the recuperative qualities of its piping hot spring water.</p> <p>Almost 18 months after the nuclear accident at nearby Fukushima Daiichi power plant, that same natural resource is about to turn this spa resort into a trailblazer for the country's push towards renewable energy.</p> <p>By spring 2014, Tsuchiyu, 9 miles (15km) from Fukushima, will be generating 250 kilowatts of electricity \u2013 about a quarter of the city's total needs \u2013 at a geothermal plant hidden away in the surrounding mountains.</p> <p>The plant will be the first to be built inside a national park, a controversial move that only became possible after the environment ministry recently relaxed regulations on developing protected areas.</p> <p>If all goes to plan, the project could not only help the town become self-sufficient in power generation, but revive its role as a tourist destination after visitor numbers plummeted amid lingering fears over radiation. In the past, hot-spring operators have been among the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/07/geothermal-power-stations-japan\" title=\"\">fiercest opponents of geothermal energy</a>, an obvious source of energy given Japan's huge subterranean reserves of volcanic water.</p> <p>Many fear the plants would affect the flow and quality of the water, which is pumped up from the depths and then cooled for the benefit of Japan's enthusiastic bathers.</p> <p>In Tsuchiyu, however, where half a dozen hotels remain closed with earthquake damage, spa owners are among the new geothermal generator's keenest backers. \"The plant won't affect the water quality or the temperature,\" said Kazuya Ikeda, general manager of the Tsuchiyu Onsen Tourist Association. \"We have surveyed opinion in the town, and no one has raised any objections.\"</p> <p>The move also makes economic sense. Under a new feed-in tariff system introduced last month, utilities are required to pay premium prices for renewable energy \u2013 42 yen (34p) per kilowatt for geothermal power.</p> <p>\"The structure itself will be quite small and unobtrusive,\" Ikeda added. \"And with the feed-in tariff, we should be able to cover our initial costs in about seven years.\"</p> <p>The 300m-yen (\u00a32.5m) facility will use water pumped from below ground and combine it with an ammonia-like substance with a lower boiling point than water to propel a turbine.</p> <p>Resistance to geothermal power, coupled with the pre-Fukushima faith in nuclear, means that until now Japan has failed to tap into a resource that energy experts believe has huge potential. Its 18 geothermal plants account for 0.2% of electricity output, according to the trade and industry ministry, and no new plants have been built for a decade.</p> <p>Scientists believe the sector's share could rise enormously thanks to the feed-in tariff, new subsidies to fund feasibility studies and test-drilling, and official recognition that nuclear's heyday has passed.</p> <p>According to one estimate, Japan's gGeothermal capacity could reach 24m kilowatts \u2013 the third biggest in the world after the US and Indonesia \u2013 compared with less than 550,000 kilowatts now. Tsuchiyu has other compelling reasons to embrace geothermal power. Visitor numbers dropped dramatically after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and while a recovery is under way, fears of radiation persist, even though recorded levels here pose no health threat.</p> <p>Profits from the venture will be used to repair three damaged hotels and rebuild three others that were destroyed in the earthquake.</p> <p>In the long term, Ikeda believes Tsuchiyu will become a model for other small towns struggling to find clean and stable sources of energy, while experts debate if nuclear has any role to play in Japan's future energy mix.</p> <p>If the experiment works, it should allay anxiety among other Onsen operators about potential damage to hot-spring water flows \u2013 the financial lifeblood of countless similar resorts around Japan.</p> <p>Eventually, the geothermal plant will be capable of generating 1,000 kilowatts, according to Ikeda. That is a tiny fraction of the capacity of just one of Fukushima Daiichi's now crippled reactors. But with opposition to nuclear restarts unlikely to waver, towns such as Tsuchiyu have no choice but to turn to alternatives, he said.</p> <p>\"If it hadn't been for the nuclear disaster, we would never have given this project a second thought.\"</p>",
  "<p>Something interesting is happening to the legal services market in Scotland.</p> <p>Firstly, like everywhere else, Scotland is feeling the effects of a double dip recession. This has shrunk the legal sector, dried up a good deal of commercial and domestic property work and left smaller law firms concentrating their billable time on wills, trusts and executries.</p> <p>For the medium to large firms in the Scottish market, however, the seismic event of the past few years has been the falling away of work from the two most significant clients in the country: The Bank of Scotland and The Royal Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>To give an idea of just how central this work is, I recall a discussion some years ago with a senior partner in one of Edinburgh's grandest firms. He pointed out that in 1800 their two largest clients were the banks and that this was still the case over two hundred years later. Indeed, the decline of bank business in Edinburgh \u2013 which all the major firms share in \u2014 has been compared by some to Glasgow's loss of heavy industry in the 1950s, or the disturbance of an ecosystem in which surveyors, lawyers, accountants and even sandwich shops have traditionally lived and thrived. Of course both banks are still very much present in the Scottish market, it's just that the transaction work which they consistently provided may not return on anything like the scale it once was.</p> <p>Despite these changes, however, there is a great deal for lawyers to be optimistic about: the market has dynamism and Edinburgh is growing again as an eminent financial centre with secure funds under management; it's attracting headquarters for banks such as Virgin Money, Tesco and Green Investment; the city has over 700 established financial services firms; it's building a significant reputation for technology start-ups with IPO ambitions; there's oil and gas work and development; and it's still one of the top places in the world to live, work and study.</p> <p>But the thing which is most interesting in the industry at the moment is the rapid trend of mergers between Scots and English firms. The most prominent link up earlier this year was between McGrigors, one of Scotland's lead firms, and Pinsent Masons. Others have followed: <a href=\"http://www.dwf.co.uk/\" title=\"\">DWF</a> and Biggart Baillie, <a href=\"http://www.shoosmiths.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Shoosmiths</a> and <a href=\"http://www.achws.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Archibald, Campbell &amp; Harley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dacbeachcroft.com/\" title=\"\">DAC Beachcroft</a> and Andersons. A number of other firms have featured in the rumour mill. The trend is a very significant one for a jurisdiction which has always been fiery about its independence: equally, however, its very independence from the rest of the UK legal sector has perhaps led Scots firms and their lawyers to underplay their hand on a wider stage.</p> <p>Why are these mergers happening, and what are the incentives on both sides?</p> <p>From the Scottish perspective, a link up with a strong London or regional player gives the strength and support of a larger firm in these tough economic times \u2014 for even the biggest in Scotland are small when compared to the likes of the magic circle firms. Many clients will have interests across the border, and it makes sense in those circumstances for the same firm to be able to offer a joined up service. For lawyers in Scottish firms, a link up with a global practice brings the potential to work and travel far beyond the jurisdiction's traditional boundaries.</p> <p>From the opposite perspective, merger with a Scots firm is likely to bring in a high quality team of lawyers with an established share in some very lucrative markets including, for example, oil and gas work. As an added bonus, for those working on high value London deals there will suddenly be the availability of a skilled team of commercial lawyers working out of Edinburgh, Glasgow or Aberdeen, who would then be in a position to share the workload at a competitive rate.</p> <p>Overall, the trend of cross border mergers meets a number of needs on both sides, as well as being a timely reminder that despite obvious differences (such as land law) there is much which is shared across the two jurisdictions. After all, the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1707/7/contents\" title=\"\">Act of Union</a> in 1707 gave Scots the commercial freedom to reap the benefits of England's trade networks, whose doors had until then been closed to them; and it gave England the talent, drive and imagination of some of Scotland's best people.

  "<p>Can we use sport as a development tool \u2013 and, if so, how? How can the revenues and energy of major sporting events be harnessed to help achieve development objectives? Or is it better to consider sport a development end in itself? In a month of global sporting celebrations, we'll examine these issues in our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/content/podcast+global-development/global-development\" title=\"\">Global development podcast</a> and would appreciate your comments to help shape the discussion.</p> <p>Many groups say sport has great potential as a vehicle to raise awareness and spread messages in areas such as health and education. Others point to cases where sport has played a role in peace and reconciliation. In Sierra Leone, for instance, a programme called Fambul Tok \u2013 Krio for \"family talk\" \u2013 has incorporated football into its efforts to <a href=\"http://www.footymatters.com/community/fambul-tok-football-reconciling-sierra-leone/\" title=\"\">help reconcile divided communities after the civil war</a>. In Fiji, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=wzIpUO6c5t8#!\" title=\"\">rugby is used as a tool to help alter the perception of people living with disabilities</a>. And, as we <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/16/street-child-world-cup-sao-paolo\" title=\"\">reported in April, the Street Child World Cup</a> initiative aims to give marginalised and frequently criminalised street kids greater protection and better opportunities.</p> <p>Of course, sport is also big business, with the potential to generate huge revenues from ticketing, merchandising, screening rights and tourism. Not to mention great wealth for individual athletes, some of whom go on to become major philanthropists and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/audio/2010/dec/17/focus-podcast-celebrity-aid-development\" title=\"\">development advocates</a>.</p> <p>Current and former English Premier League footballers <a href=\"http://www.craigbellamyfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Craig Bellamy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thedidierdrogbafoundation.com/\" title=\"\">Didier Drogba</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kanuheartfoundationng.com/\" title=\"\">Nwankwo Kanu</a> all have Africa-based charitable foundations championing development causes. John Smit, the captain of South Africa's rugby team, is one of several high-profile sportsmen to take a stand on <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/Report/89329/SOUTH-AFRICA-Sports-stars-urge-men-to-do-the-right-thing\" title=\"\">HIV prevention and gender violence</a>.

What role can they play in the development process?</p> <p>Some argue that sport is not simply a development tool \u2013 a means to other ends \u2013 but should rather be seen as a development goal in its own right. Children, for example, need <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dfid/7131420163/\" title=\"\">opportunities to play sport</a> because having recreational time is a fundamental part of growing up.</p> <p>Let us know what you think.

  "<p>Cities in the UK are currently facing financial pressures, resulting in reductions in services, economic growth and in some instances social upheaval. New ways will need to be identified that will enable our cities and local authorities to overcome such financial hurdles and plan for growth through the improvement of living spaces, infrastructure and investment in new technologies fit for the 21st century.</p> <p>Most cities have a local university, which encompasses knowledge and human resources that are under-utilised by local authorities. This will need to change so that the city and its university's resources can be coupled to achieve a step change in joined-up thinking, informed by science and engineering, optimised to be effective in bringing the needed changes for both resource efficiency and economic growth.</p> <p>Both the city of Southampton and the University of Southampton recognise that this linkage is important not only for utilisation of the council's scarce resources but also for making well-informed plans to regenerate a city's activities. Hence my being appointed by Southampton city council as the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-19179720\" title=\"\">first chief scientific adviser (CSA) associated with a local authority</a> in the UK.</p> <p>The role of a city CSA is not only to provide advice in addressing the above challenges, but also to establish city- and region-wide networks that will create new mechanisms to support local authorities and its communities.</p> <p>Today about 51% of the world's population live in cities, which occupy about 2% of land mass yet consume approximately 80% of the global resources. The <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/18200618\" title=\"\">world population is projected to grow to 9&#xa0;billion by 2050</a> from its current estimate of 7&#xa0;billion. Such an increase will undoubtedly affect the urban areas of the world, requiring new thinking in how cities could adapt to such population growth.</p> <p>For instance, the traditional delivery mechanisms of services and processes, the supply of resources as well as the impact of a changing climate, will pose significant challenges to a city, its population and its infrastructure. The latter includes energy, water, transport, communications, waste management and other services that are deemed necessary for the city to function. Furthermore, cities are the main drivers of economic activities and growth and their outputs are highly dependent on infrastructure that is geared to serve its inhabitants and create vibrant commercial activities.</p> <p>Having a CSA could allow councils in the short term to address issues such as improving the energy efficiency credentials for their buildings. The insulation of homes, for example, could be rolled out coherently, starting with council-owned properties.</p> <p>The CSA could also help councils establish guidance and approaches on <a href=\"http://www.microgenerationcertification.org/consumer/microgeneration-technologies/\" title=\"\">microgeneration technologies</a>. It is clear that the generation of heat or electrical power at household level and community-wide schemes using renewable energy resources and district heating systems will play a major role in the delivery of energy to domestic and commercial entities in the future.</p> <p>On the planning front, councils will need to pool resources to address deficiencies of understanding of new technologies, especially those related to energy generation and efficiency in buildings.</p> <p>Council activities in local industry, support services and supply chains need to support low-carbon development. So a CSA could advise councils to look at regional opportunities and available funding mechanisms to achieve this.</p> <p>Finally, the advancement of technologies and expansion of information technology offer a fantastic opportunity for councils to establish geographical information systems that cover city- or region-wide datasets on buildings and their current state of energy. This would provide their citizens with better information.</p> <p>So a CSA has an important role to play in helping a city to plan for the challenges ahead, to enhance the performance of the city and the quality of life of its inhabitants.</p>",
  "<p>Jaguar Land Rover has won gold for British exporters by reporting a 45% boom in second-quarter profits to well over \u00a3500m, driven by soaring demand from China for the new Range Rover Evoque.</p> <p>The Coventry-based company, now under the control of Tata Motors of India, saw a 91% increase in overall sales from the luxury-car-hungry Chinese market year on year.</p> <p>More than 80% of the vehicles produced at three UK plants are being shipped abroad, increasingly to countries such as China, Brazil and Russia.</p> <p>\"China is strong, especially strong for the luxury market,\" said Ralf Speth, the chief executive of JLR. \"We have a very low market share in China \u2026 therefore we are sure we can continue this growth.\"</p> <p>Industry experts say the Range Rover Evoque has been particularly cleverly marketed \u2013 boosted by a special edition designed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/apr/23/victoria-beckham-designs-range-rover\" title=\"Guardian: Posh car for sale, one stylish owner, contact Victoria Beckham \">collaboration with Victoria Beckham</a> \u2013 but they believe the whole company is thriving on heavy investment, strong product lines and good management.</p> <p>The strong financial performance was announced on the day the Office for National Statistics revealed that in June Britain's trade deficit had ballooned to its highest level since modern records began following a sharp drop in exports.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, JLR sales rose 34% to 83,452 vehicles, including nearly 72,000 Land Rovers \u2013 but fewer than 12,000 Jaguar saloon cars \u2013 in the three months to 30 June.</p> <p>Revenues for the quarter hit \u00a33.6bn, an increase of 35%, while operating margins stood at 14.5% and an operating profit of \u00a3527m in the quarter \u2013 an increase of 45.6% \u2013 was recorded.</p> <p>\"Continued strong revenue and operating profit performance were supported by demand for new products, improved market mix and a favourable exchange rate environment,\" said the company.</p> <p>JLR has declared a first dividend of \u00a3150m, which went to Tata Motors, whose wider business was hit by a slowdown in its home market of India and a depreciation of the rupee. The wider group reported a consolidated profit, before tax, up 34% but net income rose only 12%.</p> <p>Tata bought Jaguar Land Rover from the Ford Motor Company in 2008 for about \u00a31.5bn and its subsequent success after a long period of difficulty means 23,000 staff are employed in Britain. About 8,000 have been taken on in the past 24 months alone and the business has recently announced plans to build a new engine plant in south Staffordshire that could take on a further 750 workers. JLR has also decided to build a new Jaguar F-type at the Castle Bromwich facility in Birmingham.</p> <p>Professor Baback Yazdani, the dean of Nottingham Business School and a car industry expert, said JLR had \"bounced back remarkably\" over recent years by positioning itself for overseas market growth in luxury brands.</p> <p>\"This is about foreign ownership but local management. Just like the Olympics, if you want to be a champion you have to put in relentless hard work as well as inspired leadership.</p> <p>\"Tata has put in long-term investment but given the responsibility to JLR to deliver its own destiny.\"</p> <p>JLR is just one of a number of automobile success stories in Britain with Toyota, Nissan and the BMW-owned Mini business also performing strongly at a time when car sales in Europe and the US are static.</p> <p>Toyota said late last year that up to \u00a3100m would be invested and 1,500 jobs created with the production of a new hatchback model at the group's Burnaston plant in Derbyshire. This month the Japanese company announced that first-quarter profits had almost quadrupled, although this was exaggerated by difficulties last year owing to the tsunami which forced it to halt production.</p> <p>Meanwhile, those more exposed to volume car markets in the US and Europe such as General Motors of Detroit, which also controls the Vauxhall brand, saw a fall in quarterly profits in the three months to June. In 2009 the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and received a $50bn bailout from the American government.</p> <h2>VW weathers crisis while subsidiary Seat amasses losses</h2> <p>As it strives to become the world's most profitable automotive group, the last thing Volkswagen needs is a perpetually loss-making subsidiary. Seat, its Spanish car division, is exactly that, which is why VW has ambitious plans for the carmaker outside western Europe.</p> <p>Unlike its competitors, VW has weathered Europe's debt crisis, reporting higher profits and record deliveries while adding production capacity in expanding Chinese and Russian markets. Seat, meanwhile, has amassed \u00a41bn (\u00a3786m) of losses since 2008 and has made a profit in only one of the last 10 years, a dismal performance that VW seems committed to fix.</p> <p>Battered by the slump in austerity-hit Spain, Seat is the only brand among VW's five main car nameplates to be stuck in the red, VW's recent quarterly results showed. \"Seat is the undisputed black sheep in the VW family,\" said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, director of the Centre for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. \"It would be economically more sensible to close it down and use its facilities for other group brands.\"</p> <p>VW wants Seat to become less reliant on Spain and instead seize potential in China and Russia.</p> <p>The brand plans to open 15 showrooms in major Chinese cities including Chengdu, Nanjing and Shenzen by the end of the year, exploiting growing demand from young buyers for sporty compacts. The average Seat buyer is 34, giving it the youngest customer profile in the VW group.</p>",

  "<p>Climate change is real, it exhibits the hand of man, and it is the cause of global devastation. Despite the obvious need for immediate action, the human race is losing the race against time. Here's a different approach for us to become resilient, kickstart growth, and accelerate the pace of progress toward sustainable development.</p> <p>Last week Nasa scientist <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/05/us/climate-change/index.html?iref=allsearch\" title=\"\">James Hansen linked climate change to extreme weather</a>. His findings are topical, considering the ongoing widespread US drought, massive power outage in India, and historic flooding in China. Whether you believe the science behind climate change or not, these dreadful events rise above the sceptic's eye.</p> <p>Despite climate change's continuing path of devastation, the world is still struggling to mount an effective response. Not that the global effort is not lacking. Rio+20 was the latest in a recurring string of international meetings to combat climate change and promote sustainable development. Prominent companies are investing significant amounts to achieve their greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments. And many individual citizens are acting voluntarily to reduce their environmental footprints.</p> <p>But there are numerous, well-known roadblocks to an effective response. Let's start with the word \"voluntarily\". Action to mitigate the hand of man in climate change has for the most part been voluntary. Yes, the European Union has put its emissions trading scheme in place. And yes, Australia has set up its own carbon trading market. But without a binding global policy on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global action remains voluntary. As we all know, there are timescale limits to voluntary actions.</p> <p>The global effort to achieve a binding policy that transforms efforts from voluntary to \"in compliance\" is hamstrung by asymmetric competitive disadvantage. Outside of huge, near-selfless gesture, why would developed countries willingly limit their companies' GHG emissions (therefore necessitating significant investment and potentially disruptive change) while developing countries would not be under similar conditions?</p> <p>What makes climate change such a frustrating challenge is not only its scale but also its myriad stresses and risks. The challenge effects everyone, albeit unequally. Those living in particularly sensitive environments are at greater risk of suffering from climate change's effects. And that's before we discuss financial and technological resources. Climate change is a collection of stresses and risks. Stresses, such as the melting of the polar ice cap, and risks, such as the subsequent potential flooding of urban centres residing on shorelines, have been thoroughly dissected elsewhere. Suffice to say there is no single climate change solution.</p> <p>Cross-sector collaboration provides the path to our best chance to navigate out of our collective mess. To see why and how, consider the <a href=\"http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/\" title=\"\">Consumer Goods Forum</a>. The forum brings together over 400 retailers, manufacturers, and NGOs from 70 countries. The member companies have <a href=\"http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/pfiles/press_release/Press_Release_2012/2012-06-20-CGF-Us-Gov-deforestation.pdf,\" title=\"\">combined sales of $3.1 trillion and employ nearly 10 million people</a>. Eighteen months ago the forum's members collectively set a binding agreement to help achieve net zero deforestation by 2020 by employing the power of their supply chains. Deforestation is meaningful to the forum's companies because they rely on forestry for everything from palm oil, to soy, beef, paper and board materials for their products.</p> <p>This agreement, and subsequent action, is noteworthy because deforestation accounts for nearly 17% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed the agreement possesses so much kinetic energy that in June 2012 the US government agreed to join the forum's effort to tackle deforestation.</p> <p>Cross-sector collaborations are most effective when targeting issues of collective enlightened self-interest. Water to a beverage company. Food to a food company. Energy to an energy services company. All three of these are clearly sustainable development issues. They have become, by company choice, the foundations of enterprise strategies.</p> <p>To be clear, climate change itself falls within everyone's sphere of interest. But where do we truly begin? How does a participant in a sector, or an entire sector for that matter, move the needle on climate change? And how can we avoid disappointment if we expect every participant in our global economy to act voluntarily in our collective best interests?</p> <p>As the Consumer Goods Forum shows, there is appetite among the private, public, and civil sectors to collaborate on meaningful issues. Indeed initial conclusions from my study of ongoing cross-sector collaborative efforts reveals clues that could help answer to the challenges we face:</p> <h2>Change the object of our global pursuit from sustainability to resilience</h2> <p>Private, public, and social sectors must participate collaboratively if a set of solutions is to be found and put in place. Above all else, inaction within each sector is a prescription for obsolescence across all sectors.</p> <p>\"Sustainability\" is perceived to be a loaded term, more often associated with stewardship than prosperous development. Our collective reliance on achieving a state of sustainability is leading to inaction, endless debate, and disagreement. Once and for all, let's move beyond sustainability as synonymous with altruism, with \"do goodedness\", and with liberal agendas. Instead let's view action, and not merely debate, as synonymous with raising our collective resilience today while inoculating our global environment against the hand of man over time.</p> <h2>Work with organisations across sectors to solve common vexing issues </h2> <p>The key is to collaboratively focus on solutions to smaller, though no less significant, sustainable development issues:</p> <p>\u2022 Without water, beverage, food, and energy companies perish quickly</p> <p>\u2022 Without water, we perish quickly too</p> <p>\u2022 Without energy, our lives are irrevocably disrupted. The same holds true for all companies</p> <p>\u2022 Without food, we perish, though slightly less quickly thanwithout water. Farmers and food companies in particular perish quickly without food</p> <p>Water, energy, food \u2013 these three issues are the essential holy trinity of environmental sustainability. They are maddeningly intertwined and their effect reaches everyone \u2013 private, public, and social sectors alike. Because everyone is affected by each of these issues, and because they are so intertwined, everyone needs to be at the table. No one entity, no matter how large, can save us from ourselves.</p> <h2>Adopt an 'action <em>is</em> our policy' approach </h2> <p>The private and social sectors must stop waiting for government regulation in order to act. This is not earth shattering. But to this point the sustainable development action has been less than unanimous. Certain companies within the private sector are beginning to realise that they no longer control their own destiny. Now they can only influence their own destiny. Because, above all else, every company relies on natural resources and willing human labour for products and services. Without either, what do you have?</p> <p>Collective action on environmental and social issues can kickstart growth. Solutions to the challenges discussed above will rely upon all else enlightened self-interests, innovation, and inclusivity. History has shown how innovation, when properly funded and scaled, lead to growth. Inclusivity in turn increases the likelihood of adoption of innovative solutions to frustrating problems. But it's enlightened self-interest that will enable the scale of innovation and extend our reach to include as many constituents as possible.</p> <p>As the Consumer Goods Forum example suggests, multinational companies can successfully lead cross-sector efforts to address vexing climate change problems. Their interests cross the borders of developed and developing countries alike, so their actions, when brought to life throughout their global operations, are not beholden to the asymmetric competitive disadvantage problem. Indeed companies including Coca-Cola, Unilever, and GE are actively embracing open innovation to find, fund, and scale ideas that build the foundation to solutions in the water, food, and energy fields. Coca-Cola is working with Dean Kaman, the Segway inventor, to refine and scale a device that can turn the dirtiest of water into the cleanest drinking water. Unilever is working with NGOs and other organisations to collect and bring best thinking and practices to 500,000 smallholder farmers worldwide. And GE's Ecomagination challenge is both gathering ideas for new energy system technologies, but also using the company's global footprint to refine, scale, and accelerate entrepreneurs' ideas into significant revenue streams for all involved.</p> <p>For those sceptics of the private sector, remember this: these companies understand that without water, food, and/or energy, they too will cease to exist.</p> <p>We're all in the same boat. It's time to accept this and get on with escaping our mess by rowing in the same direction. Resilience, growth, and sustainable development remain within our reach. We just need to work together to grab these brass rings.</p> <p><em>Eric Lowitt is the author of The Future of Value and a forthcoming book, The Collaboration Economy.

  "<p>As this week's money-laundering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">allegations against Standard Chartered bank show</a>, Iran is feeling the pressure of heightened sanctions and is exploring all options to circumvent them.</p> <p>Though the claims relate to the period 2001-7, since the start of this year co-ordinated sanctions by the EU as well as the US have tightened the noose on Tehran by blocking access to the key financial and insurance markets of Europe. Iran is slowly being excluded from large parts of the global financial system, unable to sell its oil and fast running out of space to store it.</p> <p>Living with sanctions is not new to Iran, nor are many of the methods it has used to evade them. But all its counter-efforts have locked western sanctions enforcement agencies in a game of cat-and-mouse aimed at exposing anyone trying to access the financial system to launder funds or hide transactions.</p> <p>And Iran's tactics are often sophisticated. Over the past year, the regime has launched a diplomatic offensive focused on developing economies, which are desperate for cheap fuel, and it has offered them huge discounts on oil. Some countries have found ways to trade or evade by negotiating barter deals involving grain or consumer goods in exchange for oil.</p> <p>In addition, tankers carrying Iranian oil are alleged to have switched off their automatic identification systems used to track their locations, and Iranian shipping firms are known to have frequently changed the name, owners, and flag state of vessels \u2013 even allegedly to have repainted tankers. The lack of transparency in the shipping industry makes detection of offenders more difficult, and Iran has historically been successful in staying ahead of US and European efforts to track and blacklist them.</p> <p>Iranian corporations, directed by their government, have long used offshore companies, which have limited or no ownership disclosure requirements, to trade or try to enter the financial system. In 2010, with the help of US pressure group <a href=\"http://www.iranwatch.org/\" title=\"\">Iran Watch</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/world/middleeast/08sanctions.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">New York Times exposed </a>a web of companies being used by the Iranian state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. Its network of interlinked companies was registered in financial centres such as Hong Kong and Isle of Man, and in some cases had British directors. This level of sophistication should not come as a surprise when Iran has been subject to US asset freezes since 1979 and more widespread sanctions since 1984, during its war with Iraq.</p> <p>As modern sanctions have become more targeted and focused on isolating Iran from the global financial system, limiting its ability to earn foreign currency through sales of oil and gas, so too have the methods used to undermine them. Some anti-money-laundering specialists have been forced to run background checks on their students to ensure they are not trying to discover weaknesses in the system. And there are fears among oil traders that Iranian oil is being mixed with non-Iranian supplies.</p> <p>There will always be countries and companies who will choose to trade with Iran, regarding sanctions as western or US-inspired measures that are unenforceable against them. As a result, major western companies doing business in Asia, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union are becoming increasingly wary of clients who may be discreetly trading with businesses in Iran. While the headlines are focused on allegations against Standard Chartered, today's major sanction-busting deals are being done by firms that are not household names. <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2012/07/31/white-house-orders-new-iran-sanctions-targets-2-banks-under-existing-measures/\" title=\"\">Last week's blacklisting by the US treasury</a> of Bank of Kunlun Co, part of the Chinese state-owned China National Petroleum Corp, and the Elaf Islamic Bank of Iraq for \"knowingly facilitating significant transactions and providing significant financial services for designated Iranian banks\" was not so widely reported.</p> <p>These types of transactions are indicative of the trend of a continued appetite by many to evade sanctions. Whether Standard Chartered is guilty or not, the US regulator's action shows that it is quickly losing patience with any foreign firm, British or Chinese, which attempts to have illicit dealings with Iran.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's biggest trade deficit since modern records began 15 years ago prompted calls for the government to provide more help for exporters struggling to cope with weakening global demand for their products.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce called on the business secretary, Vince Cable, to boost infrastructure spending, create a new investment bank and assist with trade finance after the latest official figures showed the gap between imports and exports widened from \u00a32.7bn to \u00a34.4bn in June.</p> <p>David Kern, the BCC's chief economist, said: \"British exporters have untapped potential to expand, but they need more government support to help them compete globally and diversify towards growing markets outside the EU. We need firmer action in key areas such as trade finance, promotion and insurance. More infrastructure spending and the early creation of a business bank would make a major contribution towards stronger growth in UK exports.\"</p> <p>Labour also seized on data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing that the value of UK exports of goods and services fell by 4.6% between May and June while imports declined by 0.7%.</p> <p>The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: \"The Business Department has failed to adequately help firms which want to export, in particular small companies. It speaks volumes that the government's finance scheme to boost exports only helped five firms before being quietly dropped.\"</p> <p>Umunna added that the government's promise of an export-led recovery had been \"shattered\" by the figures and called on ministers to adopt \"industrial strategies across the board\".</p> <p>The ONS said the UK trade deficit was the largest since comparable records began in 1997. It was made up of a \u00a310.1bn deficit in trade in goods, offset by a \u00a35.8bn surplus in services.</p> <p>City analysts said the figures were poor even when allowing for the disruption to business caused by the extra bank holiday in June to celebrate the Queen's diamond jubilee.</p> <p>They noted that the trade gap for the second quarter \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend than one month's figures \u2013 increased from \u00a37.8bn to \u00a311.2bn, enough to wipe a percentage point off economic growth. In the three months to June, the value of exports was down by 2.7% while imports were flat.</p> <p>Although Britain's export performance has been hampered by the prolonged crisis in the eurozone, the slowdown in the rest of the world has also started to hit British firms.</p> <p>The ONS said Britain's deficit with the European Union increased by \u00a30.5bn in June to \u00a34.9bn, while the deficit with the rest of the world widened by \u00a31.3bn to \u00a35.2bn. Exports to the US, the Netherlands, France, China, Italy and Spain fell heavily in June.</p> <p>In the second quarter of 2012, the EU deficit increased by \u00a31.8bn to \u00a314.1bn and the non-EU shortfall rose by \u00a31.5bn to \u00a314.2bn. The biggest falls in overseas sales during the quarter were to the US and Germany.</p> <p>The government's aim since it arrived in power more than two years ago has been to rebalance the economy towards exports but the figures for the first half of 2012 show that the deficit is on course to be higher than in 2010.</p> <p>Ministers have blamed the problems in the eurozone for the difficulties faced by exporters, but City analysts said there were now problems in North America and Asia.</p> <p>Daniel Solomon, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \"Growth in much of emerging Asia has been slowing for some time and, while the US is growing slowly, the labour market has been fragile there for a while.\"</p> <p>Chris Willliamson, economist at Markit, said: \"The fall could perhaps be in part blamed on the disruption to shipments caused by extra holidays for the Queen's jubilee, but there is clearly an underlying trend of worrying weakness in overseas demand.\" He added that the fall in exports in the second quarter was the biggest since 2006.</p> <p>Vicky Redwood, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said that if the extra bank holiday had affected shipments through UK ports, it should have affected imports as severely as exports. \"And previous extra bank holidays have not had that big an impact. In June 2002, the month of the golden jubilee, the deficit widened by only \u00a30.4bn.\"</p> <p>Britain's trade in oil plunged deeper into the red in June, notching up a deficit of \u00a31.5bn.</p> <p>During the 1980s and 1990s, Britain's growing trade deficit in goods was masked by a healthy surplus in oil but the decline in North Sea production over the past decade has meant a deficit averaging \u00a31bn a month during 2012.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> has continued its recovery following Tuesday's 16% drop in the wake of New York regulators accusing the bank of $250bn worth of illegal transactions with Iran.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/08/standard-chartered-chief-defends-bank\" title=\"\">The bank came out fighting</a> in a press conference on Wednesday, attempting to repair its battered reputation and accusing the regulator of \"factual inaccuracies\" in its attack. It did admit that $14m of transactions did breach US rules.</p> <p>Buyers have now come back for the banks shares, pushing them 49p higher to 1364.5p and making them the biggest riser in an uncertain FTSE 100. Ian Gordon of Investec kept his buy recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> We wouldn't expect any bank's press conference to prove pivotal, but chief executive Peter Sands' performance yesterday afternoon should, we believe, act as a source of further comfort to shareholders. This doesn't look like a bank \"in crisis mode\", as one might reasonably expect. Standard Chartered is taking the unusual, but courageous, stance of facing down a regulator because it believes that the regulator is factually wrong. Let justice prevail on 15 August [when a hearing takes place]. We expect the end-game to be a fine (of unwarranted size), and then we move on. </blockquote> <p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved its rating from underperform to neutral:</p> <blockquote> Presumably, Standard Chartered would not take such a strong line with its regulator, unless it was very sure of its position. If the latter is correct then it would be reasonable to expect its shares to recover more of their lost ground. If [the regulator] is proved to be correct then its tactics may increase the likelihood of a much more severe penalty, including (as threatened) the removal of its US banking licence. The stakes are clearly very high. Given the high degree of uncertainty, and the possibility that the outcome may prove less damaging to the bank than at first appeared, we think it is prudent to upgrade to neutral. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is marking the fifth year of the financial crisis with a 1.70 point dip to 5844.22, with very light trading volumes. The mining sector is moving higher after weaker than expected Chinese inflation figures prompted talk of more policy action by the country to boost its economy.</p> <p><strong>Randgold Resources</strong> has risen 165p to \u00a363.55 after a 32% rise in second quarter earnings, while <strong>Xstrata</strong> has added 11.3p to 923.8p following its results earlier in the week.</p> <p><strong>ITV</strong> is up 1.55p at 82.8p after forecasts of a good advertising performance next month. Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Initial feedback from a major media buyer suggests September has seen a rebound in advertising for ITV. If correct, this supports our view that July and August advertising weakness was caused more by a temporary shift of spending from TV to newspapers to capture Olympic audiences rather than a more negative general stance on advertising. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>BSkyB</strong> has climbed 6p to 749p after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/08/bskyb-sky-sports\" title=\"\">it won an appeal against an Ofcom ruling </a>that it must sell its sports channels to rivals at regulated prices. The broadcaster could receive \u00a325m from an escrow account related to the pricing system, said analysts. <strong>BT</strong>, which recently won rights to Premier League football matches, has fallen 5.8p to 215.9p after the ruling.</p> <p><strong>Amec</strong> is the biggest faller in the leading index, down 82p at \u00a310.77 after its half year results. Jon Bell at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> We note a more cautious tone from management around the operating margin which has fallen by 70 basis points to 7.5%, mainly due to a shift in business mix. Given [the caution], evidence elsewhere of the effects of the global slowdown (e.g. Cape) and with the shares trading at the top end of their recent range, we downgrade our recommendation from buy to hold. We also take this opportunity to lower our full year forecast, reflecting some pressure at the Kearl project in Canada where key performance indicators were not met. We now forecast pretax profit of \u00a3330m (previously (\u00a3342m). </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Enterprise Inns</strong> is up 5.75p at 61.25p after the pubs group said like-for-like income improved in the 18 weeks to the start of August. Simon French at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> Given the improving trading trends and falling bank debt we think the stock continues to offer significant upside potential and reiterate our buy recommendation and 87p target price. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Volunteering abroad comes with a bit of a social stigma. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/mar/28/gap-year-spoof-youtube\" title=\"\">gap yah comedy sketch</a>, where posh boy Orlando boasts about his drunken adventures, has led many to dismiss overseas volunteer projects as a middle-class cliche.</p> <p>From my experience, the stereotype couldn't be further from the truth. Volunteering isn't so expensive that it's only an option for the well off. I spent 10 weeks volunteering in Arizona with <a href=\"http://usaconservation.org/\" title=\"\">America Conservation Experience</a> (ACE), helping to preserve America's natural beauty.</p> <p>The trip was arranged through <a href=\"http://www.bunac.org/\" title=\"\">Bunac</a>, a work and volunteer organisation. Altogether, it cost me around \u00a31,000 \u2013 a sum which I covered mostly by working in my student bar.</p> <p>Despite the self-indulgent image associated with overseas volunteer projects, the work can be hard going. I spent my time abroad maintaining trails, building fences and implementing re-vegetation projects in some of the national parks and national monuments of America.</p> <p>Summer temperatures in Arizona stay well above 35C, not ideal if you're carrying 50kg of concrete for 10 hours at a time. And then there's the wildlife to deal with. One afternoon nap took a less subdued turn when I realised that a rattlesnake was resting only 3 metres from me. The experience, needless to say, improved my strength of character \u2013 and reduced my fear of the English household spider.</p> <p>Most people volunteer because they want to give something back to the world. But in reality, you benefit just as much as the local communities and eco-systems you're helping.</p> <p>Spending 10 months in America's most beautiful national parks and forests was an unforgettable experience. I gained a far deeper understanding of the local environment than the average tourist, meeting ex-national park rangers, who had a unique knowledge of the area's history and eco system.</p> <p>The most challenges aspects of working abroad are also the most beneficial. Being placed in an unfamiliar environment forces you to use your initiative and develop self-confidence \u2013 surviving 10 days of camping in the wild is something that three years of university could never provide. When I look back on the work I completed, it makes writing a dissertation and academic deadlines seem a lot more manageable.</p> <p>But best of all, my 10 weeks were spent volunteering with young people from a mix of cultures and backgrounds \u2013 from Belgians to South Koreans. When I left Arizona, I returned home having made friends with students from across the world.</p>",
  "<p>Struggling mobile phone maker Nokia has agreed to sell its Qt software business to Finnish IT services company Digia Oyj as part of its strategy to sell off non-core assets.</p> <p>The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which analysts said was a fraction of the $150m (\u00a396m) Nokia paid for Norway's Trolltech in 2008.</p> <p>Nokia bought the Qt software through its acquisition of Trolltech and it was a central part of its strategy until 2011, when it decided to swap its own smartphone software for Microsoft's Windows Phone.</p> <p>The software is used by about 450,000 developers for making applications for some 70 industries.</p> <p>Up to 125 employees working on developing and licensing the software will move from Nokia to Digia, the companies said on Thursday.</p> <p>Digia said it planned to make Qt available for developing applications for Apple's iOS platform, Google's Android and Microsoft Windows 8.</p> <p>Tommi Laitinen, the senior vice president of international products at Digia, said: \"We are looking forward to welcoming the Qt team to Digia.

  "<p>Thousands of civil servants have borne the brunt of the \u00a35.5bn cut in central government spending last year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/aug/09/efficiency-savings-exceed-5bn-target\">cuts, announced on 9 August</a> by the Cabinet Office, were higher than predicted and more than the \u00a33.75bn in savings made the previous year. The biggest single saving - \u00a31.5bn - has come from cutting thousands of Whitehall posts. </p> <p>The announcement could intensify the growing tension between the government and senior civil servants, who have been subject to an onslaught on their jobs, pensions and their much-prized impartiality over the past few months, despite reassurances since his appointment by the head of the civil service, Sir Bob Kerslake, that the government recognises the value of its civil service. </p> <p>Last week, Kerslake <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/01/civil-service-government-outsourced-policy-review?INTCMP=SRCH\">rebutted claims</a> that a review of civil service administration in other countries, including those where ministers have a greater say in appointing senior officials, was a step towards politicisation of the civil service. </p> <p>Announcing that review, Cabinet Office Francis Maude said that while the government is \"rightly proud\" of the civil service, it would be hubristic to assume there was nothing the UK could learn from other successful governments</p> <p>The latest savings figures highlight the impact of a ruthless campaign of cost-cutting across central government, steered by Maude, who<a href=\"http://www.guardianpublic.co.uk/francis-maude-is-comfortable-in-back-office-role-cutting-and-centralising\" title=\"\"> in February 2011 said</a>: \"If I go home at the end of the day having saved a hundred million pounds, by dint of what I've done or led \u2013 and there have been days when we've done more than that \u2013 I feel I've earned my salary.\" </p> <p>The savings include:</p> <p>\u2022 Nearly \u00a31.5bn through \"stronger controls on non-essential recruitment\" to the civil service \u2013 a huge increase from the \u00a3300m saved in 2010-11.</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a31bn saved through a moratorium on the use of consultants in central government. Since 2010, consultancy spend has been cut by more than 85%.</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3390m saved by freezing marketing spend; this follows savings of \u00a3400m on marketing in 2010-11.</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3200m saved on property costs \u2013 almost double the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jan/12/whitehall-property-savings?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">savings of the previous year</a>; this follows the appointment of an advisory body of property experts in March 2011 and further controls over the government estate.</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3500m saved through joint procurement of good and services.</p> <p>In October 2010, chancellor George Osborne<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/spending-review-civil-service-job-cuts?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> announced a doubling of the target for cost cutting across Whitehall,</a> from \u00a33bn to \u00a36bn, through cutting thousands of civil service jobs. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence has seen the largest cut, with a fall of 5% from 57,210 in December 2011 to \u00a354,250 in April 2012, although some central departments have slightly increased their headcount.</p> <p>In June, Jonathan Baume, the outgoing general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/jun/20/civil-service-shakeup-will-stretch-whitehall?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">wrote that the proposed job cuts would stretch Whitehall to the limit</a>. \"The whole plan is predicated on the continued reduction in civil service posts by up to 60,000 by 2015. There is no evidence that this decrease will be accompanied by a reduction in the work and scope of government,\" he said.</p> <p>Maude said the controls on spending brought in by the Cabinet Office efficiency and reform group, which he chairs jointly with chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, had saved \"unprecedented amounts of money\" and would become a permanent feature across government.</p> <p>Ian Watmore <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/may/16/ian-watmore-permanent-secretary-resigns?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">resigned</a> in May as director general of the efficiency and reform group, a position he had held since June 2010. The Cabinet Office has not yet announced Watmore's replacement.</p> <p>The scale of the cuts has raised fears about damage to public services, despite the government's committment to protect frontline services. In early 2011, Maude was described by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/07/big-society-is-not-working\" title=\"\">Guardian's Polly Toynbee </a>as \"mastermind of the shrivelling state, axeman in chief\".</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2012.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/27/nell-freudenberger-interview-the-newlyweds\" title=\"\">Nell Freudenberger</a>'s new novel, like the two books before it (the short story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\" title=\"\"><em>Lucky Girls</em></a> and the novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/29/fiction.features\" title=\"\"><em>The Dissident</em></a>), is about what its central couple calls \"cultural differences\". George is a 34-year-old American engineer, and Amina is a 24-year-old Bangladeshi. They met via an internet site called AsianEuro.com, which Amina, through whose eyes the story is told, likes to think of as an updated version of the village matchmaker who arranged her grandparents' marriage. George wants a stable home life and a family; Amina wants the chance of an American education and career. They form a mutually beneficial alliance. However, neither gets quite what he or she expects.</p> <p>The cultural differences between George and Amina range from linguistic trifles (he alarms her by calling the local teenagers who knock over their mailbox \"thugs\", a word she associates with violent bandits) to the profound (she's not only never had an orgasm, she doesn't even know that it's possible). But their biggest disconnect has to do with their notions of family. George's vision is nuclear; Amina's is extended. Specifically, it has never occurred to her that her parents \u2013 an economically feckless father and an intermittently dotty mother \u2013 won't shortly be following her to Rochester, New York, land of Home Depots, malls, Starbucks and, most exotic of all, snow. Lots and lots of snow. Live-in in-laws is not what George had in mind.</p> <p><em>The Newlyweds</em> is essentially a character study. Its narrative arc is a long, leisurely upward incline to the moment when Amina realises that in becoming American she no longer wants to live in America, and yet she can't return to Bangladesh. It's not that the marriage isn't equitable. At worst, George is a bit of a pedant; in Amina, he seeks a partner who's not so much subservient as comprehensible. \"Who knows why women do anything they do?\" he asks when she quizzes him about his beautiful, impetuous, chronically dissatisfied cousin, Kim. \"Except for you \u2026 You're logical.\"</p> <p>George treats Amina with consideration and respect, even if he has little grasp of what's going on in her head. Amina regards marriage as an enterprise, a series of surmountable challenges on the road to adulthood. Their union is not passionate, but it is companionable. Yet as Amina adjusts to her new identity as \"this American wife, using the dishwasher and the washing machine, checking her email on the living room computer\", she begins to fret over the loss of her previous self, wondering if the past and present Aminas \"would simply grow farther and farther apart, until the day they didn't even recognise each other\". What she once thought of as an immutable soul, \"whose thoughts were in no particular dialect\", is being ineluctably reshaped by her environment, her husband and the English language.</p> <p>Freudenberger describes this metamorphosis in careful detail. The effect is largely persuasive, even when Amina's observations serve as overly pointed commentary on American mores: \"You might cheat, steal, lie, but if you confessed you could be instantly forgiven \u2013 as if the bravery it took to admit it made the thing itself all right.\"</p> <p>For all her pragmatism, there is one subject on which Amina remains stubbornly illogical: her parents. \"She was here, and so this was where they had to be,\" she insists in the face of George's reservations. She finally manages to parlay a transgression on his part into an agreement to bring them over, and the last third of the novel describes her journey back to Bangladesh to secure their visas and get them on a plane. It's a nightmare of bickering, competitive relatives, obstructive bureaucrats and unruly emotions. But Bangladesh is also where Amina discovers what she really wants, with a desire she's only able to recognise thanks to the time she's spent in the land of rugged individualism.</p> <p>An accomplished if overlong piece of literary naturalism, <em>The Newlyweds</em> feels rather old-fashioned, as if, like Amina, it were a visitor from another country. That would be the country where readers are willing to devote themselves to many pages of expertly rendered depictions of suburban life and the intricacies of everyday marital relations without much indication of where all of it is heading. It's the sort of novel you admire even as you admit you aren't especially curious to know what happens next. Once, a reader might have taken it on faith that a book from a writer celebrated as one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/04/new-yorker-young-writers-list\" title=\"\">20 best novelists under 40</a> by the New Yorker magazine must have a point worth pursuing. Whatever it may lack in urgency, it makes up for in good taste. However, the world where such readers once abounded is vanishing in time's rearview mirror almost as quickly as the old Amina. Those who remain can pick up the novel with confidence; the rest need not worry too much about passing it by.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Miller's <em>The Magician's Book: A Sceptic's Adventures in Narnia</em> is published by Little, Brown. Nell Freudenberger will be appearing at the <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh International Book Festival</a> on 13 August.</p>",
  "<p>So as the Olympics come to an end attention is inevitably turning to their legacy. All four of the Olympic boroughs show up on the Trust for London's poverty profile. These are London's worst areas for housing, pay, health and education. Taken together they are a sea of red. On the face of it it is a clash of worlds; the Olympics with all its show and fanfare and the harsh reality of life for many in the local community. So how can the two come together?</p> <p>Two years ago we set out to find nine visionary local charities who were already tackling disadvantage in the boroughs and who felt they needed business skills to help them grow. We put each charity with a team of business leaders assembled from five of the Olympic sponsors (adidas, BP, BT, Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance and Deloitte) to coach them on a monthly basis for a year.</p> <p>The reality was harsh. Most of the charities we worked with had already suffered huge cuts or experienced them during the time they worked with the Olympic sponsors. <a href=\"http://www.ncytrust.org/\" title=\"\">New Choices for Youth</a> had twenty-five years experience of working with children and young people in crisis. Last year it supported 1,500 young people in Newham and Tower Hamlets. Yet in 2010 cuts in local government contracts led to a fall in its turnover from \u00a31.2m to \u00a3500,000. <a href=\"http://www.aanchal.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Aanchal</a>, a charity working with South Asian Women affected by domestic abuse, had already had all of its funding from the local authority cut.</p> <p>In the sector there have often been questions raised about whether charities can really learn from business and if it's the right thing to do. But for small charities, having a team of business brains to mentor and coach you to work through some very difficult problems can prove invaluable. However there are inevitable frictions. At first charities can find it quite hard to stand back and look at their organisation from a different perspective. On the other hand, business people from large corporations can find it difficult to adjust to an organisation that has a small budget and a whole board of non-executives.</p> <p>So did it work and what did the charities gain?</p> <p>For many of the charities it was a challenging process. But as Marcia Samuels, Director of <a href=\"http://www.ncytrust.org/\" title=\"\">New Choices for Youth,</a> says although it was tough at times she now understands the full costs of her services, has a clear business plan and as a result the organisation has become more streamlined and professional. Many of the charities have also been helped to deliver on highly ambitious targets. Mark Hardie from <a href=\"http://www.accesssport.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Access Sport</a> says they are well on the way to achieving their target of giving 9,000 children in deprived areas access to high quality sport.</p> <p>By 2013, nearly a year on from all the Olympic charities finishing their work with their business mentors, our aim is that they will have doubled the number of people they reach and experienced a 50% growth in turnover.<a href=\"http://www.accesssport.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Access Sport </a>is just one which is already well on course to do just that.But it hasn't been just the charities that benefitted from this process. For many of the mentors it really brought home the daily struggles of small organisations trying to solve some really tough problems. One of the mentors from BT said the experience made her 'see things through a different lens'. For one senior executive who grew up in Waltham Forest it showed him the benefits of helping a community he had grown up in.</p> <p>What we learned from putting the two worlds together is that respect was key. Each world had something to teach the other. And it took time: a whole year to understand in a drip-drip way what the other had to say. But those two worlds emerged enjoying each other. At <a href=\"http://www.pilotlight.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Pilotlight</a> we also discovered that location matters. We helped local charities with the sponsors who were using their space.</p> <p>Now the challenge is to take that message to corporates across the country who sit in a location, crowd the local coffee and sandwich bars and then head back home in the evening to somewhere entirely different. Today CSR trends are heading towards being issue themed and global but big business needs to spare a thought for the charity down the road. We need corporates across the country to look at their local areas and the charities working in them and engage with them. It shouldn't take an Olympic Games to do that.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
