  "<p>England are poised to play home Tests away from Twickenham for the first time since 1998, in order to promote the 2015 World Cup across the country. Tournament organisers are committed to boosting interest in union in the north and are pushing hard for the national team to venture further afield. Not since England played New Zealand at Old Trafford has a major Test been staged outside south-west London, although England did play World Cup warm-up games at Huddersfield in 1998, against the Netherlands and Italy. The financial benefits of playing at Twickenham have since held sway but the need to sell 2.9m tickets for RWC 2015 is prompting an overdue rethink. \"There is a tremendous appetite to make sure this Rugby World Cup gets to as many corners of the country as we can take it,\" admitted Andy Cosslett, the chairman of England 2015. \"With only one Premiership team in the north it's something we have to address. Taking rugby outside the traditional rugby strongholds into places where we're fighting the battle against Premiership football is something we see as a priority.\"</p> <p>As the new chairman and chief executive of the RFU, Bill Beaumont and Ian Ritchie, hail from Lancashire and Yorkshire respectively, there is already a natural desire within the union to, as Cosslett put it, \"do the right thing\". The national coach Stuart Lancaster lives in Leeds and has already made a point of staging training sessions away from England's familiar Bagshot base. \"The RFU is very supportive,\" said Cosslett, keen to \"capture the attention\" of new audiences wherever they live. \"If we've done our job properly we'll engage the whole population of England.</p> <p>\"We can't shift Twickenham Stadium but being on the doorstep of a sports-mad city like London is fantastic. Rugby people know how to enjoy themselves pretty much anywhere. If you're watching it in Whitton High Street I'm sure that'll be fun too.\"</p> <p>Between 10 or 12 venues will stage World Cup matches although the final selection has yet to be made. Cardiff will definitely stage games, with Wales likely to play a minimum of two pool matches at the Millennium Stadium, and tournament organisers would love to include the Olympic Stadium on the roster.</p> <p>Any formal agreement to stage big-time rugby in Stratford must wait, however, until negotiations over the stadium's future tenants have been completed. ER2015 is willing to wait until March but admits some Premier League football club managers are reluctant to have rugby played on their pitches at a busy stage of the domestic season. Precisely when and where England, and their various rivals, will play their pool games in 2015 also cannot be finalised until after the pool draw has taken place on 3 Dec.</p> <p>With exactly three years to go until the tournament kicks off, however, the organisers believe they will generate a healthy surplus regardless of the tough economic climate. \"I'm not going to forecast the economic environment but we're pretty confident,\" said Cosslett. The International Rugby Board require an \u00a380 million guarantee to stage the tournament before the host union receives a penny in ticket revenue.</p> <p>Cosslett also reiterated that the decision to remove Paul Vaughan as chief executive of ER2015 in favour of Debbie Jeavons had been taken in a bid to broaden the tournament's impact beyond traditional rugby circles. Jeavons was closely involved with the organisation of the Olympics and is due to transfer across from her Locog role next month.</p>",
  "<p>As expected, the planning committee of David Cameron's favourite council, Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F), last week <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Outline_planning_application_approved_for_8bn_pound_Earls_Court_regeneration_scheme.asp\">approved plans</a> to radically redevelop a 77-acre patch of inner west London - plans which include the demolition of 760 homes despite the strong opposition of people living in them, the destruction of the Earls Court exhibition centre despite the objections of the Association of Event Organisers, and despite a panel of architects H&amp;F itself helped to appoint <a href=\"http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/planningandconservation/planningapplications/earlscourtapplication.aspx\">advising it to reject the plans</a>. </p> <p>The struggle over the <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/\">Earls Court project</a>, as the giant scheme is called, has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/jul/09/council-housing-social-cleansing-tories\">raging in earnest since 2009</a>. The council has now embedded core components for its delivery. But its opponents have established bridgeheads too. One describes the situation in vivid terms: \"From here on it's a fight to the death.\"</p> <p>It would be rash to predict the outcome or the precise events that will precede it, but a timescale of key battles can be mapped. Next month, maybe sooner, a judge will decide whether an application for a judicial review into the scheme's legality launched by residents opposed to the demolition of their homes should proceed further. </p> <p>Also some time in October <a href=\"http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/committees/Home/tabid/39/ctl/ViewCMIS_CommitteeDetails/mid/404/id/1489/Default.aspx\">the planning committee of H&amp;M's neighbouring borough of Royal Kensington and Chelsea</a> is expected to consider the application for the part of the project that lies within its boundaries. Assuming it approves it - which it almost certainly will - the expectation is that the two applications together will be put before London Mayor Boris Johnson for his consideration. </p> <p>Last December, Johnson's planning officers at the Greater London Authority (GLA) rejected earlier versions of the applications because they <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/davehillblog/2011/dec/09/regeneration-housing\">failed to comply with 44 policies of the mayor's London Plan</a>, but suggested ways in which those failures might be addressed. These included \"further information and discussion\" on housing, \"especially regarding estate renewal and affordable housing provision.\" </p> <p>The words \"estate renewal\" mean the knocking down of those 760 homes in Hammersmith and Fulham and their promised replacement within the wider redevelopment area - a promise the scheme's opponents have doubts about. The GLA response also noted that the number of additional \"affordable\" homes included in the plans for the main development area was 740, representing about 14% of the total number of homes then proposed. This is very low percentage. A useful comparison might be made with the London Legacy Development Corporation's goal for \"affordable\" homes to be provided in the neighbourhoods of the Olympic Park - 35%, a figure <a href=\"http://www.londonlegacy.co.uk/legacy-corporation-appoints-taylor-wimpey-and-lq-to-build-first-neighbourhood/\">described last month</a> as being \"in line with the mayor's London Plan.\" </p> <p>Yet H&amp;F's revised Earls Court project application still offers only 740 additional \"affordable\" homes. Given this, it is terribly tempting to suspect that the \"further information and discussion\" that the GLA suggested H&amp;F should provide have resulted in an accommodation to enable the former to allow the latter to have its way. If so, it will mean Mayor Johnson being content that, according to my calculator, only 11% of the 7,583 new homes now being proposed for the project area as a whole will be additional \"affordable\" ones. Moreover, these will be the \"intermediate\" variety of \"affordable\" homes, rather than the less expensive social rent variety.</p> <p>This may seem a strange state of affairs in a city gripped by a crisis of housing affordability. It will, however, not surprise seasoned followers of the Earls Court project saga. The previous job of Johnson's recently-appointed head of his new crime and policing office Stephen Greenhlagh was leader of H&amp;F. Greenhalgh <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">told the Guardian earlier this year</a> that the Earls Court project is \"the best deal in the history of redevelopment in London.\" Defending Greenhalgh against critics of the scheme back in 2010, Johnson described him as \"the great man.\" Will Johnson use his planning powers to block or obstruct the ambitions of his fellow Tory Greenhalgh and his erstwhile colleagues at the flagship Tory borough? It seems rather unlikely.</p> <p>However, a green light from the mayor to his allies in the boroughs won't be the end of the matter. The judicial review could be progressing, and further legal challenges cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the council's wish to sell the land on which those 760 homes stand - in two estates, the West Kensington and the Gibbs Green - to the developer <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/our_business_capco/capco_eco/\">Capco</a> for demolition and redevelopment has to be approved by the government. This is unlikely to occur before next March, by which time a great deal might have changed - not least if police conclude that there is substance to <a href=\"http://shepherds-bush.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/west-ken-report-on-misconduct-in-public.html\">allegations</a> that people acting for the council have <a href=\"http://www.fulhamchronicle.co.uk/fulham-and-hammersmith-news/local-fulham-and-hammersmith-news/2012/09/17/criminals-residents-accuse-council-over-earls-court-redevelopment-82029-31851353/\">engaged in misconduct</a> in relation to the scheme.</p> <p>This long war is now becoming deeply attritional, yet its end may just about be coming into sight. Much, much more on all this to come...</p>",
  "<p>Those who follow my writing know that I am <em>not</em> a fan of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/01/bias-polls-harry-enten\">weighting polls</a> to a predetermined party identification (ID). The reason is that questions on party ID can be skewed by question ordering and political environment. Many Republicans said, for instance, they were independents <a href=\"http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_76.html#.UFd8W79nFE4\">after the Watergate scandal</a>. Respondents may also be more likely to call themselves an independent instead of a Republican if they decide to cross party lines at an election.</p> <p>Some Republicans have been up in arms this year over what they perceive as polls with too many Democrats. The charge is not new. <a href=\"http://www.mysterypollster.com/main/2004/09/weighting_by_pa.html\">In 2004</a>, many Democrats complained of a bias: they thought the polls had too many Republicans. Why? Pollsters were finding that more voters identified as Republicans than usual. But it turned out that more voters in the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html\">exit polls</a> called themselves Republicans than in prior years \u2013 and George W Bush did win.</p> <p>The truth is that while some pollsters are unreliable, most know what they are doing. It's also important to remember that most media companies use bipartisan polling teams. <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2012/09/12/fox-news-poll-obama-tops-romney-in-post-convention-poll-most-say-country-still/\">Fox News</a> has both a Democrat and a <a href=\"http://shawresearch.com/shaw/Bio.html\">Republican pollster</a> on their team. They found President Obama up by 5 percentage points. Are they biased?</p> <p>NBC News/Wall Street Journal has given Obama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/race-2012-election-more-demagogics-demographics\">the advantage</a> in every one of their polls. Did you know that one of their pollsters is <a href=\"http://pos.org/about/partners-and-vice-presidents/bill-mcinturff-va/\">Republican Bill McInturff</a>, whose partner is Mitt Romney's pollster Neil Newhouse?</p> <p>Still, the party identification argument would be more sustainable if it made a big difference across pollsters: that is, if pollsters who had more Democrats than others were more Democratic, while those with more Republicans were more friendly to the GOP. To that effect, an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NumbersMuncher/status/246966493185728513/photo/1\">interesting graph</a> was published by Tweeter \"Numbers Muncher\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396287912\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347913964810/obamalead_460.jpg\" alt=\"Obama's lead by party ID\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The graph is supposed to show that the more there are survey respondents who identify as Democrats, the bigger the Obama lead. Your eye is probably drawn to the relationship between Rasmussen (at bottom left) and every other pollster. Join the dots, and you would seem to have found a fairly straightforward relationship: more Democratic-identified respondents giving a more pro-Obama poll result.</p> <p>You can explain about 45% of the difference in Obama's lead and the percentage difference between Democrats and Republicans in the sample. That's a solid, though not overwhelming relationship. It suggests that the number of Democrats in one sample can help predict whether or not the poll is going to be more Democratic than a poll done by another outlet.</p> <p>The problem is that the relationship is being driven by one datapoint. Take Rasmussen out of the chart, and you get this graph:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396287913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347914038711/partyID_460.jpg\" alt=\"Obama lead v party ID\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>All of a sudden, the relationship that seemingly was there, no longer is. The explanatory power of party ID, therefore, is essentially zero. The pollster that has the most favorable Romney numbers gives Democrats a 10-percentage point party ID advantage. If anything, you might try and draw a U-shape to connect the dots.</p> <p>A truly real statistical relationship should not be dependent on one datapoint. Adding the newly released <a href=\"http://argojournal.blogspot.com/2012/09/poll-watch-monmouth-university-2012.html\">Monmouth University poll</a> continues to prove a lack of a relationship.</p> <p>The truth is that if you dig deep enough, you can find many causes for \"house effects\" (that is, differences between pollsters). This year, Democrats and some analysts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/race-2012-election-more-demagogics-demographics\">have complained</a> about the racial composition of polling samples; I don't buy these racial arguments for the most part either. I only ask for individual pollsters to keep their own data consistent. A pollster shouldn't have a 35% Democratic-identified sample one time and a 25% sample the next, except when there have been changes to the electorate such as <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/12/obama-closes-enthusiasm-gap-with-romney-after-conventions/\">increased Democratic enthusiasm</a> after the Democratic National Convention.</p> <p>Now, none of this is meant to say President Obama will definitely win (more on that later in the week), but he <em>is</em> winning right now. That may be welcome news to some, but hard for others to accept \u2013 and I've seen that. Take it from someone who was among the first to call it that the Republicans would take over the House in <a href=\"http://poughies.blogspot.com/2010/02/republican-blizzard-on-generic-ballot.html\">2010</a> and hold it in <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/hje2011102702/\">2012</a>; not everyone wanted to hear this.</p> <p>I'm interested only in projecting the winner of this presidential election objectively. If there are those who prefer to cherrypick data to get a preferred outcome, that's their choice. But they're setting themselves up for a fall.</p>",
  "<p>During the press conference of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, Professor Phil Scraton said he and fellow panellists had the advantage over any public inquiry, that in their meticulous investigation of the massive documentation they had been greatly assisted by being \"able to get close to the victims\". This comment was no doubt prompted by the traditional lawyer's assumption that a public inquiry is limited to listening to voices inside the inquiry forum, by formal legal processes from which the independent panel was spared.</p> <p>The contrast in procedures is not accurate. When Lord Scarman conducted his inquiry in 1981 into the Brixton riots under the terms of the Police Act 1964, it was a notable feature of the inquiry that at the end of each day's session of hearing witnesses Lord Scarman could be seen walking the streets of Brixton talking to residents about their experiences during the riots. No one, as far as I know, raised any objections; nor could they reasonably have done so. I&#xa0;am quite certain, moreover, that Lord Scarman's report was better informed as a result of those informal conversations.</p> <p>Public inquiries are not aspects of the legal system. They are a part of public administration designed to investigate national scandals or disasters and to report to ministers who bear the responsibility for deciding what action, if any, needs to be taken.<br><strong>Louis Blom-Cooper QC</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Simon Jenkins' article on police accountability is astonishingly perverse, (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/hillsborough-scandal-last-23-years\" title=\"\">Hillsborough shows it's time for elected commissioners</a>, 14 September). In South Yorkshire at the time, the nearest thing to an individual politician with responsibility was Sir Irvine Patnick, local MP and former member of the Sheffield city council, and he completely swallowed the whole police story.</p> <p>Those who have served on police authorities know how powerful the pressures are to support the police line. Accusations of failure to back law and order are invariably used and a single individual, whether directly elected or not, would be more susceptible to such pressure. There are few votes in being portrayed as \"soft\".</p> <p>My experience on the West Yorkshire police committee at the time of the Yorkshire Ripper case convinced me that it requires informed political pluralism to deal with the inevitable pressure.</p> <p>Jenkins was once the leading advocate of \"big bang localism\" and I am disappointed that he has now succumbed to the populist idea of the single \"tough guy\", which will inevitably undermine local democracy still further.<br><strong>Michael Meadowcroft</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The shocking revelations contained in the Hillsborough Independent Panel's report into the 1989 tragedy underline the need for the Independent Police Complaints Commission to be given new powers. If the IPCC were able to interview officers under caution immediately following incidents, cover-ups might be prevented. The absence of such powers has hindered the ability of the police to properly investigate many high-profile cases in London.</p> <p>We have seen too many instances of officers distorting the facts by comparing notes in draft form and co-ordinating statements to fit their chosen narrative, as in the Jean Charles de Menezes case. These practices are illegal and must stop. The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime should take the lead by ensuring there is proper oversight of Metropolitan police officers who are required to provide statements individually and not as a collective entity.<br><strong>Jenny Jones</strong><br><em>Green party group leader, London&#xa0;Assembly</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Robert Younger (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/13/danger-caught-in-a-crowd\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 13 September) is wrong to blame fans for the perceived need to construct fences around the pitch at football grounds. In the early and middle years of the 20th century large crowds were common and, in the case of an emergency, often spilled on to the pitch, thus preventing serious injury. The introduction of \"pens\" and high fences in the 80s was an indication of an authoritarian mindset that sought to treat fans as farmyard animals or prisoners. Huge mistakes were made on the day of the Hillsborough tragedy, but it was an accident waiting to happen. <br><strong>Peter Smith</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>Under the European lights on Tuesday evening take two of Manchester City's Champions League crusade begins against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Real Madrid. After last year's failure to last beyond Christmas Roberto Mancini knows he must guide the club to the knock-out phase or the sticky questions start.</p> <p>In Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mansour, the billionaire owner, will watch television pictures of the starriest night yet of his club's fast-paced evolution in what is only City's third European Cup campaign against Real, the nine-times continental champions who head the aristocrat class the Blues are so keen to join.</p> <p>The Sheikh's \u00a31bn-plus investment has always been pointed at this competition and the status success will bring, to the club and the Abu Dhabi \"project\". The thinking behind the strategy here is that a first triumphant invasion of Europe is the next required staging post in the Emirate's long-term goal of building a global commercial empire.</p> <p>With work under way on the \u00a3100m-plus, 80-acre Etihad Campus that will feature the City Football Academy where the hope is a generation of home-grown prodigies can be hot-housed, the demand on the front-of-house operation is that Mancini can deliver the Champions League trophy in the next two or three seasons.</p> <p>For the campaign about to be embarked upon the least required is a powerful showing that gives credence to Mancini as an operator on the continental battlefront where his career record is modest: in four seasons at Internazionale the furthest he managed was the quarter-finals.</p> <p>In this quest Mancini has an array of stellar talent assembled in the manager's three years in Manchester that disallows any excuse of inferiority when City roll into Madrid, Ajax and Borussia Dortmund, who make up a group that for once is a league of domestic champions.</p> <p>Mancini, though, spent a fretful summer hoping to get the green light for a \u00a3116m splurge on a quartet he identified as being able to provide the surge required to compete in Europe while attempting to retain the championship.</p> <p>Under orders from the chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, Brian Marwood, City's football administration officer, refused to sanction the spend on Eden Hazard, who went to Chelsea for \u00a332m, Javi Mart\u00ednez, who cost Bayern Munich the same price, the \u00a330m-rated Daniele De Rossi, who stayed at Roma, and Robin van Persie, snapped up by Manchester United for \u00a323m.</p> <p>In this decision we saw City, the world's richest club, indicate theirs is now apparentlya financial policy hoping to adhere to Uefa's Financial Fair Play. Instead, in a frantic, final 24 hours of the summer window, Mancini spent \u00a338m on a second-choice four who with the earlier payment of \u00a315m for Jack Rodwell took City's total outlay to \u00a353m. In came Benfica's Javi Garc\u00eda for \u00a315.8m, Swansea City's Scott Sinclair (\u00a36.2m), Internazionale's Maicon (\u00a34m) and Fiorentina's Matija Nastasic (\u00a312m, including Stefan Savic as a makeweight).</p> <p>What City's ins and out for summer 2012 do not show is the re-emergence of Carlos Tevez as the potent force that again makes him their best player. The striker, who became an outcast last season, is now the happiest of campers, a slim-line, smiling assassin with goals in each of City's opening three league games.</p> <p>The anniversary of the Tevez-Mancini fall-out arrives on 27 September. When the Argentinian refused to warm up for a substitute's appearance in a Champions League group game at Bayern Munich an imbroglio began that became a prime factor in the failure to reach the knockout stages. The loss of City's onfield totem,, the operator who leads the charge while scoring crucial goals and who has Champions League-winning experience with United in 2008, left a gaping hole as Carlito's Way led to an early exit for the club.</p> <p>From a group that featured Bayern, Villarreal and Napoli, City crashed out to the sound of Mancini's mantra: \"Usually with 10 points you always go through, 99% of the time,\" he said, not without reason. Yet the ramifications for the Italian were still being discussed in Abu Dhabi as City's title challenge looked to have faded fatally when United rode to an eight-point lead in early April.</p> <p>A breathless, closing month that featured the Blues beating United 1-0 in the derby and a madcap final day which ended in Sergio Ag\u00fcero's dying-seconds winner to claim a first championship in 44 years closed the debate over Mancini's future.</p> <p>With a fresh, five-year contract now signed, he will feel financially robust. But his career prospects at the club rest on continued advancement and success. Until City have at least one European Champions League trophy in the cabinet, they remain below the domestic elite. Chelsea's first triumph last year attained the holy grail for their own billionaire benefactor, Roman Abramovich. To join Chelsea and United, who have three, an inaugural European title is required. Liverpool's five trophies place them on a higher plane again.</p> <p>So as Mancini's gang of high-class millionaires take to the Bernabeu's famous turf a fascinating parlour game begins. If City again fail to last beyond Christmas, does the Italian need a second successive Premier League title to avoid a nervy summer?</p>",
  "<p>This was a radical rightwing government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/04/cameron-reshuffle-government-politics-live\" title=\"\">before the reshuffle toughened up its Thatcherite credentials</a>. From the start, David Cameron's mission was to break the postwar consensus on the welfare state that survived Margaret Thatcher. Where she privatised state-run industries, the Cameron government would dismantle the state itself. As students they hung posters of her on their walls. Now they go where she never dared \u2013 not boldly declaring it before the election, but hell-for-leather lest they only get one term.</p> <p>Yet here is the Tory party in turmoil, blaming its poor poll ratings on Cameron's lack of spine. Some seem so desperate to hold on to their seats that they even imagine the egotistical exhibitionist Boris Johnson as a saviour. How bizarre are these stirrings from the party's right. Last week <a href=\"http://pierceblog.dailymail.co.uk/2012/09/the-launch-of-conservative-voice-should-make-mr-cameron-very-afraid.html\" title=\"\">Liam Fox and David Davis launched Conservative Voice</a>, clamouring about Europe, lower taxes and deregulation, while backbench young turks of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18785970\" title=\"\">Free Enterprise Group</a> published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>, calling for much the same while abusing British workers as \"the worst idlers in the world\".</p> <p>Among the few still deceived by Cameron's soft-centred pre-election disguise are his own backbenchers. Stupidity is the only explanation. The idea that they are saddled with some milksop centrist kowtowing to the Liberal Democrats defies the most cursory glance at the Cameron record so far.</p> <p>This week in our new book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=5038495109873\" title=\"\">Dogma and Disarray \u2013 Cameron at Half-Time</a>, David Walker and I publish an interim report. As with our books on the Labour parliaments, culminating in The Verdict on Labour's 13 years, we follow the facts on the ground, the policies carried out, avoiding the political noise at Westminster. Politicians' characters are intriguing, but what matters is what they do.</p> <p>When Cameron assumed leadership of a party that had lost three elections, the focus groups warned him to embrace welfare state values. Or at least to pretend to. How consciously he dissembled we don't know, perhaps he doesn't either. He retains the misleading aura of a pragmatist, disguising the fervour of his anti-state dogma. He may be no great ideas man, but for his Tory generation it's a reflex: they instinctively breathe free-market <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek\" title=\"\">Hayek</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter\" title=\"\">Schumpeter</a> on \"creative destruction\", applying it to government itself. Their Americanism takes the form of shipping in Tea Party Republicanism \u2013 how readily they would have let Murdoch create a British Fox News.</p> <p>Only dogma explains why Cameron risks all by stripping down the NHS, Britain's holy of holies. The only serious obstacle to his intent has been his own ineptitude at implementation. Yet for all the bungled U-turns, there has been no deviation from the great austerity.</p> <p>How ironic that he should be assailed from his right. In misleading voters as to his intentions before the election, he seems not to have let his own party into the secret. They only heard they were to be disinfected, detoxified, turned green and never be nasty again. The reality of spending cuts the Institute for Fiscal Studies calls \"almost without historical and international precedent\" seems to pass by the likes of Fox and Davis.</p> <p>Let's reprise Cameron's audacity. Start with \"I will cut the deficit, not the NHS\", and \"no top-down reorganisation\". In office he has encouraged not just cuts but tumultuous change and wholesale outsourcing, this week with another \u00a320bn worth of the NHS up for market bidders. How odd that the right fails to appreciate the radicalism of what will be permanent rupture. Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Open Public Services white paper</a> revealed \"any qualified provider\" as the template for universal outsourcing.</p> <p>If his pre-election \"equality\" soundbites made his right wing queasy, in office Cameron has proved as anti-woman as any reactionary might wish: promising a third of his ministers would be women, he appointed only 23 out of 121. He promised \"the most family-friendly government ever\", and \"a more civilised work-life balance\", amid pictures of him cooking his children's breakfast. Yet the IFS finds mothers and children hit hardest, the child trust fund abolished, and tax credits, childcare, Sure Start and much more cut. On child benefit, Cameron said, \"I wouldn't means-test it\", but he did. Education maintenance allowance would be kept: it's gone. Thousands more midwives were promised, none were delivered. He signed the pledge on child poverty, yet the IFS predicts half a million more poor children. He said, \"I'd never do anything to damage disabled children\": two-thirds will lose Disability Living Allowance.</p> <p>Big Society? Charities have suffered swingeing grant cuts. No rise in VAT, he promised; it rose.

Or that&#xa0;10,000 HMRC staff are cut from catching tax-dodgers?</p> <p>The party's trouble springs not from a lack of rightwing zeal but from failed austerity medicine, and the polls are grim. Cameron pledged national debt would be falling as a percentage of GDP by 2015: it won't. Instead the Office for Budget Responsibility says net debt will rise by \u00a3465bn.

The public are deceived again if they fall captive to Johnson's wit, let alone the preposterous pretence to be an \"outsider\". They'll find him cut from identical ideological cloth as the Cameron circle: he's no maverick.

  "<p>The 36th anniversary of Mao's death, a little over a week ago, was met by official silence \u2013 but spontaneous commemorations across China, including a long queue outside the Mao Memorial Hall in Tiananmen Square.</p> <p>The next day, Wen Jiabao, the premier, spoke at a ceremony to unveil statues of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/asia_pac/02/china_party_congress/china_ruling_party/key_people_events/html/zhou_enlai.stm\" title=\"\">Zhou Enlai</a>, the first premier of the People's Republic, and Chen Yi, who took over as foreign minister from Zhou. He said: \"Old China was totally humiliated, its territories were fragmented \u2026 The older generation of revolutionaries like Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Chen Yi founded the People's Republic and ended a hundred years of humiliation in our recent national history, laying the foundation of new China's foreign relations. We must for ever remember their magnificent achievements, and study, carry on and develop their intellectual and spiritual qualities\".</p> <p>The day after that speech the Japanese government signed a deal to begin to \"nationalise\" the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/china-japan-dangerous-standoff\" title=\"\">Senkaku islands, known as Diaoyu in China</a>. The Chinese government strongly objected, and sent surveillance ships to the disputed waters. Popular feelings also ran high: anti-Japan demonstrations have spread across China, including Hong Kong. Taiwan's veteran \"defending Diaoyu movement\" has been boosted by implicit official support. Larger mass rallies could occur on Tuesday, the anniversary of the 1931 Japanese invasion in northern China.</p> <p>However, interpreting Wen's words and the mass protests in China's streets as simply nationalistic would miss the point. Rather, as the leaders well know, accumulated social discontent with a regime seen by many as externally weak and internally corrupt has found expression in maritime disputes between China and its neighbours. Some of the signs used in the anti-Japan demonstrations address domestic policies: there were even a few forbidden ones, with reference to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/36c9ffda-6456-11e1-b50e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26jgDZpNh\" title=\"\">the crushed Chongqing model</a>. Many protesters carry Mao's portrait. Voices from the top and bottom of Chinese society have coincided here to call for a return to common sense.</p> <p>Wen, by reputation the most \"liberal\" among the party's political factions, was speaking about the need to honour modern China's roots in the epic liberation struggle of the Chinese people. In the eyes of ordinary Chinese, the People's Republic has moved far from its founding promises of popular power and wellbeing, \"rising\" through hyper-growth, frenzied urbanisation and single-minded global integration, with grave moral, social and environmental costs: losing its soul while expanding economically.</p> <p>Continuities and ruptures are both evident in a comparison of the Maoist and post-Mao eras. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/09/99/china_50/deng.htm\" title=\"\">Deng Xiaoping</a>, who belonged to the first communist generation, led China's market transition immediately after the cultural revolution. The 1980s saw general living standards rise and 400 million peasants lifted out of poverty. Despite such pragmatic slogans as \"getting rich first\", Deng warned against the danger of income polarisation:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we allow the millionaires to emerge one day, our reform project would fail.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Yet, by a powerful market logic, and in the absence of determined political intervention, China did produce millionaires and later even billionaires. It became one of the world's most unequal societies. Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, handpicked by Deng as successive party general secretaries, loyally carried out the Dengist programme of \"reform and opening\". They were still idealistic communists in their respective ways and did not survive the events around the upheavals in Tiananmen Square in 1989. However, many subsequent policies, such as the integration of coastal China into the global economy and export-led growth, were set in motion.</p> <p>Instead of tackling the urgent problems of corruption and rising social insecurity that contributed to the Tiananmen upheavals, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/09/jiang-zemin-appears-beijing-ceremony\" title=\"\">Jiang Zemin</a>-<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/asia_pac/02/china_party_congress/leadership_changes/html/zhu_rongji.stm\" title=\"\">Zhu Rongji</a> leadership selected by Deng radicalised an initially socialist reform of self-adjustment. After the post-1992 resumption of \"development as the absolute principle\" (Deng), they pushed for industrial privatisation, introduced stock and real estate markets, and negotiated China's accession into the World Trade Organisation with excessive concessions. Jiang also paved the way for the Communist party to change colour. As 40 million urban workers were laid off and rural communal management collapsed, the second reform phase turned out to be an all-out neoliberal adventure.</p> <p>Since then the astonishing wealth and lifestyles of some cadres and families have become common knowledge. Officials keeping overseas bank accounts, or fleeing the country with bags of cash, fuelled popular indignation and political cynicism.</p> <p>It was hoped that Hu Jintao, the president, and Wen \u2013 appointed with Deng's approval \u2013 would clean up the mess. They proposed a \"scientific conception of development\" and a platform of people-first social policies, removing agricultural taxes and school fees for compulsory education, and working on rebuilding public medicine and social security. However, they also forced property laws on the legislature to legitimise privatisation, and stuck to a GDP-centered strategy. China is trapped in the developmentalist predicament of exploitative cheap labour, undue energy consumption, heavy pollution and foreign trade dependency. With an excess surplus capital, China's outgoing investments have also run into difficulties and tensions abroad.</p> <p>During Hu and Wen's tenure \u2013 like that of their reformist predecessors \u2013 market supremacy has relied on state sponsorship or imposition, at times violently. Senseless commercialisation in Tibet and Xinjiang, with intended and unintended social, cultural and demographic consequences, caused deadly clashes.</p> <p>With hopes for the third \"reform decade\" dashed, China's vulnerable feel the pain: the land-losing peasants; the struggling migrants and the children and elderly and sick people they left behind; and, in the end, angry strikers, petitioners and protesters. As the economy falls into a slump, the government seems to have followed every step of recent World Bank recommendations. In this month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/nov/14/apec-summits-what-leaders-wore-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Apec summit</a>, Hu reaffirmed China's commitment to further trade and financial liberalisation.</p> <p>China's post-Deng power transitions have so far been largely smooth. The processes have been modernised, with more extensive voting opportunities and consultation. The leaders at all levels have become younger and better educated, but the system still hinders able, independent candidates, and tends to promote the mediocre and obedient.</p> <p>Due to the fall of Bo Xilai in the Chongqing crisis, we already know that there will be no seamless power transition this year. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/15/chinese-leader-xi-jinping-appears-public\" title=\"\">unexplained absence of Xi Jinping</a> only added to the uncertainty. The total secrecy of politics at the top hurts the system itself by showing its lack of self-confidence and a deep distrust of citizens. This will have to be addressed by the new leaders.</p> <p>As things stand, it is difficult to anticipate any decisive change in China's political economy. Yet there are multiple factors at work: the logic of the market and the logic of bureaucracy \u2013 but ultimately also the logic of politics. Xi and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/china_politics/leadership/html/7.stm\" title=\"\">Li Keqiang</a>, the assigned premier, have been appointed through rounds of internal elections and negotiations. They should be aware of popular demands, and social movements, and become committed to political transparency and, indeed, democracy.</p> <p>And we may also expect them to tackle corruption, so as to rescue the regime for their own survival. They could begin with publicising the earnings and family incomes of national leaders and highly placed officials. They need also to revert to the minimal communist ethic of serving the people.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended at 10.30pm (UK time) on 17 September, after a partially edited version was published in error</p>",

As important as the plans themselves was the thinking behind this move.</p> <p>According to Romney strategist Ed Gillespie, the idea was to introduce the voters to Mitt Romney the man at the Republican National Convention. Now, as we are heading into the homestretch, Americans want to hear policy specifics from the candidates.</p> <p>This is interesting because Romney has built his campaign on several assumptions. The first is that voters wouldn't really be paying attention during the summer and would start to really focus on the race during the fall. Therefore, it was safe to allow the Obama campaign to outspend Romney 2-1 in several swing states \u2013 not counting assists from Super Pacs on both sides \u2013 and saturate the airwaves with ads, because nobody would watching. Romney would wait to open his wallet and launch his air attack when the voters were engaged.</p> <p>There's political science data that contradicts this theory, as does the recent example of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. Eight years ago, a shaky incumbent took to the airwaves early to define his little known and less liked challenger. Kerry never recovered. Romney is betting he'll be different.</p> <p>The second assumption is that the election will be almost entirely a referendum on Barack Obama's performance in office, and that the economy makes it very unlikely the president can be re-elected. This, too, carries risk. Romney has done relatively little to define himself or his campaign. Weak economic growth has occasionally been compatible with presidential reelection. And a large percentage of the American people still blame George W Bush for the economy. The recession didn't begin under Obama's watch, even if his policies haven't stimulated much of a recovery.</p> <p>Now Romney seems to be assuming that the remaining swing voters can be reached by filling them in on the policy details he has left fuzzy throughout the campaign. This may be due to a dent in Romney's tax advantage caused by the Obama campaign's assertions that the Republican's tax plan would raise the burden on the middle class. But there's little evidence \"low-information undecideds\" will suddenly be turned by learning how Romney would regulate energy or tweak marginal tax rates.</p> <p>The most valid of Romney's assumptions is that his problems with the conservative base limit his freedom of movement. He can't pivot \u2013 as he clearly would like to \u2013 on healthcare and immigration, and might also want to on abortion. By itself, this isn't a problem, since this is shaping up to be a base election. But it has limited Romney's ability to develop a critique of Obama that goes beyond the committed Republican voter, as evidenced even by his Cairo embassy statement.</p> <p>Internal campaign sniping aside, what Romney is left with is essentially hoping that anti-Obama sentiment is large enough to keep him within the margin of error. Then, on election day, undecided voters could break heavily enough to put him over the top. It <em>could</em> work; it could be a strategy for topping out at around 48% of the vote.</p> <p>But it doesn't seem like the ambitious pursuit of a mandate some conservatives expected when Romney tapped Paul Ryan as his running-mate.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Romney's Libya criticism could have been stronger'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's reaction to the attacks and murders of American Consul to Libya Chris Stevens and several of his colleagues was not a faux pas, as Democrats and their cheerleaders in the media claim. In fact, his criticism could have been stronger for maximum impact.</p> <p>In 1980, when Iran held 52 Americans hostage, thumbing their nose at \"threats\" by President Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan sent a strong message that was unmistakable in its resolve: when Reagan became president of the United States, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeni would face the harsh reality of what a strong American president would do in the face of a hostage situation. Reagan was Carter's opponent in the election, and the incumbent president's weakness and impotence, and their danger to America, had developed into a key issue in the final weeks of the campaign. Carter, like Obama, also had failed domestically \u2013 on the economy, gas prices, and joblessness \u2013 and looked for others to blame.</p> <p>In September 1980, Carter was leading Reagan in the polls by 8 points. But in the face of domestic and foreign policy failures mirroring those of President Barack Obama today, the incumbent lost to Reagan on election day. America's choice for leadership was confirmed as the correct decision when Iran released the American hostages, just as Ronald Reagan was placing his hand on the Bible and being sworn in as president. While pro-Carter historians have twisted themselves into pretzels trying to implicate Carter as the man behind ending the hostage crisis, the facts speak otherwise.</p> <p>President Obama has proven to be weak-kneed, caving to Islamic extremists, including al-Qaida, by perp-walking an American film-maker out of his home for producing a film on Islam our enemies in the Middle East are falsely claiming as the reason for the anti-American riots and murders across the region. But the truth is beginning to haunt Obama, as we now know the attacks were planned, and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/16/libyan-president-magariaf-military-action\">Obama administration was made aware of the impending doom</a>, but ignored the information and declined to share it with Ambassador Stevens and others.</p> <p>That President Obama chose to skip six days of security briefings during that period, and more than half in his presidency, sets him up for comparisons to failed President Carter \u2013 and for being held accountable for placing Americans overseas at risk. As it becomes apparent that President Obama misled the American public, and that Americans died as a consequence of his inaction, his presidency&#xa0;should be&#xa0;over.</p> <p>Yet the media seem to remain intent on protecting Obama, even in light of the danger his incompetence has proven to present.</p> <p>While most polls show Romney trailing Obama nationally, the most accurate from 2008, Rasmussen, shows Romney leading. However, Obama appears to have the edge in more of the key battleground states Romney needs in order to win. Despite overblown reports of the Romney campaign infighting, which nearly match recent stories about conflict among top Obama aides, the Republican nominee needs to be able to turn on a dime and fully address Obama's dangerous foreign policy \u2013 or rather lack thereof \u2013 while hitting Obama on the tanked economy, $16tn national debt, 23 milllion jobless, and Obamacare.</p> <p>In short, Mitt Romney needs to understand that the media is against him. He must not utter anything superfluous to his core message \u2013 eliminating the media's scope to focus on anything other than substance: they can't quote him on what he doesn't say. Romney's argument on substance versus Obama's lies and obfuscation will win the day.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-lewis\">Matt Lewis</a>: 'Romney now needs strong debate performances'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285840\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/4/7/1302195821539/mattlewis_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Lewis\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If someone isn't comfortable in his own skin \u2013 if he doesn't really know who he is \u2013 everyone can tell. Campaigns are similar, and Mitt Romney's campaign has been looking self-divided lately.</p> <p>Despite a few flirtations with boldness (including the selection of Representative Paul Ryan as his running-mate), the Romney campaign always reverts to passivity. This is surprising and unfortunate, inasmuch as the boldness has usually worked. </p> <p>The strategy also seems to imply a belief in the (probably) false premise that a bad economy would automatically doom Obama \u2013 and that Romney could win by simply raising campaign cash, running perfunctory TV ads, and staying above the fray and under the radar. (Today, the theory that the 2012 election is solely a referendum on Obama seems quaint. But the Romney campaign might have been the last to notice.)</p> <p>This premise has manifested itself in various ways, including Romney's single-minded focus on the economy. Supporters call this \"message discipline\", but being elected president is about more than any one facet of political life \u2013 no matter how important that facet might be. Romney's Middle East comments last week were ill-timed, to be sure, but they were at least a recognition that the 2012 campaign is also about foreign policy, national security, and yes, even social issues.</p> <p>Interestingly, the notion that a Republican could win on the economy alone doesn't seem to jibe with history. Liberals can always promise more giveaways \u2013 a fact that can make them seem more appealing during tough economic times. Sure, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980 because of malaise \u2013 but there was also the Iranian hostage crisis.</p> <p>To win, Romney must give voters a reason to vote <em>for him</em> \u2013 not just a reason to oppose Obama. He must present a coherent worldview that contrasts him with Obama's interrelated policies. It is important that we see his vision. And yes, there should be some specifics. The notion that he can skate by without providing details \u2013 that he can run out the clock and hope we don't check his homework \u2013 won't fly. </p> <p>There are three big moments in general election campaigns: The selection of a running mate, the convention, and the debates. In the next 50 or so days, Mitt Romney has to find a way to get his groove back \u2013 and this will clearly require strong debate performances.</p> <p>Despite the campaign infighting and ill-advised press conference during last week's Middle East turmoil, Mitt Romney can still win this election. Like a sports team on a losing streak things look bleak. But wining covers a multitude of sins.</p> <p>If Romney catches fire \u2013 which is still possible \u2013 his campaign problems suddenly look trivial. As they say, nothing succeeds like success.</p> <p><em>Matt Lewis is a senior contributor on politics to the Daily Caller</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Just being \"Not Obama\" isn't going to be enough'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285836\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are three changes the Romney campaign ought to make immediately.</p> <p>1) Enough with \"Obama isn't working.\" Yes, we know. It's obvious. No one needs to be reminded that unemployment is high. When you spend so much time repeating what everyone already knows, people begin to wonder if you really have that much else to say.</p> <p>2) The Romney campaign \u2013 Romney, most of his surrogates, and its ads and web videos \u2013 needs to connect the dots a lot more. If you watch Bill Clinton talk about a policy, there's a particular rhythm: first, here's the problem; second, here's what's causing the problem; third, here's what we're going to do; fourth, here's how it will work; and fifth, here's the result you'll see when it works. </p> <p>3) The campaign just needs to move <em>faster</em>: news cycles come and go without Romney managing to staple his agenda and ideas to the passing events. Last week would have been a golden opportunity to discuss what Romney really thinks of the Arab Spring: did America look at the uprisings in the region too optimistically? Is the Arab world ready for democracy, or is that just setting the stage for demagogues and/or Islamists? Have any of our public diplomacy efforts in recent years really paid off, or have they amounted to feelgood talk?</p> <p>And when Ben Bernanke and the Fed enacted QE3 last week, didn't that seem like a golden opportunity to showcase the Romney campaign argument about how the US economy is in a rut where all traditional methods of \"stimulus\" have proven disappointing? And how about the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/321107/scathing-fast-furious-ig-report-imminent\">expected upcoming release of the Department of Justice inspector general's report</a> on the \"Fast and Furious\" scandal? That's a perfect opportunity to make an address on the \"culture of unaccountability\" in Washington \u2013 found in the GSA (general services administration), as well as the DOJ \u2013 and how a Romney administration would fix that.</p> <p>Opportunities come and go.

  "<p>The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, came under pressure from both sides of the Commons on Monday to explain the continuing role of British troops in Afghanistan following the killing of three more British soldiers and an unprecedented Taliban attack on Camp Bastion, the main UK base.</p> <p>Questioned by both Labour and Conservative MPs about what purpose their presence there was serving, he told MPs that British troops were operating in a \"difficult and challenging environment\" but their task of training Afghan security forces could not be \"derailed\".</p> <p>Hammond was responding to an urgent question from the former Labour minister Denis MacShane who asked why the government was allowing British soldiers to \"be sacrificed without any purpose\". They were engaged in an unwinnable conflict to no strategic benefit to the UK, he said.</p> <p>He was not \"urging scuttle\", MacShane said, but British troops had done all they could and it was time to say it was over. \"It is over,\" he repeated, reflecting growing concern about a conflict in which soldiers were continuing to be killed for purposes which seem far from clear.</p> <p>The former Conservative minister John Redwood said: \"Why don't we end the combat duties for our troops now, let the Afghans learn the remaining lessons by experience and bring our troops home for Christmas?\"</p> <p>Hammond said the former Welsh Secretary was \"ignoring the realities of the situation on the ground\".</p> <p>He added: \"We do have a clear plan to draw down our engagement over two years. We are steadily withdrawing from combat. To give you an example, at the beginning of the current six month tour we were operating 81 separate bases ... we are now down to 34. We are withdrawing quite quickly from the combat role but we have a job to do and we will carry on doing it.\"</p> <p>Conservative MP John Baron, referring to an interview Hammond gave to the Guardian last week, questioned whether British troops should be put in danger \"for the sake of nation-building\". Hammond replied that rebuilding the Afghan state was \"part of the overall battle\" - namely, to prevent Afghanistan from being a base for international terrorism.</p> <p>Labour MP Paul Flynn also urged troops be pulled out: \"There is absolutely no reason why we shouldn't do what the country wants and bring our brave soldiers home by Christmas.\"</p> <p>Hammond replied: \"We have a legacy in Afghanistan that has been won at a great cost: 430 British service personnel have given their lives and we intend to protect that legacy by ensuring that the UK's national security interests are protected in the future by training and mentoring the Afghan national security forces to take over the role we are currently playing.\"</p> <p>Two soldiers from 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, Sergeant Gareth Thursby and Private Thomas Wroe were shot dead in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province on Saturday. They were killed at a checkpoint when a man dressed as a local Afghan policeman pretended to be injured before opening fire, circumstances which, Hammond said, made the fatal attack feel \"all the more raw\".</p> <p>On Friday, Lance Corporal Duane Groom, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, died after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb.</p>",
  "<p>When the competition is stronger, you need to be smarter, nimbler and more imaginative to survive. Pitted against the commercial muscle of France, Italy and the US, British fashion lives on its wits. And those who dismiss fashion as vacuous should know that new ideas are essential to selling frocks.</p> <p>The ideas fuelling the latest crop of London fashion week shows were drawn from sources near and far: from an east London park to Florence and Rajasthan via Outer Space.</p> <p>For Christopher Kane, inspiration struck during a walk in Victoria Park, near the Olympic Park in east London, with his sister and close collaborator, Tammy, and her baby daughter. Christopher noticed the ornate wingnuts on the ironwork of a bridge. Something about the shape chimed with his studio experimentation with taking a bow motif, that symbol of don't-frighten-the-horses ladylike dressing, as the starting point for something bold and sculptural.</p> <p>\"We started with something sickly sweet, and messed it up until we ended up somewhere darker,\" he said. With bolts and wingnuts remade in clear plastic as fastenings on ribbon folds of fabric \u2013 milk white, sugar pink and daffodil yellow \u2013 the collection took on a life of its own, a wardrobe for a pastel Frankenstein's monster.</p> <p>From the very first outfit \u2013 a biker jacket suit in white leather relief-embossed with roses \u2013 it was a collection fired with drama and perfectly pitched to please Kane's young, fashion-crazed fanbase.</p> <p>Erdem is adult and well-mannered, where Christopher Kane is young and raucous. (To signal this to anyone who hadn't picked it up, Jessie Ware joined the Alexa Chung gang in the front row at Kane, while Lady Mary from Downton Abbey observed Erdem with aristocratic poise, chaperoned by Vogue staffers).</p> <p>But the humour and detail in Erdem's clothes appeals to women whose poise masks a mischievous streak, a fact neatly reflected in the story he told backstage about the genesis of his collection: it was inspired, he said, by a 1950s science fiction short story about reptilian aliens who try to blend in as respectable women. Slivers of python were inserted between slices of lace. Fifties detailing \u2013 back vents that give a cocoon silhouette, ornate crystal necklaces \u2013 were set off-kilter by pretty colours used in deliberately odd combinations: fuschia, yellow and tangerine, for example.</p> <p>Peter Pilotto is a Dalston-based label whose graphic pieces are currently scoring high across the celebrity matrix. As well as regular glossy magazine appearances, the label was recently worn by Princess Beatrice to the Olympic Park. Peter Pilotto \u2013 a duo, confusingly, despite the name \u2013 are at the vanguard of a revolutionary London fashion movement which has reinvented print for a generation of women who considered traditional patterns old hat.</p> <p>Like Mary Katrantzou, whose weekend show reworked imagery from postage stamps and banknotes, they take a rich, cultured aesthetic and use modern technology to make it into something more accessible. Colours and patterns which once had a tendency to stifle the clothes with museum-piece nostalgia are digitally engineered into something more digestible to the modern palate.</p> <p>The latest catwalk collection showcased new latest advances in digital engineering. Working with a new software programme that enables designers Peter Pilotto and his partner, Christophe De Vos, to experiment with infinite combinations of layered patterns \u2013 a process they describe as \"a digital kaleidoscope\" \u2013 they spliced ideas taken from early English calligraphy, images from Florentine frescoes, and colour combinations they fell in love with during a summer holiday in Rajasthan. The impact of the software on these dense visuals is a little like putting reams of statistics into a spreadsheet. The finished product is infinitely more accessible.</p> <p>The effect of print layering is counterintuitive. One might expect that a geometric dark grid laid on top of swirls of bright colour would dampen the impact, but instead it seems to serve as a harness, channelling the energy of the look into something more dynamic. On dresses, slim trousers and the label's bestselling curvy pencil skirts, print and silhouette were in harmony.</p> <p>The imprint of other London catwalk shows seemed to have fed in to the collection at times \u2013 the marbling that was the focus of Stella McCartney's one-off London show in February, and the baroque sensibility of Mary Katrantzou \u2013 but the result was surprising and fresh. This collection may not match the commercial splash made by its autumn predecessor \u2013 that had a coherent, recognisable thread that this more complicated show perhaps lost \u2013 but it promises a bright future nonetheless.</p> <p>Technical innovation in print and fabric is a key factor in the dynamism of London fashion. Fabrics on Kane's catwalk this season include basketweave silks and injection-moulded rubber, while Erdem worked with an embroidery company in Switzerland experimenting with the use of classic couture techniques on modern plasticised fabric.</p> <p>Antonio Berardi, keen to show a sportier side to a label known for exquisite taste and refined sex appeal, experimented with a new Aertex-effect mesh that holds its shape while maintaining the freshness of openwork. \"The only problem is, it is incredibly expensive,\" admitted the designer after the show. \"I am always asking, how can we make this better. My pattern cutters kind of hate me, because it makes things very complicated. But my clothes aren't cheap, so they should be really special.\"</p> <p>The collection, which referenced the Chrysler building and the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, was shown in a catwalk fashioned out of the third floor of a Soho carpark, an appropriate juxtaposition for a designer who refuses to compromise on the quality and workmanship of his clothes.</p> <p>Compared to most labels on the London fashion week schedule, Burberry are in financial clover, but in the past few weeks their upbeat trajectory has slackened. Chief creative officer Christopher Bailey's response was a fun, upbeat catwalk show that wore the brand's heritage lightly. \"The environment is challenging right now,\" admitted Bailey. \"All we can do is try to have a strong point of view, which is joyous and sexy and makes people excited about fashion.\"</p> <p>The \"very British glamour\" of Norman Parkinson photos and an archive photo of an early twentieth century Burberry corset were the starting point for a collection of corsetted cocktail dresses in rustling Quality Street shades of satin, worn with capes and loose jackets of coloured perspex and luxe gaberdine.</p> <p>The much-maligned Burberry check, banished below stairs in recent seasons, was revived for tongue-in-cheek bags trimmed with neon animal skin. Bailey is optimistic for the check's future: \"I think it should be something which makes people smile,\" he said.</p>",

His plans were published in full<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203826/Michael-Gove-New-rigorous-exams-abolish-GCSEs.html\"> in the Mail on Sunday yesterday</a> and the only significant new fact in the announcement was the name of the new exam, the English baccalaureate certificate. Gove said that changing the exam would enable English pupils to compete with the best in the world.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We plan to call these new qualifications - in core academic subjects - English Baccalaureate Certificates - recognising that they are the academic foundation which is the secure base on which further study, vocational learning or a satisfying apprenticeship can be built. Success in English, maths, the sciences, a humanities subject and a language will mean that the student has the full English Baccalaureate.</p> <p>Now some will argue that more rigorous qualifications in these subjects will inevitably lead to more students failing. But we believe that fatalism is indicative of a dated mind-set; one that believes in a distribution of abilities so fixed that great teaching can do little to change.</p> <p>And we know that great teaching is changing lives even as we speak. We have the best generation of teachers and headteachers we have ever had. Their excellence combined with reforms and improvements to education that this Government are making through improved teacher training, greater freedoms for head teachers and the growth of academies and free schools will mean more students will be operating at a higher level.</p> <p>So even as exams become more rigorous, more students will be equipped to clear this higher bar. Indeed, we are explicitly ambitious for all our children \u2013 and we believe that over time we will catch up with the highest performing nations and a higher proportion of children will clear the bar than now.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove adopted a belligerent tone in his statement, accusing Labour of devaluing GCSEs by introducing modules and extending the use of coursework. But, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2162369/Michael-Gove-plans-scrap-dumbed-GCSEs-bring-O-Levels.html\">if the Daily Mail report from earlier this summer about his plans was accurate </a>(and no one is suggesting that it was not), Gove has retreated in some respects. The introduction of the new exam has been postponed and at this stage he is only proposing that pupils start studying for the English baccalaureate certificate in English, maths and science from September 2015; other subjects will follow at some unspecified point in the future.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, has said that Labour will not support exam reform that does not benefit all pupils.</strong> Responding to Gove's statement in the Commons, Twigg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The education leaving age is rising to 18, we need to face the challenges of the 21st century. But I simply don't accept that we achieve that by returning to a system abolished as out of date in the 1980s. Instead, we need a system that promotes rigour and breadth, and prepares young people for the challenges of the modern economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove said that Twigg's comments showed that Labour was failing to embrace reform.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Teaching unions have strongly condemned the plans.</strong> Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \"The secretary of state has embarked from the outset on a cynical and wholly unjustifiable attempt to discredit the quality and rigour of the GCSE qualification.\" And Christine Blower, the general secretary of the NUT, said Gove's approach was \"nonsensical\".</p> <p>That's it from me for today.

We need to raise the level of challenge in our Key Stage 4 qualifications to match the best in the world. Raising our expectations of attainment for all students will drive up standards as teaching and learning improve to <br>meet that challenge. High expectations are essential to creating a step change in standards and allowing us to keep pace with our international competitors.</p> <p>1.2. Our proposals will restore confidence by ending the perverse incentives created by the interaction of our qualifications and accountability system. At present, schools are incentivised to boost their performance by seeking examinations in which they believe their students may achieve higher grades, and Awarding Organisations have a corresponding incentive to compete for market share by <br>providing less demanding examinations.</p> <p>1.3. To remove that perverse incentive, we will move away from the competition between Awarding Organisations in the core academic subjects of English, mathematics, sciences, history, geography and languages. Instead of schools being able to choose between competing GCSEs in these subjects, a competition will be held to identify the best, single suite of qualifications in each subject offered by a single Awarding Organisation.</p> <p>1.4. We intend to use the school and post-16 accountability frameworks to incentivise schools and colleges to teach these new qualifications both at Key Stage 4 and post-16. Schools will start teaching new qualifications in English, mathematics and sciences from 2015, with students first entering the new exams in the summer of 2017. We will refocus the Department\u2019s floor standard measures which identify <br>underperforming schools to take account of performance in our new English, mathematics and sciences qualifications from 2017. The timetable for the introduction of qualifications in history, geography and languages, and the timetable for the introduction of English and mathematics post-16, will be determined following responses to this consultation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T17:27:08.519Z\">at 6.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50574f9dc0e3d221b423ae85\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T16:28:15.120Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The NUT has now issued its response to Gove's plans.

On the one hand the Education Secretary demands ever higher pass rates, yet when this is achieved, claims that it can only have occurred due to examinations becoming too easy. This is a nonsensical approach. Parents and carers know how hard their children work for GCSEs and how \u2018rigorous\u2019 the exams are. Ministers need to recognise that it is through sheer hard work and determination that pupils and teachers are achieving great results.</p> <p>What is being proposed here is blatantly a two-tier system. Pupils who do not gain EBacc Certificates will receive a record of achievement which will most certainly be seen to be of far less worth by employers and colleges.</p> <p>Placing a cap on those who can gain top grades means that many students will miss out on the recognition and opportunities they deserve and harks back to a time when only a few were expected to go on to higher education.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T17:11:57.417Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5057465ec0e3d221b423ae75\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T16:18:05.780Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Twitter comment on the Gove statement, which has just finished.</p> <p>From Labour's Liz Kendall</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/leicesterliz/status/247723105487843328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Abolishing course work in qualifications except D&amp;T &amp; art is real mistake.

And this year thousands of ordinary students have suffered because the modular design of the English GCSE \u2014 linked to the amount of coursework in school \u2014 has undermined faith in grading and marking ...</p> <p>We believe that if we remove modules and reduce coursework, get rid of the factors that encourage teaching to the test and, above all, ensure there is just one exam board for each subject, we can restore faith in our exams and equip children for the challenges of the 21st century. We will ask exam boards to prepare new tests in English, maths, the sciences, history, geography and languages, drawing on the example of other countries with the best education systems.</p> <p>We plan to call the new qualifications in these core academic subjects English Baccalaureate Certificates (EBacc) \u2014 recognising that they are the foundation on which further study, vocational learning or a satisfying apprenticeship can be built.

Continuous assessment helps mitigate against the very many personal problems young adults begin to experience more frequently after they turn 16. Too often, teachers reading this will agree, have good pupils faltered at the last educational hurdle because of relationship, family, emotional or economic difficulties. Creating a one-off exam at the very end of studies cannot be said to accurately measure a student\u2019s ability in a particular subject. This change is devoid of compassion and shows how little Michael Gove understands the real world.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://ht.ly/dLo89\">\u2022 Fiona Millar at Local Schools Network says today\u2019s announcement should not overshadow a structural problem with the current exam system.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One fact that emerged last week has been perplexing me. Three pieces of evidence; the Ofqual letters to Edexcel leaked to the TES, the testimony of the Ofqual CEO to the Education Select Committee and the findings of the Welsh government\u2019s review into re-grading all focused on the role played by KS2 SATs results in the regulation of GCSE results. Education journalist Warwick Mansell as also written an extensive blog on this here.</p> <p>This statement on the Ofqual website summarises the situation. A prediction about GCSEs is made based on the KS2 results of the cohort in question. If that cohort exceeds expectations then the English exam regulator forces down the GCSE grades to bring them into line with predictions ...</p> <p>But if GCSE results are based on KS2 predictions, how can schools do what is expected of them in terms of the performance tables, RAISEonline and Ofsted? All these key measures of accountability rest on how well schools enable their pupils to make progress from KS2.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50572cfcc0e3eb823e694807\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T14:00:31.698Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from Greg Hurst, the Times' education editor</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GregHurstTimes/status/247693635578105856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>So the new exams to replace GCSEs in core subjects are to be called the English Baccalaureate Certificate (EBC)</p>&mdash; Greg Hurst (@GregHurstTimes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregHurstTimes/status/247693635578105856\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-17T13:48:59+00:00\">September 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T14:58:07.445Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50572caa58f9cf283191bdc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T13:59:08.316Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Leighton Andrews</strong>, the education minister in the Welsh government, told the World at One that Michael Gove's plan to replace GCSEs sounded like \"a backwards step for England\". <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-19620759#?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">There's a story about his comments on the BBC's website. </a>Here's the key quote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It sounds to me as though it's a backwards step for England to be honest.

Asked if the government would delay universal credit, he said it was \u201con track\u201d to be implemented according to the current timetable. The government was \u201c100% committed\u201d to universal credit, he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 said the government\u2019s voluntary approach to getting more women on to company boards was working.</strong> Since March this year women have accounted for 44% of all appointments to FTSE 100 directorships, the spokesman said. Women now comprise 17.3% of FTSE 100 boards, compared with 12.5% in February 2011, <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/Feb/women-on-boards\">when Lord Davies published a report recommending a voluntary approach to increasing the number of women on company boards. </a>The issue came up when the spokesman was asked about today\u2019s FT story saying that Britain will succeed in blocking an EU plan to impose a quota. (See <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/17/michael-gove-gcse-replacement-live#block-5056f36bc0e3eb823e6947ea\">10.54am.)</a> The spokesman said the government was opposed to quotas, in Britain or in the EU, and that other governments shared this view too.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street refused to endorse Sir John Major\u2019s claim that the economy is recovering.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/16/economy-darkest-moment-john-major\">Yesterday the former prime minister told the Andrew Marr show: \u201cI\u2019m not certain but I think we have passed the darkest moment \u2026 My guess \u2013 and this is something a minister can\u2019t say but I can \u2013 my guess is in due course we will find that we passed the bottom, that that last revision of GDP when we had a 0.5% reduction is less bad than we thought it was, and that we are starting on what will be a slow road to recovery.\u201d</a> Asked if David Cameron agreed with this assessment, the spokesman said: \u201cWe still think there are significant challenges for the UK economy. We are still dealing with a significant overhang of debt and the situation in the Eurozone is still very difficult.\u201d (Ever since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jan/14/economy-recession\">Norman Lamont was ridiculed for spotting \u201cthe green shoots of economic spring\u201d,</a> ministers have been terrified of expressing premature economic optimism, although <a href=\"http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=15118&amp;Title=%27Green+Shoots%27+of+economic+recovery+\">Major said yesterday said Lamont was actually right.)</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 rejected suggestions that the Department for International Development is wasting money on consultants.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204239/The-fat-cats-foreign-aid-Ministers-target-consultants-paid-500m-taxpayer.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\">Today the Daily Mail has splashed on a story saying that Justine Greening, the new international development secretary, wants to stop spending so much money on \"poverty barons\" \u2013 advisers who are \"making millions in consultancy fees from the foreign aid budget\".</a> The prime minister's spokesman said it was \"not surprising\" that a new secretary of state should want to examine the way the department spends money. But he dismissed suggestions that there was a problem. \"Our the last two years there has been a root and branch review of all our aid programmes to ensure that we are spending money in the right way and that money is going where it is most needed,\" he said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T12:07:11.622Z\">at 1.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5056fb3d58f9cf283191bdaa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T10:28:15.815Z\">11.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I'm back from the lobby.

While until this moment the Tory guns have been silent, Tory operators have not been idle. They have been carefully researching Labour\u2019s weaknesses. Lessons have been learnt from the 1996 to 1997 period when the Conservative Party never settled on a consistent critique of Tony Blair. There\u2019ll be no return to the counter-productive demon eyes campaign. There will just be three endlessly repeated messages and they\u2019ll be delivered whenever possible by trusted surrogates.</p> <p>The ammunition has been loaded into the cannons, the carriage turned towards the enemy and the command to fire will soon be issued. Target one is Labour\u2019s borrowing plans. Using estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, there\u2019ll be a campaign reminiscent of the famous tax bombshell posters from 1992. It will be directed at Labour\u2019s implicit plans to borrow \u00a3200 billion more. Target two will be Labour\u2019s opposition to the coalition\u2019s caps on benefits and immigration. Mr Osborne, in particular, sees these issues as possessing the potential to drive a wedge between Mr Miliband and Labour\u2019s heartland, blue-collar voters.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019ll be a focus on the Labour leader himself. I\u2019m reassured that the negativity won\u2019t be personal but it will focus on Mr Miliband\u2019s opposition to all of the coalition\u2019s big deficit-reducing measures. The latest polling suggests the Conservatives enjoy a four-to-one advantage when it comes to a sense that they, rather than Labour, will take tough decisions.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204239/The-fat-cats-foreign-aid-Ministers-target-consultants-paid-500m-taxpayer.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\">\u2022 The Daily Mail says Justine Greening, the new international development secretary, is reviewing how much her department spends on consultants.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An emergency audit was opened last night into revelations that \u2018poverty barons\u2019 are making millions in consultancy fees from the foreign aid budget.</p> <p>Nearly \u00a3500million was paid out last year to firms that work on Third World programmes.

This is how he replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would be advocating ramping up where we are. How you do that, whether it is along the lines of what the Turks have suggested, which is you create zones of immunity \u2013 these are questions that we should debate. What I\u2019m certainly very alarmed at the propsect of is the notion that we just leave that now.

  "<p>Russia is taking advantage of the recent bounce in stock markets by pressing ahead with the sell-off of a stake \u2013 valued at around $5bn (\u00a33.1bn) \u2013 in Sberbank, the largest bank in the country.</p> <p>The shares are to be listed in London and Moscow and will leave Russia's central bank with a 50% stake plus one share in what is described as the third largest bank in Europe after HSBC and Santander.</p> <p>With 19,000 branches across 11 time zones, Sberbank has major international aspirations and has already bought banks in countries such as Turkey.</p> <p>The sale comes as stock markets have been buoyed by the latest round of electronic money printing \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 by the Federal Reserve, although there is lingering anxiety about whether Spain will ask its eurozone partners for a bailout.</p> <p>An auction of the shares \u2013 in the form of global depository shares \u2013 was under way on Monday and is expected to close by Wednesday.</p> <p>\"We expect the transaction to close successfully given the stock's attractive valuation, the bank's strong fundamentals and improved market conditions following the announcement of QE3. Sberbank remains our top pick in Russia: we believe the lender is the best play on the underpenetrated Russian consumer lending market,\" analysts at Citi said.</p> <p>The sales being sold represent a 7.58% stake in Sberbank whose assets account for more than a quarter of the entire Russian banking sector.</p> <p>Herman Gref, the chairman of the Sberbank, said the sale was an opportunity to \"diversify\" the existing share base. \"We view this as a critical step in our broader plan to reinforce Sberbank's position as the leading Russian financial institution, and transform it into one of the world's top performing banks in terms of profitability, operational efficiency and service quality,\" Gref said.</p> <p>The sale is part of a privatisation programme that has been delayed by market volatility. Sberbank will have a regulated stock market listing in London for the first time following the sale.</p>",
  "<p>The first licence for a large-scale cull of badgers in England was issued on Monday, allowing the animals to be killed over a 300 square-kilometre area in west Gloucestershire.</p> <p>The government hopes it is the first of many licences and that the death of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/19/badger-cull-bovine-tb-spelman\" title=\"\">estimated 100,000 badgers</a> will help curb the scourge of TB in cattle, which led to 26,000 cows being slaughtered in 2011.</p> <p>Asked if the granting of the license was a positive first step in a nationwide roll out of the cull, the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, said: \"Yes, I very much hope so.\" Badgers can carry bovine TB but the scientists who led lead of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\">decade long trial of culling concluded it could make \"no meaningful contribution\"</a>, and was \"not an effective way\" to control the disease.</p> <p>\"In pursuing this nonsensical policy, the government appears to have scant regard for scientific evidence, animal welfare or wildlife protection, and is betraying farmers with a bloody and pointless slaughter that will not solve their problem,\" said Mark Jones, veterinarian and executive director of Humane Society International. HSI has lodged a complaint against the government with the Bern Convention, a European treaty to protect wildlife. The Badger Trust has also pledged to pursue any legal route to challenge culling licences.</p> <p>Paterson, a strong supporter of the cull, said: \"I want to see a prosperous, healthy badger population living alongside healthy cattle. We would all like to have a vaccine but we have not got one. So we should use the measures used effectively in other countries to bear down on the disease in wildlife and in cattle.\" The previous Labour government said an oral badger vaccine would be ready by 2015. The coalition cancelled five of six trials of injectable vaccines, and said a viable oral vaccine was \"years away\".</p> <p>The RSPB said on Monday that they would be vaccinating badgers on its land at Highnam Woods in Gloucestershire, which lies just outside the newly licenced culling zone. \"The dairy industry has endured terrible times while trying to cope with this devastating disease,\" said the RSPB's Martin Harper. \"However, we have never been convinced that the best way to help farmers is to force them to foot the bill for a contentious cull that is only expected to reduce outbreaks by about 16%. This is a lot of effort for a small gain. Bovine TB needs tackling properly and we believe vaccination offers the best hope for cattle, badgers and the industry.\"</p> <p>The decade-long trial indicated that if heavy culling was continued for years, then a 16% drop in bovine TB cases could be seen. But the new culls will use a different killing method and the cull in Gloucestershire, and one expected in Somerset, are intended to test whether the less expensive shooting of free-running animals is as effective as the cage-trapping and shooting used before.</p> <p>The issuing of the <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2012/170912.aspx\" title=\"\">licence by Natural England</a>, revealed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/16/badger-cull-government-go-ahead?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">Guardian on Sunday</a>, means the group of farmers and landowners can cull over a continuous six-week period every year for the next four years and have to kill at least 70% of the local population. \"Maximum numbers will be specified to prevent the risk of local extinction,\" said a statement from Natural England.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/12/activists-disrupt-bager-cull\" title=\"\">Animal rights campaigners are determined to halt the trials</a> through protests at the cull sites, whose location is not being made public. Volunteers plan to patrol the zones and stop the badgers coming into the open.</p>",
  "<p>British arms exports should be subjected to prior scrutiny by MPs and the risk that the weapons could be used for internal repression must be assessed much more effectively than in the past, two leading members of Labour's shadow cabinet have told the Guardian.</p> <p>A radical shift in Labour's policy on the arms trade, with tougher controls, and greater transparency and accountability, is spelt out by Douglas Alexander and Jim Murphy, the shadow foreign and defence secretaries.</p> <p>\"The Arab spring has fundamentally recast the context in which domestic and international security policy is conducted \u2026 a nation's arms-exporting policy represents today one of the most profound ways in which a country can influence events beyond its borders,\" they say.</p> <p>The Arab spring put the spotlight on Britain's arms export policy as official reports revealed that the government approved substantial exports of weapons \u2013 including guns and ammunition, as well as crowd control equipment \u2013 to Muammar Gaddafi's Libya, Hosni Mubarak's Egypt, and Bahrain, months before those governments violently repressed popular uprisings.</p> <p>The British government subsequently revoked 158 arms export licences to those countries. However, it resumed arms sales to Bahrain despite a continuing crackdown against protesters.</p> <p>\"At present the risk assessment used to determine the legitimacy of an export licence relies too heavily on retrospective assessment, primarily taking in to account evidence of a government previously having breached specific criteria,\" Alexander and Murphy say in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/uk-progressive-arms-policy-arab-spring\" title=\"\">joint article published on the Guardian Comment is free website</a>.</p> <p>\"If the Arab spring has shown us anything,\" they add, \"it is that perceived past stability is no guarantee against future volatility.\"</p> <p>The government should adopt more pre-emptive risk assessments, placing more emphasis \"on social, political and economic drivers of conflict\", they say.</p> <p>The previous Labour government increased parliamentary scrutiny over arms export licences but it was limited to reviewing ministerial decisions after they had already been taken. \"What is still lacking in the UK system is a method for prior scrutiny,\" say the shadow foreign and defence secretaries.</p> <p>\"Lessons could be learnt here from our allies. In Sweden there is an expert advisory body, headed by an independent official responsible for oversight of export licensing, which advises on delicate pre-licence decisions \u2013 before a minister has made the final call. And in the US, Congress is given prior notification of all foreign military sales over specific cost-thresholds planned for the following year and can object ahead of the government making a decision.\"</p> <p>Though Alexander and Murphy say any system of prior scrutiny must not delay decision-making, it could be an important step in increasing transparency and accountability.</p> <p>They accuse the coalition government of \"jettisoning of the leadership position bequeathed to them\" on proposals for a global arms trade treaty, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/ga/67/agenda/\" title=\"\">on the agenda of the UN general assembly this month</a>. The government's position contributed to a stalemate in negotiations in July in New York, they say. What was needed was an agreement that was \"transparent, legally binding, and [applying] to all existing and future transfer agreements\".</p> <p>Vince Cable, the business secretary, admitted to a committee of MPs earlier this year: \"We do trade with governments that are not democratic and have bad human rights records \u2026 we do business with repressive governments and there's no denying that.\"</p> <p>He was giving evidence to the Commons committee on arms export controls whose chairman, the former Conservative defence minister Sir John Stanley, accused the government of adopting a \"rosy-tinted\" and \"over-optimistic\" approach to authoritarian regimes.</p>",
  "<p>Relatives, friends and associates of hundreds of political activists and human rights campaigners held in Burmese prisons are waiting for details of a new official amnesty which, according to state television, could see more than 500 detainees set free.</p> <p>Though Monday's announcement by the information ministry did not identify the prisoners, officials from Burma's main opposition party said the move could mean all remaining political prisoners would be freed.</p> <p>The release is the latest in a series of measures by the government of President Thein Sein, who has pledged to open up the once-isolated south-east Asian state.</p> <p>It comes a day after Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel laureate and leader of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), arrived in the US for a major tour, during which she is expected to meet President Obama.</p> <p>The 67-year-old, who spent more than two decades either under house arrest or too fearful to leave Burma in case the government would never let her return, in May travelled abroad for the first time in 24 years, to Thailand. In June she visited the UK and European countries on a triumphal tour.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi was on Tuesday due to meet the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, in Washington, where, later this week, she will receive the congressional gold medal, the highest honour granted by the US congress.</p> <p>She will also visit exiled Burmese activists in New York, where she lived for two years in the late 1960s while working at the UN.</p> <p>Sein is due to travel to New York later this month to address the UN general assembly for the first time as president.</p> <p>Sein's political prisoner amnesties \u2013 alongside other reforms such as new media laws and a move to a restricted form of democracy \u2013 have helped to convince western nations to suspend many of the sanctions imposed against the previous military-led regime.</p> <p>Many of those released in the most recent amnesty are likely to be petty criminals. However, there are hopes that most, if not all, of the several hundred dissidents still held will also be freed. There are somewhere between 200 and 700, according to estimates.</p> <p>Naing Naing, a central executive committee member of the NLD, said he understood 424 political detainees were being freed in the latest amnesty and that the party was \"optimistic that these are the remaining political prisoners\".</p> <p>Thin Thin Aung, of the Women's League in Burma, who lives in Delhi, told the Guardian she had heard from friends that political prisoners were to be released. \"We should know more tomorrow,\" she said.</p> <p>Analysts say the release is aimed at preparing the ground for Sein's trip to the US. A series of top-level western diplomats have visited Burma this year and repeatedly emphasised the need to free detainees, many held after cursory trials and in poor conditions. The Burmese president will be allowed to venture outside UN territory in New York after Washington issued a waiver on visa restrictions.</p> <p>Most sanctions on Burma, which was ruled for 49 years by an authoritarian junta, have been suspended since April in recognition of its political, economic and social reforms. Washington has eased some embargoes in the past few months, including some covering investment, but the senate finance committee opted in July to extend a ban on Burmese imports to maintain pressure on the government to reform.</p> <p>Burma wants that ban, as well as similar restrictions by the EU, to be lifted in order to attract foreign firms to the country to set up manufacturing operations and create jobs for a population that is among Asia's poorest.</p> <p>Michael Kugelman, analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington, said that Sein wanted \"to demonstrate that Burma is ready to do business with the world\".</p> <p>Banks, construction firms, hotel chains and telecommunications companies, both global and regional, have already expressed keen interest in the new market being opened up.</p> <p>For US policymakers, improving relations with Burma, which has vast natural resources and occupies a key location \u2013 neighbouring emerging powers China and India \u2013 is also an important strategic goal.</p> <p>\"The US is turning towards the Asia-Pacific region in a way it has not done for a long time, but with all the euphoria in Washington about how fast these changes in Burma are happening it has to be remembered that there are still political prisoners, the army is still extremely violent and sadistic and the treatment of ethnic minorities is terrible,\" Kugelman said.</p> <p>Monday's amnesty came as Human Rights Watch reiterated calls for political prisoners to be released, accusing the government of \"dragging its feet rather than fulfilling its promises\".</p>",
  "<p>Fears of a trade war between the United States and China intensified on Monday after Barack Obama launched action at the World Trade Organisation to stop Chinese auto industry aid from threatening jobs in the key electoral battleground state of Ohio.</p> <p>With growth and jobs seen as vital in the race for the White House, the administration said it had begun a case at the WTO in Geneva against what the White House said were illegal export subsidies for cars and car parts.</p> <p>The ratcheting up of the trade tension between the world's biggest and second biggest economies prompted immediate tit-for-tat retaliation from Beijing, which announced its own WTO case against the US.</p> <p>Trade experts said the tougher approach taken by Obama came as little surprise given the high level of unemployment. No president since Roosevelt in the 1930s has won an election with the jobless rate as high as 8.3% and the labour market has proved particularly weak in the so-called rust belt states of the midwest.</p> <p>\"Export subsidies are prohibited under WTO rules because they are unfair and severely distort international trade,\" US trade representative Ron Kirk said in a statement. \"China expressly agreed to eliminate all export subsidies when it joined the WTO in 2001.\" </p> <p>Obama's decision to adopt a more aggressive approach towards China followed accusations by Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger in the presidential race, that the president has been too soft in the face of repeated violations of global trade rules. </p> <p>China's export-led growth model has resulted in a trade surplus averaging $25bn a month in 2012, attracting criticism from manufacturing lobbying groups and unions.</p> <p>Jobs in the US auto parts sector dropped by roughly half between 2001 and 2010, while US imports of auto parts from China have increased seven-fold, according to the Obama administration.</p> <p>Ohio, one of the most important of the six swing states likely to decide this year's tight race for the White House, depends heavily on the auto industry, which was bailed out by Obama following the savage global downturn of 2008-09. Polls show that Obama has a slight edge in Ohio.</p> <p>Scott Paul, executive director of the American Alliance for Manufacturing welcomed the administration's move. </p> <p>\"The facts in the case are indisputable. China is subsidizing its auto parts sector, blocking our exports, and causing significant harm to workers and businesses in our nation,\" he said. \"Our auto assembly sector, now back on its feet, could be undercut by China's cheating, causing irreparable damage to the heart of America's productive economy.\" </p> <p>The WTO confirmed that the US had filed a case against China and that the two sides would now have a 60-day cooling-off period in which to seek an agreement. If the talks fail, a panel will be set up to decide whether US jobs had been outsourced as a result of subsidies that unfairly cut the cost of Chinese exports.</p> <p>Sources said that in high-profile cases involving the WTO's bigger members consultations often resulted in failure, and Beijing responded swiftly to the action taken by Obama by challenging measures adopted by the US to prevent the dumping of cheap Chinese goods, including kitchen utensils, steel, tyres, wood flooring, magnets and paper.</p> <p>China has already won one WTO case against the US over its use of anti-dumping measures, which forced Washington to bring in new laws designed to be compliant with global trade law. Beijing today said that the new US law was also in breach of WTO regulations and affected exports worth more than $7bn.</p> <p>\"Chinese enterprises in an uncertain legal environment, in violation of the relevant rules of the WTO transparency and due process,\" a spokesman for China's ministry of commerce said.</p> <p>Obama and Romney have both pushed China to the forefront as they seek to refocus their campaigns after a week dominated by foreign policy and the protests at US embassies across the Arab and Islamic world.</p> <p>Tough action on China is one of the few foreign policy positions Romney has pushed in the campaign so far, claiming Obama's weak response has harmed US workers. The president has countered with claims that Romney has investments in Chinese companies and outsourced jobs to China while running the private equity firm Bain Capital.</p>",
  "<p>The Arab spring has fundamentally recast the context in which domestic and international security policy is conducted. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/afghanistan-protests-anti-islam-film\" title=\"\">dramatic events of the past few days</a> have demonstrated the continued volatility of the region that is home to the uprisings. We all now have a responsibility to adapt to these new challenges.</p> <p>Our foreign policy must be recalibrated as a priority, but our defence policy must not be exempt from such review. A nation's arms-exporting policy represents one of the most profound ways in which a country can influence events beyond its borders.</p> <p>Of course countries have the right to self-defence. The legitimate defence industry can save lives; it supports our armed forces with world-class equipment and generates huge skilled UK employment. But our industry is only as strong as the regulations within which it operates.</p> <p>Thanks to the previous Labour government, the UK already has some of the toughest arms export regulations in the world. But the Arab spring has once again put a spotlight on UK arms export policy. And as a party led by our values, not the bottom line, it is right we now consider how our principles can be reinforced in today's new global security environment.</p> <p>That is why we supported the government's recent review into its arms trade policy, which saw 158 export licences being revoked and increased the scope for future suspensions. But more can still be done.</p> <p>First, it is vital that the government strengthens the enforcement of the regulations already in place. Specifically, there is already much concern about the operation of front companies registered in the UK but that operate overseas with impunity. Our current system prohibits this in principle, but more must be done to prevent it in practice.</p> <p>But as well as stronger enforcement, there is also scope for more fundamental reform. So, second, the government must consider reforming the current risk assessment procedures. At present, the risk assessment used to determine the legitimacy of an export licence relies too heavily on retrospective assessment, primarily taking into account evidence of a government previously having breached specific criteria.</p> <p>If the Arab spring has shown us anything, it is that perceived past stability is no guarantee against future volatility. Given this, the government should now be exploring whether their own risk assessment policy could become more pre-emptive. This would place greater emphasis on existing social, political and economic drivers of conflict that we now know would offer a better assessment of emerging threats and danger of future instability.</p> <p>Third, as well as instilling valuable foresight in to the system, more can be done to enhance oversight. The previous Labour government took important steps to increase parliamentary scrutiny over export licences. But crucially, this was limited only to reviewing ministerial decisions only once they had already been taken.</p> <p>What is still lacking in the UK is a method for prior scrutiny. Here, lessons could be learned here from our allies. In Sweden there is an expert advisory body, headed by an independent official responsible for oversight of export licensing, which advises on delicate pre-licence decisions \u2013 before a minister has made the final call. And in the US, Congress is given prior notification of all foreign military sales over specific cost thresholds planned for the following year and can object ahead of the government making a decision.</p> <p>These systems disperse decision-making power to ensure there is sufficient supervision of executive action. Any system of prior scrutiny must not delay decision-making, but could be an important step in increasing transparency and accountability.</p> <p>Each of these changes would make an enormous difference alone, but in the absence of international agreement they would be inadequate.</p> <p>Fourth, therefore, the government must focus its efforts on securing a global arms trade treaty. A global industry requires global guidelines. It is vital that consensus is reached at the UN general assembly this month. Failure at last month's UN conference is a stain on the conscience of the international community.</p> <p>The government's jettisoning of the leadership position bequeathed to them contributed to the stalemate, and renewed commitment is now essential. We need an agreement that is transparent, legally binding and applies to all existing and future transfer agreements.</p> <p>As a nation proud of our ability to influence global trends, Britain must now prove we are also able to respond to them. The Arab spring reinforces the need for a truly progressive UK arms policy, and the government must now act to secure one.</p>",
  "<p>\"There are professions more harmful than design\", wrote the godfather of sustainable design, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek\" title=\"\">Victor Papanek</a> in 1972, \"but only a few\".</p> <p>Papanek accused designers of creating useless, unnecessary and unsafe products; of wastefully propagating product obsolescence; of creating \"stuff-lust\" that promoted materialistic lifestyles.</p> <p>As the 2012 <a href=\"http://www.londondesignfestival.com/\" title=\"\">London Design Festival</a> kicks off this week, one wonders how much has really changed. Are the objects of desire emerging from the festival destined to bulge our landfills or secure our future?</p> <p>A look at the agenda shows scant reference to sustainability so one can only conclude, and hope, these issues are increasingly integrated rather than dealt with as a stand-alone.</p> <h2>Design matters</h2> <p>The material world that surrounds us \u2013 the signs that direct us, the smartphone pages we flick through, the way we use buildings, how we move around cities \u2013 is consciously or unconsciously designed. Sometimes this has been done well, but frequently not, even though how things are designed can have significant implications for sustainability.</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) estimates that 75% of UK consumers' carbon emissions come from the use of products and services. We also know that 80% of the environmental impacts of those products and services are determined in the early stages of design. These two figures tell us that sustainability is chiefly about stuff and that the impacts of products or services are pretty much designed-in (or out for that matter) from the very outset.</p> <p>So design really does matter, not only in how we shape and order our world, but also in determining our impact on it. We've made some serious headway on sustainability reporting and monitoring, governance, production, supply chains and communications, but paid much less attention (and allocated less budget) to how we design more sustainable products, services and systems. One probable reason for this, beyond a few notable individuals, is a lack of leading voices on sustainable design as part of the broader debate.</p> <p>Though design may be guilty of past malpractice (who wasn't?), there's a growing sense that in the next wave of sustainability \u2013 focused on creativity, entrepreneurship, innovation and practical solutions \u2013 design skills will feature heavily in our toolkit. Californian design professor and Papanek contemporary, Nathan Shedroff, captured this well when he said: \"Design is the problem as well as the solution\". If environmentalism's success was in spotlighting sustainability problems to the world, the success of design will be in helping deliver solutions.</p> <h2>Why design for sustainability?</h2> <p>It may be fair to ask how much designers have earned the right to play in the sustainability space if they lack sustainability leadership. Yet there are positive signs of change, from the take-up of design methods like Cradle-to-Cradle and biomimicry, through to industry design collaborations like the <a href=\"http://www.apparelcoalition.org/\" title=\"\">Sustainable Apparel Coalition</a>. From the many thousands of designers voluntarily signing the <a href=\"http://www.designersaccord.org/\" title=\"\">Designers Accord sustainability principles</a>, to celebrity designers like Philippe Starck, Wayne Hemingway and Yves Behar pinning their colours to the sustainability mast.</p> <p>Why, you may also ask, should you turn to a designer, rather than a supply chain manager, factory manager, communications/ad agency or technologist? Great design makes the heart beat faster, solves tricky problems creatively, makes weird, new stuff seem normal, makes things cool, can make lives better and make businesses richer. Steve Jobs understood this intuitively in stating that \"design is the fundamental soul of the human-made creation\", and great design helped Apple become the wealthiest company there is.</p> <p>We now need to take design way beyond what Apple has done with it and turn its skills whole-heartedly and single-mindedly to the challenges of sustainability. We need people saying \"wow,\" \"ah ha\", and \"yes\" to really great sustainable design.</p> <h2>The sustainable design gallery</h2> <p>It's far better and easier to explain design in action, so we put together a series of 12 examples that illustrate our points about design and sustainability in more detail. The gallery chiefly focuses on industrial or product design examples of everyday products and services. Rather than exhaustively detailing these here, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/gallery/sustainable-product-design-in-pictures\">take a look at the gallery</a>.</p> <p>Design is multi-faceted, tackling many types of challenges and sustainability is obviously complex too.

It shows how the sustainability movement can get more out of design, plus the main areas and ways that design needs to step up on sustainability. Over the coming weeks I will unpack this roadmap in more detail in a series of articles covering sustainable design.</p> <p>Reading Papanek's Design for the Real World as a young design student convinced me that sustainable design was the only route for me, and I've worked in the field ever since.</p> <p>I'm hoping this series triggers two critical things among the sustainability and design communitiesFirst, that clients and the sustainability movement will turn more to designers for help with sustainability problems and look for more sustainable solutions. Second, that the design community can move beyond the image of being stylists and fashionistas, to see sustainability as the ultimate design brief.</p> <p><em>Chris Sherwin is head of sustainability at leading design and innovation consultancy </em><a href=\"http://www.seymourpowell.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Seymourpowell</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Critics like to talk about the \"films of the year\", but the awful truth is that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/16/us-police-question-film-maker-anti-islam-movie\" title=\"\">this year's most significant movie may well turn out to be a non-movie</a>, a hoax movie, a bigoted piece of poison calculated to inflame the Muslim world. Innocence of Muslims is a 13-minute low-budget video on YouTube, abysmally scripted, acted and directed; it might be risible were it not for the ugly Islamophobia which it promotes and whose effects are now being seen around the world.</p> <p>It was apparently made by an Egyptian-American based in the greater Los Angeles area, one Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, reportedly a Coptic Christian, who initially claimed to be an Israeli property magnate called Sam Bacile, using funds from \"Jewish donors\". How Nakoula actually bankrolled this film is not clear. He says his wife's family contributed the money; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/15/police-hold-anti-islamic-film-maker\" title=\"\">he himself is a convicted fraudster</a>.</p> <p>This video is routinely described as a \"trailer\" and some screenings \u2013 of something \u2013 do appear to have taken place at one rented Californian cinema, but there is no proof that audiences ever saw anything substantially longer than this, nor that there is anything resembling a \"film\" of which this is a \"trailer\". Yet the damage is done. People throughout the Muslim world are being persuaded that there is a proper feature-length entertainment, backed by Jewish donors and being watched by Americans in their movie theatres.</p> <p>The video appears first to show Christians being attacked and a medical clinic trashed by a Muslim mob in Egypt while the police stand idly by. Here is where \u2013 for what it's worth \u2013 the bulk of Nakoula's budget appears to have been spent. Then we cut to a crass supposed retelling of the life of the prophet Muhammad. Hammy and preposterous acting is the order of the day, along with crude green-screen staging. People in robes exchange wooden dialogue and gurning threats against backprojected deserts. There is plenty of suspicious cutting and dubbing; crudely Islamophobic lines don't lip-synch with what the actors are mouthing \u2013 stuff like: \"Muhammad is our messenger and the Koran is our constitution!\" It is quite possible that the actors had no idea what they were doing.</p> <p>But the really sinister thing is that all this ham-fistedness and crassness is an important sense deliberate. It has to look like propaganda for the provocation to be effective.</p> <p>Innocence of Muslims might prove, in the most nauseatingly ironic way, that cinema still can make a difference. Actually, what it proves is that the movies are still associated with an idea \u2013 the idea of America's global power and prestige. If you can produce something hinting at a film proving that this power is being put to Islamophobic uses, you can get an extreme reaction. Heaven knows there are plenty of gung-ho Hollywood movies with Arab villains \u2013 respectably produced and distributed \u2013 all feeding the disenchantment.</p> <p>Also, of course, it proves the global reach of the internet. Explosive material can be easily disseminated. Perhaps the most comparable example is <a href=\"http://www.kony2012.com/\" title=\"\">Kony2012</a>, the powerful viral video calling for the arrest of Ugandan cult leader Joseph Kony which in March this year exploded uncontrollably in popularity and resulted in its director suffering a temporary emotional breakdown. Innocence of Muslims, a thoroughly nasty piece of work, has caused something worse than this, and was intended to. But like Kony2012, it was almost certainly timed for the American election, in this case to incite Muslim communities and then provoke macho responses from the presidential candidates.</p> <p>There is naturally a great deal of ultra-dodgy stuff out there on the web, with no gatekeepers to enforce levels of technical competence or ideological good taste. All sorts of murky videos can be accessed. Throughout both east and west, a whole generation is disenchanted with conventional media and looks to the web, with its plethora of user-generated content, for explanations. There are weird conspiracy-theorist movies on the web by \"truthers\", promoting the idea that the American government faked 9/11 as a pretext to wage war for Middle Eastern oil. Well, crackpot as these theories undoubtedly are, our British and American governments brought them on themselves with their mendacious claims about WMD.</p> <p>This is what has brought Innocence of Muslims into being. Even discussing it in these terms plays into its authors' hands. Here's hoping Muslim communities can be persuaded to treat it with the contempt it deserves and that the US president and his challenger can keep their nerve.</p>",
  "<p>Efforts to force reluctant Icelandic taxpayers to pick up the bill for unhonoured deposit guarantees extended to hundreds of thousands of British and Dutch savers are to be heard in a court in Luxembourg.</p> <p>Despite repeated attempts to reach a negotiated settlement for Icesave customers, Icelandic voters have twice rejected proposals to repay the British and Dutch governments in a national referendum.</p> <p>In 2008 the UK Treasury was forced to step in and guarantee British retail deposits with Icesave, an online account offered by stricken Icelandic bank Landsbanki. The bank failed in the midst of a market-wide financial meltdown in Reykjavik that ultimately forced Iceland to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>Before the bank's failure the Icesave website had told UK savers: \"You can also rest assured that with Icesave you are offered the same level of financial protection as every bank in the UK.\" Part of this guarantee was supposed to come from a dedicated Icelandic fund, though this has never paid out and is effectively bust. Iceland refuses to stand by these guarantees and rejects findings that it must do so under European regulations.</p> <p>Lured by market-beating interest rates, some \u00a34.52bn poured into Icesave coffers from retail depositors, charities, councils and other public institutions in the UK.</p> <p>The UK has been seeking repayment of \u00a32.35bn, plus interest, representing the cost to the UK taxpayer of covering guarantees the Icelandic fund failed to honour.</p> <p>Lawyers for Iceland will argue on Tuesday that there is no requirement on the state to stand behind the guarantee fund, and, even if there were, the global financial crisis in the autumn of 2008 was so exceptional as to release Iceland from such a requirement.</p> <p>Such force majeure arguments will be fiercely opposed by the UK Treasury, the Netherlands and the European Commission, all of whom will be represented at the hearing in front of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) court. Efta is the body that ensures that four European states \u2013 Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland \u2013 conform with a raft of European Union rules and regulations.</p> <p>The European Commission is expected to tell the court that Iceland's 2008 financial crisis was not simply the impact of a global banking shock on a small economy. It has already submitted that \"the particular intensity of the collapse [in Iceland] was due to pre-existing domestic shortcomings in the banking sector, and made possible by mistakes and negligence committed by the Icelandic authorities.\"</p> <p>Iceland had allowed the balance sheets of its banks to rapidly grow to nine times the size of the island's gross domestic product. This was not sustainable and should have alerted banking supervisors to concerns that pledges to guarantee deposits were unsound, the commission will argue.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Age:</strong> Not old enough.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Imagine a fish.</p> <p><strong>How can a cod not be old enough?</strong> By being too young.</p> <p><strong>To do what? Drink fish beer?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Cast fish votes?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Have fish sex?</strong> In a sense, yes.</p> <p><strong>You're going to have to explain this one slowly.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ices.dk/committe/acom/comwork/report/2012/2012/cod-347.pdf\" title=\"\">A study of North Sea cod</a> carried out by Defra's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science has revealed that very few of them are living long enough to reach their sexual peak.</p> <p><strong>Because?</strong> We are overfishing them, of course. Left to their own devices they can live for up to 25 years. But now, thanks to decades of hauling them from the water before they have so much as imagined another fish naked, there are <a href=\"http://www.thelivingocean.net/2012/09/just-100-cod-left-in-north-sea_16.html\" title=\"\">fewer than 300 cod left</a> in the North Sea that are older than 13.</p> <p><strong>Which means?</strong> Which, since cod become more fertile as they age, means fewer experienced older lovers to populate future generations. Plucked from the sea in their millions <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/may/30/fisherman-working-life?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">by fishermen</a>, the majority don't make it far beyond their first birthdays.</p> <p><strong>Really?</strong> Really. The study looked at 500,000 fish caught in North Sea ports across Europe and found not a single adult cod over the age of 13 among them. The figures suggest there are around 191 million one-year-old cod, just 18 million three-year-olds and fewer still aged four or over.</p> <p><strong>Can't the one-year-olds just do the reproducing themselves instead?</strong> Absolutely not. The one-year-olds are just kids. Cod don't even reach sexual maturity until they are four. They need the masterful and seasoned fins of their veteran casanovas.</p> <p><strong>So how do we save these sexy older gentleman and lady cod?</strong> By reducing fishing quotas. Experts want to see next year's haul reduced to just 25,600 tonnes, down from 32,000 this year and a peak of 360,000 in the 1970s.</p> <p><strong>Sounds to me like a good deal for cod everywhere.</strong> Yep. If only we counted fish votes.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"Mrs Codinson, you're trying to seduce me, aren't you?\"</p> <p><strong>Don't say:</strong> \"Do we really want more teenage fish pregnancies?\"</p>",
  "<p>The Champions League was a tournament of surprises last season. It is futile to pretend that it revived all the romance of the competition when it was known only as the European Cup but there was unpredictability. The outcome was strange enough for moneyed Chelsea almost to pass themselves off as insurgents when they landed the prize.</p> <p>With that win on penalties against Bayern Munich in the opposition's own stadium Roberto Di Matteo overcame steep odds. In the aftermath nothing seemed quite so clear any more and that can only be of benefit to the Champions League. Illusions were dispelled and people understood that the imposing La Liga sides were not really beyond all others on football's evolutionary scale.</p> <p>Barcelona and Real Madrid each fell in the semi-finals. Their status has not vanished and Barcelona are favourites to claim the trophy this time, with Real a little behind them in the betting. Nonetheless the Champions League can be enigmatic. Wealth, for instance, is far from being the sole consideration.</p> <p>The affluence of Paris Saint-Germain's Qatari owners is remarkable, even if Uefa's financial fair play regime eventually curbs some of their extravagance. Despite that, the manager, Carlo Ancelotti, does not look as if he is expecting glory regardless of the fact that \u00a335m was paid to Milan for the defender Thiago Silva.</p> <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a 30-year-old purchased from the same club for \u00a320m, has had an impact, with five goals so far, but only one other player has scored. Ancelotti, in typically understated fashion, will still have his hopes but extravagant talk is slightly out of favour when the global economy, with few exceptions, is sluggish.</p> <p>Glamour may be less available than usual, with even Manchester City cutting back on big spending, but that could bring us a more absorbing tournament. The UK interest has been expanded a little with the return to the Champions League group phase of Celtic after a four-year absence. For them this was not simply a matter of pride or a pursuit of glory.</p> <p>With Rangers demoted to the Third Division of the Scottish Football League, Celtic will be relieved to shore up their income with a European campaign. In England modest aspirations of that sort would be shunned. While City's outlay will get closer to normal standards, the means already employed by them ought to have registered more deeply in the Champions League.</p> <p>Other clubs, however, have been able to lay down stores of experience in this particular context. From 2005 to the present there has been only a single final without an English team present. Despite that, modesty should still come readily to hand. Barcelona have been particularly fastidious in emphasising their superiority, with triumphs over English clubs in three of the past seven finals.</p> <p>There is, all the same, a hint of change in the air. Pep Guardiola has stepped down at Barcelona and, although Tito Vilanova has taken over in convincing fashion, the great challenges are still to come. While it is folly to discount Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, his Real Madrid side gave a relentlessly mediocre account of themselves at the weekend while falling to defeat at Sevilla.</p> <p>It may just have been a rogue occasion but Mourinho's inability to rouse his team to even a few minutes of high-intensity attacking was remarkable. The summer, of course, is only just behind us and there are no certain conclusions to be drawn but it does feel as if the normal preconceptions about the authority of Barcelona and Real will be under review.</p> <p>The prospects for the leading English sides look a little encouraging. Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal are all steeped in the Champions League. That cannot be said of City and therein lies the test for Roberto Mancini. Cosmopolitan though he may seem, the manager did better with the grind of the domestic front. In Champions League and then Europa League his side disappointed.</p> <p>There were setbacks, too, for an Arsenal side that lost 4-0 to Milan and could not quite recover in the match at the Emirates. Even so, the moments of dismay are offset by the general consistency, although nobody has yet eulogised one of the Premier League sides as they did Barcelona until very recently. Regardless of that, the store of Champions League expertise is still great, particularly at Old Trafford.</p> <p>Players such as Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes are certainly old but not yet obsolete. They should be bolstered, too, by acquisitions such as Robin van Persie and Shinji Kagawa, who ought to prove a menacing partnership. United's prospects must be healthy if that pairing makes people forget that Wayne Rooney is injured.</p>",
  "<p>I want to begin by making a confession: I like it when novelists are dead. I find it pleasant to hold a novel in my hand and to know that its author is no longer among us. The spontaneous sympathy I then feel for both text and writer is even a little bit more heartfelt if the book is out of print; if I had to get hold of it secondhand from one of those dubious online dealers who offer as-new copies so cheaply that the cost of delivery exceeds the now no more than symbolic cost of the book itself.</p> <p>I always read a novel which has become that cheap to the end. I feel an almost personal obligation to do so. I keep going to the very last page, even if it can't really grip me and push against my limits; even if I begin to fear that it was never, even when it was written, a good book. Then I put it in the wastepaper sack along with the newspapers of the last few days. It's a little like laying to rest a mummy that was displayed, undignifiedly and for far too long, in a museum. The memory of this good deed is the last future which, for a little while at least, we will share.</p> <p>I know that this feeling has something to do with the way I imagine the past of the novel. If I don't shy away from a megalomaniac sense of vertigo, I am briefly able to imagine the totality of all the novels ever written: thousands upon thousands of manuscripts, of which many \u2013 presumably only a minority, but still a mighty host \u2013 have become books, lingering for a time in libraries or other memories until they too disappear into nowhere.</p> <p>The history of literature tries to control this vortex of time. Where there's a twisting maelstrom of production and destruction, it claims to recognise stable linearity: beginnings; development; opposition and gain; sometimes something new, better even. Progress without end. The history of the novel \u2013 at least the history of the European novel \u2013 then turns into a tree whose growth we can supposedly reconstruct. This oak rises from the fertile soil of older narrative forms. At some point a separate sapling emerges from the epic thicket. The wood of the trunk grows stronger and harder; gradually the tree becomes aware of the tradition it forms, but also of unrealised possibilities. Grown stately and proud, it forks into powerful branches. Its youngest twigs reach further towards the light; towards new, not yet explored kinds of writing.</p> <p>I like this illusion. I enjoy the idea that I could know what is old and what is new, that I understand how the new emerges from the old. Like every illusory control of time it can help one to keep going, if one submits to it at the right moment. But there is also the fatally wrong moment. I remember a young author telling me about her collision with the history of the novel. She had written her first work of prose, a slim, autobiographical volume, in the finest enthusiasm of na\u00efve creativity. Before she tackled a proper novel, she simply wanted to see just what had been written so far. She asked experienced readers for help and drew up a list. No more than a selection from, supposedly, the most important German-language novels of the 20th century, 20 or 30 titles.</p> <p>She began in chronological order. What had been conceived as an instructive game turned into a nightmare. She had entered the forest of literature in order to collect a few fine mushrooms for her basket. But she was forced to realise that a giant mushroom rhizome ran through the gentle grove from one end to the other. A network of dead fibres, but also of damp living ones. Not everything that strove towards the light there was in good condition: much was maggot-eaten, there was much ugly rank vegetation, above all far too much iridescent beauty. In the young writer, however, the emotional surplus of yearning, anticipation and fear, the many-armed dream-catcher, which her future novel had been, shrank away into despondency and resignation.</p> <p>A pity! With a little luck things could have turned out differently. From the experience of frightening greatness she drew the fatal conclusion that whatever there was inside her, driving her to write a novel, was embarrassingly small. The shock of greatness prevented her from achieving what experienced readers spontaneously succeed in doing time and again: the fusion of one's own creative system with the structure of the text; the magnificent identification of a reading consciousness with the imagined world of the novel; the flight into a wonderful and vast expanse.</p> <p>That could be called escapism. And there are spatial metaphors that suggest themselves to describe the experience. But someone who escapes into a novel is also escaping from a particular time. Every habitual reader \u2013 the genre junkie just as much as the lover of subtle language games \u2013 senses and enjoys the fact that he is escaping that time which is constantly being presented to him as the really important, decisive one. This deceitfully dominant time format could perhaps be called \"small time\" in contrast to the grand experience of time in the novel.</p> <p>This small time has something to do with our everyday lives. And its dogmatic champions maintain that dealing with daily life prevents us from squandering our always-scarce hours on reading \u2013 never mind writing \u2013 novels. An old, threadbare reproach. But who can feel so certain of himself in this respect? A few weeks ago I was talking on the phone to an author; almost 40, his latest novel was about to appear. I thought our conversation was going to be all about this happy forthcoming event, when he abruptly asked me what kind of nursing care insurance I had. At the moment he felt tormented by the thought that in the future, in 30 or 35 years, he might be at the mercy of the infirmities of old age without appropriate support. His son would then find himself in the terribly awkward situation of having to take care of a poor, invalid writer, one perhaps even suffering from dementia.</p> <p>A few days later I started reading his new novel. I can no longer say how many pages it took before I forgot the nursing care insurance cover, but it was quite a few. On the unusually difficult way into the promise of time of the novel, I felt that what prevented my immersion was a kind of future. It's not the presence of everyday life, its demands and duties that stand in the way of experiencing a novel. On the contrary: every genuine reader knows the special pleasure that comes of escaping into the time of the novel in the middle of everyday life, in the middle of the automatically prolonged present of errands, of getting things done. No: not the present but a particular kind of future \u2013 a feeling of apprehension, a specific anxiety, indeed cowardice \u2013 appeared to me to be the time-enemy of the novel.</p> <p>So I don't believe those people who claim that unfortunately they don't have any time to read novels, never mind write them, although in fact they feel strongly drawn to do one or the other or both. Out of a mistaken sense of consideration I don't say to them: it's only your small future that stops you dedicating yourself to the bigger time of the novel. The fact that you don't allow yourself to push against your own limits is a great pity, because it's precisely the experience of the novel that could help prevent your soul being soured by too much small future.</p> <p>Four years ago, the literary editor of a newspaper asked me whether I would like to contribute to a series in the arts pages of the publication. Its title was \"The Future of Yesterday\". Short essay-like texts were supposed to discuss utopian novels of the past 300 years. I was very taken by the idea, because I looked forward to reacquainting myself with texts I had read for the first time decades before. Most of the titles that involuntarily came to mind were so-called science fiction novels from the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>Fortunately the editor didn't expect me to consider whether they contained forecasts that had subsequently come true in technology, politics or society. Only the cheap know-it-all attitudes of those born too long after would throw themselves at these novels to explain that they told of gadgets, social orders and forms of rule that have not (or perhaps even have) become contemporary reality. Indeed, I didn't feel in the least that the technological, social or political environment around me would have been the future of these novels. I doubted that these authors, like members of some literary-military special unit equipped with telescopic sights and laser pointers, had been aiming at our 21st century.</p> <p>Admittedly, as genre literature, the majority of these books had in some formal aspects satisfied the expectations of genre readers. Probably the vain desire to predict something that could still come true in the lifetime of the author had played a limited part in the writing. But this prognostic ambition had evaporated from the space of reading like some initially overpowering but ultimately fleeting perfume. How liberating to enter into the apocalyptic visions of these novels without the possible nuclear war between the USSR and the US forcing itself into one's mind. How fascinatingly open to fantasise about a fictitious cyberspace and its obscure matrix without having to see this fictitious system and its world as representatives of yesterday's or today's internet. How good, not to be the posterity of these novels.</p> <p>Relieved of all prognostic expectations they seemed to me to have gained in scope. And my reading profited in more than a futurological way from the character of our contemporary shared world: if I am not deceiving myself, then in recent decades a certain pressure of expectation has very much diminished. The novel no longer has to provide the guiding thread linking a historically tamed past with a critically comprehended present, a string of knots by which one is then supposed to feel one's way forward into the already looming future.</p> <p>I know there are phenomena which distract from this liberation of the novel. Even when I'm writing I often don't feel as free as the present-day novel actually is. The demons of small time know all about my diffidence and regularly lead me into temptation. It's not so long ago that an agency that looks after the media advancement and public future of its clients called me up. A very energetic young man got to the point right away. They had heard that my prose texts had an interesting closeness to science and technology. They had read random samples. I was the right man. An important client \u2013 a well-known German scientist, the cutting edge of medical-biological progress personified \u2013 was looking for someone who could relate in an attractive way what his research team had discovered and which was about to cause a sensation. I should immediately look at the client's Wikipedia entry. The agency had brought it right up to date.</p> <p>The Wikipedia article was very long, fairly well written and just easy enough so that with my chance bio-chemical and medical knowledge I was able to follow it. All cleverly and skilfully done. What could this established and eminent authority expect from me? The future was quickly told. Planned was a bestseller: that is, one with sales figures in the six-digit range. I asked for examples, and my caller had them at his fingertips. To my surprise these included not only popular non-fiction books but also downmarket fiction. As a professional, I would no doubt immediately appreciate that the future quite evidently lay in the fusion of up-to-date scientific topics with narrative forms of presentation. Time was short. It would be best if I could provide a written sample as soon as possible. An introductory chapter. The relevant material had already been prepared.</p> <p>In the meantime I know what I should have replied: you're mistaken, I'm not an expert provider of narrative services. I am not an expert at all. I am a very dogged amateur in the field of experiencing big time. I don't believe in the continuous progress of science; I think that the natural sciences, especially medicine, are, just like literature, a maelstrom of production and annihilation. Consequently, in common with many authors, I love doctors as literary figures. I doubt whether the latest equipment and approaches are always better than yesterday's machines and abandoned procedures. I can certainly see that there is change. But I think that most of what we encounter as new is a surprising variation on and combination of older, more or less well-remembered or even quite forgotten elements. I enjoy the phenomenon of \"novelty\" as an invigorating feeling, as hormonal agitation, but I am far from wanting to make a bony fetish of whatever's new. I would probably not buy the book that I'm supposed to write for you. And if I got it as a present and began to read it out of curiosity it would probably bore me to death. Of the many forms of future, of the expectations, longings, fears I have so far fallen victim to, the future you have in mind is among the most inhibiting. If it were to become dominant, this future-obsession would cannibalise everything that I find hopeful about writing.</p> <p>Of course I didn't say any of that. Its not often that I make grand statements on the phone. I merely said: \"I'm really sorry. Thank you very much for thinking of me. But the imaginary scope of a possible novel has begun to absorb me. It will be called 'The Future of Mars' but have almost nothing to do with what you imagine as the near future of 'science' and 'fiction'. We've simply got a small time problem here, a time problem among contemporaries. But you can certainly call me again in one-and-a-half, in two or two-and-a-half years!\"</p> <p>That time is up. That future is over. The nervous young man never called me again. I finished my novel in June of this year. The book on which I was supposed to collaborate as a ghost-writer was considerably faster. It never became a bestseller. One can now buy copies online for 99 cents plus postage. I am afraid that the experience of big time can make one arrogant towards other forms of the experience of time. Perhaps I should order a copy and read it right to the end as slowly and devoutly as possible and then also lay this narrative mummy to rest in an appropriately dignified manner.</p> <p><strong>This is a translation of Georg Klein's keynote speech at the International Literature Festival Berlin.

  "<p>Ah <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/16/nigel-slater-kitchen-diaries-2\">September</a> - the month that straddles summer and autumn; a time of big changes for food. Keats was justifiably effusive in his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jan/23/to-autumn-john-keats\">Ode to Autumn</a> depicting a season overflowing with a glut of produce: ripe apples, juicy plums, damsons and pears, gnarled orange-green gourds swelling with culinary promise, and fresh milky-sweet nuts such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/09/hazelnut-cobnut-filbert-recipes-whittingstall\">cobnuts</a> that have seen such revival in popularity over the last few years.</p> <p>I have a confession: I don't like summer food all that much. The odd <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/18/nigel-slater-classic-insalata-caprese\">heirloom tomato salad</a> is fine, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/allotment/2009/aug/04/gardens-gardeningadvice\">borlotti beans</a> woven into a minestrone with summer squashes, laced with basil and a heavy hand with the olive oil is all very well, but unless it's as hot as the Med it just doesn't taste quite right. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2011/oct/17/autumn\">Autumn</a> on the other hand, Britain does superlatively well. By this time of year I am thankful that soon I won't have to deal with the endless glut of courgettes arriving in <a href=\"http://www.riverford.co.uk/\">organic box schemes</a> or from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/apr/05/gardens28\">gardens of kindly friends</a> and that I will be able to find some greens at the <a href=\"http://www.lfm.org.uk/\">farmers' market</a> that actually benefit from being cooked.</p> <p>Talking of greens, it is the coming of the kale season that excites me most. It's one of the few things I manage to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/apr/05/vegetables.growingyourown8\">reliably grow in my garden</a> and there is something about those crinkly dark green leaves that just spells goodness (the whole <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale\">kale family</a> is full of vitamins C and K, calcium and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulforaphane\">sulforaphane</a>. If it wasn't so delicious it would rather put one off eating the Tuscan peasant dish, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/03/nigel-slater-classic-ribollita\">ribollita</a>, rich in both beans and Tuscan kale.</p> <p>Tuscan kale, also called cavolo nero or sometimes dinosaur kale in the States, is just one variety that grows well in this country. Red Russian kale with its beautiful crinkly purple tinged leaves, and dwarf kale are both easy to grow and excellent to eat. Many find the leaves bitter and chewy but it's all in the preparation, and while the current fashion is to put baby kale leaves in a salad I would rather do as the Italians have always done and slow cook hardy greens in plenty of olive oil, salt and garlic until they melt into a homogeneous mass, to be served alongside roasted meats or sausages (they have an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/24/kale-beans-salami-recipe\">affinity for cured meats</a>) or roasted pumpkin with shavings of pecorino or parmesan. Actually, even plonked on top of a slice of toasted sourdough and glossed with some good olive oil a bunch of cooked kale makes a fine lunch.</p> <p>Gourds of all shapes and sizes begin to appear around now, and with them resurface the debate about which is the tastiest. Personally I go for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabocha\">kabocha</a>, a green, knobbly-skinned beast that is almost impossible to cut or Crown Prince, a paler bluey-green in colour but similarly dense and deep-orange fleshed; Iron Bark is another good one to look out for. All these varieties make excellent soups and stand up to roasting without collapsing. For those who can't quite face the amount of flesh a large squash yields, small gem squashes are delicious stuffed with mushrooms (also just <a href=\"http://www.rivercottage.net/users/Mushroom%20Man/blog/1283949048-september-is-mushroom-season/\">also starting their season</a>), cream and garlic, and baked and served individually. For lovers of starchy vegetables other roots are also being pulled \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/15/nigel-slater-beetroot-indian-lentil\">beetroot</a> and long, slim carrots with tops still attached, and soon we'll have baby turnips too, perfect for roasting whole or braising in stock.</p> <p>And it is not just vegetables that we can get excited about this time of year \u2013 nuts might not seem an obvious British food but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2005/sep/17/foodanddrink.shopping4\">cobnuts</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/27/recipes.foodanddrink\">wet walnuts</a> are the perfect accompaniment to the hard, grainy cheeses that feel so right after a summer of oozy bries and mozzarellas. And fruit \u2013 apples are just appearing, the first <a href=\"http://www.orangepippin.com/apples/discovery\">Discoveries</a> will soon make way for <a href=\"http://www.orangepippin.com/apples/coxs-orange-pippin\">Coxes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.orangepippin.com/apples/egremont-russet\">Russets</a>, raspberries are enjoying their second crop of the year, blackberries are abundant and if you are lucky you might even spot local figs or grapes at markets or farm shops. Soon plums, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/07/damson-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall\">damsons</a> and stone fruits will be ready for crumbles, cakes and even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/14/summer-autumn-crossover-recipes\">sweetly-sharp sauces</a> to accompany the game that is just appearing: grouse, wood pigeon and guinea fowl (if you want a tamer flavour) being among the best. What do you foods do you look forward to when the weather cools?</p>",
  "<p>Rarely can a movement have been so hastily obituarised as Occupy Wall Street. The campaign that has done more than any other to thrust inequality on to the political agenda of one of <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html\" title=\"\">the world's most unequal countries</a> turned one only yesterday \u2013 yet already a would-be priesthood is reading its last rites.</p> <p>Even as demonstrators began gathering in Manhattan last Saturday for anniversary celebrations, the esteemed financial columnist Joe Nocera <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/opinion/nocera-two-days-in-september.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">proclaimed in the New York Times</a>: \"For all intents and purposes, the Occupy movement is dead, even as the Tea Party lives on.\" A similar note was struck in the news reports that dutifully totted up all the weekend arrests of protesters before bolting on boilerplate about \"a cause now on the wane\". In New York last weekend, I met a hedge-fund manager who recalled how his fellow financiers would froth themselves into a fury over the Occupiers last autumn; nowadays, he said, the subject barely came up.</p> <p>True, Occupy no longer squats unignorably in the American or British political debate as it did last autumn. Nothing I saw last weekend resembled St Petersburg in 1917. The open assembly at Washington Square Park on Saturday night was jovial but sparsely attended, posing no disturbance to the black pensioners playing chess nearby, although they might have been put out by the dancing crusties and \"tribal drummers\" at Sunday's concert. And today's big march on Wall Street was planned more as a get-together than a serious&#xa0;resurgence.</p> <p>But that doesn't justify one of the most interesting political phenomena in years being written off by many of the same folk who never saw it coming in the first place. Indeed, each time they do so, they display a lamentable misunderstanding of Occupy's strengths and weaknesses, an ignorance of how activism ebbs and flows and a complacency about the merits of its arguments.</p> <p>The most ridiculous comparison is the one Nocera draws with the Tea Party. On the one hand, you have a bunch of rightwing nihilists bankrolled by the billionaire Koch brothers and with their own TV channel, Fox; on the other, you have a rag-tag group of students, the unemployed and a few others with their own Tumblr accounts. Given their different boxing weights, it is remarkable that Occupy has managed to get as far as it has, turning \"we&#xa0;are the 99%\" into one of the most resonant slogans in campaigning history.</p> <p>Still critics carp at Occupy for \"not keeping up its momentum\", as if political campaigns ran as straight-forwardly as Frankfurt's U-Bahn. Let me cite two examples of how that is nonsense. The year before tents were pitched at Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, a US campaign called <a href=\"http://other98.com/about/\" title=\"\">The Other 98%</a> began denouncing \"the elite 2% [who] have rigged the system\". Why that flopped while another against the 1% took off is anyone's guess.</p> <p>Ultimately, the history of political activism is the history of setbacks and unexpected advance. Max Berger, who helped co-ordinate the <a href=\"http://october2011.org/blogs/margaret-flowers/world-revolution-world-revolution-day-15-october-2011\" title=\"\">global protests of 15 October 2011</a> \u2013 which included the St Paul's Tent City in London \u2013 remembers planning sessions in New York being five-strong. Only on the day, and only through watching the Times Square ticker updating with fresh protests in foreign capitals, did 26-year-old Berger realise how far word had spread.</p> <p>Finally, the dismissal of Occupy ignores what it&#xa0;has already achieved. The Zuccotti Park camp allowed hundreds of complete strangers to develop serious political arguments and strong ties alike. In the consumer onanism that is 21st-century Manhattan \u2013 a tiny island teeming with shoppers pleasing only themselves \u2013 that is no mean feat. Recently, Occupiers have begun serious campaigns against foreclosures of homes, for unionisation of workplaces and for reneging on unjust debts.</p> <p>That's not enough, of course. I would like to see Occupy engage with making positive demands about what kind of future we should have, rather than what kind of present we don't. But to expect a one-year-old movement to unfurl a detailed replacement for neo-liberalism is to ask more of a bunch of twentysomethings than we expect from trade unions, NGOs or Ed Miliband and Barack Obama.</p> <p>But what Occupy has got right is its targets. That the economic model is broken shows in the policy exhaustion of those still trying to patch it up four years after Lehman's collapse \u2013 and now retrying all the options that have failed already. Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/ben-bernanke-flakcatcher-in-chief\" title=\"\">Ben Bernanke</a> opted for a third round of quantitative easing, which will surely do more to lift gold prices than to bring down unemployment. And for proof that US politics are bust, one need only look at <a href=\"http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.4/ndf_martin_gilens_money_politics_democracy.php\" title=\"\">the finding by political scientist Martin Gilens</a> that poor and middle-class Americans have almost no influence on which policies are made \u2013 even while laws favoured by 20% of the richest Americans have a 20% chance of being adopted by politicians. He says: \"A&#xa0;democracy that ignores most of the public has a tenuous claim to legitimacy.\"</p> <p>When a Princeton professor makes statements as alarming as that, cynics would be better off directing their ire at the system, rather than any ideological naivety of its opponents. Of course Occupy, and others, will make mistakes; that's what happens when you try something new. But as the activist Rebecca Solnit once said: \"Despair is a black leather jacket that everyone looks good in. Hope is a frilly, pink dress that exposes the knees.\"</p> <p>Happy first birthday, Occupy. Keep showing your knees.</p>",
  "<p>A landmark case that could affect the fate of forests across Sweden reaches its final stage today in the supreme court.</p> <p>Environmentalists have warned that a damaging precedent will be set if Finnish company Nordkalk is allowed to carry out large-scale limestone mining in an ancient, biodiverse habitat on the northern Swedish island of Gotland.</p> <p>The planned limestone quarry would destroy part of Ojnare forest and neighbouring wetlands, a region that borders two protected areas and is so valuable that the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to turn it into a national park.</p> <p>\"We have species and habitats here that are not present anywhere else in Sweden, and in some cases not on the entire planet,\" says Nils Hallberg, a lawyer at the agency. Protected animals in the area include the large blue butterfly and Montagu's harrier, a bird of prey.</p> <p>Environmental groups have appealed to the supreme court in a last-ditch attempt to halt the mining after Nordkalk was given the go-ahead by a lower Swedish court in July this year.</p> <p>Supreme court judges will be presented with evidence from both sides today, and must decide over the coming days whether to take on the case.</p> <p>Tensions have run high in recent weeks, with activists chaining themselves to machinery to stop trees being felled, and protests including candle-lit vigils held in nine Swedish cities. \"People are very upset,\" said Elisabeth Wanneby, a member of campaign group Save Ojnare Forest.</p> <p>The main legal criticism in this case, that has been contested since 2006, focuses on the impact of the four kilometre-long and 25 metre-deep quarry on two nearby \"<a href=\"http://www.natura.org/\" title=\"\">Natura 2000</a>\" EU-protected areas, that are designed to safeguard Europe's most valuable species and habitats.</p> <p>\"We do not think that Nordkalk has presented enough scientific evidence that these protected areas will not be harmed by the work,\" said Hallberg.</p> <p>Environmental groups are concerned that mining could pollute and deplete the groundwater system that runs between the two nature reserves directly under the proposed quarry.</p> <p>They also fear for the area's unique wildlife. More than half of the world's rare yellow flower called <a href=\"http://www.nordkalk.se/default.asp?viewID=1928\" title=\"\">Gaffelfibbla</a> (<em>Pilosella dichotoma</em>) is reportedly found on the site proposed for mining.</p> <p>Carl Schlyter MEP, vice-president of the parliamentary committee on the environment, public health and food safety, has written to Janez Poto\u010dnik, the European commissioner for the environment, asking him to step in and stop the \"irreversible damage\" to this \"pristine area\" and \"safeguard the protected habitats\".</p> <p>The Swedish EPA says that if the large quarry is built it will not be able to turn the area into a national park as planned, opening the door for further mineral exploitation in the area. It could also set a precedent for similar developments near protected areas, and bring Swedish law in conflict with EU regulations, according to the agency.</p> <p>A statement by Nordkalk said: \"Before the permit was granted, a comprehensive environmental assessment \u2026 [was] performed.</p> <p>\"There will naturally be certain interference in nature because this kind of an industrial plant cannot be build [sic] otherwise. But that is what we have got the permit for. We will not wipe out any endangered plants from the island, destroy any drinking water or touch the Natura 2000 areas.\"</p> <p>There is no date set for the supreme court's decision on whether to take up the case. If the judges accept the case they are expected to halt Nordkalk's work in the area until they have come to a conclusion, which could take months.</p>",
  "<p>It is hard not feel a weary sense of deja vu at this week's announcement of yet another massive change to our education system. What with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2012/sep/12/michael-gove-gcse-grading-politics-live\" title=\"\">GCSE regrading fiasco</a> and the row over the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/17/michael-gove-school-playing-fields\" title=\"\"> selling off of state school sports fields</a>, Michael Gove clearly needs a quick political fix this autumn. But the nation's hard-working pupils \u2013 many of them now embarking on GCSE courses that the government has more or less officially rubbished \u2013 do not deserve more ill-thought-through upheaval in the form of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/16/michael-gove-gcses-o-levels-reform?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the new O-level proposals</a>, which will officially be known as \"the English Baccalaureate Certificate\".</p> <p>So what's in a name? Tabloid headlines are predictably promising an end to \"dumbing down\" and a \"return to rigour\". But thanks to widespread dismay when the O-level proposals were leaked first time round, earlier this summer, there will now be no return to the two-tier system of O-levels and CSEs that Gove clearly hoped for originally.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that makes his bold new reform neither new nor particularly bold. An exam at 16 that all can take, distinguishing the so-called academic and not-so academic in its gradation of difficulty, and its marking scheme? Barring the end of coursework, the introduction of a single exam board for core subjects and modular retakes, that sounds pretty similar to our current GCSEs.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest change, apart from a welcome end to the commercialisation of exam boards, will lie in the revised secondary curriculum underpinning the proposed new exam. Gove has always made clear his preference for a more traditionalist, linear curriculum; the fact that the government has given itself an extra year or two to devise this may, in part, be due to its recent disastrous experience of redrafting the primary curriculum.</p> <p>Two of the members of the expert panel resigned from their posts last autumn, and one, senior academic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jun/12/michael-gove-curriculum-attacked-adviser\" title=\"\">Andrew Pollard, spoke out publicly against the \"prescriptive\" nature of the proposals</a>, which risked generating a sense of \"widespread failure\" among the nation's primary schoolchildren. The appointment of Elizabeth Truss as minister in charge of curriculum and qualifications \u2013 rather than the more broad-minded David Laws \u2013 suggests that a rigid traditionalism will continue to dominate the department's thinking.</p> <p>But the real story is that, once again, a massive opportunity for genuine reform has been lost. With the school leaving age soon to be raised to 18, our system must now successfully educate pupils with a wide range of interests and abilities. The case for a massively expensive exam at 16 \u2013 once the school-leaving certificate \u2013 is no longer proven.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the international evidence on what makes a modern, stimulating curriculum \u2013 from the development of speaking skills to the encouragement of teamwork, in addition to specified subject knowledge \u2013 is being rejected in favour of an old-fashioned test that will surely turn off the majority of students long before they come to sit the 50s-style do-or-die exam.</p> <p>In its place, we need a more up-to-date and consensual approach to qualifications and assessment reform. One good place to start would be the Tomlinson proposals of 2004 \u2013 sadly rejected by then PM Tony Blair \u2013 with its emphasis on \"evolution not revolution\" regarding any major reform, including widespread consultation and trialling before implementation. And with its emphasis on a mix of academic and vocational learning, more project-based assessment, and greater opportunities for \"stretch\" for abler students, the report was far more in step with successful systems around the world than Gove's backward-looking vision.</p> <p>Much of the derision of project-based school work misses the point. The problem with the current GCSE model is not that it is coursework per se, or that pushy parents can get in on the act, but that, as part of a high stakes accountability system for both school and child, these projects too easily become part of the deadly exam factory mentality.</p> <p>Next month at the <a href=\"http://londonfestivalofeducation.com/\" title=\"\">London Festival of Education,</a> Pasi Sahlberg, the director of the ministry for education in Finland, one of the most successful systems in the world, will challenge UK educators to ditch our reliance \"on external standardised assessment instead of \u2026 school-based, teacher-led continuous assessment.\"</p> <p>This is not just common sense. It is vital for the future equity of our system. As the OECD reminded us only this week, the UK continues to have one of the most segregated school systems in the world. As our education system further fragments \u2013 the untrumpeted part of the coalition reforms \u2013 the new O-level will merely increase success for some, at the expense of the many. A sense of deja vu, anyone?</p>",
  "<p>My journey to headship so far has been long, both in distance and time. It seems ages ago that I submitted an internal application to become a senior teacher to cover a colleague who had been granted early retirement. My leadership journey has seen me teaching tamariki (Maori children) in New Zealand and being questioned in a wharenui (meeting house) on why a white man is talking about their children's education to overcoming the challenge of gaining my NPQH (<a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/nationalcollege/index/professional-development/npqh.htm\">National Professional Qualification for Headship</a>). I finally found the support from the Future Leaders charity four years ago. The charity, like myself, believes that leadership it not solely born out of the length of service, but must have clarity of purpose; in this case, that all young people have the right and ability to succeed in education, whatever their background.</p> <p>As I write this blog, I'm reminded of the post-Olympics comments on the number of our medal winners being from an independent school background. What is it that has enabled them to succeed? Is it purely a privileged background? The latest statistics say one in four UK children grow up in poverty; the UK has a greater variation in reading standards than almost every other developed country in the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\">OECD</a> and the attainment gap between children from rich and poor backgrounds is detectable at an early age (22 months) which widens throughout the education system. There are however many stories of this not always being the case. My deputy principal recently shared a story of an urban primary where staff built strong relationships with the students; created an environment where students believed in their success and set the expectations high, because of their belief that people always rise to expectations, students achieved their dreams. So is it our leadership of learning that acts as the catalyst which eventually results in bucking the trend? Do we provide that self-belief that my parents instilled in me that put me in the position to be to be writing this? My mother left school at 14 with a certificate in home economics and my father had to leave school after his O-levels because his school didn't offer A-levels, but still they raised my aspiration in education and the opportunities that it can open in life.</p> <p>This begins at primary schools, where the need for quality leadership is evident in the statistics: in 2010/2011, 58% of primary pupils eligible for free school meals (a key deprivation indicator) achieved the expected level in both English and maths compared with 78% of all other pupils, and 100,000 pupils did not achieve the expected literacy levels at all. We need to engage with children as early as possible - that means placing inspirational leaders in challenging primary schools to really have an impact on closing the achievement gap, which will impact on the student's ability to access education much later on in secondary school. Recently I had to challenge an adult who said that unless we taught the parents how to bring up their children then our results would never improve. I am an educationalist, my area of influence is the school that I lead and if our parents don't read with their children at night, then I am not going to comment on their parenting ability. I will however, identify gaps in our students' learning and make sure that these areas are taught during their school day; after all it is my responsibility to educate them for more than 20 hours a week, 38 weeks of the year.</p> <p>Leading a primary academy has provided a level of freedom that I have not had before; the freedom to lead strategies that will have an impact on aspirations. Success is celebrated at the end of the week with scholars in each year wearing a mortar board and robe, and having afternoon tea with the principal. Our academy mantra is recited during assembly and every lesson and teachers have signs on their doors which show what university or college they attended. All very small things on their own, but together they convey our focus on learning.</p> <p>So if you ask me about how school leadership can benefit children from disadvantaged backgrounds, my answer is clear: it must allow students to dream, be strong enough to make everyone believe in those dreams and focus them to achieve. I hope to lead a school where all our students leave with at least the minimum requirements in literacy and numeracy, as well as the learning skills to allow them to choose their next stage of education. A school where we as adults lead the learning using every second of the school day to teach and where you will never hear anyone use the excuse of a learners background for why they can't achieve their lifelong dream.</p> <p>Future Leaders is now offering its first primary leadership programme for 20 aspiring primary heads starting in November.

  "<p>A clear thread throughout the sixth session of the World Urban Forum, a premier gathering to discuss urbanisation and housing that ran in Naples from 1-7 September, was the recognition that never before has humanity seen such a rapid increase in wealth.</p> <p>This wealth has been achieved due to the role of cities. Yet, while cities and countries are becoming more prosperous, this growth has not been shared equitably.</p> <p>Wealth accumulated in cities has contributed to the expansion of the middle classes. Cities are offering many improved opportunities, in health and education for example. At the same time, the current economic crisis has derailed many of these achievements. This is particularly the case in terms of access to basic services, such as housing.</p> <p>The WUF stressed that adequate housing is a fundamental human right. However, it hasn't been spelled out whose job it is to guarantee it. Should this be local authorities, national governments or the international community?</p> <p>The world is rapidly and unstoppably urbanising. More than 60% of the global population now live in urban areas. It is expected that 2 billion people will move to urban areas within the next 20 years. This rapid growth must be harnessed in a positive manner. If not planned, the influx will just add to the number of slums and informal settlements, which are hard to resettle or get rid of.</p> <p>WUF participants have called for a new paradigm in housing. It should offer the involvement of all actors in urban development processes \u2013 particularly women, young people and marginalised communities. To that end, UN-Habitat has started working on a global housing strategy to the year 2025.</p> <p>Harmonising and unifying global housing data can be the first step towards this new paradigm. Various institutions and authorities have accumulated a lot of knowledge. However, most of it does not mean much to the policy makers. Urban specialists suggest using new digital technologies to create visual global mapping tools that will identify all problem areas for housing.</p> <p>Understanding that equity is context-driven, it is important to understand successful housing examples and practices. The global housing strategy can work if it relies on strong regional analysis. UN-Habitat, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Habitat for Humanity and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent have been working on formulating regional housing issues though Housing Forums. Forum for Latin American and Caribbean takes place in Bogota, Columbia, at the end of September. In 2013, similar events will take place for Europe and Central Asia in Geneva, Switzerland, and for Asia in and Pacific in Manila, the Philippines.</p> <p>Another key element in achieving adequate housing for all would be to come up with innovative means of housing finance. It is vital to develop various forms of land rights and not have a sole focus on ownership, for example; prolonged rents with guaranteed rights and strong tenure protection could be strengthened.</p> <p>A new way of approaching growing urbanisation is desperately needed and it is up to NGOs, governments and the housing sector to determine what our urban future would be like.</p> <p><em>Katerina Bezgachina is PR and media manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Habitat for Humanity</em></a><em> in Europe and Central Asia</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>The use of consultants and independent contractors by the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) is set to come under heightened scrutiny over the next few months through two separate government inquiries.</p> <p>Justine Greening, a former accountant who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/04/andrew-mitchell-justine-greening-uk-development\" title=\"\">took over from Andrew Mitchell as development secretary</a> this month, has launched an internal review of the department's spending on technical experts.</p> <p>The announcement follows <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545584/Poverty-barons-who-make-a-fortune-from-taxpayer-funded-aid-budget.html\" title=\"\">an investigation by the Sunday Telegraph</a>, which found DfID is paying hundreds of millions of pounds to a group of primarily UK-based consultants, some of whom earn six or seven-figure incomes and used to work in government.</p> <p>The newspaper, which branded DfID's top contractors as \"poverty barons\", honed in on consultancies such as Adam Smith International (ASI), which grew out of the Adam Smith Institute, a rightwing thinktank. ASI reportedly received \u00a337m from DfID last year, nearly 70% of its turnover.</p> <p>\"Several of the best-paid consultants are former DfID officials who appear to have gained substantial increases in their personal wealth since leaving the department, even though they are still doing essentially the same work,\" said the newspaper.</p> <p>Labour's shadow international development secretary, Ivan Lewis, said DfID's spending on consultants is likely to be the \"tip of the iceberg\" in a bigger push to spend less through aid charities and more via private companies.</p> <p>\"From day one in government, the Tories have instructed DfID officials to massively increase the amount of funding being spent via private companies including consultants,\" said Lewis. \"This has nothing to do with value for money and everything to do with ideology.\"</p> <p>Government commitments to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on aid by 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/11/government-un-overseas-aid?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">recently reiterated by Greening</a>, have pushed the department's ringfenced budget under increasing scrutiny.</p> <p>Last Friday, the UK aid watchdog announced details of its plans to examine DfID's use of contractors. The Independent Commission on Aid Impact (ICAI) has intended to review DfID's use of consultants ever since it was launched by Mitchell last year. But as ICAI's investigations are themselves led by consultants who receive DfID funding, the watchdog's inquiry has been postponed numerous times.</p> <p><a href=\"http://icai.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ICAI-ToRs-DFIDs-Use-of-Contractors1.pdf\" title=\"\">ICAI published an advertisement last week</a> to find a separate provider to lead its study of how the UK aid agency uses contractors to deliver programmes, and \"how this contributes to wider development outcomes and to sustainability through the build-up of local expertise\".</p> <p>The watchdog aims to interview DfID staff, experts and other UK stakeholders, and will use case studies to evaluate how the department decides when to use contractors, and how it chooses them and oversees their work.</p> <p>ICAI's work is led by a consortium of consultancy firms, three of which \u2013 KPMG, Agulhas Applied Knowledge and the Swedish Institute for Public Administration (Sipu) \u2013 also frequently bid for and win DfID contracts, creating a clear conflict of interest and pushing the watchdog to seek additional outside help.</p> <p>Companies bidding for ICAI's contract must not have carried out work for DfID or other UK departments administering British aid for at least the past five years. The watchdog aims to open its inquiry this autumn, with a final report published in early 2013.</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/09/dfid-cost-cutting-puts-aid-at-risk\" title=\"\">a parliamentary report</a> warned that the UK government's drive to cut costs could make it over-reliant on contractors and put the effectiveness of its aid programmes at risk.</p> <p>MPs on the international development select committee said their concerns about DfID's use of contractors and other external partners were compounded by the lack of publicly available information on UK aid-funded contracts.</p> <p>The select committee's report echoed <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmpubacc/610/610.pdf\" title=\"\">broader concerns expressed by the public accounts committee</a> regarding the UK government's spending on consultants, suggesting issues of transparency aren't confined to DfID.</p> <p>In late 2010, the committee warned: \"Despite spending over \u00a31bn a year on consultants and interim staff, central government departments are largely in the dark about whether this represents value for money. There are of course legitimate reasons for a department to buy in specialist skills where they are in short supply internally. But departments have become too reliant on buying in core skills rather than developing them in their own staff.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmintdev/1569/156908.htm\" title=\"\">Giving evidence</a> to the select committee in March, DfID explained it is essentially a \"commissioning organisation\", unlike the aid organisations of other governments, which often employ thousands of people.</p> <p>On Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/News/Press-statements/\" title=\"\">a statement on DfID's website</a> defended the department's use of consultants. It said: \"Organisations have won contracts to work for DfID through a best-value, competitive bid process.\"</p> <p>A department spokesperson added on Monday: \"As the new international development secretary, [Greening] is taking a close look at every aspect of the department's spending.\" DfID's internal report on the department's use of technical experts should be completed by the end of the month, but will not necessarily be made public.</p> <p>Last week, the development expert <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/10/dfid-transparency-procurement\" title=\"\">Charles Kenny argued on the Guardian's Global development site</a> that Greening was in an ideal position to add weight to global conversations about the need for increased transparency in government contracting. \"The most common argument against contract publication \u2013 that parts of contracts sometimes contain commercial or national secrets which would be complex and costly to redact \u2013 doesn't stand up,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Economists have long tried to perfect the art of forecasting recessions, but others believe there are straightforward warning signs that have nothing to do with algebra or computerised modelling. For Jonnie and Derek Keys, two Irish brothers who run a vehicle and machinery auction company in Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland, the canary in the coal mine is the spike in construction equipment leaving a country at knockdown prices.</p> <p>From the <a href=\"http://www.euroauctions.com/\" title=\"\">Euro Auctions</a> headquarters set amid the verdant drumlins and mountains ofrural Tyrone, Jonnie Keys has noticed a recent increase in the purchase of diggers, loaders, lorries and other mechanical equipment from Italy.</p> <p>\"We are already familiar with a surplus of vehicles, diggers, trucks and generators in Spain. Now we have noticed a large amount of kit for sale coming out of Italy at low prices. It's a sure sign of a slowdown, a warning light that things are about to get much worse, especially in the country's construction industry. That is what is now happening in Italy,\" Keys says as he surveys his enormous auction yard.</p> <p>From this spot in the village of Dromore, on land the Keys family has farmed for generations, Jonnie and Derek have built Euro Auctions from a turnover of \u00a34m in 1998 to about \u00a3220m last year.</p> <p>In their start-up year they organised two auctions of vehicles, plant machinery and other construction equipment; in 2012 there were 22. Their global reach extends from Ireland to a 10-hectare auction site in Leeds, and from there to Germany, Spain and now Australia.</p> <p>The past few years after the spectacular collapse of the \"Celtic tiger\" boom could have been disastrous but the brothers spotted an opportunity to increase their business.</p> <p>\"When Lehman Brothers collapsed and the recession went global we noticed there was a lot of surplus equipment about in the world. We were able to offer a service to our customers who were desperate to sell. We could take the kit off their hands, to get rid of it into other parts of Europe or to export it to expanding markets elsewhere,\" Keys says.</p> <p>Their clients range from banks that have repossessed vehicles and machinery to individuals desperate to sell in order to pay their debts.</p> <p>Even when the downturn killed off the Celtic tiger and brought the building industry to a standstill in the Irish Republic, the Keys brothers realised there was still money to make on the island.</p> <p>\"There was an awful lot of surplus equipment, some of which we had actually bought for our clients to bring into the republic, to cope with the housebuilding boom. Then after 2006-2007 we were selling that same stuff off to more robust economies like Germany. We were lucky enough in that the Germans were still buyers,\" Keys recalls.</p> <p>Now the business has gone truly global with the establishment of a base near Brisbane on Australia's Sunshine Coast. \"We noticed over the last few years by closely monitoring the buyers coming to our auctions in all our sites that Australians were increasing their presence in the market. So to meet that demand, to be close to a port, to be close to the mining industry we decided to locate near Brisbane,\" he says.</p> <p>The new base has helped feed the voracious demand for earth-moving machines, diggers, tractors, mobile drilling equipment and generators for the Australian mining industry.</p> <p>Apart from Australia's phenomenal growth, which has attracted thousands of Irish immigrant workers, there was another factor boosting Euro Auctions' expansion: the Japanese tsunami.</p> <p>\"The Australians would have traditionally sourced their equipment from Japan but since the tsunami a lot of that equipment has had to stay at home to help Japanese reconstruction. So we were able to fill a gap.\"</p> <p>They also see the new Pacific base as a launch pad for further penetration of new markets such as Malaysia, Bangladesh and the Philippines.</p> <p>\"As we speak, at least one container is leaving Dromore per day to be shipped out to these countries. And if and when the slowdown begins in Australia all the surplus equipment we have left out there can be sold into these new markets.\"</p> <p>Inside their aircraft hangar-sized headquarters, with its view of the mountains close to the Co Donegal border, the Keys brothers are installing a new hyper-rapid broadband system linked to a transatlantic fibre-optic cable. The technology will mean there is less than half a second's delay between an auction site in Dromore or Leeds to someone putting in a bid to buy in Dubai or Texas.</p> <p>But it would be unthinkable for the brothers to have their headquarters anywhere other than in the village of 1,600 where they grew up and where they still live.</p> <p>\"Whether we send out a digger to someone an hour across the border or way down under in Australia doesn't matter to us. The vehicles and the machinery have to come from somewhere \u2013 we're just happy it's from here in Dromore.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's gorgeous today in Frankfurt, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog\" title=\"\">banking blog</a> has set up camp this week. The mission: to find out how Germany's financial centre is different from Britain's.</p> <p>I went for a long walk this morning and the most glaring difference is simply size: Frankfurt is tiny! With about 700,000 inhabitants, it's a tenth of the size of London, and the place feels very much like a provincial university town with skyscrapers. In the central Opera Platz, opposite an office tower for the Swiss bank UBS, a notice was posted on a wall: \"Family of theologians with two daughters looking for 4-room apartment, maximum \u20ac1,400 a month \u2026 a garden would be wunderbar.\" It's hard to imagine such a thing in London, where vastness has bred anonymity, and four-room apartments with a garden go for the equivalent of \u20ac1,400 a week.</p> <p>In one way, Frankfurt is like any European city of its size, with a beautiful old train station as its downtown anchor. Walking into town you get the customary sex shops (\"hot women and cold drinks\"), cheap fast-food joints and Starbucks (\"celebrating 10 years in Germany\"). But as you walk on, Frankfurt (\"Bankfurt\" for some) quickly begins to feel like Dubai or some car-based city in the US. You find yourself on wide thoroughfares with two or three car lanes in each direction, plus a tram in between. Dotted on all that asphalt are the shiny buildings for Deutsche Bank, PricewaterhouseCoopers and other players in the global game of finance. (A lovely detail: they allow grass to grow in between the tram tracks, which gives off a pleasant early morning smell.)</p> <p>In the coming days I hope to speak to lots of people here, both bankers and \"ordinary\" Frankfurters, which is where you may come in. Are you working in finance in Frankfurt? Have you worked there in the past, and are you now in London? Please share your experiences and help us build a picture of how it works in Germany's main financial centre.</p> <p>You can use the comment section below or write to me directly on <a href=\"mailto:jlbankingblog@gmail.com\" title=\"\">jlbankingblog@gmail.com</a> \u2013 anonymity guaranteed \u2013 or on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JLbankingblog\" title=\"\">@jlbankingblog</a>. If you're in Frankfurt now, why don't you let the Guardian buy you ein kaffee oder Pilsner? And don't worry, after more than a year of interviewing bankers and people in finance in London I have become quite adept at hiding your identity.</p>",
  "<p>Is Britain becoming more anxious and less tolerant? The answer is that we are less keen on the idea of coalition government, we are less satisfied with the NHS - and we think there should be less spending on benefits. </p> <p>If you want to know what the UK thinks, you go to the British Social Attitudes Survey, <a href=\"http://www.natcen.ac.uk/\">run by NatCen</a>, which has surveyed over 85,000 people in the last three decades about their attitudes to government, morality, health and happiness. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://bsa-29.natcen.ac.uk/\">29th report this year</a> poses questions for politicians of all parties - and NatCen has given us key historic data for you to download and play with. This is what it shows.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"polit\">How Britain feels about politicians</a></h2> <p></p> <p>Only 9% of us trust politicians either a great deal or a lot, compared to 58% who trust the police the same amount. One in five of us trusts governments of any party all or most of the time.</p> <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, coalition government becoming a reality has not led to fondness - the amount of people who think a coalition government is best for Britain is down from 40% in 2010 to 28% - and much lower than is high of 50% in 1995. Meanwhile, only 27% want to change the voting system, down from 41% in 2010 and the lowest score since 1983.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"welfare\">How Britain feels about welfare and public spending</a></h2> <p></p> <p>Traditionally during recessions people believe the government should spend more on welfare. Not this time: only 28% believe the government should more on benefits,down on 2010 and only 1% above 2009. Before the crash in 2008, the figure was 35%.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, when people were asked if they thought the government should have the main responsibility for \"ensuring people have enough to live on if they become unemployed\", 85% of them said yes. Now that figure stands at 59%, suggesting that people are happier with outsourcing of these services than they used to be.</p> <p></p> <p>The results can be quite nuanced: people have been asked since 1983 if they thought the welfare state encourages people stop helping each other. In 2010, at the time of the last election this figure had risen to a high of 38%. It's now down to 33%. Meanwhile, 15% of the population think the creation of the welfare state is one of Britain's proudest achievements.</p> <p>There's a consensus across party support, too - with big drops in Labour and Lib Dem supporters who believe the government should be the supplier of benefits.</p> <p>But it's not a straightforward picture: After falling for nearly a decade from a high point of 63% in 2002, the proportion of people who want to see more public spending, even if this means higher taxes, rose between 2010 and 2011, from 31% to 36%. Over half (55%) would like spending levels to stay where they are.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"nhs\">How Britain feels about the NHS</a></h2> <p></p> <p>By the time Labour left power in 2010, satisfaction with the NHS had risen to an all-time high of 70%. The latest data shows it down to 58%, which is where it stood in 2008. </p> <p>People were also asked how they felt about specific services, and this shows falls in satisfaction across GPs, A&amp;E, outpatients and inpatients. The proportion of people who think things have got worse has changed too - up to 27%, which is where it stood in 2008 but not as high as the 49% of 1995. Meanwhile, ask people what the top priority should be for public spending and they say health - just above education. And 73% of people still oppose the idea of the NHS only being available free to the poorest.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"immigration\">How Britain feels about immigration</a></h2> <p></p> <p>Immigration has always been a tricky issue in British politics - and the latest figures show that just over half, 51%, of the population think immigration should reduce \"a lot\".</p> <p>Having said that, the number of people who think that immigration has had a positive economic impact has risen, to around 30%, up from 26% in 2002. But then, so has the number who believe the impact has been \"very bad\" - almost doubled from 11 to 21%. Interestingly, that view is shared by 29% of first or second generation migrants.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"scotland\">How Scotland (and England) feels about independence</a></h2> <p></p> <p>The survey also asked people in Scotland how they feel about independence - and asked people in England about the impact they thought it would have on them.</p> <p>A third of Scots, 32% believe the country should be \"Independent, separate from UK and EU, or separate from UK but part of EU\" - which is up from 23% in 2010 (in England, this is up to 26%). Meanwhile those who believe it should remain a part of the UK is down slightly, from 61% to 58%.</p> <p>The report also compares how Scots feel now with their expectations of devolution in 1997, just after Tony Blair's Labour came into power. Then they felt that devolution would be better for pride in country, standards of healthcare and the economy. All of those percentages are much lower for independence.</p> <p>It also shows that the majority, 63%, think Westminster should take the lead in defence and foreign affairs, rather than Edinburgh.</p> <p></p> <p>The survey also asked people in England what they thought about Scotland and independence. Some 30% thought Scots receive their fair share of government spending. But the proportion who thought it received more than its fair share is up to 44%, compared to 21% in 2000. And another 66% agree the answer to the so-called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jan/17/what-is-west-lothian-question\">West Lothian question</a> (<em>\"Now that Scotland has its own parliament, Scottish MPs should no longer be allowed to vote in the UK House of Commons on laws that only affect England\"</em>), the highest it has ever been. However, the majority of English people asked though that England itself should be governed in the way it is now.</p> <h2>About the survey</h2> <p>The 2011 survey consisted of 3,311 interviews with a random sample of adults in Britain. </p> <p>Addresses are randomly selected and visited by one of NatCen Social Research's interviewers. After selecting one adult at the address (again at random), the interviewer carries out an hour long interview.

  "<p>Writing about Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, the Orientalist scholar W Montgomery Watt wrote: \"Of all the world's great men, none has been so much maligned as Muhammad.\" His quote seems all the more poignant in light of the Islamophobic film Innocence of Muslims, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/islam-film-muslim-protests?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">which has sparked riots from Yemen to Libya</a> and which, among other slanders, depicts Muhammad as a paedophile.</p> <p>This claim is a recurring one among critics of Islam, so its foundation deserves close scrutiny.</p> <p>Critics allege that Aisha was just six years old when she was betrothed to Muhammad, himself in his 50s, and only nine when the marriage was consummated. They base this on a saying attributed to Aisha herself (Sahih Bukhari volume 5, book 58, number 234), and the debate on this issue is further complicated by the fact that some Muslims believe this to be a historically accurate account. Although most Muslims would not consider marrying off their nine-year-old daughters, those who accept this saying argue that since the Qur'an states that marriage is void unless entered into by consenting adults, Aisha must have entered puberty early.</p> <p>They point out that, in seventh-century Arabia, adulthood was defined as the onset of puberty. (This much is true, and was also the case in Europe: five centuries after Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, 33-year-old King John of England married 12-year-old Isabella of Angoul\u00eame.) Interestingly, of the many criticisms of Muhammad made at the time by his opponents, none focused on Aisha's age at marriage.</p> <p>According to this perspective, Aisha may have been young, but she was not younger than was the norm at the time. Other Muslims doubt the very idea that Aisha was six at the time of marriage, referring to historians who have questioned the reliability of Aisha's age as given in the saying. In a society without a birth registry and where people did not celebrate birthdays, most people estimated their own age and that of others. Aisha would have been no different. What's more, Aisha had already been engaged to someone else before she married Muhammad, suggesting she had already been mature enough by the standards of her society to consider marriage for a while. It seems difficult to reconcile this with her being six.</p> <p>In addition, some modern Muslim scholars have more recently cast doubt on the veracity of the saying, or hadith, used to assert Aisha's young age. In Islam, the hadith literature (sayings of the prophet) is considered secondary to the Qur'an. While the Qur'an is considered to be the verbatim word of God, the hadiths were transmitted over time through a rigorous but not infallible methodology. Taking all known accounts and records of Aisha's age at marriage, estimates of her age range from nine to 19.</p> <p>Because of this, it is impossible to know with any certainty how old Aisha was. What we do know is what the Qur'an says about marriage: that it is valid only between consenting adults, and that a woman has the right to choose her own spouse. As the living embodiment of Islam, Muhammad's actions reflect the Qur'an's teachings on marriage, even if the actions of some Muslim regimes and individuals do not.</p> <p>Sadly, in many countries, the imperatives motivating the marriage of young girls are typically economic. In others, they are political. The fact that Iran and Saudi Arabia have both sought to use the saying concerning Aisha's age as a justification for lowering the legal age of marriage tells us a great deal about the patriarchal and oppressive nature of those regimes, and nothing about Muhammad, or the essential nature of Islam. The stridency of those who lend credence to these literalist interpretations by concurring with their warped view of Islam does not help those Muslims who seek to challenge these aberrations.</p> <p>The Islamophobic depiction of Muhammad's marriage to Aisha as motivated by misplaced desire fits within a broader Orientalist depiction of Muhammad as a philanderer. This idea dates back to the crusades. According to the academic Kecia Ali: \"Accusations of lust and sensuality were a regular feature of medieval attacks on the prophet's character and, by extension, on the authenticity of Islam.\"</p> <p>Since the early Christians heralded Christ as a model of celibate virtue, Muhammad \u2013 who had married several times \u2013 was deemed to be driven by sinful lust. This portrayal ignored the fact that before his marriage to Aisha, Muhammad had been married to Khadija, a powerful businesswoman 15 years his senior, for 25 years. When she died, he was devastated and friends encouraged him to remarry. A female acquaintance suggested Aisha, a bright and vivacious character.</p> <p>Aisha's union would also have cemented Muhammad's longstanding friendship with her father, Abu Bakr. As was the tradition in Arabia (and still is in some parts of the world today), marriage typically served a social and political function \u2013 a way of uniting tribes, resolving feuds, caring for widows and orphans, and generally strengthening bonds in a highly unstable and changing political environment. Of the women Muhammad married, the majority were widows. To consider the marriages of the prophet outside of these calculations is profoundly ahistorical.</p> <p>What the records are clear on is that Muhammad and Aisha had a loving and egalitarian relationship, which set the standard for reciprocity, tenderness and respect enjoined by the Qur'an. Insights into their relationship, such as the fact they liked to drink out of the same cup or race one another, are indicative of a deep connection which belies any misrepresentation of their relationship.</p> <p>To paint Aisha as a victim is completely at odds with her persona. She was certainly no wallflower. During a controversial battle in Muslim history, she emerged riding a camel to lead the troops. She was known for her assertive temperament and mischievous sense of humour \u2013 with Muhammad sometimes bearing the brunt of the jokes. During his lifetime, he established her authority by telling Muslims to consult her in his absence; after his death, she went to be become one of the most prolific and distinguished scholars of her time.</p> <p>A stateswoman, scholar, mufti, and judge, Aisha combined spirituality, activism and knowledge and remains a role model for many Muslim women today. The gulf between her true legacy and her depiction in Islamophobic materials is not merely historically inaccurate, it is an insult to the memory of a pioneering woman.</p> <p>Those who manipulate her story to justify the abuse of young girls, and those who manipulate it in order to depict Islam as a religion that legitimises such abuse have more in common than they think. Both demonstrate a disregard for what we know about the times in which Muhammad lived, and for the affirmation of female autonomy which her story illustrates.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2012. It originally stated that King John was 44 when he married Isabella of Angoul\u00eame. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Changes in how universities and research are funded has meant that there are fewer permanent, full-time posts available. In addition to the reduction in the number of posts, the perceived value of having a career in higher education has changed over the last 30 years. In all, the career progression options for an ambitious academic has also evolved and any academic intending to thrive in this environment needs to be aware of the changes and plot out the options available to them.</p> <p>In the past, when academics looked at their career progression, there were clear cut stages of development. An individual who is intelligent, hard working, and got along with their colleagues, would work through those stages: starting with a PhD and moving into post-doctoral work. They would then move into teaching and lecturing, with the ultimate aim of becoming a professor with a research team of their own. While the career path is no longer that straightforward, there are still options for those who are committed to a career in academia.</p> <p>One way is to embrace and pursue a career as a global researcher, operating in an international context. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to be the absolute leader in your field. The global research market is very competitive, so for an academic unable to compete in an international arena, this may not be the best option.</p> <p>For those who are building an international reputation, there is also the option <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/12/famous-academic-historians\" title=\"\">of becoming a television or 'media don'</a> \u2013 an intellectual who is active in the public eye. These individuals not only need to be leaders in their field, but must get to a stage where they become a \"brand\" in their own right.</p> <p>So what are the options for academics who neither want a career abroad or on TV? One feasible career move is to cross over into higher education management and consider roles such as dean or vice-chancellor, which were traditionally the preserve of academics nearing the end of their career. But a career in management is by no means the easy option. It requires diplomacy, the ability to not only to work well in a team, but to also motivate others and be astute in (or at least able to grapple simultaneously with) multiple issues outside the area of one's expertise. With the academic career built on a single-minded dedication to teaching and research, the above skills are harder to acquire than they may appear.</p> <p>Whichever career path an individual takes, wider changes in the sector will have a number of implications for individual lifestyles and relationships. Ultimately, academics will need to go where the money is. This means that they will find less stability in their working lives. They are likely to end up taking on a number of part-time contracts at different institutions at the same time, or temporary contracts one after another. This can to lead to frustrations rooted in the challenges of balancing the need for a career with the need for a stable personal life.</p> <p>Who then will be most affected by the changing landscape? It is the new generation of academics who are most likely to bear the brunt of the current changes, but they are also the ones best able to adapt to the fast evolving demands of their roles. With the right support, postdoctoral and early career researchers are likely to have the flexibility to keep pace with the changes and progress to dean or vice-chancellor.</p> <p>For all though, it's clear that there are difficult times ahead. But a career in academia can still be rewarding \u2013 and with all the young people progressing through from schools or the need for innovative ideas to revive the economy, the role of the academic has never been more needed as it is today.</p> <p><em>Claire Arnold is a founding partner of </em><a href=\"http://www.maxximconsulting.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Maxxim Consulting</em></a><em> and specialises in organisational strategy, change management and leadership development for higher education</em></p> <p><em>Editor's note: This is an edited version of a longer article written by the author</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The leading German banker did not mince his words. Answering questions about whether his government was prepared to dig deep to save the eurozone from destruction, he said Berlin would insist on stringent conditions in exchange for financial help: \"You can't just hand over your chequebook and let somebody else spend your money.\"</p> <p>That sentence speaks volumes about the way economics has changed the dynamics of eurozone politics. Germany is not just Europe's biggest economy. It has made itself more competitive over the past decade through the sort of hardline structural reforms it now wants to see in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The message from the eurozone's paymaster is simple: if we can do it, so can you.</p> <p>Three separate factors explain why Germany carries such clout. Firstly, there is the country's powerful economic base \u2013 a web of small, medium and large companies that have access to long-term finance, boast highly skilled workers and have spent decades investing in product development and after-sales service.</p> <p>Second, there are the steps taken since the creation of the single currency to make Germany more competitive. Trade unions accepted low pay deals that resulted in real living standards rising much more slowly than in Britain, France or the United States. The Hartz reforms made the labour market more flexible, allowing German firms to undercut their foreign rivals.</p> <p>Finally, the shift in global economic power from west to east has played to Germany's strengths. Countries such as China and India are looking to build up their manufacturing sectors. To do that they need the capital goods that are the speciality of the often family-run businesses of Germany's <em>Mittelstand</em>.</p> <p>For the time being, though, comparisons with the postwar <em>Wirtschaftswunder</em> \u2013 or \"miracle economy\" \u2013 do not stack up. The rapid expansion in the decades after the second world war resulted in rising real incomes as the proceeds of growth went to both capital and labour. Over the past decade, it has been the factory owners that have reaped the rewards from supply-side reforms in terms of higher profits. Real income growth has been weak.</p> <p>What's more, the economic climate \u2013 notwithstanding the emergence of China, India and Brazil as economic superpowers \u2013 is less benign than it was in the 1950s and 60s. The eurozone's sovereign debt crisis has been rumbling on for almost three years, and Germany is not immune. The latest data showed that Germany's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2012, but business surveys suggest a slowdown in the second half of the year.</p> <p>By comparison with the rest of the eurozone, Germany's recent economic performance has looked good. But compared with the days of Konrad Adenauer, Ludwig Erhard or Willy Brandt, it has been unimpressive. For much of the past decade, German banks were as reckless as their American and British counterparts, shifting capital abroad to finance housing bubbles in Spain and Greece. Investment in domestic industry was weak until the advent of the sovereign debt crisis prompted a much more conservative approach to lending.</p> <p>\"It is a myth that the German economy has gained from euro membership,\" said Charles Dumas, of Lombard Street Research. \"Its growth has decelerated. Its growth of productivity has halved. Its citizens have accepted severe wage restraint without the former benefit of a rising currency, leading to negligible gains in consumer welfare. The undervaluation granted by their wage restraint has benefited producers artificially, and weakened the incentive to cut out waste \u2013 hence lower productivity growth.\"</p> <p>Even so, Germany's economic clout means Angela Merkel has an effective veto on the proposals canvassed for sorting out the problems of monetary union. None of these are cost-free. One option would be for Germany to sanction an increase in inflation, making it less painful for the poorer southern European economies to adjust. That is anathema, as is the notion of writing blank cheques in a repeat of the transfer payments to the east following reunification.</p> <p>Breaking up the euro is also unthinkable, which means Merkel's only feasible option is to turn Germany's postwar foreign policy on its head. Instead of making Germany more European, henceforth the rest of Europe will be made more German.</p>",
  "<p>With his background as an entrepreneur, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/11/peter-bazalgette-big-brother-challenge?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">newly appointed chair at ACE Peter Bazalgette</a> will no doubt encourage arts organisations to think more commercially about ways in which they can earn, rather than raise their income. Indeed, there is a growing recognition within our sector that in the golden years of arts funding we perhaps overlooked the significant income generating potential of our work, beyond selling tickets and hiring out spaces.</p> <p>Funding agencies too are beginning to favour one-off investments that will make arts organisations self-sustaining in the future; supporting initiatives that look to earn income through intellectual property and cultural assets. Gradually the question is being asked: rather than asking money for what we do, is it not better to earn money from what we know?</p> <p>The process of thinking more commercially can throw up all sorts of questions around how you position your organisation and products. For example, it would be natural to assume that you should focus on your audience as your biggest customer and your brand as your biggest selling point. How better to promote your new enterprise than to draw on the solid artistic reputation and following you have painstakingly developed over the years?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iniva.org/\" title=\"\">At Iniva</a> (Institute of International Visual Arts) we're experiencing something interesting that challenges this assumption. For over 20 years, we have operated at the cutting edge of global contemporary art \u2013 producing exhibitions, publications and research around international and culturally diverse artists. In doing so we have gained an audience interested in global artistic practice who visit our exhibitions, talks and library.</p> <p>However, in recent years, working in partnership with educational therapy service <a href=\"http://www.aspaceinhackney.org/index.html\" title=\"\">A Space</a>, we have also been producing a series of resources that draw on the imagery of contemporary art to support emotional and creative learning. These emotional learning cards were initially devised as a way for us to promote the work of artists from diverse backgrounds and we sold them as we would any publication \u2013 through our website, venue and distributors.</p> <p>A year ago we started to look at releasing a new set of cards but were concerned that sales of the existing sets were not fulfilling their potential. We decided to do some investigative work into who was buying them.</p> <p>Our findings were intriguing: we realised that those who were coming to our website to buy the cards were not our usual audience. They were teachers, therapists, counsellors and parents who had heard about our resources through word of mouth. We started to wonder whether to use the existing Iniva brand and website was the right approach to selling the cards. Wouldn't it be better to create a new website that targeted more directly our newly discovered market?</p> <p>We decided to test this idea and developed a new brand and website: Iniva Creative Learning.</p> <p>If you compare our <a href=\"http://inivacreativelearning.org/\" title=\"\">Creative Learning website</a> with our <a href=\"http://www.iniva.org/\" title=\"\">main website</a> you can see how the two brands differ in their messages and approach. Creating this difference was quite a challenge. We went through an extensive process of sifting and simplifying our language; challenging ourselves to discover ways of talking about art that would be relevant and appealing to our new customer while also giving them the information they needed.</p> <p>The main Iniva website offers a wealth of information for the visitor to pick and choose from: upcoming events, an image and audio archive of work, and information on our venue and library. In contrast, the new site directs the visitor straight to our products. All the information on the website is purposed to the act of buying our resources. Again, as an organisation more attuned to sharing ideas than selling products, this has at times felt alien.</p> <p>However, since the second site went live in May, the increase in sales has been remarkable. With a little online marketing we immediately went from selling two to three products a week to two to three products a day \u2013 within six weeks sales had increased by 300%. After posting a few blogs on various therapy related sites, we've suddenly found a surge of interest from American therapists and counsellors \u2013 a market that is not insubstantial.</p> <p>Of those who have bought our resources, 50% classify themselves as mental health workers, 35% are teachers and the remaining 15% arts educators, parents and \"others\" \u2013 with only one or two exceptions they are an entirely different set of stakeholders to Iniva's visiting artistic audience.</p> <p>So, is it right to separate commercial from artistic activity in this way? No doubt there are issues about capacity and clarity of focus in facing two different directions at the same time. There is also the potential missed opportunity of converting customer to audience or vice versa. But we found that the act of presenting our artistic and commercial products together under one brand meant that one automatically overshadowed the other. In our case two brands are better than one.</p> <p><em>Paddy Chatterton is head of development at Iniva \u2013 follow the institute on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Iniva_arts\" title=\"\"><em>@Iniva_arts</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>It is hard to imagine now that southern Germany \u2013 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria \u2013 was very poor in the 19th century, a largely agricultural area little touched by industrialisation. After the second world war, when hard graft and financial aid via the Marshall plan resulted in Germany's \"<em>Wirtschaftswunder</em>\" (economic miracle), the region rose to become the country's economic powerhouse.</p> <p>Today the south is Germany's most prosperous part and home to tens of thousands of small and medium-sized privately-owned companies \u2013 known as the <em>Mittelstand</em> \u2013 hi-tech clusters and household names such as Daimler and Bosch.</p> <p>Gerhard Pfeifer, who runs the eponymous ropemaking business in the picturesque town of Memmingen, where the unemployment rate is a mere 1.9%, says the Mittelstand is the backbone of the German economy. Crucial to its success is Germany's tradition of craftsmanship \u2013 on-the-job training with some theory thrown in. For example, Pfeifer's late father, who took over the business after the second world war, was a master ropemaker, as is Gerhard Pfeifer's sister, Renate Pfeifer-Lerner. The firm has taken on 12 new trainees this year, taking the total to nearly 50.</p> <p>Pfeifer also credits the south-west's entrepreneurial spirit. About 95% of the 128,000 Mittelstand companies in Swabia (Bayerisch-Schwaben) are family businesses which despite their high export activity \u2013 40% of their turnover goes abroad \u2013 remain rooted in the region through their close involvement with local social and cultural institutions.</p> <p>\"The German Mittelstand sees itself as rooted in the real economy \u2013 not finance-oriented but focused on quality and performance,\" he said. \"You need banks that support this and don't treat companies as commodities.\" He is horrified at the idea that only 10% of global capital is based on real values, with the vast majority driven by speculation on financial markets.</p> <p>The Pfeifer business, whose steel ropes are used in lifts, cranes, bridges, mines and sports stadiums, as well as featuring in the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, is a typical Mittelstand company, albeit older than most. It has been run by the same family since the 16th century, when the oldest surviving document mentioned a dispute between two ropemakers, one of whom was Pfeifer's ancestor. Today the business employs 1,200 people, with nearly half of them working in its historical base in Memmingen. It generates an annual turnover of \u20ac220m (\u00a3176m) and has subsidiaries in 17 countries around the world, including China, Russia and Dubai.</p> <p>Pfeifer is hopeful that the company can survive in an Asian-dominated future thanks to its hi-tech products. The firm is one of Germany's \"hidden champions\" \u2013 little known companies that have carved out a niche for themselves and become successful internationally.</p> <p>In nearby Leipheim, Wanzl is a third-generation family business that makes every second shopping trolley in the world (2.8m a year), along with hand baskets, luggage trolleys, baggage carts and vending units, and also designs shop interiors. It employs about 4,000 staff, more than half of whom are in Germany, and has factories in seven countries including China. Its clients include Tesco and Sainsbury's.</p> <p>Gottfried Wanzl, whose grandfather and father were locksmiths and started the business after the war, inspired by the American inventor of the shopping trolley, Sylvan Goldman, said: \"Germans tend towards perfection. Our work mania is often sneered at abroad but it's typical German culture \u2013 if you start something you do it with passion and see it through to conclusion.\"</p> <p>German manufacturers have been quick to set up factories and sales offices in China and have invested heavily in technology and design. When Wanzl said: \"We remain the innovator, not the plagiarist\", and argues that his firm's broad product range is known for high quality and reliability on the world market, this sums up the situation for many German companies.</p> <p>Germany's local savings banks (Sparkassen and Genossenschaftsbanken) are a key pillar of the Mittelstand, a source of funding for small firms. While supporting traditional German values like saving, Pfeifer admitted: \"Saving alone has never catapulted a company to the top.\" He also recognises that the debt-laden southern European countries in the eurozone have a different financial culture and cannot be expected to change from one day to the next.</p> <p>There is a clash of cultures and values. He notes that \"a stable currency, formerly the D-mark, and the independence of the Bundesbank are key elements of Germany's prosperity, having contributed to the economic miracle after the war, and this is in danger of evaporating. This is what Germans are afraid of.\" But while structural reforms are clearly needed in the southern European countries, \"Germany will not want to be the bogeyman that drove them to ruin\", he added.</p> <p>Pfeifer believes that Angela Merkel's cautious stance on more help for crisis-ridden countries and her resistance to eurobonds \u2013 commonly issued debt \u2013 are merely tactical behaviour designed to maintain pressure on those countries and to placate Germans.</p> <p>Wanzl also sees no alternative to more EU bailouts for troubled eurozone countries: \"There would only be losers if Europe fell apart.\" He notes that even Germany has highly indebted cities and regions \u2013 such as Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen and the Saarland state \u2013 that are subsidised by the wealthier parts. \"If Europe were to break up into small states, we would play a diminishing role in a globalised world,\" he added.</p>",

Thinktank the Social Market Foundation has published a <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/media/news/think-tank-reveals-universal-credit-at-risk-of-backfiring-and-pr/\">new report on the government's plans for Universal Credit</a>, and warns that the move to monthly payments could cause significant hardship for families on the lowest incomes. On the Inside Housing blog, commentator Jules Birch warns that evidence suggests the <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/blogs/runaway-train/6523755.blog\">welfare system is \"cracking under the strain\"</a> even before further cuts due next April and the phased introduction of the universal credit starting at the same time. Analysing the SMF report, alongside the new Social Attitudes survey and research by the National Housing Federation, Birch concludes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Iain Duncan Smith and the DWP will no doubt continue to resist calls for changes and stick to their line that the universal credit will make work pay and boost personal responsibility. However, the reform is looking increasingly like a slow motion train crash that everyone else can see is going to happen.<br>Benefit cuts are already biting and are set to affect far more families from next April with the bedroom tax and benefit cap. The danger is that IDS's flagship reform will make things worse rather than better. There is still time to stop the train before it is too late. </p> </blockquote> <p>On the Shelter blog, Kate Webb predicts <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2012/09/uc-and-u-turns-when-to-start-worrying-about-universal-credit/\">\"the softest of soft launches\" for Universal Credit</a> and says she expects only the simplest of cases to be allowed onto UC at first. She adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shelter has always said we support the introduction of Universal Credit in principle \u2013 the current benefits system is fiendishly complicated for many households, particularly when transitioning into paid work.</p> <p>But Ministers are perhaps now realising why no previous government managed such a radical overhaul of welfare. Delivering Universal Credit in a way that protects low income households is more important than meeting deadlines set down when UC was little more than a wonk's proposal. A collective moratorium on the term 'U-turn' as a political attack would perhaps be helpful in giving DWP the space it needs to get UC right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, volntary organisations in Birmingham warn that welfare reforms and the move to Universal Credit will <a href=\"http://birminghamagainstthecuts.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/welfare-reforms-make-child-poverty-target-unachievable/\">make the government target of ending child poverty by 2020 unachievable</a>.

  "<p>European targets to replace fossil fuels with biofuels are contributing to spikes in food prices and global hunger, according to the latest analyis by Oxfam.</p> <p>The aid organisation is calling for EU energy ministers meeting in Cyprus on Monday to scrap mandates that commit member states to sourcing 10% of transport energy from renewable sources by 2020. It has calculated that the land required to meet these mandates for biofuels for European cars for one year could feed 127 million people.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-eu-biofuels-idUKBRE8890SJ20120910\" title=\"\">draft proposal</a> leaked last week suggested the European commission was considering capping biofuel mandates at 5% by 2020, in recognition of fears that they compete with food production and are not as environmentally-friendly as first thought. Aid agencies say this is not enough, and want to see them removed altogether.</p> <p>Biofuel targets introduced in 2009 to help fight climate change have become increasingly controversial. In Europe, the targets will be met almost exclusively from food crops at a time of record prices. Soy and corn prices were at all-time highs in July, and the prices of cereals and vegetable oil remained at peak levels in August, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/155659/icode/\" title=\"\">according to the FAO</a>.</p> <p>The contribution of biofuel targets to mitigating global warming is also being questioned, as demand for crops for biofuels is pushing agricultural production into forests, peatlands and grasslands that had been acting as carbon sinks. Key industry figures, including the CEOs of Unilever <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/04/us-eu-biofuel-food-crisis-nestle\" title=\"\">and Nestl\u00e9</a> and billionare hedge-fund manager Jeremy Grantham, have <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f2f7fae-e531-11e1-8ac0-00144feab49a.html%C2%A3axzz25OFNAmYq\" title=\"\">added their voices to NGO concern</a> that diverting food crops to fuel for American and European cars may trigger a food crisis, following on from the worst US drought in half a century. Last week, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/12/france-agriculture-idUSL5E8KCBTC20120912\" title=\"\">called for a \"pause\"</a> in the development of biofuels competing with food.</p> <p>The UK currently requires 5% of transport energy to come from biofuels. <a href=\"http://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/oxfam/bitstream/10546/242997/1/bp161-the-hunger-grains-170912-en.pdf\" title=\"\">Oxfam's report, The Hunger Grains</a> (pdf), published on Monday, estimates that meeting the binding EU targets as they are ratcheted up until 2020 will cost every adult UK consumer around \u00a335 a year in higher fuel prices.</p> <p>The UK government's own analysis of the impact of meeting the EU target suggests that removing the mandate could reduce food price spikes by up to 35%.</p> <p>Oxfam's chief executive Barbara Stocking said: \"The EU must recognise the devastating impact its biofuel policies are having on the poorest people through surging food prices, worsening hunger and contributing to climate change.\"</p> <p>Demand for biofuels in Europe is also putting pressure on land and water resources globally. The International Land Coalition has estimated that around two-thirds of all large-scale land deals around the world in the past 10 years have been <a href=\"http://www.landcoalition.org/sites/default/files/publication/1205/ILC%20GSR%20report_ENG.pdf\" title=\"\">acquisitions made to grow biofuel crops</a> (pdf) including soya, sugar, palm oil and jatropha. Many of these deals have displaced local communities with claims on the land or have involved laying claim to water rights.</p>",
  "<p>One of the world's leading ice experts has predicted the final collapse of Arctic sea ice in summer months within four years.</p> <p>In what he calls a \"global disaster\" now unfolding in northern latitudes as the sea area that freezes and melts each year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">shrinks to its lowest extent</a> ever recorded, <a href=\"http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/pw11/\" title=\"\">Prof Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University</a> calls for \"urgent\" consideration of new ideas to reduce global temperatures.</p> <p>In an email to the Guardian he says: \"Climate change is no longer something we can aim to do something about in a few decades' time, and that we must not only urgently reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions but must urgently examine other ways of slowing global warming, such as the various <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/01/geoengineering-techniques-study-science-coalition\" title=\"\">geoengineering ideas</a> that have been put forward.\"</p> <p>These include reflecting the sun's rays back into space, making clouds whiter and seeding the ocean with minerals to absorb more CO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <p>Wadhams has spent many years collecting ice thickness data from submarines passing below the arctic ocean. He predicted the imminent break-up of sea ice in summer months in 2007, when the previous lowest extent of 4.17 million square kilometres was set. This year, it has unexpectedly plunged a further 500,000 sq km to less than 3.5m sq km. \"I have been predicting [the collapse of sea ice in summer months] for many years. The main cause is simply global warming: as the climate has warmed there has been less ice growth during the winter and more ice melt during the summer.</p> <p>\"At first this didn't [get] noticed; the summer ice limits slowly shrank back, at a rate which suggested that the ice would last another 50 years or so. But in the end the summer melt overtook the winter growth such that the entire ice sheet melts or breaks up during the summer months.</p> <p>\"This collapse, I predicted would occur in 2015-16 at which time the summer Arctic (August to September) would become ice-free. The final collapse towards that state is now happening and will probably be complete by those dates\".</p> <p>Wadhams says the implications are \"terrible\". \"The positives are increased possibility of Arctic transport, increased access to Arctic offshore oil and gas resources. The main negative is an acceleration of global warming.\"</p> <p>\"As the sea ice retreats in summer the ocean warms up (to 7C in 2011) and this warms the seabed too. The continental shelves of the Arctic are composed of offshore permafrost, frozen sediment left over from the last ice age. As the water warms the permafrost melts and releases huge quantities of trapped methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas so this will give a big boost to global warming.\"</p>",

The rumbling left-hand rhythm was often used to evoke trains and railroad travel, and the buoyant energy of the music was popular to dance to in the juke joints and barrelhouses. Famous early exponents included Jelly Roll Morton, Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis. </p> <h2>C is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqJQIERAdU0\">Competitions </a></h2> <p>Competitions are a vital part of many classical pianists' careers. They are a testing ground, and a way to get noticed in a crowded field. But are they an exciting way to make a name as a young musician, a necessary evil, or are they in fact not necessary at all? Guests this day will include leading pianists who give contrasting views for and against competitions: Stephen Hough thinks they're dreadful; Lucy Parham says they can be a great experience for a young musician; Pierre Laurent Aimard finds the idea of competing in an art form problematic.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You might be playing a Liszt Etude at nine in the morning after a bad sleep, on a piano you only had five minutes to try out\u2026 If you can get up and play well in a competition, that's the biggest test.\" <em>Angela Hewitt</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>D is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1diZtD5_G0\">Duets</a> </h2> <p>The piano is rare in that it's an instrument that can be played by two people at the same time. The intimacy of sharing a stool and playing shoulder to shoulder can make for a very pleasant experience. And there are many great pieces of music composed for piano duet. Views from the stage and from the rehearsal room come from pianist David Owen Norris, and from duet partners Pascal and Ami Rog\u00e9, and the Lab\u00e8que sisters, who've played together since childhood, not always in complete harmony.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Faure's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcNHP12m-_g&amp;feature=related\">Dolly Suite</a> is a lovely piece for four hands one piano. We were fighting all the time. I was six and she was eight. And she was saying you are taking up all my space \u2013 we were pushing each other and my mother was in tears and totally in despair\u2026\" <em>Marielle Lab\u00e8que</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>E is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVUIqMvcHlQ\">Encores</a> </h2> <p>There's an art to choosing and performing an encore, even for the world's top pianists. Being invited to return to the stage calls for a choice that complements but doesn't upstage the programme the audience have just heard. And it mustn't keep the orchestra sitting too long with nothing to do. It must be prepared and yet feel like a spontaneous treat. Above all, it's a pleasure; as Angela Hewitt says: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It can be a wonderful moment. What is funny is when you've played some marvellous programme with marvellous works and really given all you have for two hours and somebody comes up and says, 'What I liked best was the encore'!\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>F is for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnfZjqMSy0&amp;feature=related\">Fingers</a> </h2> <p>The piano is an unusual musical instrument in that all ten digits of the performer can be used to sound different notes simultaneously (alternatively it can be played to perfection with just five - see <em>L is for Left-handed pianism</em> on 3 October). Fingers need practice, and practice makes perfect. Working hard to build strength and dexterity is part and parcel of every pianist's story, and just as in sport, exercises are a necessary evil. But what can start out as a chore when young can eventually become a pleasure when technique is more advanced and exercises turn into Chopin or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SvZyjKUGQ8\">Moskowski Etudes</a> \u2013 written and designed for developing technique but also being very beautiful music.</p> <h2>G is for<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/20/glenn-gould-wilfully-idiotic-genius\"> Glenn Gould</a> </h2> <p>Glenn Gould was a Canadian pianist who became one of the best-known and most celebrated classical pianists of the 20th century. He was particularly renowned as an interpreter of the keyboard music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Gould was well known for his unorthodox musical interpretations and mannerisms at the keyboard. He stopped giving concerts at the age of 31 to concentrate on studio recording and other projects. His story is told by his biographer Kevin Bazzana, with comment from pianists Murray Perahia, Stephen Hough and David Owen Norris, and violinist Gidon Kremer, who has just recorded an album of Bach arrangements in homage to Gould's performances of these works.<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>The word 'inimitable' really makes sense with Gould, and if he has a message it isn't 'be influenced by my interpretations' \u2013 his message is: 'be yourself; bring your own personality to the music you play'<br><em>Kevin Bazzana, biographer of Glenn Gould</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>H is for Hiring</h2> <p>Often when a concert pianist steps onto the stage to perform, they have to play a piano that has been hired. Surprisingly, while many are in great shape, sometimes they aren't. Sometimes they are appropriate for the repertoire about to be played and sometimes not. The challenge for the artist is to work out how to play this piano in such a way that the concert is the best it can be. How does a pianist coax a beautiful performance out of the hired concert grand? <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mss9x\">Also on this day on In Tune</a>, master piano technician Ulrich Gerhartz of Steinway's gives a backstage view of the delicate business of delivering and caring for these huge yet delicate instruments (four large men required to get them up staircases!) Every Steinway piano has its own character: one of his jobs is to match the piano to the individual player. These pianos are incredibly cosseted, painstaking cleaned and maintained, and on the concert day they're tuned twice \u2013 once for the rehearsal and once again before the concert. Ulrich compares it to a Formula One racing car, they are always being tweaked to maintain absolute peak performance.</p> <p>Concert pianist Jonathan Biss remembers a particular disaster playing a hired piano for a concert in Vermont: </p> <blockquote> <p><br>I was in Vermont, and the piano had been moved in a couple of days before. The rehearsal went fine, and the piano technician left before the concert started. I started playing and after three minutes, the lyre - that's the thing which holds the pedals - simply fell off. Someone forgot to replace a screw or two. I put my foot on the pedal and suddenly it wasn't there any more.</p> </blockquote> <h2>I is for<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvUbrbFdJ8g\"> Improvisation</a> </h2> <p>Some people can do it and some can't \u2013 sit down at the keyboard and simply make music up on the spur of the moment. The piano can be the perfect instrument for jazz improvising, capable of a vast range of sounds from the percussive to the lyrical. The left hand can be the rhythm section while the right provides melodic lines and \"choruses\". But there are many ways to improvise \u2013 classically trained players may choose to follow clear structures in improvising, for instance in the cadenza of a concerto; and jazz musicians will often have at least a fixed chord sequence from which to elaborate; whereas a silent film accompanist often improvises spontaneously to a film which may last for an hour or more, having never seen it before sitting down to perform to an audience of cinema-goers. And in the genre known as Free Improvisation, the pianist tries to avoid all pre-thought or pre-arranged structures, and be completely open to the ideas of the moment when hammer strikes string.</p> <blockquote> <p>The piano is great for improvising because it transcends different genres. It's a completely open book ,and there's such a wide range of emotions you can cover. <em>Jazz pianist Gwilym Simcock</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>J is for Jazz </h2> <p>Ever since the early ragtime of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin\">Scott Joplin</a> and Jelly Roll Morton the piano has been a key instrument in the development of Jazz. Associated with the smoky bar-room, the instrument allows the jazz pianist to play all the elements of the band - stretching the harmony, roll a great rhythmic bottom-end, and improvise singing, soaring melodies. Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Herbie Hancock, among others, all stretched what the Jazz piano could do.</p> <blockquote> <p><br>The piano is the perfect jazz instrument, it can do everything, it can have a great bass sound to it, you can explore more extended harmony all on your own, and you can make it sing in so many different ways, so we're very lucky as piano players, we do get to have it all. <em>Gwilym Simcock</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>K is for <a href=\"http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/piano-keyboard-diagram.html\">Keys</a></h2> <p>There are sad keys and glad keys, so they say; F sharp minor is turbulent and C major is sunny. Every pianist knows how a key feels under their fingers - every key has its own combination of black and white on the keyboard. Before the Baroque period, keyboards had to be re-tuned to play in each different keys. But with the development of the modern piano, so-called \"equal temperament\" evened out the differences between the keys. One great masterpiece represents this development \u2013 JS Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, which expresses his faith in the new tuning system by having pieces in all the 24 different major and minor keys. But another curious factor of keys still remains a problem \u2013 the fact that different countries tune their pianos to different pitches. So middle C is, for instance, a bit higher in Germany than in the UK. </p> <h2>L is for Left Hand</h2> <p>The right hand may be the belle of the ball but the left hand is no dowdy Cinderella. The left hand is a fundamental part of piano music \u2013 literally, the fundamental is the root part of every note on the piano.<br>A strong left hand is crucial to successfully playing Bach, but what motivates a pianist to tackle the fiendish work of Godowsky who transcribed the already difficult Chopin preludes for the left hand alone? For some, such as one-armed pianist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI7tnBmGnq4\">Paul Wittgenstein</a>, left-handed repertoire is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwNxn-iFRuI\">Nicholas McCarthy</a>'s - who was born without his right hand - only option. </p> <h2>M is for Movies</h2> <p>Piano improviser extraordinaire, <a href=\"http://harrythepiano.com/\">Harry the Piano</a>, silent film accompaniment specialist <a href=\"http://www.neilbrand.com/\">Neil Brand</a> and writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet \u2013 all experts in the field of film music \u2013 explore the role of the piano in movies, from the very first days of silent cinema, through <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hubyFqSUaGA\">Brief Encounter</a>'s immortalisation of Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto, to modern classics such as Michael Nyman's haunting music for The Piano.</p> <h2>N is for Novels</h2> <p>The piano has played a starring role in some the nation's best loved novels, acting as a signifier of everything from social class to seduction. On this day's In Tune, Professor John Mullan guides listeners through some of the most memorable novelistic piano moments, starting with Jane Austen's Persuasion - where the piano finds itself at the centre of a plot typically fraught with issues of class and gender, then on to Emily Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre, where Blanche Ingram puts the piano to use as a 19th century flirtation technique in her quest to impress the brooding Mr Rochester. In EM Forster's A Room with a View and Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty, it's the experience of listening to the piano \u2013 or not listening to it \u2013 that enables the novelists to shine a revealing light on their characters.</p> <h2>O is for Orchestra</h2> <p>How do you practice a concerto without an orchestra? Who controls a concerto - conductor or soloist? Are there any similarities between taking the role of soloist and sitting at the back as the anonymous orchestral pianist? Stephen Hough says: </p> <blockquote> <p>It's both like being a soloist, like playing a solo recital in that you have to have a very strong vision of the piece you're playing and sufficient personality and inner energy to convey that to the audience. But it's also chamber music, it's a shared experience\u2026 there have to be moments of dialogue. I think that's what makes the playing of a concerto a particular challenge, it's keeping the two things in balance. </p> </blockquote> <h2>P is for <a href=\"http://www.pianonoise.com/Article.Page-Turning.htm\">Page Turner</a></h2> <p>It should be simple. All you have to do is turn a page of a score while the pianist's hands are otherwise engaged. But page turning is fraught with difficulties, for both pianist and turner. What if you're turning pages and a bee flies into your shirt and stings you? What if you're playing and every time you need the page turned, the heaving embonpoint of your turner obscures your view of the music? Top of the list of Thankless Tasks, the essential but stressful job of page turning is only successful if it passes unnoticed.</p> <h2>Q for Queues</h2> <p>Which great pianists would be worth queuing for? Piano fans queued around the block in 1965, to see the return of Vladimir Horowitz, one of the century's most celebrated pianists, after a 12-year break from live performance. And in the age of internet booking, piano audiences are no less passionate. </p> <h2>R is for <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-repetiteur.htm\">R\u00e9p\u00e9titeur</a> </h2> <p>R\u00e9p\u00e9titeurs are so much more than just pianists. Sure, they have to be able to get around the keyboard. But they also have to be able to read the multiple lines of a full score, coach singers, take the role of an orchestra and, in a nutshell, know the opera they are rehearsing probably better than anyone else involved in the process. And those are just some of the musical skills. Because a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur must also be at once musically self-effacing, a linguist and a diplomat who can accommodate and reconcile the often conflicting demands of singers, conductors and directors. But, despite all that, there's no first-night curtain call for this vital figure.</p> <h2>S for Sustain</h2> <p>The sustain pedal, usually the one on the right, is the most commonly used pedal in a modern piano. When pressed it sustains all the damped strings on the piano by moving the dampers away from the strings and allowing them to vibrate freely so all the notes being played will continue to sound until the pedal is released. Until the Romantic era of Chopin and Liszt it was considered a special effect, but in the 19th century it came to be regarded as an essential element of piano sound. Pianist Stephen Hough says the sustain pedal itself is \"as important as the strings, the hammers, the keys of the piano \u2013 without it the instrument doesn't exist.\" </p> <h2>T for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjZIwxrY3Ss\">Tuning</a></h2> <p>The issue of tuning has been a live one ever since Greek mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras was pinching strings and scratching his head over harmonic discrepancies 2,500 years ago. For a keyboard instrument such as the piano with its multiple strings, until the system of Well Temperament was popularised in the early 18th century, instruments would only really sound good tuned to a certain key. Thanks to the Well-Tempered method of tuning though, and yes, Bach knew what he was doing when he wrote that collection of pieces in all 24 keys to be played on the same instrument, the pianist now has freedom to transpose freely across the keyboard. Yet, piano tuning is a highly nuanced art, affecting the tone and colour of an instrument. With razor-sharp hearing and an ability to creatively play with the compromises necessary to tune a piano, the piano tuner still plays a key role in preparing an instrument for performance. </p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"I've learnt a lot about tuning over the years, that there isn't one set tuning, a gifted tuner will do a different tuning depending on the repertoire I play, a different tuning for Bach than Ravel, it can be a very creative thing. Tuning can totally change the sound of a piano, in fact most of the sound colour of a piano comes from the tuning\u2026 you can do a lot with the tuning, creating resonances and harmonics in the piano, and a lot of people don't realise that.\" <em>Angela Hewitt</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>U for Upright</h2> <p>\"A sort of musical fungus attached to the walls of semi\u00addetached houses in the provinces\" is how celebrated conductor and fount of bons mots <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Beecham\">Sir Thomas Beecham</a>.</p> <h2>V for Virtuoso</h2> <p>Virtuoso is a term applied to many of the world's top pianists of today. With its roots in the Italian usage of the 16th and 17th centuries, a virtuoso is an individual who possesses outstanding technical ability in any intellectual or artistic field. But it takes much more than just playing demi-semi quavers on a keyboard to dazzle an audience. So what are the true qualities of virtuosity and which particular composers are regarded as virtuosi, writing music to show off their own technical prowess at the keyboard?</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Clara Schumann and Liszt were the first big virtuosos who played technically brilliant pieces... the word denotes a huge personality also: panache on stage, histrionics when you're not on stage \u2013 Liszt certainly was, with fainting women and so on. <em>Angela Hewitt</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>W for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAInt7hIZlU\">Workshops</a></h2> <p>What goes into the making of a piano? How do the pianos of today differ from those which Liszt or Debussy might have played? In the central London workshop of Steinway's, there are stripped down pianos everywhere, skeletons with their strings and frames exposed, and benches with vices and chisels like any carpenter would use. The scene is much like it would have been a hundred years ago, and Steinway still employs apprentices who are trained in the craft and art of piano maintenance.<br>Ulrich Gerhartz, their Director of Concerts and Artist Services explains what goes into the crafting of Steinway's delicately balanced instruments, and pianist Stephen Hough reflects on how changes in the manufacture of pianos means that the sounds he makes today are very different from the virtuosi of the past.</p> <h2>X for X-treme</h2> <p>Although every instrument has a history of extreme techniques, the piano seems to have attracted more than its fair share of people wanting to see how far it, and they, could go. From Beethoven, who was known for destroying pianos during the course of a performance, through to John Cage (who invented the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXAUEuECqQ\">prepared piano</a> by inserting screws, rubbers and bolts into it) and beyond, this episode of the Piano A\u2013Z is not for those of a sensitive disposition.</p> <h2>Y for Yellow River</h2> <p>In 1969 at the height of the Chinese Cultural Revolution the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River_Piano_Concerto\">Yellow River Piano Concerto</a>, commissioned by Madame Mao, received its highly politicised premiere. Despite being banned from Chinese musical life in 1976 it has slowly filtered back into the musical mainstream in a country with a huge affinity with the piano today. To say that 30 million Chinese school children are learning to play the instrument is a conservative estimate: some say the figure is as high as 90 million. For the Chinese the piano has become a potent symbol of the importance of hard work and dedication, as well as the perfect instrument for the one-child family system.</p> <p>Nobody embodies the piano in China more than global superstar <a href=\"http://www.langlang.com/\">Lang Lang</a>. </p> <blockquote> <p>It's kind of like football... piano has become the most popular fashionable instrument to learn. And as China opens up, gradually the piano has become important for people to understand Western culture. <em>Lang Lang</em></p> </blockquote> <p><br>Pianist Fou Ts'Ong, whose parents were imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, and conductor Jindong Cai also discuss the changing image of the piano in China since the days of Madame Mao.</p> <h2>Z for Zany</h2> <p>The alphabetical exploration of the piano concludes with Z for Zany, an affectionate look at the role of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuWUp1M-vuM&amp;feature=related\">piano in comedy</a>.

We're helping them to engage with a social care audience \u2014 who the key stake holders are, what language to use. All of that needs a lot of careful thought.\"</p> <p>Brown, who was previously a trustee for two years at the <a href=\"http://www.scie.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Care Institute for Excellence</a>, was keen to apply for the Nice fellowship to contribute to its social care work programme.</p> <p>The former social worker said: \"It was a very easy decision for me, I thought it made sense to move with the brief.

  "<p>As the market drifts lower following last week's US quantitative easing-fuelled gains, <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> is bucking the trend after poaching a new finance director from <strong>Smith and Nephew</strong>.</p> <p>Adrian Hennah will join Reckitt - the Cillit Bang and Finish maker - in December to replace Liz Doherty who is stepping down. Rakesh Kapoor, who became chief executive a year ago, thanked Doherty but added:</p> <blockquote> Liz and I have agreed that Reckitt's and her way of working are not as well matched as either of us would like, and not is the right time for her to move to a new opportunity. </blockquote> <p>Doherty will however stay on until next March in an attempt to make a smooth transition.</p> <p>Reckitt shares have risen 31p to \u00a336.03 on the news, while Smith &amp; Nephew has slipped 2p to 688p. Martin Deboo at Investec said the news was positive for Reckitt:</p> <blockquote> We see this as a positive for Reckitt's shares this morning. In our view Doherty had struggled to win acceptance in the investor community and suffered from being appointed prior to chief executive Rakesh Kapoor's accession. In contrast, we hold a positive view on Adrian Hennah and expect Reckitt to be more effectively and cohesively led as a result. </blockquote> <p>Clive Black at Shore Capital was more concerned about the situation:</p> <blockquote> [We note] with some considerable surprise the 'stepping down' of Liz Doherty as chief financial officer of Reckitt Benckiser. <br> Ms Doherty will be replaced Adrian Hennah currently chief financial at Smith &amp; Nephew, where we have actually questioned the sustainability of his position under its new chief executive. Such change is disconcerting to our minds and we will need to digest this news and make sure that nothing is untoward in the Reckitt camp.  Shore Capital has a hold stance on Reckitt Benckiser shares, partly reflecting worries on our behalf about the group's emerging strategy and the wholesale change in top team following the halcyon days of Becht &amp; Day. Today's news does little to assuage our worries. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere in consumer goods, <strong>Unilever</strong> has added 16p to \u00a322.61 after UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy and its price target from \u00a322 to \u00a324. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> For the first time, a clearly defined food strategy is being put in place that seeks to leverage Unilever's scale (particularly its R&amp;D capability and consumer/shopper insight) and scope (particularly its emerging markets platform) to drive sales and increase competitive advantage. Chief executive Polman views food, with its combination of strong cash flow and global growth platforms, as an integral part of the 'Unilever model'. <br> Believing there to be some residual scepticism regarding Unilever's reliability and an under-appreciation of the changes taking place in the food business, we see scope for multiple expansion over the next 12 months. </blockquote> <p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> has added 3p to 350p on further consideration of its plans to merge with EADS.</p> <p><strong>Xstrata </strong>is steady at 1060.5p as it resumed operations at its chrome mine near Rustenburg in South Africa, where tensions are high after police killed a number of striking miners.</p> <p>There is also a growing feeling Xstrata's board will recommend the latest offer for the business from<strong> Glencore</strong>, down 3.75p at 375.1.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has dipped 13.36 points to 5902.19, as investors paused for breath after the market's recent rises. Simon Denham at Capital Spreads said:</p> <blockquote> The FTSE is taking things in its stride this morning as traders are taking a little bit of profit following the strength of the last couple of days. Things are very quiet on the economic data front today, so we might just see the markets drift sideways for the time being. </blockquote>",

  "<p></p> <h2>Monday</h2> <h2>Masters of Money<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Debut of a three-part series presented by the BBC's economics editor, Stephanie Flanders, pondering in turn the relevance of three economic philosophers. The next two episodes will consider the legacies of Marx and Hayek, but tonight it's the turn of John Maynard Keynes. Flanders argues that we are living through the supreme test of Keynes's core belief: that the best way for a broke nation to stimulate growth is to spend yet more of the money it doesn't have. Keynes also bequeathed the supreme caution against overly utopian economic planning: \"In the long run,\" he observed, \"we are all dead.\" <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Leaving<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>The passionate affair between middle-aged hotel manageress Julie (Helen McCrory) and studenty staff member Aaron (Callum Turner) is by this second episode in full flight, but with it comes complication. After making beans on toast for her ungrateful husband and teenage kids, Julie is impressed with the fact that Aaron loafs around his mum's big house reading novels, and a bit jealous of the attention he gets from girls his own age at work. So is it a fling, or a love affair? Julie finds an unlikely ally in trying to figure out an answer. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>999: What's Your Emergency?<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>This week's drop-in to Blackpool's emergency call centre focuses on children, from the prank calls (don't do it kids, the operator can track your number) to more serious violations. There's plenty of antisocial behaviour and lots of little tykes swearing at coppers. Children go missing while their parents are in the pub, and a two year old is found walking the streets alone. For emotional uplift, a determined teenager who looks after her mother passes her A-levels and is bound for university. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Treasures of Ancient Rome<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Concluding instalment of Alastair Sooke's three-part paean to the art of the Roman empire. The conventional wisdom, as Sooke acknowledges, holds that the Romans were terrific at laying roads and erecting aqueducts, but their artistic legacy amounts to little more than an extremely poorly reviewed violin solo by one of Rome's more erratic emperors. Sooke travels to Italy, Libya and Egypt, and around Britain, to debunk this view, and advances compelling evidence, some of it never previously seen. To the list of things the Romans did for us, it seems, must be added mosaics, silversmithery and glassware. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>True Blood<br>10pm, FX</h2> <p>While season four of True Blood wasn't anyone's idea of great, it did at least have the sense to finish big. That momentum is carried over into this new-season opener. No time for the soppy vampire romance stuff tonight; there are corpses to take care of. As dead doesn't always mean dead on this show, those who had waved a fond(ish) farewell to Tara may have to get used to her being around in some form for at least a bit longer. There are also werewolves to contend with, and a mystery involving soldiers who served in Iraq. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>A Tale of Two Chinas<br>10.05pm, More4</h2> <p>In the wake of the Chinese economic boom, UK-based Carrie Waley has an interesting job. She runs a kind of finishing school for wealthy Chinese immigrants to the UK, teaching them how to queue properly and to kiss someone socially with the right degree of awkwardness. Carrie is a symbol of new China, but is old enough to have been affected by the cultural revolution. Here, she revisits China, and tries to get to the bottom of what happened to her family; hard in a country where young people don't want to know, and old people don't want to talk about it. <em>JR</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396170641\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347285307066/Vikings-008.jpg\" alt=\"Vikings\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Oliver presents Vikings, BBC2. Photograph: Production/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Production/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Wills And Kate: Baby Fever<br>8pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>There's nothing quite like the expectation of billions to weigh you down when trying to maintain an erection. This is presumably something that Prince William must be acutely aware of: the potential father-to-be of a child that will spend every second from its first postpartum bellow onwards under the scrutiny of the world's media. Wills And Kate: Baby Fever looks at the overbearing situation facing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with royal historians and insiders asked to speculate wildly over what may or may not happen at some point in the future. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Vikings<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>We know them as the bearded Norsemen who ransacked our settlements and defiled our corpses. In this episode of his historical investigation, Neil Oliver attempts to demonstrate a different side to the Vikings: theirs, he explains, was a vast trading empire, and their story is as much about widespread settlement as it is savagery. Oliver's cravats and poetic manner suggest someone on the point of getting his guitar out, but his archaeologist's nose leads him to sniff out Viking runes carved as far afield as a mosque wall in Istanbul. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Person of Interest<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>If latecomers to JJ Abrams's latest supernatural-tinged drama require a primer, just imagine this as a Lost spinoff where Michael Emerson's Benjamin Linus uses his cunning for good in a desperate bid for redemption. Finch (Emerson) and Reese (Jim Caviezel) stumble upon hardworking Doctor of Interest Megan Tillman who, it appears, is living a double life as an all-night party animal, seemingly under threat from serial scumbag Andrew Benton. Closer examination, however, proves that things aren't quite so clear cut. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>Love and Marriage<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>This three-part social history on the institution of marriage begins by looking at the period between 1900 and the 1950s. Things were different during the early part of the century: the Victorian marriage ideal prescribed long courtships, a kiss declared an intent to marry, and parents would often be involved in choosing spouses. The film skips through the changes wrought by historical forces \u2013 the world wars, the Depression, feminism, socialism \u2013 and examines how relationships survived the harsh realities of the day. The real delight, though, is in the anecdotes of the interviewees, recalling a world a lifetime away. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Romanzo Criminale<br>9pm, Sky Arts 1</h2> <p>A promising pre-credits sequence gives way to a second series of this dour Italian drama about a group of hoodlums tearing up 1970s Rome. At the start of this series, one of the gang has been shot, and his gangmates are forced to race the police to find out who dunnit. It's quite a specialist find for fans of men with big perms and moustaches, playing poker and scowling a lot, but devoid of the humour naturally occurring in life, and so quite hard to stick with if you enjoy a bit of light with your shade. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Bad Education<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>School election time, and there's a clear favourite: budding Blairite David Millbank. With Fraser out as head after an unfortunate exam mishap, deputy headmistrix Miss Pickwell plans to use Millbank to convince the school governors that the role should be hers. Despite never having voted in his life \u2013 \"My dad does my postal vote for me,\" \u2013 Alfie vows to stop her, and impress Miss Gulliver, by leading hapless Joe to power. Irrespective of your view of Jack Whitehall, this has made for a solid series, set to return next year. <em>MJ</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396170642\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347636826828/Still-shot-from-Mrs-Biggs-010.jpg\" alt=\"Still shot from Mrs Biggs, ITV drama starring Sheridan Smith and Daniel May\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheridan Smith and Daniel Mays in ITV's Mrs Biggs.

No element of the digestive system is unmentionable as The Food Hospital once again sets out to prove that healthy eating can help ease the symptoms of illness. The race in question involves twins eating different amounts of fibre to see how speedy or slow it makes their bowels. Elsewhere in the hospital, a four-year-old boy whose eczema leaves him screaming in pain is tested for a milk allergy and a doctor and dietician try to help a man who's scared of fruit and vegetables. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Mrs Biggs<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>London is starting to swing: you can tell by the way Charmian Biggs (Sheridan Smith) is out dancing. Meantime, husband Ronnie (Daniel Mays) is missing out on the fun because he's rotting in jail. As history records, this is a state of affairs that's soon to change, although many of the details covered here, most notably Charmian's abortion following an affair, will be less familiar. It's an entertaining drama that does a grand job of calling up the 1960s, but which could be so much better were the script more nuanced. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Imagine<br>10.45pm, BBC1</h2> <p>This special edition of the arts documentary strand sees Alan Yentob talking to Salman Rushdie about living under the death sentence proclaimed by Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, in 1989. Rushdie, who has a memoir out recalling his years in hiding, discusses how his life was turned upside down after the publication of The Satanic Verses and accusations of blasphemy against Islam, which resulted in his publishers and translators being attacked and even killed. There are also interviews with his protection officers, his friends and family, and his publisher. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Covert Affairs<br>9pm, Really</h2> <p>Fearless spy Annie (Piper Perabo) is brandishing fourth of July cupcakes as season three of this watchable CIA caper kicks off. Unfortunately, her celebratory mood is shattered when she narrowly escapes being blown up in a car-bombing incident. The good news is it leaves her fabulous hair unscathed, but she discovers she's a suspect and is swiftly moved to a new job where she must track down a charming Russian spy in Marrakesh. On-off love interest Auggie's been left at home to investigate the car bombing, so expect a dose of overseas romance. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>The Revolution will be Televised<br>10pm, BBC4</h2> <p>At times this show resembles a strange hybrid of Trigger Happy TV and Da Ali G Show, with Heydon Prowse and Jolyon Rubinstein adopting a collision-course policy to satirising current affairs by thinking of ways to intervene. It's an approach that's redolent of countercultural pranks: not always funny, but often admirable. Tonight, they inform the people of Lincoln that they will soon, in part, be policed by security firm G4S, and serve up glasses of crude oil at the BP portrait awards. Their acting may be bad, but their interaction with the public shows real chutzpah. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Jewish Americans<br>10pm, PBS</h2> <p>Small groups of Jewish refugees arrived in the United States prior to the war of independence, despite being initially refused entry by Dutch Calvinist Peter Stuyvesant, and were instrumental in the commercial development of the country as it expanded west (it's claimed that the 10-gallon hat was a Jewish invention). However, as this first in a colourful three-part series shows, the Jewish community experienced difficulties both in forsaking their heritage and in being accepted as \"true\" Americans, concerns which persisted almost to our own times. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396170643\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346326181597/Good-Cop-010.jpg\" alt=\"Good Cop\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warren Brown in Good Cop. Photograph: BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Good Cop<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Officer Rocksavage's revenge spree is coming to a close, with just Jonjo left alive from the gang who beat his partner to death. Rocksavage is having far more success with his illegal activities than he is with his regular policework: his pursuit of a duo of brutal, motorbike-riding robbers is hamstrung by regulations and cutbacks. Also, being new to criminal activities, he's left a bit of a trail behind. All this off-the-books action has consequences, which only appear when the bodies pile up and there's no one left to turn to. <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>The Choir: Sing While You Work<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Forget whistling while you work, the admirable Gareth Malone reckons that belting out tunes with actual words and in company is the way forward. So it is that Malone's new series sees him forming choirs at four different workplaces, a quartet that will later go head to head in a musical contest. He begins in Lewisham with the local NHS Trust, and a choir formed of doctors, nurses and porters from one of London's busiest hospitals. Bringing the staff together throws up problems, though, as the song Malone selects proves challenging. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Making Faces<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The work done at the facial prosthetics lab at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham is astonishing. For every accident or surgery that has left its subject disfigured, there is a prosthesis offering hope of something approaching a normal life. In this opening episode of a series profiling the lab and its employees, a woman from Burnley travels to be measured up for a new nose, having lost her own to nasal cancer. She hopes they can give her one with the hue of her fake tan. One of the technicians says: \"We're clinicians, not magicians.\"</p> <p>We would beg to differ. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Stephen Hawking's Grand Design<br>9pm, Discovery</h2> <p>It's the meaning of life deciphered in an hour this week, the second in Dr Stephen Hawking's new series, beginning with Descartes, played in an opening dramatised interlude by a man with flowing hair, 'tache and a quill looking all pensive. He is around 300% more attractive that the real Descartes, who was, to be fair, a bit of a gargoyle. But still, it's got to be depicted somehow. Then it's on to Darwin and mathematician John Conway, whose cellular automaton, the Game of Life, went on to explore evolution. As you'd expect, it's all a bit complex, so pay attention at the back. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>The British<br>9pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>This glossy CGI-dominated series telling the saga of these isles makes one appreciate all the more the virtues of a Simon Schama. Tonight, to the pulse of a high-BPM soundtrack, cameras swerve queasily in and around the turrets of virtual castles as we whizz through the dissolution of the monasteries, the invention of the printing press, and Sir Francis Drake. Authoritative talking heads include a smattering of academics, but also Jeremy Irons, Michael Portillo and even Terry Wogan. This is Sky, we expect something a bit more highbrow. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Wilfred<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>Jenna's drug meltdown video goes viral, forcing Ryan to try to fix everyone's awkward feelings with a dinner party. Going against warnings from the highly manipulative Wilfred is just the start of Ryan's undoing. Emotions run high \u2013 despite the surprising hilarity brought to the table by Drew (Chris Klein, playing his usual dumb hunk role to the hilt) \u2013 as Amanda and Jenna take a fast dislike to each other. The result is a sharp take on the standard awkward dinner-party setup, and a timely reminder of what makes this show special. <em>PO'N</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396170644\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345832236482/Parades-End-010.jpg\" alt=\"Parade's End\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Hall and Benedict Cumberbatch in Parade's End.

Tel:/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Celebrity MasterChef<br>6.30pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Any old Z-lister can play the buffoon on Celebrity Big Brother, but it takes someone with guts, determination and an impressive fricassee to survive MasterChef. Two-headed kitchen beast John Torode and Gregg Wallace have dished out criticism and performed many an eye-bulge to camera \u2013 now the final three must do battle. Danny Mills, Emma Kennedy and Michael Underwood are the last ones standing after a sweaty season in the kitchen. So, who can pull off the final challenge of cooking up three courses of (cue booming Wallace-like voice) fault-free food? <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Baggage<br>8pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>The Gok Wan brand continues its unstoppable rise with this dating show. Much like Gok Cooks Chinese, which declared that doing the odd stir-fry was sufficient experience for someone to host their own Chinese cookery show, Baggage has the most tangential of links to Wan's particular skillset: contestants reveal their biggest secrets to potential partners by opening up suitcases, and suitcases contain clothes, which Gok is an expert on. Thus Gok is the host of a dating show. He probably has enough charisma to carry it off. Just. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2>Parade's End<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Tietjens (Benedict Cumberbatch) is posted back to the front and his fellow officers tease him about his faithless wife Sylvia (Rebecca Hall). She remains torn between the lure of strange men's bedlinen and the need to be loved by the husband she's so bored with. Meanwhile, Valentine, the virtuous suffragette, tries to enjoy her birthday despite not knowing whether Christopher is alive or dead. In a long, drawn-out story, we are finally treated to a showdown between all three participants in the love triangle \u2013 and a truly moving conclusion. <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Live ICC World Twenty20 Cricket <br>2.30pm, Sky Sports 1</h2> <p>Cricket has been played in Afghanistan since the 19th century but has enjoyed a resurgence in recent times. This is, in part, due to the fact that, unlike, say, beach volleyball, it was a sport actually approved by the Taliban. Strained geopolitical circumstances always add a frisson to the built-in excitement of Twenty20 cricket but Afghanistan are no mugs, nor are they plucky opposition to be patted on the head: they have a top-10 ranking and should prove a stern test for the reigning champions. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Secrets of The Manor House<br>8pm, Yesterday</h2> <p>According to the opening narration here, the British manor house is \"an inspiration to this day for popular television costume dramas\". Indeed, and the return of Downton Abbey is in turn presumably an inspiration for the scheduling of this doc about life upstairs and downstairs in vast rural pads 100 years ago. To judge by the amount of screen-time reserved for how moneyed Americans married into British families, it was made for a Stateside audience, but that's not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 a straightforward, if rather stodgy, overview of the aristocracy's pre-first world war Indian summer. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Imagine: Tom Jones \u2013 What Good Am I?<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Tom Jones recently revealed his superpower would be immortality. Well, he's not doing too badly: the coal-miner's son from Pontypridd has seemingly been around forever \u2013 an elemental force with a voice like Thor's own hammer. In this edition of Imagine, which first aired in 2010, Alan Yentob talks to the Welsh legend \u2013 or rather stands back and absorbs the charisma blast \u2013 while the likes of Cerys Matthews and Robbie Williams hail the man with the golden lungs. Followed by a live gig at the LSO St Luke's, and a collection of archive performances. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p>",
  "<p>At first, I didn't see this peacock butterfly against the shed wall. Its wings were folded and the camouflage was flawless. Then it moved. I was tidying and afraid I might harm it, so I put a tentative hand out to move it. Slowly, stiffly it stepped onto my fingers, remaining on my hand for half an hour. After the fascination passed, I realized I had surrendered use of one arm to this dazzling creature. I managed to continue gardening with my right but the left was dedicated to warming. It stayed with me for a few trips back and forth across the garden before leaping skyward with directed speed not normally associated with butterflies. Then it was gone. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605404\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347612902250/JBrown2012PeacockButterfly2.jpg\" alt=\"butterfly\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So often exotic species get the attention. This is not a rare butterfly, with a range stretching from western Europe to Japan. I love it all the more for its commonness. On a sunny afternoon there are a few working around the buddleia. They are fascinating for their brilliant markings, their wood-bark underside, and for their longevity. I have found them over-wintering in the shed, when spotting a common butterfly becomes a truly rare joy. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605405\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347612935448/JBrown2012Buddleia.jpg\" alt=\"budleia\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The buddleia, butterfly bush, surprises us each year with its aggressive growth. From a cluster of remarkably hard stumps, its branches quickly extend over the fence (the neighbours don't seem to mind) and threaten to blanket the currants. We try to brace them rather than trimming, at least until the blossoms are finished. </p> <p>Our mizuna and red lettuce are thriving within the protective circles of slug rings. It will be the last of our lettuce planting for the season, as the nights are becoming far too cold already. Though tarnished, the slug rings still seem effective. Our dill, left unprotected, was so thoroughly consumed, erased, while we were traveling that I forgot on our return I had ever planted it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605406\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347612963520/JBrown2012Lettuces.jpg\" alt=\"lettuces\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I have a few alpines along a rocky border, and one in a pot. I grow them simply for their mesmerizing symmetry that, to me, is contribution enough. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605407\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347612993880/JBrown2012Alpines.jpg\" alt=\"alpines\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Partridges and/or gastropods stripped most of our shallot tops just before harvest. We brought in lots of shallots, but can't braid them this year. Instead, they have become a temporary centerpiece on the dining table, shimmering in their golden skin. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605408\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347613025523/JBrown2012Shallots.jpg\" alt=\"shallots\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We try not to compost too much. Composting loses nutrients as it gives a huge boost to the soil directly under it before the compost is spread around. Any material that can be mulched goes on the paths between the beds, or directly on them in the autumn. However, ground elder roots and other ambitious weeds need to decay at a safe distance. With neighbours adding their weeds, the pile has grown. Last year our contributions were riddled with nasturtium seeds. They thrived in the rich soil, crowning the heap with a glorious tangle of salad leaves and blooms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396605409\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347613057236/JBrown2012Nasturtiums.jpg\" alt=\"nasturtiums\" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Soon enough, the leaves will drop from the cherry tree, the harvests will be finished, the garden beds mulched. And hopefully, there will be a peacock butterfly or two in the shed. I will leave the window open.</p>",
  "<p>As delegates gather in Birmingham for the National Housing Federation's annual conference, the country is gripped by the biggest housing crisis in a generation and the longest double dip recession since the Second World War.</p> <p>The facts are stark. Housebuilding is down, homelessness is up, private rents have hit record highs and we have a mortgage market where people are struggling to get mortgages.</p> <p>The latest government figures tell us that less than 100,000 homes were started in the 12 months to June \u2013 a 10% decrease on the previous 12 months. This week, and every week, 2,500 less homes will be built than are needed.</p> <p>Two years ago, Labour warned the government that by recklessly raising taxes and cutting spending too far and too fast, they risked putting the recovery at risk. We warned that cutting the housing budget by 60% would not only be a devastating blow to housebuilding, the construction industry and the wider economy but also to the millions of families in need of a home.</p> <p>Since then the government has announced countless schemes and initiatives from the new homes bonus to the housing strategy \u2013 a \"revolution to get Britain building\". But nothing has stopped the remorseless deepening of the housing crisis, which led to a 9% contraction of the construction industry, the single biggest reason for the double-dip recession.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, we had yet more announcements. They included more assaults on the planning system and affordable housing rather than blame of its own failed policies.</p> <p>With the ink not yet dry on the National Planning Policy Framework, the chancellor and the prime minister told us of yet another \"radical reform\" of the planning system. Reducing requirements to build affordable housing through section 106 is fundamentally wrong. It cannot be right for Whitehall to rob local people of their ability to require developers to build affordable housing in their communities.</p> <p>While some measures announced have the potential to help, there was little by way of new investment, suggesting the government has failed to learn the lessons of history.</p> <p>Economic recovery requires us to build our way out of recession. Whether it was the revival from the depression of the 1930s or Britain's post-war recovery.</p> <p>The government needs to show the same determination now as the Labour government did in 2008 when, faced with a global crisis, it increased investment in housing to build 112,000 affordable homes, sustain 160,000 jobs and 3,000 apprenticeships.</p> <p>We have proposed bringing forward infrastructure investment and have called on the government to repeat the bankers bonus tax to fund tens of thousands of affordable homes. The National Housing Federation has calculated that \u00a31bn would lever in \u00a38bn of investment from housing associations, building up to 70,000 affordable homes and creating over 300,00 jobs.</p> <p>Action to free up the mortgage market is also essential. The banks are simply not passing on money from the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme. They must be obliged to.</p> <p>The government has continued Labour's drive to free up public land for housebuilding, but it must go further and consider schemes to provide public land to housing associations and other developers for free at the point of use with pay back over time. Such a scheme would overcome the initial cost of land and get affordable housebuilding going.</p> <p>The government must also encourage innovation among local authorities and housing associations. It was a step forward that the government proceeded with Labour's plans to free councils to build the next generation of council homes through housing revenue account reform. The government must now provide help and support to those innovative councils taking advantage of that reform to ensure they use the headroom to maximise the number of homes built.</p> <p>If the government really meant what it said about getting Britain building, it would have put housing centre stage of its economic recovery plan and invested. But it has not. We will put housing centre-stage in a way it has not been for a generation and homes, jobs and growth will lie at the heart of our recovery plan.</p> <p><em>Jack Dromey is Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington and shadow housing minister</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>"
