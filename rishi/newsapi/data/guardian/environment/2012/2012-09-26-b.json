  "<p>Alfred Russel Wallace arrived in Singapore in 1854 with a simple plan in mind. He would survey the region's wildlife and ship specimens back to London for sale to museums and wealthy collectors. His financial security rested on the foreign exotica for which Victorians had a seemingly insatiable appetite.</p> <p>The British naturalist amassed thousands of insects and birds during eight years in southeast Asia. And though Wallace's strange creatures sold for good money back home, the collection had a more profound value. Through studying the animals, Wallace hit on one of the world's greatest scientific discoveries: the theory of evolution through natural selection.</p> <p>Wallace's work on the theory, along with major insights into biodiversity, are described in thousands of pages of books, articles, drawings and paintings, which appear together for the first time today, in a web project directed by <a href=\"http://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/staff/van_wyhe.html\" title=\"John van Wyhe\">John van Wyhe</a>, a historian at the National University of Singapore. The <a href=\"http://wallace-online.org/\" title=\"Wallace Online project\">Wallace Online project</a> was funded by an anonymous US donor, and comes ahead of next year's centenary of Wallace's death.</p> <p>Wallace's publications were distributed among thousands of magazines and newspapers, and had never been collected together in one place. The project contains 28,000 pages of searchable documents and 22,000 images. They include stunning pictures of blue-throated bee eaters, asian fairy-bluebirds and meticulous drawings of butterflies and beetles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396742142\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348677164745/The-new-bird-of-paradise--001.jpg\" alt=\"The new bird of paradise that Wallace discovered, Wallace's standard-wing\" width=\"220\" height=\"354\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new bird of paradise that Wallace discovered, Wallace's standard-wing. Photograph: Wallace Online</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wallace Online</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Van Wyhe, who directed <a href=\"http://darwin-online.org.uk/\" title=\"Darwin online project\">a similar project</a> for Darwin's works several years ago, said the Wallace collection was intended as a reliable source of information on the naturalist whose name was so eclipsed by Darwin's. \"This needed to be done for Wallace. He's far less well known than Darwin, and it's high time people had reliable material on his work,\" van Wyhe said.</p> <p>The history of science is littered with names overlooked, but few so much as Wallace. In July 1858, the first papers on natural selection were read aloud at the <a href=\"http://www.linnean.org/\" title=\"The Linnean Society\">Linnean Society</a> in London, one from Darwin, the other from Wallace. Though both men announced the theory at the same time, Darwin's publication, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species\" title=\"On the Origin of Species\">On the Origin of Species</a>, the following year was the seed of revolution that made senior scientists take notice.</p> <p>The book was not the only factor. Victorian modesty played a part in Wallace's diminished place in history, and perhaps some deference to what he, a poor and unprivileged man, saw as the great figures of science. \"The Victorians were falling over themselves to be more modest than everybody else. Modesty was a high virtue. So Wallace, from the very beginning, referred to it as Darwin's theory, and he never relented to the end of his life,\" said van Wyhe.</p> <p>From 1855, Wallace published a series of articles that came ever closer to declaring the theory of evolution through natural selection. In the midst of a malarial fever, on the island of Ternate in Indonesia, he had a moment of clarity, that many are born, lots die, and only a few survive. He sent an essay from the island to Darwin, who passed it to the great geologist, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lyell\" title=\"Charles Lyell\">Charles Lyell</a>, who then proposed it to the Linnean Society alongside an essay from Darwin.</p> <p>\"It's one of the greatest ironies in history. Wallace sends his essay to the one man in the world who has been working on this for 20 years. And Darwin, again the perfect gent, passes it to Lyell, and they decide to publish essays from them both,\" said van Wyhe.</p> <p>Wallace's thorough survey of wildlife led to another breakthrough in 1859, known today as the <a href=\"http://www.radford.edu/~swoodwar/CLASSES/GEOG235/zoogeog/walline.html\" title=\"The Wallace Line\">Wallace line</a>. He noticed that species on either side of an invisible line between Australia and Asia were substantially different, despite being close geographical neighbours. The observation clashed with the thinking of the day, that species were created for their particular environment. Wallace proposed the animals came from two ancient, larger landmasses, a Super Asia and a Super Australia, which had long since sunk beneath the waves. \"He couldn't have imagined plate tectonics, which is the real explanation, and that Australia started out in South America,\" said van Wyhe.</p> <p>Among Wallace's other writings are notes on local cuisine. In a passage on the <a href=\"http://wallace-online.org/content/frameset?pageseq=157&amp;itemID=S715.1&amp;viewtype=side\" title=\"Durian fruit\">durian fruit</a>, Wallace describes a large coconut-sized fruit with short, stout spines, liable to fall from trees and cause spectacular wounds to the unwary. \"When brought into a house the smell is often so offensive that some persons can never bear to taste it. This was my own case when I first tried it in Malacca, but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater,\" he writes. Having declared the taste almost impossible to describe, he offers \"a rich butter-like custard, highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it, but intermingled with it come wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, brown sherry, and other incongruities\".</p> <p>In other papers, Wallace laments the rate at which species are being forced to extinction, and makes one of the earliest calls for conservation. He likens species to letters that make up the volumes of Earth's history, and their loss obliterating an invaluable record of the past.</p> <p>\"Future ages will certainly look back upon us as a people so immersed in the pursuit of wealth as to be blind to higher considerations,\" <a href=\"http://wallace-online.org/content/frameset?pageseq=20&amp;itemID=S078&amp;viewtype=text\" title=\"On the Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago\">he writes</a> from the Malay archipelago in 1863.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 A ruinous stalemate in the arena of public affairs. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9559043/Andrew-Mitchell-under-pressure-to-quit-after-police-suggest-he-DID-call-them-f-plebs.html\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> is battered and bruised but won't go, even though the police dearly wish he would. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/14/sir-norman-bettison-hillsborough-comments\" title=\"\">Sir Norman Bettison</a>, chief constable of West Yorkshire, his reputation trashed after the Hillsborough disaster report, is also digging in, despite the demands of the campaigners and politicos. Surely there's a deal to be struck; the police get Mitchell's scalp but only if they'll give up Bettison's. A straight swap. Both ride off into the sunset. Everyone's happy.</p> <p>\u2022 Oh they'd miss Mitchell for a while. But then, like everyone who's met him, they'd have their memories. Like Ralph Gee. His was just a brief encounter and many years ago \u2013 back in the 1980s. But he has never forgotten it. He was the picture librarian of the Nottingham Evening Post. Andrew \"Pleb\" Mitchell was the local MP who appeared in the office. \"He banged on the counter of the picture library, demanding that a particular one of him should never be used again,\" Ralph recalls. His tone? \"Very arrogant.\" And there was a problem. Apparently each unposed picture of the chief whip was ruined by a \"sneer visible in full face\". The police at parliament would recognise it right away.</p> <p>\u2022 What, meanwhile, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/grant-shapps-posed-web-guru?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Grant Shapps \u2013 or Michael Green</a>, or whatever he calls himself these days \u2013 doing as party chairman? Surely nothing so time-consuming that he cannot make his way to Calderdale, in West Yorkshire. There he'll find a Tory councillor called Roger Taylor. Shapps/Green should really have a word with him. For it is Taylor's way to correspond with Just West Yorkshire, a group he has little time for. He does so with commendable frankness, but one does wonder whether the views espoused are those Shapps/Green would want voiced by party representatives. There's \"Most acts of terrorism are committed by Muslims. I agree there are many minor 'terrorist' groups but they don't worry me just as much.\" And \"We know the vast number of vile and hatred-riddled rioters were black or non-white\". And with regard to the recent Hillsborough report, there's \"Is your ultra-left organisation claiming that the police actually pushed into the terraces and suffocated the victims? Are you telling me that this report is not overloaded with politically correct language rather like the Stephen Lawrence 'enquiry' (a joke in itself) was?\" These are my personal opinions, he told us. There were errors at Hillsborough, he added, but \"I get fed up with being told to toe the line just because the prime minister has apologised\". Lawrence, Hillsborough, Muslims. See, Grant. Plenty for you and he to talk about.</p> <p>\u2022 After two failed attempts at the London mayoralty, what news is there of Lib Dem ex-copper extraordinaire <a href=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Paddick\" title=\"\">Brian Paddick</a>? Not as much as we or he would like, one fears. Asked by a wellwisher at party conference how he occupies his time, he said: \"I keep throwing myself on the mercy of the party, but they can't seem to find a use for me.\" Sorry, Brian. The iceberg has hit. It's every man for himself.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, wasn't it a timely rebuke for the fair tax troublemakers who interrupted a love-in between Dave Hartnett, the former head of HM Revenue and Customs and top types in the field of tax avoidance/planning? Activists burst into the black-tie dinner at New College Oxford to present the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/25/tax-avoidance-party-dave-hartnett\" title=\"\">retiring Hartnett with a lifetime achievement award</a>: a golden handshake statuette. Of particular note to them were the deals cut by the revenue with Goldman Sachs and Vodafone. HMRC waived millions in possible tax payments from both companies. The interruption was not welcomed by those who had paid up to \u00a3900 to hear Hartnett speak, and there emerged one particular hero who, in his Andrew Mitchell-style ire, threatened to \"set the dogs\" on protesters and condemned them as \"trespassing scum\". The event was chaired by <a href=\"http://www.taxchambers.com/?q=users/robert-venables-qc\" title=\"\">Robert Venables QC</a>; author of such as Inheritance Tax Planning, and Tax Planning Through Trusts; and the figure in a tiz \u2013 to whom wise counsel says \"Robert, cool it\" \u2013 looks very much like him.

  "<p>\"I came to Warley on a wet September morning with the sky the grey of Guiseley sandstone.\" That's the first line of John Braine's classic 1959 novel <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010827f\" title=\"\"><strong>Room at the Top</strong></a> and, coincidentally, exactly as much of the book as I have read.</p> <p>I too first came to Warley on a wet September morning with the sky the grey of Guiseley sandstone, watching the new BBC4 adaption alone in my office. The northern town where Joe Lampton has come to seek his fortune is provincial, claustrophobic and really quite appealing. It's not grey and gritty as you'd expect; most scenes are washed in watery sunlight. The colours are muted but gorgeous, and while the people of Warley are all pale as alabaster, they look more elegant than ill. Plus, you can smoke wherever you want, and everyone is very polite on the phone. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to think about postwar Warley, but I don't think I'm supposed to want to move there.</p> <p>Accountant Joe (Matthew McNulty), from nearby Duffton, is even more provincial than Warley. He's also ambitious, chippy, handsome, sexually frustrated (although not for long \u2013 women are throwing themselves at him), and scheming. He lodges in Warley's most prestigious area \u2013 known locally as T'Top \u2013 and dreams of promotion, three-guinea shirts and marriage to little rich girl Susan (played by Doctor Who's assistant-elect, Jenna-Louise Coleman).</p> <p>He is also involved with the older, unhappily married Alice Aisgill (Maxine Peake, magnificent as ever). They have a friends-with-benefits arrangement (\"loving friends\", they call it, which is nicer, and from the book). For a while, Joe manages to run his relationships with Susan and Alice in parallel, but the complications quickly mount up.</p> <p>Lampton is, of course, a prototypical angry young man, but he's no class warrior. He doesn't hate the system \u2013 just his place in it. McNulty captures his resentful, entitled, spoilt demeanour (\"mummy's boy, teacher's pet, housewives' choice,\" says Alice, summing him up) while retaining enough charm to allow us to see why he causes such a stir in Warley. The script is pared-down and pacy; there are none of the longueurs you might associate with dramatising postwar tedium (\"This is like Chekhov, isn't it?\" says Joe's boss during a meeting. \"Sitting here drinking tea, discussing life\"). In fact, it's absolutely gripping, and quite sexy with it.</p> <p>You may be wondering why, during this annual glut of popular period drama, an excellent, intelligent two-part adaption like this one is suddenly turning up, lost and underpublicised on BBC4. It's because it was originally scheduled for April, but had to be postponed due to some last-minute legal complication over the book rights. If you missed it, you've still got time to catch up before tonight's conclusion. It's the perfect thing for a wet September morning.</p> <p>You were probably busy last night watching Keith Allen on drugs (Allen on drugs, not you; actually, it's none of my business), but no previews of that programme were available. I found a substitute that was, in its way, positively hallucinatory. <a href=\"http://natgeotv.com/uk/doomsday-preppers\" title=\"\"><strong>Doomsday Preppers</strong></a> (National Geographic) is a series following eccentric American suburbanites as they prepare for the end of civilisation, largely by buying too much food and storing it until it goes bad. As Mike Mester, who is preparing for civil unrest following global financial meltdown, puts it: \"If the grocery shelves are empty, you're only nine meals away from anarchy.\" Mike looks as if he's never skipped breakfast.</p> <p>No show has ever done more to validate my no-nuts-for-winter existence. Mike not only keeps 200 litres of petrol in his house, he refreshes the supply on a three-month rotation because, apparently, petrol goes off. He also has three months' worth of food for 10 people and an arsenal of weapons. He thinks he's thought of everything, but he's only ready for one kind of societal collapse. Riley Cook, meanwhile, is preparing for the north pole and the south pole to switch places. Other preppers are gearing up for \"the total destruction of the power grid\" and \"the Yellowstone supervolcano\". The show does little to&#xa0;contextualise all this paranoia. If&#xa0;anything, it legitimises it.</p> <p>Here and there you get a glimpse of how deluded the preppers are. Preston, who's building up a seed bank to secure his post-apocalyptic future, related a tale of a roadside shoot-out with a fellow prepper as if it heralded the beginning of the End Times. A local newspaper headline gave the incident a slightly different shading: \"Soldier of Fortune or Botched Pot Deal?\" You decide.</p>",

  "<p>In their article on 18 September, Douglas Alexander and Jim Murphy called for changes to our defence export policy. I always have an open mind about how we can improve on already carefully scrutinised policies, but the authors may be missing some key elements of what the government already does.</p> <p>First, they say more needs to be done to crack down on UK front companies. This already happens: UK brokering controls apply to UK nationals operating anywhere, and we prosecute people involved in illegal arms deals worldwide.</p> <p>Second, they call for risk assessments on defence exports to be \"forward-looking\". They already are: we have tough criteria and high standards, and our decision-making process includes a thorough analysis of possible future developments.</p> <p>Third, they suggest that licence applications should be subjected to prior parliamentary scrutiny. This was considered by parliament in 2001 and rejected by the Labour government on the basis that it would confuse the roles of executive and legislature. Current arrangements provide for thorough scrutiny of all export licensing decisions by parliament, which it does conscientiously.</p> <p>Finally, they call for a renewed commitment to secure a global arms trade treaty, but they know full well that the government is already delivering on this. The UK continues to lead international efforts for such a treaty. Ministers and officials worked tirelessly up to and during the negotiating conference in July, and are working intensively to prepare a second short conference in early 2013 to agree a strong treaty which sets high standards and attracts broad support.</p> <p>As the opposition knows, we take these responsibilities very seriously and, under heavy parliamentary scrutiny, will continue to do so. <br><strong>Alistair Burt MP</strong><br><em>Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister for counter-proliferation</em></p> <p>\u2022 Although the UK government has provided \u00a32.4m for the training of police and armed services used by oppressive regimes, this support has focused on trying to improve their human rights and accountability record (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/25/uk-millions-training-oppressive-regimes\" title=\"\">UK gave Sudan and Congo troops training</a>, 26 September). Despite the honourable intentions of the government, it is treading a fine line: working to reform these forces must not give the impression of validating them. We should not forget that Sudanese security forces in particular are implicated in genocide at the very highest levels.</p> <p>Before reform can occur, a more effective response to the brutality of the Sudanese security sector is needed. It is futile to try to reform forces that are still systematically murdering and oppressing civilians that do not fit Khartoum's objective of a unified Arab-Islamist state. Financial support from the UK would be better spent supporting negotiations that resolve all the issues left unanswered by the comprehensive peace agreement \u2013 including where the border between Sudan and South Sudan is located, and the status of southerners in the north.

  "<p>The government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/19/david-cameron-delay-trident-replacement\" title=\"\">review of the future of the Trident submarine nuclear missile system</a> is likely to suggest a significant downgrading of the UK's nuclear deterrent, including the possibility of locking the warheads \"in a cupboard\" for delayed launch only after several weeks of mounting international tension.</p> <p>The revelation was made by Sir Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat who was the defence minister leading the review until the government reshuffle this month. The MP for North Devon said he believed the policy could get support in Whitehall and from senior military figures and Labour.</p> <p>Harvey said past policy on Trident had been dictated by the 1980s view that the only deterrent to a nuclear attack from the then Soviet Union was the belief that the UK could \"flatten Moscow\" in retaliation. This led to the UK building Trident and having at least one armed submarine at sea every hour of every day since.</p> <p>Speaking in detail about the Trident review for the first time since he was sacked as minister, Harvey said: \"If you can just break yourself out of that frankly almost lunatic mindset for a second, all sorts of alternatives start to look possible, indeed credible.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"The Russia of the 21st century \u2013 economically diverse, vaguely democratic, but definitely a very different sort of place from where it was in 1980 \u2013 might find all sorts of damage to be unacceptable short of flattening Moscow.</p> <p>\"Therefore to convince ourselves that the only point of having any deterrent at all is the capability of flattening Moscow is the wrong and distorting lens through which to view the debate.\"</p> <p>Instead of replacing Trident with a like-for-like 24-hour nuclear armed submarine presence at sea after the current system is due to be taken out of service in 2028, cheaper alternatives are being considered. These range from stepping down the patrols, to designing missiles to be launched from aircraft, surface navy ships or land, to a delayed launch system.</p> <p>The delayed-launch model would involve developing a nuclear warhead for a cruise missile that could be launched from existing Astute submarines, Harvey said, \"but having perfected that technology simply put it away in a cupboard and keep it as a contingency in case there ever were to be a deterioration in the global security picture that might need the UK government to take it out of the cupboard\".</p> <p>In this situation, the UK would store the warheads in a secure military location, from where they could be removed, put on the tip of a missile and put to sea within weeks or months.</p> <p>Challenged as to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/defence-and-security-blog/2012/sep/26/nuclear-trident-liberal-democrats?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">why the review did not consider nuclear disarmament</a>, Harvey said: \"I think you might struggle to persuade the British public to do that, but I think you might persuade them to go down to the penultimate step: you keep something for a rainy day, but putting it away and not having it as part of your everyday activity.\"</p> <p>Harvey told a fringe debate at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton that the idea of moving \"down the nuclear ladder\" had support across all three armed services: the army, the Royal Navy and the&#xa0;RAF.</p> <p>He said one reason for growing support for the review's alternatives was a \"perfect storm\" of defence capital costs around 2020, including building the new joint strike fighter aircraft and Type 26 frigates, a new generation of unmanned aircraft, and amphibious craft for the navy.</p> <p>The army, he said, was \"driving around in vehicles which are literally about to fall to pieces\".</p> <p>If defence ministers in 2020 were not to be put in an impossible position, the defence ministers of the next couple of years would have to take the necessary decisions to avert a crisis.</p> <p>He said: \"Believe you me there are very senior figures of all three services who are highly aware of that perfect storm of these costs, who don't believe the Treasury is going suddenly ride to their rescue with a cheque and who are asking, 'Is the opportunity cost of having another generation of nuclear weapons too high, in terms of of what it would prevent us doing on other fronts?'\"</p> <p>He added: \"I can't say with certainty how they [military chiefs] will respond, but a number of them made the point to me to not portray it [the report] in such a political and party way that you don't create the space for some of us to support you and try and help.\"</p> <p>It was not impossible that the review could get support from the Whitehall security sector, said Harvey, who was also hopeful that Labour, or parts of the party, would support the review's conclusion.</p> <p>He added: \"The UK national security strategy no longer even identifies the nuclear menace as a tier one threat.\"</p> <p>In a sign of the potential political row brewing over Trident, John Woodcock, the Labour MP for Barrow in Furness, where new Trident subs would be built, this week accused the Lib Dems of being in a \"hopeless muddle\" over the issue.</p> <p>\"The Lib Dems are either cosmically ill-informed or seeking to pull the wool over the eyes of many thousands whose jobs depend on a thriving shipyard,\" he said.</p> <p>Harvey's response was that creating jobs in Barrow should be the last consideration. \"The idea that you should produce weapons of mass destruction in order to keep 1,500 jobs going in the Barrow shipyard is palpably ludicrous. We could give them all a couple of million quid and send them to the Bahamas for the rest of their lives , and the world would be a much better place, and we would have saved a lot of money,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I had wanted my legacy to be bringing the UK down the nuclear ladder,\" added Harvey, who was knighted after his dismissal in the reshuffle.</p> <p>However, Professor Malcolm Chalmers, research director at the defence think-tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), raised concerns about possible savings by scrapping a Trident replacement, saying he was not yet convinced by the figures.</p> <p>\"If you end up going for an option which steps down the ladder but you don't save any money it's a political non-starter,\" he&#xa0;said.</p> <p>The review was made part of the coalition agreement between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives after the 2010 election because the two parties disagreed strongly on the issue. After Labour decided in 2007 to replace Trident with a like-for-like system, the Lib Dems went into the 2010 general election opposing that policy while the Tories supported it.</p> <p>The review is now being headed by Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who is a Lib Dem.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012 to remove a reference to the UK adopting \"a delayed launch system on the model employed by other countries, including Japan\". This was intended to be a reference to the theoretical possibility that Japan could manufacture a nuclear weapon quickly because of its highly developed domestic nuclear industry, rather than a suggestion that it possesses nuclear weapons now. The Japanese embassy has asked us to point out that \"Japan is firmly committed to its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing, not producing and not permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons, in line with Japan's peace constitution\".</p>",

There is daylight robbery in the mines.\"</p> <p>Mokwane works at Blyvooruitzicht near Carletonville in western Gauteng (\"place of gold\" in Sesotho) province, a place where workers go underground every day fearing it could be their last; where they complain of low pay, bad food and overcrowded single sex hostels; where they say they are still treated like animals by their white bosses. Their simmering resentment could seemingly blow at any moment.</p> <p>South Africa's mines are the frontline in an increasingly ferocious battle over greed, inequality and economic liberation. The sight of angry workers confronting police with sticks and clubs has become a defining one. Strikes are raging above the country's vast reserves of platinum, gold and, this week, coal.</p> <p>On Wednesday, AngloGold Ashanti admitted that most of its 35,000 workers had downed tools in an illegal strike. At the same time industrial action continued at Gold Fields and Anglo American Platinum, whose Rustenburg mines are reporting less than 20% attendance. Many are spurred by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/marikana-mine-shootings-revive-soweto\" title=\"Guardian: Marikana uprising\">last month's uprising at Marikana</a>, when 46 people died before rock drillers won a wage rise.</p> <p>Eighteen years after the end of racial apartheid, workers' patience is all but exhausted. Julius Malema, the fireband politician, has told them: \"They have been stealing this gold from you. Now it's your turn.\"</p> <p>An industry that has divided rich and poor for nearly 150 years, scarred by exploitation and violence, is facing an existential crisis. These are the world's deepest mines and there were 123 deaths last year; this week AngloGold Ashanti announced that a mud rush had killed a shaft timberman who had served the company for 33 years. The incidence of tuberculosis in the mines is up to six times higher than in the general population.</p> <p>Rock drillers have been described as a skilled elite among miners. But Mokwane, 33, told of the hardships his job entails once the cage snaps shut at Blyvooruitzicht.</p> <p>\"To me this work is like some form of torture. You always think, 'Am I going to come out alive, am I going to die?' If the rocks fall on you, you will be seriously injured or killed. It's very dangerous because in most cases we get to the working point and discover it's not safe, but we are told to work. We are afraid because it's not safe and anything could happen at any time.\"</p> <p>When the men are drilling, he continued, they are inside a crevice 1.5 metres high so cannot stand upright. They must get on their knees or squat. \"The challenge is that once you start drilling you have to balance the machine. It is shaking and taking energy from you.\"</p> <p>\"The other problem is smoke that comes out of the machine. You can't put on a nosemask because it easily gets wet. So you just have to breathe the smoke. There also difficulties when it gets too hot, like you are losing breath. When you ask the bosses for permission to go outside for fresh air, they say no, so you can hardly breathe.\"</p> <p>Last November, he recalled, his worst fears were realised when a colleague working close to him was \"totally buried by rocks\". He survived but is confined to a wheelchair. \"To this day,\" Mokwane said bitterly, \"he has not been compensated for his injuries.\"</p> <p>Racial politics are not left above ground, according to Mokwane. \"The white bosses don't respect us; they only respect each other. Sometimes the conditions are not safe but they don't listen. The bad thing is that even our own black bosses are treating us like the white bosses do.\"</p> <p>Like many men here, Mokwane sends more than half his salary to his impoverished family living far away, in his case the rural village of Mqanduli in Eastern Cape province. Mokwane's wife, three children, mother and three siblings are all depending on him to pay for their food, shelter and school fees. He misses his loved ones \"constantly\" but can only go back at Christmas and Easter.</p> <p>Home for the rest of the year is within the mining compound. A visitor to his shared hostel room is assailed by the thick air and smell of stale sweat, cracked floor tiles, filthy walls and power sockets, windows covered with old newspapers, uninviting communal kitchen, empty beer bottles stacked in the corner and battered lockers daubed with red spray paint that are meant to hold all a man's possessions.</p> <p>\"There's nothing that makes me happy staying in this room,\" Mokwane reflected. \"The way we live here is just like we're animals.\"</p> <p>Others start smoking drugs and, if you start complaining, they say, 'It's not your home.'\"</p> <p>Food is supplied by the mine company but does not go down well. Mokwane said: \"In the morning you're given a cup of tea and a quarter loaf. Sometimes you find the bread is long expired and so hard you can't eat it. Our lunch is also not good. In most cases they just give us food cooked the previous day. The rice is so overcooked it is like pap [maize porridge].</p> <p>\"If you try to complain, they say find your own alternative. Sometimes we try to take these complaints through the NUM (National Union of Mineworkers), but there is no change.\"</p> <p>Last week he and his colleagues told the union they are demanding a monthly wage of 12,500 rand (\u00a3938), like their counterparts in Marikana. \"If they don't come back with it, we will put down our tools. My opinion is that all miners in the whole country should go on strike, then start negotiating. No one should go to work until our demands are met. What's happening here shows that the bosses are very cruel. We were recently told the workers would share a 2m rand bonus; but I only got a black bag worth 20 rand (\u00a31.50) in the shop.\"</p> <p>Mokwane's room-mate, Vuyisa Maqundweni, 26, was lounging in a battered plastic chair, a cap pulled down tight on his head. He feels like a prisoner. \"There's nothing I can do in privacy but the situation is that I have no choice. I come back very tired and I need to rest, but others come in drunk and making noise so I cannot.\"</p> <p>Maqundweni says he sends 3,000 rand of his monthly 4,000 rand salary to his wife, small child, mother and other extended family members in Eastern Cape. He believes the yawning chasm between haves and have-nots can no longer go unchallenged.</p> <p>\"The most painful thing is knowing these companies make billions from what we do but they just give us 4,000 rand. This makes me very angry because I know the money is there and they won't pay us. They should give us an increment before people start fighting and dying. If we don't get an increase it's likely people will do what happened in Marikana. They got a big increase but we still get 4,000 rand. How can people in Marikana get paid more than we do?\"</p> <p>There is widespread disaffection with the NUM, which is aligned to the governing African National Congress (ANC). Maqundweni said: \"They are not helping us at all and we think most of them are crooks. They are the cause of us not getting an increase because they no longer respect our interests. The ANC and NUM are working together to make sure we don't get what we want.\"</p> <p>Other miners expressed similar disgruntlement. All were migrant labourers driven from Eastern Cape or Lesotho by unemployment and poverty. They complained about meagre wages, hazardous working conditions, stale or overcooked food and hostel rooms often containing eight men in bunkbeds. They viewed Marikana as a watershed in the fraught contract between capitalist and worker and expressed a collapse of trust in the NUM and ANC.</p> <p>Michael Molomo, 42, a driller whose right arm bears the scar of a rock fall, sometimes starts his shift at 3am and might not emerge until 3pm or 7pm. He says he is paid 4,000 rand and it is not enough to support his wife and eight children. \"Every time I think of them, I miss them so much, but there's nothing I can do.\"</p> <p>\"The drilling is in a closed space that doesn't allow you to breathe freely. You can't stand up and you feel pains in your knees.\"</p> <p>Nomawule, from Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape, says he earns 5,300 rand (\u00a3397) per month. \"People always say, 'The money is not enough,' but, if I look at the work I do and the money I get, it's definitely not enough. It makes me very angry that the bosses are getting so much money and giving us so little. I'm not saying we should get equal pay to the mine bosses but we should get something reasonable.\"</p> <p>The wage makes it difficult to support his wife and 10 children, whom he can only visit twice a year. \"Even as I speak now, I'm really missing my family but the situation is that I have to gather money to go home.\"</p> <p>Living in the compound offers little solace. \"It's a boring situation.</p> <p>Of course there is electricity and we appreciate that, but the fact you have one bed on top of another is not good. It's still like apartheid where people are not treated as human beings. My wife cannot even come here to stay the night.\"</p> <p>He added: \"My collegues and I have a miserable life. I think the only solution to our problem of better wages is a national strike throughout the country. If all miners can put down their tools, I think people would listen and realise we're serious.\"</p> <p>The Guardian contacted Village Main Reef, owner of Mokwane's Blyvooruitzicht mine, with a list of the miners' concerns. Cheryl Walton, a spokesperson for the company, responded: \"I believe that some of these allegations have been raised by employees through the collective bargaining structures and are being addressed by mine management.\"</p> <p>She said: \"The allegations which haven't been raised before can unfortunately not be addressed through the media. Since Village took over the mine on 1 June 2012, we have engaged openly with all stakeholders of Blyvoor about legacy issues and challenges facing the company and threatening its future.\"</p> <p>In The Road to Wigan Pier 75 years ago, George Orwell observed: \"More than anyone else, perhaps, the miner can stand as the type of the manual worker, not only because his work is so exaggeratedly awful, but also because it is so vitally necessary and yet so remote from our experience, so invisible, as it were, that we are capable of forgetting it as we forget the blood in our veins.\"</p> <p>Today, South Africa, rated the most unequal society in the world, stands accused of the same wilful ignorance towards the \"poor drudges underground\" who make lives of privilege possible. Charles Abrahams, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/south-africa-goldminers-lawsuit-negligence\" title=\"Guardian: South African gold miners file lawsuit for negligence\">a lawyer representing 3,000 former miners suffering lung diseases</a>, said: \"The same divide exists. The middle class have got absolutely no idea of what the ordinary life of a miner is on any single day.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US on Wednesday reacted with alarm to Ukraine's plan to introduce sweeping protectionist measures and warned that the actions by the eastern European country could have damaging consequences for the entire global trading system.</p> <p>Amid growing concerns that a synchronised slowdown in the global economy could prompt countries to erect trade barriers, the government in Kiev announced this week that it was raising tariffs on more than 350 goods affecting imports worth $4.6bn (\u00a32.9bn).</p> <p>Trade diplomats in Geneva fear that the changes sought by Ukraine to products including cars, trucks, agricultural machinery, meat, flowers, fruit, vegetables, washing machines and syringes, will be seen as an attempt to renegotiate the terms of its membership of the World Trade Organisation, with knock-on effects in other countries.</p> <p>\"We are very concerned about the systemic implications of what Ukraine is contemplating, and I would say that there's a broad diversity of WTO members that are concerned about what Ukraine is contemplating,\" said Michael Punke, the US ambassador to the WTO, in Geneva. \"To give you an example of how broad that diversity is, this is an issue where I anticipate we'll be working very closely with countries like Brazil to address our concerns.\"</p> <p>Officials in Geneva said Ukraine was entitled to seek increases in tariffs under an obscure part of the WTO rule book, Article 28 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which in the past has been used rarely and usually for fewer than 10 tariffs at a time.</p> <p>Ukraine will now have to enter into negotiations with other WTO members, which will seek compensation for the proposed changes. But given Ukraine's relatively small range of exported products, the EU fears that talks may fail and that Kiev may raise tariffs unilaterally, prompting retaliatory measures.</p> <p>Russia, Ukraine's neighbour, has only just joined the WTO after long and difficult negotiations on its terms of entry and will be one of the countries looking for a swift resolution to the current problem.</p> <p>Pascal Lamy, director-general of the WTO, has repeatedly warned of the risks of a drift into tit-for-tat protectionism since the financial crisis first erupted five years ago, and Ukraine's move comes at a time when growing tensions have been illustrated by a trade spat between the US and China.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of anti-austerity protesters took to the streets of Greece on Wednesday as the country was paralysed by a general strike in the first mass confrontation with Athens's three-month-old coalition government.</p> <p>In one of the biggest demonstrations in the capital in recent years, as many as 200,000 marched on the Greek parliament, according to unions in the public and private sector, which called the strike to oppose new wage and pension cuts \u2013 the price of further rescue funds from international lenders.</p> <p>Clashes broke out between riot police and hooded youths hurling rocks and petrol bombs at the finance ministry. The protesters, many shouting: \"We can take no more. Out with the EU and IMF,\" and said to be part of the crisis-hit country's vibrant \"anti-establishment\" movement, then set light to rubbish cans and bus stops, sending plumes of acrid smoke above the capital. TV footage showed demonstrators running for cover in Syntagma Square, seat of the Greek parliament, as noxious fumes filled the air. More than 100 people were detained.</p> <p>With tensions running high over the new measures \u2013 part of a mammoth \u20ac11.9bn austerity package that is set to save the state more than 5% of GDP over the course of the next two years \u2013 unions are warning that the conservative-led government should take stock or worse could come.</p> <p>In a departure from other mass protests, members of the police force, army, navy and judicial system joined public and private sector employees on the streets. One police officer, who preferred not to give his name, said the Greek state \"should feel deep shame\" at imposing cuts on the very people whose protection it sought.</p> <p>\"This is a warning to the government not to pass the measures,\" said Ilias Iliopoulos at ADEDY, the union of civil servants, insisting that around 350,000 Greeks took part in protest marches nationwide (police put the number in Athens at around 70,000). \"Today was a huge success as witnessed by all those in the armed forces and police who also participated because they, too, will be affected by these cuts. The government must know that if it wants to push us further into a corner, we will react.\"</p> <p>Echoing a view held by many Greeks, Penelope Angelou, an unemployed mother, said passing the measures would be tantamount to a \"parliamentary coup\".</p> <p>\"These parties were given our vote back in June because they promised to re-negotiate the terms of the loan agreement,\" she said, referring to the onerous conditions of the bailout accord Athens signed with its \"troika\" of creditors \u2014 the EU, ECB and IMF \u2013 earlier this year. \"We are all tired,\" she said. \"This is the third year of non-stop cuts and tax increases which have made us poor and divided us as a society. And they have not solved our problem. The recession is going from bad to worse.\"</p> <p>Since the outbreak of Europe's debt crisis in Athens in late 2009, ordinary Greeks, worst hit by repeated rounds of austerity, have seen their purchasing power drop by as much as 50% as poverty and joblessness has reached record levels.</p> <p>After a heated summer of tortuous wrangling with lenders, the alliance led by the prime minister, Antonis Samaras, is expected to finally give the package the go-ahead on Thursday. Time is of the essence, say officials, if the Greek economy is to receive a bumper rescue loan of \u20ac31.5bn, put on hold by the troika since July. The injection is now vital to \"warming up\" the cash-starved real economy. Creditors have made clear that without the controversial measures, there can be no money \u2013 a scenario that would see Greece defaulting on its debt, being forced to declare bankruptcy and leaving the eurozone.</p> <p>\"The cuts have to happen because we are at war, an economic war,\" the country's defence minister, Panos Panagiotopoulos, said this week.</p> <p>Once endorsed, the package will be sent to the parliament for ratification, probably next week. But the government's highwire act of trying to placate lenders while ensuring that the nation is not pushed over the edge will not be easy. Polls have shown the vast majority of Greeks see the measures as deeply unfair and antisocial. Highlighting fears that the recession-inducing policies have pushed Greece into an economic death spiral, the ratings agency Fitch declared on Wednesday that far from being reduced, Athens's debt mountain was growing, with the country's debt-to-GDP ratio set to increase from its current 164.9% to 180.2% in 2014.</p> <p>\"Once the Greek people learn exactly what the measures are there will be uproar,\" Iliopoulos, the trade unionist, told the Guardian. \"Parliament will see mass protests. And it won't be nice.\"</p>",
  "<p>Police have condemned looters who raided a flooded cycle shop as \"despicable\" exceptions to community spirit in the aftermath of devastating damage to a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne.</p> <p>A man and a woman have been arrested and nine bikes recovered after the overnight theft in Newburn of an estimated \u00a330,000 worth of stock in a street piled high with debris, abandoned cars and mud.</p> <p>Many areas remained on high alert, especially in North Yorkshire where Boroughbridge, Tadcaster and other communities beside rivers swollen by run-off from the Pennines were still at risk.</p> <p>The main bridges in Boroughbridge and Tadcaster have been closed, with water in the rivers Ure and Wharfe lapping the top of their arches. But residents in a nearby care home, including a 101-year-old, had their tea as usual while Environment Agency staff pumped out their cellar.</p> <p>New properties close to rivers have emerged again as an issue for flood control, along with concern at the very rapid build-up of flood water in urban areas. Although much of the north of England saw the heaviest September rain for 30 years, doubling the average for the month in many places, it was prolonged and steady for two days, rather than falling in the sudden torrents typical of extreme weather.</p> <p>The centre of low pressure responsible for the downpour has moved south but with much lower rainfall and most of the UK is expected to have quieter and dryer conditions before unsettled weather and potentially more rain returns, primarily to northern areas, next week. Heavily disrupted transport links between Scotland and the the Midlands have been largely restored, although the A1 Great North Road remained closed northbound for 40 miles through the Vale of York.</p> <p>The thefts from KB Cycles in Newburn have led to extra police patrols and Acting Ch Supt Dave Byrne of Northumbria police said: \"The safety of business owners and residents is paramount and it is despicable if people are thinking of taking advantage of the bad weather and using it as an opportunity to break in to properties. It is also important that people remember to take their own steps to ensure the security of their premises and belongings and make sure they lock doors and windows and use alarms where they have them.\"</p> <p>Pumps have been set up to rid shops and houses of up to six feet of water and temporary bridges have been built between dry islands in the main street, where water continued to gush from damaged culverts. Major clear-ups were also under way at Morpeth in Northumberland, where 40 houses were flooded for the second time in five years, Sunderland, Stockton on Tees, Durham and York \u2013 the last a city inured to flooding in the centre from its twin rivers the Ouse and Fosse.</p> <p>The latest drenching worked its way chronologically through the York Dungeon museum, according to general manager Helen Douglas who said: \"At 9am the water first appeared in the Viking area, then it spread into the torture chamber, the executions exhibit andthe witches space. By the time it reached the Dick Turpin exhibit, we had to stand and deliver the closed sign.\"</p> <p>Talks between the insurance industry and the government over future cover for properties in flood risk areas have been given further urgency by the latest damage.</p> <p>The Association of British Insurers said the latest bill had not yet been estimated but promised that members would \"be pulling out all the stops to help customers hit by bad weather\".</p> <p>There is growing concern at the lack of progress on a new agreement to provide cover for some 200,000 homes at serious flood risk when the current arrangements, agreed after widespread damage in 2008, end in June next year.</p> <p>The Environment Agency continued overnight work on clearing drains and watercourses and monitoring danger points, especially in North Yorkshire.</p> <p>More than 100 flood alerts and 57 flood warnings remained in force on Wednesday night, more than half of them in the north, while the total number of houses sent individual warnings by the Environment Agency since Sunday topped 105,000.</p>",

And in particular, a stain on those who have failed to stand up to these atrocities and in some cases aided and abetted Assad's reign of terror.</p> <p>\"If the United Nations charter is to have any value in the 21st century we must now join together to support a rapid political transition. And at the same time no one of conscience can turn a deaf ear to the voices of suffering.\"</p> <p>The prime minister was not aiming his criticisms at the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who warned on Tuesday that the security council's failure to act on Syria could lead to \"a regional calamity with global ramifications\".</p> <p>British officials said that on the diplomatic level the prime minister had in mind Russia and China, which have blocked attempts by Britain to agree tough UN security council resolutions condemning the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Tehran has a longstanding alliance with Assad while Britain recently stopped a Russian ship carrying helicopters to Syria by cancelling its insurance.</p> <p>The prime minister, who called for the removal of Assad, said that his defenders were wrong to blame the Arab spring for the bloodshed. \"Those who look at Syria today and blame the Arab spring have got it the wrong way round. You cannot blame the people for the behaviour of a brutal dictator. The responsibility lies with the dictator.\"</p> <p>He said people who invested great hope in the Arab spring were also wrong to give up even in light of the bloodshed in Syria and the political uncertainty after the election of Islamist leaders in countries such as Egypt. Libya showed the mixed picture, the prime minister said, as he condemned the murder of the US ambassador Chris Stephens in a \"despicable act of terrorism\" while hailing elections to a new congress.</p> <p>The prime minister said: \"One year on, some believe that the Arab spring is in danger of becoming an Arab winter. They point to the riots on the streets, Syria's descent into a bloody civil war, the frustration at the lack of economic progress and the emergence of newly elected Islamist-led governments across the region.</p> <p>\"But they are in danger of drawing the wrong conclusion. Today is not the time to turn back, but to keep the faith and redouble our support for open societies, and for people's demands for a job and a voice.\"</p> <p>Cameron won important support when Mohamed Morsi, the new Egyptian president, agreed with him on the need to step up pressure on China and Russia to secure a new UN security council resolution on Syria. In their first meeting Morsi told Cameron a new resolution should focus on sanctions, with the aim of isolating the Assad regime, because military action would worsen the crisis.</p> <p>Cameron, who held his first meeting in New York with Morsi, believes that the performance of the first elected leader of the world's largest Arab country shows the progress made in the Arab spring. Morsi upset Iran when he used an appearance at the non-aligned conference in Tehran to criticise Ahmadinejad for taking the wrong side in Syria.</p> <p>The prime minister used the example of Morsi to criticise former world leaders who wrongly tolerated dictators on the grounds that they guaranteed stability. \"The fact is that for decades, too many were prepared to tolerate dictators like Gaddafi and Assad on the basis that they would both keep their people safe at home and promote stability in the region and the wider world. In fact, neither was true. Not only were these dictators repressing their people, ruling by control not by consent, plundering the national wealth and denying people their basic rights and freedoms, they were funding terrorism overseas as well.\"</p> <p>Cameron did not name any former leaders. But Tony Blair embraced Muammar Gaddafi when he abandoned Libya's programme of weapons of mass destruction and was humiliated by Assad when he tried to reach out to Damascus in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>In a dig at Blair and George W Bush, who had hoped that removing Saddam Hussein would unleash a new democratic Iraq, Cameron said his own approach was not \"naive\". He said: \"I am not naive in believing that democracy alone has some magical healing power. I am a liberal Conservative, not a neoconservative.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's tough language on Syria reflects Britain's exasperation with China and Russia, which are using their vetoes as permanent members of the UN security council to block new resolutions. Britain believes there is no hope of Moscow and Beijing giving any ground at the moment.</p> <p>Officials talk of a \"logjam\" because the process launched by Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has failed. The prime minister believes there are two parallel processes under way in Syria \u2013 moves, led by the likes of Annan, to encourage a political transition at the top and a bloody revolution bubbling from below that will take some time to lead to a political transition at the top.</p> <p>Cameron would like the security council to agree to a new resolution under chapter seven of the UN charter, which authorises the use of force. This would provide legal authority for non-military intervention in Syria and could provide legal cover for military intervention at a later stage.</p> <p>The prime minister believes that, in the highly unlikely event of a new security council resolution, military action would be unrealistic. No-fly zones and safe zones would involve military force that could not be delivered.</p> <p>In his speech the prime minster announced that Britain was to provide \u00a33m for a Unicef fund to help 500,000 refugees in Syria, more than half of whom are children, as winter approaches.</p>",
  "<p>The lowest lying areas on the river Wansbeck in Morpeth, Northumberland, are among the areas that have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/26/torrential-rain-moves-south\" title=\"\">flooded again</a>. Thirty to 40 houses, a B&amp;B and a local pub have had to be evacuated. Another 10 or so homes have been affected by floodwater from the Cotting Burn \"stream\" \u2013 their third flood in four years. Now they will have virtually no chance of finding affordable flood insurance, no possibility of ever selling their houses, if things don't change.</p> <p>There is an air of frustration and exasperation in Morpeth today, because so many people in the community \u2013 including the <a href=\"http://www.morpethfloodaction.org.uk/index.html\" title=\"\">Morpeth Flood Action Group (MFAG)</a>, councillors, the local MP and the regional flood and coastal flood and coastal committee of the Environment Agency \u2013 have worked hard to put into place measures such as work on stopping the Cotting Burn flooding and developing an insurance scheme to prevent the events we're now seeing.</p> <p>Some neighbours close the curtains and try to ignore the rain, others steel themselves for the dreary, wearying task of moving all their stuff upstairs \u2013 yet again. All obediently heed the flood warning, in the knowledge that, if we are flooded, we will again face the search for alternative accommodation \u2013 and that will mean months away from our homes and communities. You worry about your neighbours, particularly those who are ill, or getting on a bit, and everyone knows of someone who died because the whole experience was just too much for them <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Morpeth_Flood\" title=\"\">in 2008</a>. So how could it happen? It all comes down to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/mar/25/public-sector-cuts-where-will-they-hit#Morpeth\" title=\"\">cuts</a> and delays by government. Plans for upstream storage by damming part of the Wansbeck and for strengthened flood defences within the town were well advanced even before the 2008 flood. Revised proposals, based on the needs of the community, expressed by MFAG, were worked up by the Environment Agency, and had been awaiting final approval by the Labour government when the coalition came to power. Once in place at Defra, the environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, responded to George Osborne's call for government department cuts by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jul/14/caroline-spelman-cuts-flood-defences\" title=\"\">divesting herself of a very large portion of her budget</a> \u2013 while at the same time overseeing a change in the funding arrangements for projects such as the Morpeth flood alleviation scheme.</p> <p>The consequence was that government funding for our \u00a321m project fell way short of what was needed. Its hands tied, the Environment Agency turned to Northumberland county council for funding. In response to lobbying by MFAG and other interest groups, county councillors quickly made radical changes to their capital investment programme so that they could plug the financial gap by \u00a311m. Now the scheme is designed, the planning application has been made and the money is earmarked. And the frustration is palpable. We don't want to go through this again \u2013 ever. The scheme has to be brought forward and work has to begin. Now. Or do we have to await the grim inevitability of flooding after the next downpour?</p>",
  "<p>The day of atonement, what better day for Nick Clegg's big speech? He has shrunk his party's vote, shrivelled its membership and shed councillors like confetti. Some polls warn he may hardly have more than a people-carrier full of MPs after the next election. He need not warn his activists to expect \"abuse and vitriol\" for they already know they join \"generations of Liberals marching towards the sound of gunfire.\" Numbly, his party seems to accept it for now \u2013 or the rump that hasn't already bolted. But few leaders survive so grim a prospect as they approach an election.</p> <p>Remorse? Regret? Atonement? No: he did the right thing. No turning back, even as the economy plummets. Billed as \"a serious speech for serious times\", it takes delusional optimism for Clegg to claim \"our journey\" is \"dealing with our debts and delivering growth\", while every month the deficit soars, growth declines and demand is dead.</p> <p>Saving the nation was why he yoked his party to Cameron: this speech reprised his scare-mongering Greek comparisons. Any relaxation of austerity risks the country going bust: with dark 1930s allusions he warned that \"extremists thrive in tough times.\"</p> <p>For now his party acquiesces, accessories to Osborne's catastrophic failure. With a bit of manipulation, he got them to vote against a Plan B, no change to Osborne's fiscal straitjacket. The mystery is why, when both parties equally fear an early election, Clegg still cleaves to Osborne orthodoxy when he could demand the Keynesian stimulus policies his party championed at the election \u2013 and Vince Cable murmurs sotto voce.</p> <p>Boasting they are \"anchored in the centre-ground\", Clegg suffers the old delusion of the middle. \"If you're attacked by Liam Fox on one side and Ed Balls from the other, you're in the right place,\" as if navigating by splitting the difference between flat and round earthers. \"Our mettle has been tested\" in making difficult and painful decisions. What he didn't say was whose mettle has been tested most \u2013 not Lib Dem politicians but all those whose benefits, services and jobs are cut by his \"harsh realities of government\", the bottom half most.</p> <p>Na\u00efve, vain or obtuse, he has been useful yellow camouflage for this most radical and ideological of Conservative governments. As if still beguiled by Cameron's affable rose garden manner, Clegg has colluded with the great Conservative blueprint for dismantling the state, outsourcing every service and withering welfare. He joked about Boris Johnson's gleeful claim this week that \"Clegg is a natural Tory\". But history's charge against him will be that after all these years of planning the politics of coalition, he failed to secure any of his party's key demands: no relaxation of fiscal austerity, no rescue of the NHS, more tuition fees but no electoral reform, no Lords reform, not even reform of party funding. No surprise reform went unmentioned.</p> <p>Every Lib Dem leader tussles to say what their party is for, easy as the \"party of protest\" but far harder as the party of someone else's government. \"Fairer taxes\" is all they are left with, to be plugged from now until election day.</p> <p>Clegg claims it as their badge of social justice, \"the system as a whole tilted in favour of those on middle and low incomes.\" He simply ignores what the Institute for Fiscal Studies always said: this raising of personal allowances gives the bottom third nothing, the middle only a little, while the main gainers are the richest third: that's probably why Osborne gave it to him. Worse, universal credit will wipe out most of that little gain by the middle.</p> <p>Yet again Clegg claimed social mobility is his mission, but when he ignores every projection that his government's policies will drive the social divide far wider, is he obtuse or dishonest?</p> <p>Equality was never the Lib Dems' strong suit, shying away from what the state must always do to stop wealth flowing upwards to the few. But liberty is their USP.</p> <p>This week they voted for assisted dying, the last great intrusion of the state on people's private decisions over life and death. They threw out secret courts. They rejected the Tories' latest deregulation of planning. On green energy Clegg pledged, \"let the conservatives be in no doubt. We will hold them to their promises.\" We shall see, with a windmill-hating environment secretary.</p> <p>\"If you don't like me, vote Labour,\" Clegg told the Birmingham Post this week. After his contemptuous claim that \"Labour plunged us into austerity'' and \"let down the most vulnerable\", few imagine any Lib-Lab coalition could ever include him.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012 because the original said \"he yolked his party to Cameron\" and spelled straitjacket as straightjacket.</p>",

The CBI added that retailers were also expecting stronger demand in the month ahead, boosting hopes that the economy could bounce back to growth in the third quarter of the year.</p> <p>Howard Archer, of the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"Given the importance of consumer spending to the economy, this supports hopes that GDP growth in the third quarter will more than offset the 0.5% quarter-on-quarter contraction suffered in the second quarter when it was hit by special factors (the extra day public holiday and wet weather that hit construction and retail sales).</p> <p>\"The CBI survey also lifts hopes that the economy is seeing modest underlying growth.\"</p> <p>Chris Williamson, of the data provider Markit, said: \"Ongoing retail sales growth should help to drive economic growth and raises the likelihood that the UK has risen from its double-dip recession in the third quarter and, from a consumer angle at least, will start the fourth quarter on a reasonably sound footing.\"</p> <p>Official figures due to be released on Thursday are expected to show that the economy contracted less sharply in the second quarter of the year than the Office for National Statistics' previous 0.5% estimate.</p> <p>Analysts are also keenly awaiting the first signal of whether the economy expanded in the third quarter of the year, bringing the double-dip recession to an end. The first estimate of third-quarter GDP will be published late October.</p>",
  "<p>The Lloyd's of London insurance market has reported its strongest six month period for five years after a respite from claims for natural catastrophes that drove the market to a loss a year ago.</p> <p>The three centuries-old market, which insures a wide range of potential incidents through its syndicates, received claims as a result of the Costa Concordia cruise liner which capsized off the coast of Italy causing 32 fatalities.</p> <p>But none of the claims in the first half were on the scale of last year <a href=\"http://www.lloyds.com/~/media/Files/Lloyds/Investor%20Relations/2012/Interim%20results/Files/IR2012_Report.pdf\" title=\"\">when claims of nearly \u00a37bn</a> were made, caused by the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand as well as severe weather in the US.</p> <p>The value of claims fell to \u00a34.6bn while profits reached \u00a31.5bn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/21/lloyds-london-record-claims-natural-disasters\" title=\"\">a dramatic improvement on the loss of \u00a3679m a year ago</a> which it has described as the costliest six month period in its history.</p> <p>Richard Ward, chief executive of Lloyd's, was quick to contrast the market's fortunes with a year ago.</p> <p>\"The result has certainly been helped by the favourable claims climate. But it is testament to the market's disciplined underwriting that, in the face of continuing low premium rates, coupled with low interest rates and the most challenging economic climate for a generation, it is able to return the strongest half year result in five years.\"</p> <p>The weather over the next six months will have a significant impact on its full year figures and the market released its figures as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/north-england-floods-homes\" title=\"\">UK was hit by a storm that the Met Office described as the most intense to cross the country for over 30 years</a>.</p> <p>Chairman John Nelson, a former investment banker who earlier this month called for sweeping changes to the culture of the financial services industry, warned that the market could not \"count on an extended period of low claims activity lasting until the end of 2012\".</p> <p>\"This is particularly the case whilst interest rates remain at historically low levels, meaning we cannot rely on investment income to make up for underwriting deficits,\" Nelson said.</p> <p>Investments made \u00a3619m, up from \u00a3548m, and better than expected because of the turmoil in the eurozone, which has driven down yields on government bonds in countries perceived to be relative \"safe havens\".</p> <p>Lloyd's has been preparing for the potential fallout from any disintegration from the eurozone and is working on the basis that it will have the same impact on its market as claims from a single hurricane, Ward said.</p> <p>The market has already reduced its exposure to the eurozone but finance director Luke Savage said there could still be claims.</p> <p>\"If there is a break-up one can only assume that there will be a proliferation of claims against banks for bad advice, as there was after the dotcom bubble, and the sub-prime situation in the US,\" Savage told Reuters.</p> <p>The impact of losses to crops caused by the drought in the US's so-called corn belt will not be fully known until the second half of the year, although the market's initial estimate was that it would be containable.</p> <p>The closely watched combined ratio \u2014 used to measure the profitability of its underwriting \u2014 was 88.7%, which demonstrates that the business was running at a profit compared with the reading of over 100% \u2014 which represents break even \u2014 a year ago.</p> <p>Earlier this month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/sep/06/banks-change-lloyds-london-tell-them-so\" title=\"\">Nelson warned</a> that bankers had \"believed their own spin\" in the run up to the banking crisis and \"the problem has been that they have recently been receiving the sort of financial rewards which rightly belong to the capital providers themselves\".</p>",
  "<p>Much the biggest cheer during Nick Clegg's conference speech came when he announced that Paddy Ashdown was back. Yes, the old hero of Bosnia has returned to head the Lib Dems' general election campaign. At last they again have a leader who can gaze inspirationally into the distance, who has the authoritative bark of a colonel in the Guards, and who can slit a man's throat with one hand while crafting a position paper on council tax adjustment with the other.</p> <p>Yes, the Liberal Democrat battle for a fairer, more equitable society is to be led by Jeremy John Durham Ashdown aka Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon. At last they have at the helm someone even the Tory chief whip cannot call a pleb.</p> <p>As the conference cheered, the giant screen was filled with a huge image of Pad, smiling broadly, eyes so crinkled he could hardly see through them. Back it took them to a simpler, happier time, when you could hate the Tories as much as you liked, and nobody ever told you your policies were rubbish because nobody cared.</p> <p>It was certainly the high spot of the speech. Clegg begged his listeners not to look back in the rear view mirror, while he resolutely did exactly that, quoting David Steel and Jo Grimond, as he told them that the heroes of the past \u2013 those who kept the faith while the Liberals had little support and few seats \u2013 were the giants on whose shoulders the present party stood. He made them sound like the early Christians, hiding in the cellars of Rome.</p> <p>It was a cunning sleight of hand, creating nostalgia for the future. A cosy remembrance of things to come, fond recollections of the next few years. Or to put it another way, \"I don't care what you think. I'm sticking with the coalition, whatever you say.\"</p> <p>It was a workmanlike speech. The theme was size. We faced a \"big\" crisis. The business bank was going to be the world's biggest. What kind of bold steps had the Lib Dems taken? \"Big bold steps.\" What had the party achieved in the last budget? Why, two \"big\" announcements. What rise in the state pension had they pushed for? The biggest ever. And what would the party achieve with its courage and the vision? The \"big\" prizes! It was beginning to sound less like a political speech and more like a McDonald's menu: supersize Clegg. We had to be stuffed to bursting with Lib Dem successes.</p> <p>There were a few jokes. Boris Johnson had written praising him this week. \"At least there is one party leader he is prepared to embrace in public.\" (Boris's crusade to upstage David Cameron reaches a climax next week at the Tory conference, and he might only be stopped by a well-placed sniper in the balcony.)</p> <p>Clegg said the Lib Dems would hold the Tories to their promises on the environment. \"To make blue go green you have to add yellow, and that's what we are doing!\"</p> <p>Oh dear. This gag, vaguely based on a paint-mixing chart, got the biggest laugh of the afternoon. Which tells you all you need to know.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012 because the original said \"the giants on whose soldiers the present party stood\".</p>",

He vowed he would force the Conservatives to stick to their green promises.</p> <p>He also announced the appointment of Lord Ashdown, the ever-energetic former party leader, to head up his 2015 election campaign.</p> <p>The surprise Ashdown appointment is likely to shore up Nick Clegg's position in the party and will reassure those activists worried that the Clegg circle has a natural leaning to a second coalition with the Conservatives.</p> <p>Now 71, Ashdown in the past has been more willing to co-operate with Labour, but this week made a point of saying he hated both Tories and Labour equally.</p> <p>He has spent much of the past year writing a book on the special forces, and the announcement of his return to frontline political combat drew the strongest applause from conference delegates.</p> <p>Infectiously optimistic, Ashdown will have the job of embedding himself in the organisation of the election, including the selection of candidates and key messages.</p> <p>In a speech full of attacks on the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, but notably not Ed Miliband, Clegg tried to depict the Liberal Democrats as a matured party of the centre willing to save the British economy, but also determined to ensure that further inescapable belt tightening starts at the top.</p> <p>He made no mention of political reform or civil liberties, two issues that have in the past formed pillars of conference speeches by Liberal Democrat leaders, preferring instead to focus on the huge economic challenges facing the UK economy.</p> <p>Defending George Osborne's politically disastrous March budget, he said: \"At the last budget, we made two big announcements: that we were spending \u00a33,000m pounds increasing the tax-free allowance, and just \u00a350m reducing the top rate of tax while recouping five times that amount in additional taxes on the wealthiest. I insisted on the first. I conceded the second.\"</p> <p>He said stood by the budget \"because as liberals, we want to see the tax on work reduced, the tax on unearned wealth increased, and the system as a whole tilted in favour of those on low and middle incomes. The budget delivered all three.\"</p> <p>He then vowed to veto any further cut in the top rate of tax, a commitment that did not surprise or disturb allies of Osborne.</p> <p>He said: \"Now that we have brought the top rate of tax down to 45p \u2013 a level, let's not forget, that is still higher than throughout Labour's 13 years in office \u2013 there can be no question of reducing it further in this parliament. All future cuts in personal taxation must pass one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by and get on?\"</p> <p>He said the issue facing the parties at the next election would be how to distribute the pain of inescapable belt tightening.</p> <p>He declared his party's independence in finding the best way to cut the deficit, saying: \"If we have to ask people to take less out or pay more in, we'll start with the richest and work our way down, not the other way around. We won't waver in our determination to deal with our debts. But we will do it in our own way, according to our own plans, based on our own values. So we will not tether ourselves to detailed spending plans with the Conservatives through the next parliament\".</p> <p>He also refused to exclude further cuts to welfare, saying the size of the welfare budget in overall government spending was \"an inconvenient truth that could not be hidden\".</p> <p>He also told his party that the debate about a fiscal stimulus, or calls for Plan A to become Plan B, was often a caricature that should not go unchallenged. He said: \"If Plan A really was as rigid and dogmatic as our critics claim, I'd be demanding a Plan B.</p> <p>\"What is needed \u2013 and what we're delivering \u2013 is a plan that is tough enough to keep the bond markets off our backs, yet flexible enough to support demand.\"</p> <p>Clegg will leave Brighton aware that his apology on tuition fees has not led to an immediate lift in his poll standing, but aware that most senior figures are wiling him to take the party into the next election, and broadly happy with his positioning of the party at the centre of the political spectrum. But there is also an acknowledgement that if he appears a serious drag on his party's recovery, calls for him to stand aside may develop in 12 to 18 months time.</p> <p>He easily saw off a push from the left to change economic policy explicitly, but he suffered two defeats \u2013 on planning policy for housing on Wednesday and secret courts on Tuesday \u2013 that will require him to reopen difficult talks with his coalition colleagues.</p>",

  "<p>Whichever way you run the numbers about climate change, 2012 looks set to go into the record-books.

In a year when extreme weather affected no less than 80% of the country, with a potential cost to the economy of $50bn, there were signs that the climate agenda is beginning to move into the mainstream debate about competitiveness, growth and employment \u2013 for all the main presidential candidates have tried to avoid addressing the links in public.</p> <p>Climate Week NYC was marked by the <a href=\"http://www.theclimategroup.org/\" title=\"\">Climate Group</a> with a launch of fascinating analysis of the growing interplay between climate, competitiveness, growth and employment. A key part of the message to the candidates, and to government, is that the '<a href=\"http://thecleanrevolution.org/\" title=\"\">clean revolution</a>' draws on strengths that America has historically had in abundance, among them innovation and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>The report concludes that a clean energy revolution is the \"common sense way of enhancing America's energy and national security, while at the same time creating a stronger and more resilient economy.\" It also calls for a \"reinvigorated, bipartisan, public-private partnership of government and corporate leaders in support of low-carbon entrepreneurship.\"</p> <p>For a big slice of America, however, as the presidential campaigns have dramatically illustrated, climate is neither an obvious challenge (with many farmers affected by this year's extreme weather events continuing to deny links with high-carbon economies) nor is it obvious that the sort of electoral result likely later in the year will guarantee a return to bipartisan politics and governance.</p> <p>Whoever the next president may be, America will be haunted by deteriorating competitiveness, stuttering growth and persistent unemployment problems. Which makes it all the stranger that politicians are not falling over themselves to embrace the 'clean revolution'. As the Climate Group notes, breakthroughs in cleantech innovation alone could boost the US economy by $155bn a year by 2030, if the right investments are made today. This could add an additional $3.2tn in cumulative GDP by 2050. And with government incentives, the figure could grow to $244bn a year.</p> <p>But the US is increasingly challenged in cleantech markets, with major economies accelerating their efforts to innovate and expand their low carbon markets. For example, China now applies for more patents than the US.</p> <p>In terms of the economic case for action, America's clean economy sector \u2013 covering business activities ranging from waste recycling to renewable energy \u2013 is worth around $1tn a year. Last year, investment in US renewable energy hit $51bn, up 57% on 2010, making the US the number one destination for such investment. With 2.7 million workers in 2010, the clean economy already employs more people than the fossil fuel industry. And by the end of the decade the global clean energy technology market could be worth $2.2tn, with the potential to create more than one million new jobs in America by 2030.</p> <p>Meanwhile, America's current economy has a massive energy Achilles' Heel. In 2011 the nation spent nearly $1bn every day importing oil, gas and other derivatives that accounted for 45% of annual consumption. Oil imports account for as much as 40% of the US trade deficit, with the annual cost of securing America's oil supply estimated at between $50bn and $140bn. Worse still, the Pentagon warns that climate change is emerging as a key \"threat multiplier,\" with rising sea levels, increased incidence of droughts and floods, and reduction in food production all expected to exacerbate existing security tensions around the world.</p> <p>With America seeing a growing collision between the fossil fuels and clean technology sector, private sector leadership will be key, clearly, with business seen as a critical catalyst for an American clean revolution. To drive the process, the Climate Group argues that clean growth needs to be placed at the heart of energy and economic strategy, and that a clear price needs to be placed on carbon \u2013 with tax reform (lowering personal and/or corporate tax rates) helping ensure revenue neutrality and wider political acceptability.</p> <p>The report supports earlier calls for the annual federal energy R&amp;D budget to be tripled to $16bn a year. It will be fascinating to see how much of all of this makes it into the presidential debates next month. But, however it plays through, Romney is extremely unlikely to champion the clean revolution, whereas Obama is at least minded to do the right thing. With highly partisan politics almost guaranteed well beyond the election, I know where my vote would be headed.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chairman of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

  "<p>This week, as the death toll in Syria's civil war approached 25,000, heads of state gathered at the United Nations in New York to proclaim their \"solemn commitment \u2026 to an international order based on the rule of law.\" The big shindig \u2013 or, in UN speak, the \"<a href=\"http://www.unrol.org/article.aspx?article_id=168\" title=\"\">High Level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and International Levels</a>\" \u2013 was an opportunity to advance human dignity, lay a foundation for economic development, and repair the social contract between peoples and governments which has been tattered across broad swaths of the globe.</p> <p>But in the end, world leaders fell short. After more than a year of planning, all they could muster was another day of talk. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/27/united-nations-rule-of-law\" title=\"\">It did not have to be this way</a>.</p> <p>Back in March, Ban Ki-moon had proposed much more. The UN secretary general courageously declared that states should commit themselves to an ambitious program of action containing detailed recommendations for enhancing international dispute resolution, empowering women and children, strengthening housing and property rights, and protecting victims of war crimes.</p> <p>The secretary general called for clear goals, with benchmarks to measure progress, and an ongoing consultative forum \u2013 with full participation by civil society, the private sector and others \u2013 to check, sustain and bolster states' political will over time.</p> <p>In short, the initial vision for the meeting offered the prospect of genuine, concrete action that might begin to constrain the exercise of arbitrary power. Which may be precisely why it provoked fierce opposition from political leaders determined not to shed an ounce of sovereignty \u2013 whether in the security council or on national territory.</p> <p>Even as the dynamics of global power shift in the first decades of the 21st century, political inequalities and rivalries left a gap too wide to bridge. The lowest common denominator prevailed. There was no consensus on what the rule of law means, let alone how to promote it. The final declaration skirted the issue. Unable to agree on much else, states simply asked the secretary to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 write another report.</p> <p>What a come down.</p> <p>And yet, notwithstanding how far the high level meeting fell from the secretary general's grand aspirations, the final declaration did contain a few positive notes.</p> <p>It helpfully \"recognise[d] the role of the international criminal court\" in ending impunity, called upon states not yet parties to consider ratifying the court's Rome Statute, and \"emphasise[d] the importance of cooperation with the court,\" as well as of fortifying domestic mechanisms for investigating and trying bringing perpetrators of grave crimes. It acknowledged the possibility of \"voluntary pledges\" by individual states \u2013 and more than 140 such promises were registered, albeit with no formal means of monitoring or follow-up. And, perhaps most importantly, the declaration suggested that the rule of law has a role to play in the post-2015 international development agenda.</p> <p>That matters, because the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \u2013 specific targets to which states committed more than a decade ago to do things like halve poverty and achieve universal primary education \u2013 are up for renewal in 2015.</p> <p>This very week, even as the rule of law summit disappointed, the secretary general's high level panel on the post-2015 development agenda \u2014 co-chaired by prime minister David Cameron of the UK, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia \u2014 convenes for the first time. A big question is whether the next generation of MDGs will embrace the values of human rights, equity and political as well as economic freedom \u2013 all of which 189 states subscribed to in the UN Millennium Declaration of 2000.</p> <p>As the debate over the rule of law these past months has revealed, these values are far more sensitive and, to some, more threatening than what often seem the more \"technical\" matters of how many kids go to school, eat properly and enjoy access to health care.</p> <p>And yet, as an accumulating body of evidence makes clear, you can't have one set of public goods without the other. Good governance, human rights, and minority protections are essential preconditions for sustainable development. Health, education and human security will be more widely achieved and shared only when people have the knowledge and tools to hold government and private institutions to account.</p> <p>And, as the tremors of change resonating throughout the Arab world show, the rule of law is both valued, and valuable, in its own right.</p> <p>After the assembled presidents and prime ministers leave New York later this month, the challenge of infusing justice into the next generation of MDGs will be their next major test. Can they summon more foresight for this task than they managed in supporting the rule of law?</p>",
  "<p>Growing fears that Syria's civil war is spilling over into neighbouring countries are driving urgent discussions involving Turkey and Arab states about a tougher, joint response, including possible military intervention. A focal point is this weekend's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/26/us-turkey-akp-idUSBRE88P0I220120926\" title=\"\">Turkish ruling party convention in Ankara</a>, which several Arab leaders are expected to attend. But old grudges, current weakness, and a tendency to say, \"After you, Claude\" when it comes to actual fighting seem likely to continue to undermine effective regional action.</p> <p>Unlike in Libya \u2013 where Nato took the lead after the Arab League disowned Muammar Gaddafi \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and other Arab governments that are demanding Assad's departure have been left to their own devices by the west. Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/obama-un-general-assembly-transcript\" title=\"\">repeated his demand at the UN this week</a> that the Syrian \"dictator\" stand down, but made no new move to achieve it. Hopes that Obama will take a tougher line if he is re-elected in November remain just that: hopes.</p> <p>Paralysing divisions within the UN security council, where Russia and China have repeatedly blocked calls for harsher measures, show no sign of easing. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, spoke of a \"regional calamity with global ramifications\". <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/syria-un-ban-ki-moon_n_1914691.html\" title=\"\">Ban added</a>: \"The international community should not look the other way.\" But despite fine speeches, and reminders of the UN's legal \"responsibility to protect\", this is exactly what is happening.</p> <p>Anger at this sorry state of affairs was voiced recently in Tehran by President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/egypt-iran-non-aligned-movement-summit\" title=\"\">who insisted</a>, to his Iranian hosts' discomfort, that the world had a \"moral duty\" to stop the Syrian slaughter. Speaking this week, Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad al-Thani, went further, proposing a military intervention.</p> <p>\"The security council failed to reach an effective position. In view of this, I think that it is better for the Arab countries themselves to interfere out of their national, humanitarian, political and military duties and do what is necessary to stop the bloodshed in Syria,\" <a href=\"http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/qatar/qatar-calls-for-arab-intervention-in-syria-1.1081149\" title=\"\">Hamad told the UN general assembly</a>. Countries should provide \"all sorts of support\", presumably including arms, to the opposition.</p> <p>Direct military intervention in Syria by Arab countries remains extremely unlikely at present. But indirect, covert means are already being applied, and militarily weak governments continue to push others to act on their behalf. It was reported in July, for example, that Saudi Arabia and Qatar had induced Turkey to set up a secret \"nerve centre\" in Adana to direct military, intelligence, logistics and communications aid to Syrian rebels. This supposed operation may also have tacit CIA support. All the countries mentioned <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/27/us-syria-crisis-centre-idUSBRE86Q0JM20120727\" title=\"\">deny supplying arms</a>.</p> <p>Yet despite evident reluctance to get involved directly, the political temperature is rising as Syria's civil war spreads like an ink stain across a parchment map of the Middle East. Lebanon and Jordan fear political and social destabilisation amid an inexorable refugee tide. Reports from Iraq speak of repeated incursions into its land and air space by Syrian combatants. Syrian mortar shells <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_21631053/syrian-mortars-land-israeli-occupied-golan-heights\" title=\"\">landed in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>Among all the neighbours, it is militarily formidable Turkey that is suffering the most, principally as a result of Assad's decision to offer Syrian bases and backing to Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) fighters in their ongoing separatist struggle in and around south-east Turkey. Damascus's move followed the decision by the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to break ties with Syria, condemn the bloodshed and demand Assad's removal. In <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/lally-weymouth-interviews-turkish-prime-minister-recep-tayyip-erdogan/2012/09/20/a837da66-01c7-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_story.html\" title=\"\">an interview last week</a>, Erdogan said: \"This regime will go. Bashar is politically dead\".</p> <p>The price of such enmity is high. PKK-related violence inside Turkey has now reached a 10-year high and is spreading, according to recent reports. Tuesday saw <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,16262310,00.html\" title=\"\">another attack in which six Turkish soldiers and one civilian were killed</a>. Iran, Syria's ally, is covertly supporting Assad's Kurdish strategy, and this has led in turn to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444813104578018240196360244.html\" title=\"\">new strains in its relations with Ankara</a>.</p> <p>Turkey is being pressed by France to create and defend \"liberated zones\" along its border with Syria, an idea harking back to the Iraq \"safe havens\" of the 1990s and from which the US and Britain have so far distanced themselves. But while Erdogan will not act on the French proposal without UN or at least US and Nato backing, he may well be in the mood to hit back at Assad over his provocative support for the PKK. This weekend, several regional leaders opposed to Assad, including Egypt's Morsi, will attend Erdogan's ruling party bash. Expect ever more urgent plotting on the theme: Get Bashar.</p>",
  "<p>The UK prime minister reaffirmed on Tuesday Britain's pledge to spend 0.7% of gross-national income on aid by 2013. David Cameron's statement, at the UN general assembly in New York, comes despite growing calls from members of his own party to rein in Britain's aid spending.</p> <p>Over the last two weeks, conservative British newspapers, including the Sunday Telegraph and the Daily Mail, have attacked the Department for International Development (DfID) for spending millions of British aid money<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545584/Poverty-barons-who-make-a-fortune-from-taxpayer-funded-aid-budget.html\" title=\"\"> on a group of highly profitable consultancy firms</a>.

Note that DfID, <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/departmental-report/2012/Annual-report-accounts-2011-12.pdf\" title=\"\">which spent \u00a37.6bn on ODA last year </a> isn't the only government department in charge of UK aid. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK Border Agency, for example, also contribute towards the 0.7% target.</p> <p>The UK is the world's third largest donor from countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), following Germany ($14.5bn) and the US ($30.7bn). But as a percentage of gross national income (GNI), British aid spending was 0.56% in 2011 \u2013 far greater than the US equivalent of 0.20%. Only five OECD countries \u2013 Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, and the Netherlands \u2013 have already met the 0.7% commitment.</p> <p>What does this mean for the UK taxpayer? With a population of about 62.6 million, last year's \u00a38.57bn spend works out at roughly \u00a3137 per head.</p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApF51UgS889tdDRIRGg3V2dWNEJoR1dLWVRreVphOUE\" title=\"\">\u2022 Get the data</a></p> <h2>Which countries get UK aid?</h2> <p>Last year, DfID announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/mar/01/uk-cuts-aid-poorest-countries?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">16 countries would no longer receive bilateral aid from Britain by 2016</a>, as a result of the department's spending reviews.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/01/uk-aid-review-cuts-dfid\">biggest announced increase</a> in aid was for Somalia, with a 208% rise planned between 2010 and 2015. This was followed by Nigeria, with an increase of 116%. By 2015, Pakistan would receive the largest chunk of UK aid \u2013 \u00a31.4bn, up 107% from 2010.</p> <p>Billions of aid are also spent through groups such as the World Bank, the EU, and UN agencies. Last year, the UK spent <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/departmental-report/2012/Annual-report-accounts-2011-12.pdf\">\u00a35bn on bilateral aid programmes and \u00a33.5bn on multilateral aid</a>.

One year later, this had already changed dramatically: in 1961, Kenya and India were top recipients. India received the largest chunk of UK aid for most of the 1960s and 1970s.

  "<p>David Cameron has reaffirmed the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19709321\" title=\"\">coalition government's commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on foreign aid</a> and has called on other countries to meet this long-standing UN pledge. But the government is under pressure from its own backbenchers to reduce aid spending, which has been protected from budget cuts.</p> <h2>How much does the UK spend on foreign aid?</h2> <p>The aid budget is set to increase as the government is committed to see Britain meet the UN aid target of 0.7% of GNI spent on aid next year. The commitment means the Department for International Development's (DfID) total aid programme is due to grow in real terms \u2013 taking into account anticipated inflation \u2013 from \u00a37.5bn in 2010-11 to \u00a310.5bn in 2014-15. Total UK aid is larger as it takes into account money from other sources such as the Foreign Office. Figures from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/04/value-oecd-aid-drops-15-years\" title=\"\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) put total UK foreign aid at \u00a38.6bn in 2011</a>. With a population of about 62.6 million, the figure works out to roughly \u00a3137 per head. The <a href=\"http://www.one.org/c/international/actnow/4409/\" title=\"\">advocacy group ONE calculates</a> that a person on an income of \u00a325,000 would pay \u00a35,465 in tax, of which \u00a352 would go to the overseas aid budget.</p> <h2>What is the government's justification for aid?</h2> <p>It's a moral and pragmatic one. The prime minister, who is in New York for the UN general assembly, told world leaders that delivering on the 0.7% pledge was the right thing to do, as well as advancing national interests. \"I would say it is not only a moral obligation that the better-off countries have to tackle poverty in our world when we still have over a billion people living on less than a dollar a day, but it's also in our interests that we build a more prosperous world. If we don't, the problems of conflict, the problems of mass migration, the problems of uncontrollable climate change are problems that will come and visit us at home,\" he said.</p> <p>Justine Greening, Britain's new international development secretary, made the same case when meeting charities earlier this month. She said: \"You only have to look at the business generated by China and India to see the potential they provide for UK companies as their export markets continue to develop.\"</p> <h2>What has UK aid achieved?</h2> <p>DfID will rattle off impressive numbers including vaccinating more than 12 million children against preventable diseases; improving the land and property rights of 1.1 million people; supporting 5.3 million children (2.5 million of them girls) to go to primary school: enabling 11.9 million people to work their way out of poverty by providing access to financial services; preventing 2.7 million children and pregnant women from going hungry: reaching 6 million people with emergency food assistance; supporting freer and fairer elections in five countries and improving hygiene conditions for 7.4 million people. ONE estimates that in the next four years, based on bilateral and multilateral spending plans, the UK will achieve a minimum of the following results: vaccinate more than 80 million children against life-threatening diseases, save at least 1.4 million lives; provide school places for 15.9 million children and help create more than 19 million jobs by fostering economic growth. Save the Children says UK aid has helped to reduce child mortality \u2013 one of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\" title=\"\">millennium development goals</a> \u2013 with the number of deaths of under-fives falling from 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011.</p> <h2>What are the critics saying?</h2> <p>Conservatives such as Mark Reckless say they do not want to scrap aid, just reduce it at a time when all government departments are under the cosh. He argues that DfID's budget should not be protected when, for example, the Ministry of Defence lacks money for aircraft carriers. The Tory press has had a field day running stories on DfID's \"bloated\" budget, its <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545584/Poverty-barons-who-make-a-fortune-from-taxpayer-funded-aid-budget.html\" title=\"\">spending on consultants</a> or UK aid money ending up in middle-income countries in Europe because considerable amounts of <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/blog/?p=9711\" title=\"\">DfID money is channelled through the EU</a>.</p> <p>Questions have been raised by politicians, including most recently Ivan Lewis, the shadow development secretary, on <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?s=ivan+lewis\" title=\"\">why the UK is sending aid to India</a>, a country that has its own space programme, although it also has more people living on less than $1.25 a day than all of Africa.</p> <h2>Why did the coalition government insist on ringfencing the aid budget?</h2> <p>The Liberal Democrats don't have a problem with the 0.7% target, but Cameron's commitment was a departure from previous Tory policy. The change can be seen as part of Cameron's attempt to \"detoxify\" the Tory brand, but the Conservatives do see foreign aid in pragmatic terms. They see aid as part and parcel of foreign policy, and DfID and the Foreign Office have been pushed to <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/What-we-do/Who-we-work-with/UK-government-departments/\" title=\"\">work closely together</a> under this government. In crude terms, the government's attitude to aid is: if it helps development, poor people will have less incentive to come to the UK and other rich countries.</p> <h2>What steps has the government taken to ensure aid is spent properly?</h2> <p>When Andrew Mitchell \u2013 now chief whip with a police problem \u2013 took over at DfID, he insisted on a <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/About-us/How-we-measure-progress/DFID-Business-plan-2011-2015/Value-for-money/\" title=\"\">\"value for money\"</a> approach, hence all the statistics on children vaccinated to show what taxpayers were getting for their money. He introduced a <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/what-we-do/how-uk-aid-is-spent/a-new-direction-for-uk-aid/multilateral-aid-review/\" title=\"\">review of Britain's multilateral aid programmes</a>, which assessed the effectiveness of 43 aid organisations that received UK money, and one on bilateral aid. The move was seen as an attempt to insulate DfID from criticism from disgruntled Tories. In assessing the multilateral aid review, government watchdog the National Audit Office concluded that the review had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/19/uk-aid-programme-better-value-audit\" title=\"\">contributed significantly to improved transparency and in achieving value for money in the government's aid effort</a>.</p> <h2>What about the money for consultants?</h2> <p>This was a story in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545584/Poverty-barons-who-make-a-fortune-from-taxpayer-funded-aid-budget.html\" title=\"\">the Sunday Telegraph, which said DfID paid almost \u00a3500m in 2010-2011 to consultants, mostly British</a>, some of whom earn six or seven-figure incomes and used to work in government. Greening, a former accountant, has launched an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/17/dfid-spending-consultants-scrutiny\" title=\"\">internal review of the department's spending on technical experts</a> and the Independent Commission on Aid Impact (ICAI), the UK aid watchdog, has also announced plans to examine DfID's use of contractors. ICAI was a Mitchell innovation. High pay is a sensitive subject for DfID. Under Mitchell, DfID announced an overhaul of the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the UK's development finance arm, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/05/cdc-appoints-new-chief-executive\" title=\"\">appointing a new chief executive on a salary significantly lower than that of her predecessor</a>, whose generous package caused consternation.</p> <h2>Does aid promote development?</h2> <p>This is a subject of much debate among development experts. Increasingly, there is a view that aid, while it accomplishes laudable goals from a reduction in child and maternal mortality to sending more girls to school, those achievements in themselves do not constitute development. John Hilary, executive director of War on Want, argues that the furore over the aid budget is a distraction from structural issues that matter more for development. He cites trade liberalisation policies that subject firms in poor countries to competition they cannot handle and tax loopholes that allow firms to minimise payments to developing countries. Dani Rodrik, the development economist, makes a similar argument. He says rich countries should <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/after-the-millennium-development-goals-by-dani-rodrik\" title=\"\">pursue a \"do no harm\" approach</a> with policies that include carbon taxes and other measures to ameliorate climate change; more work visas to allow larger temporary migration flows from poor countries; strict controls on arms sales to developing nations; reduced support for repressive regimes; and improved sharing of financial information to reduce money laundering and tax avoidance.</p>",
  "<p>In many of history's most successful economic reforms, clever countries have learned from the policy successes of others, adapting them to local conditions. In the long history of economic development, eighteenth century Britain learned from Holland; early nineteenth-century Prussia learned from Britain and France; mid-nineteenth century Meiji Japan learned from Germany; post-second world war Europe learned from the United States; and Deng Xiaoping's China learned from Japan.</p> <p>Through a process of institutional borrowing and creative adaptation, successful economic institutions and cutting-edge technologies spread around the world, and thereby boost global growth. Today, too, there are some great opportunities for this kind of \"policy arbitrage\", if more countries would only take the time to learn from other countries' successes.</p> <p>For example, while many countries are facing a jobs crisis, one part of the capitalist world is doing just fine: northern Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. Germany's unemployment rate this past summer was around 5.5%, and its youth unemployment rate was around 8% \u2013 remarkably low compared with many other high-income economies.</p> <p>How do northern Europeans do it? All of them use active labour market policies, including flex time, school-to-work apprenticeships (especially Germany), and extensive job training and matching.</p> <p>Likewise, in an age of chronic budget crises, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland run near-balanced budgets. All three rely on budget rules that call for cyclically adjusted budget balance. And all three take a basic precaution to keep their entitlement spending under control: a retirement age of at least 65. This keeps costs much lower than in France, and Greece, for example, where the retirement age is 60 or below, and where pension outlays are soaring as a result.</p> <p>In an age of rising healthcare costs, most high-income countries \u2013 Canada, the European Union's western economies, and Japan \u2013 manage to keep their total healthcare costs below 12% of GDP, with excellent health outcomes, while the US spends nearly 18% of GDP, yet with decidedly mediocre health outcomes. And, America's is the only for-profit health system of the entire bunch. A new report by the US Institute of Medicine has found that America's for-profit system squanders around $750bn (\u00a3464bn), or 5% of GDP, on waste, fraud, duplication, and bureaucracy.</p> <p>In an age of soaring oil costs, a few countries have made a real difference in energy efficiency. The OECD countries, on average, use 160kg of oil-equivalent energy for every $1,000 of GDP (measured at purchasing power parity). But, in energy-efficient Switzerland, energy use is just 100kg per $1,000 of GDP, and in Demark it is just 110kg, compared with 190 kg in the US.</p> <p>In an age of climate change, several countries are demonstrating how to move to a low-carbon economy. On average, the rich countries emit 2.3kg of CO2 for every kg of oil-equivalent unit of energy. But France emits just 1.4kg, owing to its success in deploying safe, low-cost nuclear energy.</p> <p>Sweden, with its hydropower, is even lower, at 0.9kg. And, while Germany is abandoning domestic production of nuclear energy for political reasons, we can bet that it will nonetheless continue to import electricity from France's nuclear plants.</p> <p>In an age of intense technological competition, countries that combine public and private research and development (R&amp;D) financing are outpacing the rest. The US continues to excel, with huge recent breakthroughs in Mars exploration and genomics, though it is now imperiling that excellence through budget cuts. Meanwhile, Sweden and South Korea are now excelling economically on the basis of R&amp;D spending of around 3.5% of GDP, while Israel's R&amp;D outlays stand at a remarkable 4.7% of GDP.</p> <p>In an age of rising inequality, at least some countries have narrowed their wealth and income gaps. Brazil is the recent pacesetter, markedly expanding public education and systematically attacking remaining pockets of poverty through targeted transfer programmes. As a result, income inequality in Brazil is declining.</p> <p>And, in an age of pervasive anxiety, Bhutan is asking deep questions about the meaning and nature of happiness itself. In search of a more balanced society that combines economic prosperity, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability, Bhutan famously pursues Gross National Happiness rather than Gross National Product. Many other countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom \u2013 are now following Bhutan's lead in surveying their citizenry about life satisfaction.</p> <p>The countries highest on the ladder of life satisfaction are Denmark, Finland, and Norway. Yet there is hope for those at lower latitudes as well. Tropical Costa Rica also ranks near the top of the happiness league. What we can say is that all of the happiest countries emphasise equality, solidarity, democratic accountability, environmental sustainability, and strong public institutions.</p> <p>So here is one model economy: German labour-market policies, Swedish pensions, French low-carbon energy, Canadian healthcare, Swiss energy efficiency, American scientific curiosity, Brazilian anti-poverty programmes, and Costa Rican tropical happiness.</p> <p>Of course, back in the real world, most countries will not achieve such bliss anytime soon. But, by opening our eyes to policy successes abroad, we would surely speed the path to national improvement in countries around the world.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg has fired the starting gun on the 2015 general election by announcing that the former party leader Lord Ashdown will be put in charge of the Liberal Democrat campaign team.</p> <p>The Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister used his keynote speech at the close of the annual party conference in Brighton to make clear his intention to lead the party into the general election as he spelled out the party's priorities for the duration of the coalition term and beyond.</p> <p>He announced the decision to sign up Ashdown in a move that will be seen as seeking to quell rumblings about his own future at the helm amid polling suggesting party fortunes would improve under Vince Cable.</p> <p>Issuing a warning to his coalition partners, Clegg made clear there would be \"no question\" of reducing the 45p top rate of tax further and put David Cameron on notice that he should hold \"short-sighted\" Conservatives to their promises on the environment.</p> <p>In a speech otherwise light on policy announcements, Clegg also announced \u00a350m in catch-up classes to help children who have underperformed in English and maths at Key Stage 2.</p> <p>Drawing on the spirit shown by Team GB during the Olympic Games, Clegg sought to rally the party's grassroots by saying the participants had shown that for most people \"success doesn't come easy or quick\" and required effort, perseverance and resilience.</p> <p>\"These are the qualities that will see our country through these tough times. And these are the qualities that will guide our party through tough times, too. So let us take our example from the British people as together we embark on the journey ahead. Our party: from the comforts of opposition to the hard realities of government. Our country: from the sacrifices of austerity to the rewards of shared prosperity. Two journeys linked; the success of each depending on the success of the other. Neither will be easy and neither will be quick, but it will be worth it. And be in no doubt. If we secure our country's future, we will secure our own.\"</p> <p>Hailing a series of successes in securing Lib-Dem-inspired policies, Clegg said those party members who, faced by \"several years more of spending restraint\" would rather \"turn back than press on\", needed to recognise that the Lib Dems were no longer the party of protest for disaffected voters and their only meaningful future was as the \"third party of government\".</p> <p>Unveiling the decision to co-opt Ashdown to spearhead the next general election campaign, Clegg said activists would have a strong message to give to voters thanks to the policies pushed through by the party in power, such as the pupil premium and the raising of the personal tax allowance.</p> <p>\"Because the truth is, only the Liberal Democrats can be trusted on the economy and relied upon to deliver a fairer society too. And to help get that message out there, I can announce today that Paddy Ashdown has agreed to front up our campaign as chair of the 2015 general election team. I must admit, I'm not quite sure I'm ready for all those urgent emails and 5am phone calls. But I can't think of anyone I'd rather have by my side. Paddy, it's great to have you back.\"</p> <p>He braced his party for more tough times ahead as he set out the \"inescapable\" need for further belt-tightening beyond 2015. But he laid down the party's priorities as he reiterated his determination to ensure the rich shoulder the burden of an additional \u00a316bn of public spending cuts expected in 2015-16. \"Our position is clear. If we have to ask people to take less out or pay more in, we'll start with the richest and work our way down, not the other way around,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We won't waver in our determination to deal with our debts. But we will do it in our own way, according to our own plans, based on our own values.\"</p> <p>He singled out the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, for particular criticism as he launched a staunch defence of the coalition's economic \"Plan A\", insisting it was \"tough enough yet flexible\" and would allow more \"bold steps\".</p> <p>He defended the latest budget, despite the outcry over the decision to cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, because of the key Lib Dem policies implemented as a result, including increasing the tax-free allowance. But he made clear the cut in the top rate of tax already introduced was as far as he was prepared to go.</p> <p>\"Let me make one thing clear: now that we have brought the top rate of tax down to 45p \u2013 a level, let's not forget, that is still higher than throughout Labour's 13 years in office \u2013 there can be no question of reducing it further in this parliament,\" he said. \"All future cuts in personal taxation must pass one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by and get on? It's as simple as that.\"</p> <p>Clegg also made clear that the environment would be a core priority for the party to help \"power our economy\".</p> <p>Dismissing the Conservatives' \"short-sighted arguments\" that the choice was between \"going green and going for growth\", he said: \"Going green means going forward.\"</p> <p>\"So let the Conservatives be in no doubt. We will hold them to their promises on the environment. Of course, there was a time when it looked like they got it. It seems a long time ago now. When the Tories were going through their naturalist phase. The windmills gently turning; the sun shining in. As a PR exercise, it was actually quite brilliant. Until, at last year's party conference, they went and ruined it all, admitting that you can't in fact \"vote blue and go green\". Well of course you can't.

  "<p>This week, GOP vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan topped off a critique of President Obama's response to violent demonstrations at American embassies across the Middle East by saying that because of the president's policies, the Middle East \"looked like 1979 Tehran\" \u2013 when demonstrations by Iranian student revolutionaries culminated in the invasion of the US embassy and the taking of 50 hostages in a stand-off that would endure 444 days. It has become all too easy for opponents of Ryan and his boss, Governor Mitt Romney, to level zingers at their foreign policy bloopers, and I had mine all ready: all this does is remind us that Ryan, who was born in 1970 and has no national security experience other than, as he has said, \"voting to send our troops to war\", has no idea what happened in Teheran in 1979.</p> <p>But dismissing this soundbite misses the chance to consider two serious assertions that underlie it: first, that what we are seeing in the Middle East right now is a collapse of American policy and interests on a par with how the fall of the Shah and his eventual replacement by a hostile theocracy, the hostage-taking, and the failed rescue effort damaged the US in 1979-80. And second, that it is 1980, \"morning in America\" again, and Mitt Romney is Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama is Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>Take the defeat-and-collapse theory of world affairs first. Romney sounded this call while protesters were still massed in Cairo, Tunis and Khartoum, worrying that violence demonstrated that the Arab Spring would turn into an \"Arab Winter\". <a href=\"http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/18/a_tale_of_two_narratives\">Tom Mahnken of Foreign Policy's conservative blog Shadow Government writes</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Regardless of its origins, the ongoing violence is stark testimony to the failure of the outreach to the Muslim world that lay at the heart of Obama's Middle East policy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/09/24/paul-ryan-turn-on-the-tv-and-it-reminds-you-of-1979-tehran/\">Now comes Paul Ryan equating</a> \"burning our flag in capitals all around the world\" with 1979 in Tehran. A note I can't resist here: I am just two years older than Ryan. In 1979, my middle-school social studies teacher in South Burlington, VT, decided it was important we learn about what was going on in Iran, even if we hadn't the slightest idea why it was happening, or what it had to do with us. So I can still rattle off names like Shahpour Bakhtiar, briefly prime minister between the Shah's overthrow and the ayatollahs' ascension. I'd be delighted to learn that Ryan has similar memories.</p> <p>But for those of you who stuck with the regular curriculum, or were still watching Sesame Street, let's compare and contrast then and now:</p> <p><strong>1979:</strong> A key US regional ally, held in place with US military and economic support, is overthrown, leaving an enormous hole in US Middle East policy.</p> <p><strong>2012:</strong> No governments are overthrown; several governments restate their commitment to improved ties with the US.</p> <p><strong>1979:</strong> A specific US decision \u2013 admitting the deposed Shah for medical treatment \u2013 enrages Iranians across the political spectrum.</p> <p><strong>2012:</strong> A noxious video clip with no connection to the US government enrages Muslims, generating small demonstrations a fraction of the size of those in recent years.</p> <p><strong>1979:</strong> An interim government that is angry at US policies but seeking democracy and broad ties with the world is overthrown by radicals, empowered among other forces by anti-Americanism.</p> <p><strong>2012:</strong> Demonstrations bring out radical forces that seek to challenge governments in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Pakistan. No governments fall. In fact, in one Libyan city, residents band together and drive a radical group out of its headquarters.</p> <p><strong>1979:</strong> The loss of a key US ally, the exposure of the extent of the Shah's violation of his citizens' rights, and perceived US weakness in the hostage-taking and subsequent rescue attempt \u2013 plus the installation of an inward-looking, radical government sustained by anti-Americanism \u2013 has consequences that linger to this day.</p> <p><strong>2012:</strong> <a href=\"http://lynch.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/17/the_embassy_protests_and_the_arab_uprising\">Analyst Marc Lynch writes:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"The end of this crisis matters more than the beginning \u2026 America navigating this turbulent environment will depend in part on bipartisan consensus about the importance of promoting democratic reform in the Arab world. The Obama administration has maintained its poise through a difficult week, despite the crisis abroad and the partisan polemics at home.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As in 1979, Americans must learn all over again that we do not control the pace or direction of events in the Middle East. But unlike the downward spiral of 1979, we have not lost all capacity to influence \u2013 and the governments of the region, despite considerable public anger, have not lost interest in working with us.</p> <p>Why would Romney and Ryan, who say again and again that they want more US engagement for economic and political freedom in the Middle East, dabble in a narrative that says all is lost there?</p> <p>This brings us to the second dynamic underlying Ryan's apparently casual comment. Since the summer, Romney's campaign and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/13/1980_watch_its_obama_is_carter_day_for_right_wing_press/\">its cheerleaders</a> have tried to fit this election into a Carter-Reagan narrative. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/03/us-usa-campaign-idUSBRE83Q1DF20120503\">Romney has called Obama</a> \"the most anti-small business president I've seen probably since Carter\". <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/romney-obama-worse-than-jimmy-carter/\">Killing Osama bin Laden</a>? \"Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order.\" Romney's struggle to gain a lead in the polls? <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/08/09/what-really-happened-in-the-1980-presidential-campaign/\">Like Reagan</a>. (<a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/08/09/what-really-happened-in-the-1980-presidential-campaign/\">Or not</a>.)</p> <p>Political scientists note that US elections are more polarized now than they were then, and that Carter at the time was a more beloved figure, even among those who did not vote for him, then either Obama or Romney is now. And it hardly needs saying that Reagan's charm and political skills are lacking this cycle. So the good news, surprisingly, comes from the Middle East: it's not 1979. Or 2006, when the Bush administration faced widespread and ugly protests, put down by our undemocratic allies, over Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed \u2013 and a Palestinian election that didn't produce the results they'd hoped for.</p> <p>Arguably, there is no moment like this in Middle Eastern history. If it's too much to hope that such a realization, which clearly animated the life of Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues, transcends American politics, at least we might expect that our parties would compete to see who can get it right \u2013 rather than pre-emptively declare that it has all gone wrong.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg taunted the Conservative party for abandoning their environmental ambitions in his leader's speech to the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/conference.aspx\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrat party conference</a> on Wednesday as he sought to use green issues to draw a clear line between the two parties.</p> <p>\"Let the Conservatives be in no doubt,\" Clegg told his party in Brighton. \"We will hold them to their promises on the environment.\" He described the \"vote blue, go green\" slogan used by David Cameron in opposition as a \"brilliant PR exercise\".

He warned it was endangering billions in green investment, as well as the whole government growth strategy. \"I just don't think the British economy can any more afford to have a blue roadblock to green growth,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>The attack was renewed on Sunday by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs\" title=\"\">Ed Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, who told the Observer</a> that tens of billions of pounds of investment in low-carbon, job-creating energy infrastructure projects that are \"ready to go\" could be lost to Britain because of an anti-green movement sweeping through the Tory party. Davey referred to a \"rightwing Tea Party tendency\" while Alexander dubbed opponents of a green economy as \"Luddite\" climate change deniers.</p>",
  "<p>Hmm, I think that's summer officially over with, then (I'm gazing out over a very grey Colchester skyline). I bit the bullet and lit my fire last night, too, and we've just had to shut all the office windows as it's blowing an absolute hoolie outside.<br> Never mind. Veg, thankfully, are much hardier than us. So while it may seem as if it's time to shut up shop on the edible garden, there are some easy ways to extend the growing season and ensure fresh pickings well into winter. Of course, I should start out by saying that we've got stalwart winter crops like robust, crinkly kales and savoys and steel-like leeks as the backbone of the cold-season garden. But there are ways to partner these old favourites with less likely candidates if you apply a bit of savvy \u2013 here's how: <strong>Cloches</strong><br>These are cheap, simple and invaluable \u2013 I use loads of them on my plot in autumn and winter. Mine are fashioned out of rigid wire mesh tunnels draped in a double layer of thick horticultural fleece (weigh this down with large stones or bricks) and are ideal for long rows of veg (you can buy them, too, if bending wire and folding fleece isn't your thing). Polythene isn't as insulating and it also doesn't allow for good air flow, so avoid it if you can. Laid over rows of summer-sown carrots, baby turnips, beetroot, kohl rabi, swede, celeriac, winter-hardy salad leaves and Swiss chard, it will encourage growth to tick along at the slowest of paces. As a consequence, your veg will remain small, tender and perfectly fresh. A midwinter layer of insulating snow over the top isn't a bad thing if your tunnel supports are up to it. Slug and snail damage will be minimal, as temperatures are too cold for their activity. <strong>Greenhouses</strong><br>If you have one of these, you're a lucky so and so, because it opens up the window to extensive winter growing. OK, so the cost of fuel may be prohibitive and you'll need to weigh up the economics of the situation. Electric \"fuel\" is preferable, as no fumes or water vapours are given off. The hotter you can heat your house, the more varied the crops you can grow. This could be excellent for ripening up the last few tomatoes and peppers, or any potted tender crops. No heating needn't be an issue, though, as you're essentially left with one huge cloche. Line this with bubble plastic and you'll have the ideal winter salad growing environment. Think rocket, mizuna, mustard, leaf radish, beetroot (leaves), chard, chicory, endive, hardy lettuce, turnip tops, land cress, par cel, radicchio \u2013 germinate in trays indoors to get them going, then move them to your greenhouse. Position them in the middle of the house and off the floor to access the warmest parts. <strong>Storing in the ground</strong><br>Just a quick note on this \u2013 most of us are familiar with the recommendation to leave parsnips in the soil, because a frost transforms some of the starches into sweeter substances. It also stops roots withering. Thin-skinned parsnips, celeriac and Jerusalem artichokes are better left in the soil until you want to eat them, as they risk drying out if lifted. \"Clamps\" are an old-fashioned way around this, because if your ground is frozen solid then you can't easily lift the crops. A modern-day clamp could be a box of damp sand in your shed or garage (line the base and sides with fine chicken wire to obstruct hungry rodents). Use it for the above crops, and larger beetroot, turnips and swedes. <strong>Freezing</strong><br>Of course you can always rely on your freezer to preserve your veg for winter. Calabrese, peas, spinach, runner beans \u2013 all these and more summer surpluses can be frozen. Two key points: get the veg to freezing point as quickly as possible (this results in smaller ice crystals and thereby preserves the texture) and blanch larger vegetables first to conserve their vibrant colour. There's loads on information on this on the internet, so check for specific blanching times for your particular crop.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lucy Halsall is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.growfruitandveg.co.uk/magazine/\">Grow Your Own magazine</a>, which contains a wealth of information about growing your own vegetables.

  "<p>The starting point for the process formerly known as 'knowledge transfer' imagines some white coated scientist or engineer beavering away in a lab before stumbling on something that might actually be useful to the wider world. This stereotype hinges on the idea of the 'spin-out company', which takes intellectual property developed through academic research, then puts it through a university-supported business development process, often in an incubator-like environment.</p> <p>The creative and cultural industries don't have a place in this process. The economy of creativity is based on hunches, gambles, talent and risk: on the idea that we don't always know which of our projects will become hits; on the knowledge that collaborating with our audiences and users is a central part of our operation. The dynamics of the creative economy are characterised by an excess of diversity and a superabundance of dreams of stardom. So how do we marry the usefulness of academic research with the productive idealism of the culture sector?</p> <p>Research and Enterprise for Arts and Creative Technologies (<a href=\"http://www.watershed.co.uk/ished/projects/react-hub/\" title=\"\">REACT</a>) is our remedy for the absence of the arts in the spin-out landscape. Up and running since February this year we are aiming to create a step change in the impact of arts and humanities research in the creative economy. A partnership led by the <a href=\"http://www.uwe.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">University of the West of England</a> with our long time collaborators <a href=\"http://www.watershed.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Watershed Arts Centre</a>, our team is made up of the Universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter. The change we're aiming for emerges through the twin pressures of technology and competition.</p> <p>In an age of pervasive media, the culture-consuming audience is not in the theatre or the sitting room. They are out there in the world, moving in and out of buildings, following a route, making journeys, their senses open to a wide range of stimuli competing for attention. To create a meaningful experience, the producer must design work that can respond to that shifting context \u2013 work that is defined by people's actions.</p> <p>Working to produce creative goods or services in today's world requires deep interdisciplinarity, combining our existing skills in set design, journalism or 3D modeling with engineering, software skills, product design, performance and music. Being productive here requires agility, iteration and a commitment to making and doing alongside thinking and analysing. The challenge is to produce creative researchers who can challenge, mash up, disrupt, invent and re-imagine rather than reproduce 20th century craft divisions.</p> <p>REACT is a culture change project. At the end of four years I hope that academics who are planning a research project will not only think of publishing in a peer reviewed journal but might also pick up the phone to a creative producer and talk about making a film, TV programme, app, installation or immersive experience. I hope that creative SMEs will come to know university researchers they can contact when planning their work too.</p> <p>Our primary method for delivering these goals is the 'sandbox' process developed by iShed, the innovation arm of Watershed at the <a href=\"http://www.pmstudio.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pervasive Media Studio</a>. Each sandbox produces prototypes created by interdisciplinary collaborations. As the name implies, sandbox is a space for mixed encounters: a safe ecosystem where researchers and developers can create new ways of taking advantage of emergent digital potentials.</p> <p>The whole process is managed not by academics and researchers, but by creative media producers who look after the projects: producers broker new relationships, suggest and source relevant creative or technological inputs and run a series of community days where all the projects meet together to share work in progress.</p> <p>Participants are required to post weekly blog updates as a condition of funding and are offered advice on PR, IP and business development as well as being given a mentor from the creative economy or innovation sectors. Each sandbox has a theme so that learning across projects can be maximised.</p> <p>Our first six projects were asked to address the heritage industries. It's been about developing a 21st century platform for haunting \u2013 for making the world of the present resonate with the content of the past. We have been developing media and performance experiences for cemetery visitors, making apps that show the history of cinema in Bristol and putting the people's memories of <a href=\"http://www.bristololdvic.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Bristol Old Vic</a> back into the theatre using new indoor positioning systems and smartphone recording technology. We have been tweeting the dead with Exeter archaeologists in York, and recreating Victorian pleasure gardens with a GPS controlled Georgian listening device.</p> <p>These technological applications offer new experiences for the heritage visitor, bringing the past back to life in startling ways.

  "<p>With $2bn a year to spend on research and development, it would be odd if Procter &amp; Gamble's CEO Bob McDonald was anything other than a firm believer that innovation can be a driving force to solving the world's sustainability challenges.</p> <p>Despite recognising that environmental problems are worsening, the head of the world's largest consumer products company is convinced that it is possible to solve the riddle of how to decouple continued economic growth from issues such as resource use.</p> <p>\"When you are an $84bn company, with over $2bn of R&amp;D and nearly half a billion of dollars in consumer research budget, you get tremendous capability that you can make a difference and that is what we are trying to do,\" says McDonald, 59, who presides over a global empire that embraces brands ranging from Gillette and Pampers to Ariel and Duracell. \"Our R&amp;D budget is more than 60% bigger than our nearest competitor and more than most of our competitors combined; we expect it to deliver.\"</p> <p>Big as it is, McDonald recognises that P&amp;G cannot solve the world's problems on its own and is increasingly collaborating with other companies through the <a href=\"http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/\" title=\"\">Consumer Goods Forum</a>. He gives the example of the PET Technology Collaborative, in which P&amp;G is working with companies such as Coke, Ford, Heinz and Nike to develop plastics made from plant-based materials.</p> <p>While some business leaders privately express pessimism about scaling up solutions before environmental disaster strikes, McDonald describes himself as \"jazzed up. I am excited, I am encouraged.\"</p> <p>He supports the views of Matt Ridley, who in his book '<a href=\"http://www.rationaloptimist.com/\" title=\"\">The Rational Optimist</a>,' regales against doomsayers and suggests that however much things improve from the way they were before, people still cling to the belief that the future will be nothing but disastrous.</p> <p>In particular, McDonald points to Ridley's example of the fear of many English people in the 1800s that they would be swamped by manure because of the exponential rise in the demand for horses, only to see their concerns disappear with the invention of the automobile.</p> <h2>Crowdsourcing and social media </h2> <p>The thirst for innovation led P&amp;G to become one of the first companies to recognise the power of the open web for crowdsourcing new ideas. While the multinational has thousands of its own product development staff, its <a href=\"http://www.pg.com/connect_develop/index.shtml\" title=\"\">Connect &amp; Develop</a> programme aims to develop half of new products and service ideas from partnerships with companies, individual inventors, and in some cases, even competitors.</p> <p>P&amp;G also has a partnership with <a href=\"http://www.innocentive.com/\" title=\"\">Innocentive</a>, a company that employs over 90,000 scientists who work to solve open challenges posted by companies.</p> <p>McDonald is a firm believer in the power of social media to connect diverse groups of people around the world to leverage change.</p> <p>Only last weekend he was at the Clinton Global Initiative, announcing a partnership with legendary R&amp;B singer-songwriter Smokey Robinson, who is aggregating celebrity social media feeds into a global 'Smoke Alarm' to raise funds for P&amp;G's water purification programme.</p> <p>McDonald is particularly proud of this project, which has already saved an estimated 26,000 lives, but is frustrated that the media tends to ignore the good things the company is doing.</p> <p>\"When I made the commitment on safe drinking water and that we would save one life every hour by 2020, the media did not pick up on that,\" he says. \"Why didn't the Guardian pick up on the fact that the average woman in developing countries has to walk about six kilometres a day to get safe drinking water and we have a product that solves that and that we are working with over 100 aid agencies around the world and so far have cleaned 5bn litres?\"</p> <h2>Is the P&amp;G CEO being vocal enough?</h2> <p>When sustainability professionals are asked which business leader they most admire, the name that most often trips off their tongue is Paul Polman, CEO of rival Unilever and a former P&amp;G executive, who is particularly vocal about the need to challenge the status quo and famously halted quarterly earnings briefings to counter City short-termism.</p> <p>Does McDonald feel the need to be more public in promoting sustainability? \"We have made some very bold goals and we are out there, taking responsibility and working with other competitors to get this done,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I am in the public arena. Is everybody doing enough? We should all try to do more.\"</p> <p>For McDonald, doing more means accelerating progress towards realising the conglomerate's ambitious sustainability vision which he believes will allow it to grow responsibly. This includes using 100% renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging, powering its plants with 100% renewable energy and having zero consumer or manufacturing waste go to landfill.</p> <p>McDonald, who has spent three decades working his way up the corporate ladder at P&amp;G, certainly takes a more diplomatic approach than Polman.</p> <p>It may be that Polman has more room to manoeuvre, given that his approach to sustainability has come at the same time as a good run of profit figures.</p> <p>If, like McDonald, he had been forced to make two profits warnings this year, then he too may also be forced to turn down the volume. McDonald also has activist investor <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/williamackman\" title=\"\">William Ackman</a>, who has been busily building a stake in P&amp;G, sitting on his shoulder.</p> <p>Unlike Polman, McDonald does not criticise short-termism in the financial markets, suggesting there is a growing understanding of environmental and social concerns.</p> <p>When asked if investors are failing to embed sustainability programmes, that protect the long term future of companies, into their valuations, McDonald replies: \"I don't see that.\"</p> <p>He points to a meeting with a major investor in London just the other week that focussed on \"whether the company is doing the right thing.\" He also says that P&amp;G's case is helped by being able to show how billions of dollars have been saved as a result of greater efficiency in the use of materials, energy and water. McDonald points to the fact that over the past decade, the company has reduced energy in its plants by 52%, carbon emissions by 53% and water usage by 60%.</p> <p>McDonald is also careful not to criticise politicians for their lack of action in addressing major concerns such as climate change. While the Rio+20 sustainable development conference was criticised by many for failing to come up with a vigorous agenda for change, McDonald says it did provide a framework for action, including the plan to create a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs).</p> <p>He will not be drawn on the stalemate in American politics over key environmental issues, pointing to the advantages of the US becoming energy independent through cheaper and cleaner gas and saying that he is \"an optimist but also a realist. Companies like ours do not have the barriers that some governments have in trying to do the right thing. I cannot say I get disappointed with governments but have to work hard with them.</p> <p>\"I was recently with Shimon Peres in Israel and he said to me it is very difficult for governments to govern countries any more and he felt, and I agreed with him, that companies have a responsibility to not only deliver shareholder returns but to make this world a better place.\"</p> <h2>The power of purpose and values </h2> <p>The key strength that McDonald believes P&amp;G has, which is missing in other corporations, is a clear statement of purpose aligned to the fact that it only promotes managers from within, which means that there is a clear sense of values that runs from the bottom to the very top of the company.</p> <p>McDonald points out that since its inception 175 years ago, the multinational has always been based around the idea of \"touching and improving lives and if you are going to do that, you are going to have to take care of the environment and the population of the world you are trying to improve the lives of.\"</p> <p>He says this is not just about corporate values but also about what has motivated him throughout his life: \"When I was young, I was a member of the boy scouts as I liked doing good deeds for others, and then I decided I wanted to go to the US military camp at West Point because there were people living in societies that were not free and I thought I could help them by being an officer in the army.</p> <p>\"I joined P&amp;G because of its purpose of improving peoples' lives and now I am the CEO of the company, I see this enormous responsibility. I have to use the resources of the company in the right way to deliver shareholder returns while at the same time making the world a better place.</p> <p>\"I have spent 32 years with this company. Our senior leadership has been here for between 25 to 30 years. It is a very different from other companies. We are recognised as one of the best companies in the world for developing leaders.\"</p> <p>He suggests this reputation is one of the reasons why more than one million people applied last year for fewer than 5000 jobs.</p> <h2>The challenge of changing consumer behaviour</h2> <p>Along with other consumer goods companies, P&amp;G is discovering that changing the behaviour of its customers is one of the hardest nuts to crack.</p> <p>When in charge of P&amp;G's Canadian operations, McDonald discovered first hand that consumers will say one thing in a focus group and then behave completely differently in real life.</p> <p>On the basis of customer research, he introduced refillable pouches across the laundry product range only to find out they were shunned on the shelves and the company lost money.</p> <p>In fact, P&amp;G's research suggests only around 15% of people are prepared to make any trade-off to get products that are focussed on sustainability.</p> <p>One answer has been to offer products that perform better and have sustainability embedded into their design. Another is to get the buy-in of respected third parties, such as P&amp;G's partnership with WWF to encourage people to wash in cold water.</p> <p>But even convincing people to turn the temperature down is proving difficult. The company's 'Turn to 30' consumer education campaign in the US did help lift the number of people using cold washes from 2% to 40% but that this remains stubbornly below the company's target of 70% worldwide.</p> <p>Success here is important, with McDonald pointing out that hot water washes not only account for its biggest single environmental impact, but that if every person in the US were to wash in cold water, it would have a significant impact on the country's Kyoto protocol contribution.</p> <h2>Customer insights </h2> <p>But surely P&amp;G should be doing more to educate the public, given that it is the world's largest advertiser?</p> <p>\"The issue is not the size of the advertising budget,\" says McDonald \"but the insights. What is the insight to get them to change their behaviour.</p> <p>\"We need to help them see how it impacts them personally. When you read about an earthquake in India, it has a different impact than if you are with someone who wants to cut off the tip of your little finger. If it impacts you directly, then it is relevant. So we have to find ways of having better products that perform well and help the environment, at the same time.\"</p> <p>He does recognise, however, that it is likely to take more bad news on the environmental front for people to realise they need to be more conscious of their actions: \"People are not going to be silly, and as their lives will be affected, we will see a quicker adoption,\" he predicts.</p> <h2>Can P&amp;G grow in a responsible way?</h2> <p>Increasingly coming into the mainstream debate is whether the planet can cope with continued economic growth, especially given the expanding global population and the burgeoning middle class in countries such as China and India, many of whom are clamouring to copy western lifestyles.</p> <p>Isn't P&amp;G part of the problem rather than the solution by seeking to rapidly expand into developing markets as austerity blocks expansion in developed markets? It already sells products to 4.5 billion people and is seeking to extend that to more than five billion.</p> <p>McDonald recognises the problem and says it is actively being discussed but believes that it is possible to grow within planetary boundaries.</p> <p>\"I was in China recently meeting the leadership \u2014 I am chairman of the US China Business Council \u2014 and one of the discussions I had with the deputy premier was how can China continue to develop but also take care of the environment at the same time,\" he says.</p> <p>\"If you talk to a man in India shaving in the morning before work, or a woman in China washing her hair, they would argue with you on whether these products are necessary, because they would argue they are.</p> <p>\"The answer is to design those products to deliver the benefits while taking care of the environment.\"</p> <p>As for the future, McDonald is clear on what needs to change but perhaps more importantly, what needs to stay the same.</p> <p>\"Keep the compass the same, keep the values the same but be prepared to change everything else to grow,\" he says. \"That focus on the purpose and the values are fundamental to the success of all the greatest companies in the world.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Around 20 years ago I took a submarine dive in the Sea of Japan. As we descended into the darkness to a depth of almost 5,500m (18,000ft) \u2013 more than two-thirds the height of Mt Everest \u2013 I sat on the edge of my seat, anticipating what we might see once we arrived at the ocean floor.</p> <p>I imagined seeing species new to science and unique underwater structures. After all, this was a place that had not seen the light of day for 3.5bn years. But nothing prepared me for what actually saw \u2013 rubbish, everywhere. I was shocked and depressed. How could we have let this happen?</p> <p>We now know that oceans provide a multitude of benefits to humans, including essential nutrition, climate regulation, oxygen generation and the provision of livelihoods. We also know that oceans are not an inexhaustible resource and that they are at significant risk from multiple threats. More than 40% are now heavily impacted by human activities: overfishing, coastal habitat loss, pollution. And the effects can last for decades, if not indefinitely.</p> <p>But how sick are they? What is the right measure of ocean health? If a doctor is going to treat a patient successfully, he or she needs to have a clear picture of what is wrong first, otherwise the treatment might be wrong and make things worse. The problem is that, to date, we haven't been very good at agreeing on a common measure of ocean health.</p> <p>It's a problem that has persisted. A multitude of metrics are used to divine the wellbeing of our seas, but they all fail to make the distinction that economics and people are also a vital part of this ecosystem, especially as oceans and coastlines provide shelter to 40% of the global population, help to support 350m jobs and contribute to more than $3 trillion to the world's material wealth each year.</p> <p>So we decided to do something about this. Three years ago, having convened a group of 65 scientific experts from a range of disciplines and all regions of the world, we set about creating the <a href=\"http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/\" title=\"\">Ocean Health Index</a> as a way to assess oceans on the way they're able to support all walks of life.</p> <p>The set of goals we developed to measure this hopefully reflects the universality of our approach. Food provision, carbon storage, clean waters, tourism and recreation, and natural products all get counted, as does an ocean's sense of place and other categories.</p> <p>By awarding countries scores of up to 100 based upon how well they do, we hope that we will tap into the ancient human dynamic of competition \u2013 encouraging improvement and rewarding those that do well, as well as provide policymakers, community leaders and businesses with the objective data they need to bring our oceans back from the brink. We also hope the index offers reassurance that there is more than one way to take oceans off the critical list.</p> <p>One-size-fits-all prescriptions do not work. If we are to have any serious chance of catalysing change, we need to enable countries to mix long-term, sustainable policies in a way that works best for them politically, culturally and financially. If we can do this, we can make our oceans well again. But the time to act is now, and we need all hands on deck.</p> <p>\u2022 Greg Stone is Conservation International's chief scientist for oceans and vice-chair of the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/content/global-agenda-council-oceans-2012-0\" title=\"\">World Economic Forum's global agenda councils on oceans</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine a world, 18 years from now, in which every single household on the planet is connected to a reliable energy supply that comes from a sustainable source.</p> <p>It is a fiercely ambitious goal, but a feasible one \u2013 according to the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon. Universal energy access is just one of the aims of his <a href=\"http://www.sustainableenergyforall.org\" title=\"\">Sustainable Energy for All initiative</a>, which got a big push at a recent meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly.</p> <p>\"Sustainable energy for all is the answer to some of the key challenges of our time \u2013 poverty, inequality, economic growth, and environmental risks,\" Ban told UN delegates on Monday, adding that promoting sustainable energy can \"help us avoid the catastrophe of climate change\".</p> <p>Boosting economic growth in the developing world would seem to be a key focus of the sustainable energy campaign, given that a stable electricity supply \u2013 which many poor countries lack \u2013 is fundamental to a strong private sector.</p> <p>\"We have data from the World Bank indicating that in Africa, 2-3% of GDP is wiped out every year because of an unreliable energy supply or lack of energy supply,\" said <a href=\"http://www.unido.org/index.php?id=1000109\" title=\"\">Kandeh Yumkella</a>, head of the UN industrial development organisation and the newly appointed UN special representative for sustainable energy for all.</p> <p>\"In Mali and Burkina Faso, electricity costs between 30 and 50 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with four or seven cents elsewhere,\" he said. \"At those kinds of prices, they cannot be competitive, they cannot create jobs, they will not be profitable.\"</p> <p>UN officials say the campaign aims to pump between $40bn and $50bn a year into sustainable energy, up from the current figure of roughly $9bn. But governments are reluctant to put up that kind of extra money, Yumkella said, so the UN is looking to the private sector to plug the gap.</p> <p>Philips, the multinational electronics company, has announced it is to install 100 \"light centres\" across rural Africa to bring electricity to communities in the evenings. The French oil and gas firm Total has promised to provide five million low-income people with solar lamps and portable solar kits by 2015. Dozens of other companies have made similar commitments.</p> <p>But, as concerns about global climate change grow ever more pressing, should the international community really be pushing for broader energy consumption?</p> <p>Definitely, said Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former Norwegian prime minister and <a href=\"http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm\" title=\"\">lead author of the 1987 report</a> that first gave the world the term <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/global-development+environment/rio-20-earth-summit\" title=\"\">\"sustainable development\"</a>.</p> <p>\"There is no way to think that we will have \u2026 sufficient support across the world to take action on climate \u2026 [if] that means that people in poor countries and in poor parts of countries will not have access to electricity,\" she said. \"Electricity is very basic, in so many ways. Sustainable energy for all is one crucial element in the solution.\"</p> <p>And universal energy access is just one of the three goals of the UN initiative. The campaign also aims to double the global rate of energy efficiency improvements, and double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Companies including Nike, Unilever, and Microsoft have already made commitments on those fronts.</p> <p>The last two goals are aimed at the developed world, said Yumkella, adding that rich countries \"have to transform how they produce and use energy\" even as poorer countries increase their electricity consumption.</p> <p>Yumkella believes the international community should embrace these concerted steps toward promoting sustainable energy.</p> <p>\"We are not waiting for the grand deal of climate change,\" he said. \"Right now \u2013 today \u2013 we can take action in the energy sector.\"</p>",
  "<p>A campaigning charity has won the right to support the Scottish government in its legal battle with drinks manufacturers that oppose the introduction of minimum pricing.</p> <p>Drinks manufacturers from all over the world are joining in the attempt, led by the Scotch Whisky Association, to derail the Scottish government plans. If they succeed, it will also prevent the introduction of minimum unit pricing in England, which David Cameron has said he favours. The Scottish parliament has passed legislation which would impose a minimum price per unit of alcohol of 50p, increasing the price particularly of cheap spirits sold in supermarkets.</p> <p>Alcohol Focus Scotland was given permission by the court of session in Scotland to back the government by submitting a dossier of evidence on the harm alcohol can do and the positive impact that unit pricing can have on public health. The drinks manufacturers bringing the judicial review have argued there is no such evidence. They opposed the charity's appeal to the court to be allowed to intervene.</p> <p>Dr Evelyn Gillan, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said it was a tiny organisation compared with the industry juggernaut, but that without its intervention, the court would not hear the health arguments. \"If you add up the members of the three trade groups that are making this legal challenge in the court of session, there are over 100 spirit and wine manufacturers from all over the world, including really big players like Diageo whose profits were \u00a33.2bn last year. We are one small charity.</p> <p>\"The government is going to be arguing the case primarily from the point of view that it is within the competence of the Scottish parliament. We wanted to put the public health evidence before the court because the petitioners are saying there is no evidence. We are saying that is not true.\"</p> <p>It is believed to be the first time that a charity has been given permission for a third-party intervention in the Scottish courts. The court ruled the charity would not have to pay more than its costs.</p> <p>The judicial review at the court of session in Edinburgh will take place at the end of next month. Whichever side loses is likely to take its case to the supreme court. The drinks manufacturers have also lodged a complaint with the European commission.</p> <p>\"Having failed to use their formidable lobbying power to prevent the passage of the minimum pricing law in Scotland, the global corporations now seek to get the legislation struck down by the courts. In taking this action, they follow the well-trodden path of the tobacco industry and other transnational corporations who use their considerable financial clout to oppose public health policies that threaten their shareholders' profits,\" said Gillan.</p> <p>\"In challenging the implementation of minimum pricing, the Scotch Whisky Association is essentially arguing that the commercial interests of its members should take precedence over the health and wellbeing of the people of Scotland. We need to decide if our society is prepared to limit commercial activity to better protect our health and quality of life, or alternatively, allow powerful corporate interests to dictate health policy.\"</p> <p>Significant lobbying has been taking place in Europe, where the European commission has received a complaint from the industry arguing that minimum pricing is unfair and will harm trade.</p> <p>Diageo, which owns Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness among other brands, has circulated a study it commissioned to EU officials and member states. The paper, by the Irish economic consultancy Compecon, says the Scottish policy will discriminate against alcoholic drinks imported from other countries in the EU. It says consumers will suffer through the price rise and claims there will be little impact on consumption by harmful and hazardous drinkers. \"Other benefits from reduced crime, unemployment and increased business productivity are also likely to be relatively modest,\" says the paper.</p> <p>Outlining the Scotch Whisky Association's reasons for taking legal action against the government, Gavin Hewitt, the chief executive, said in a statement in July: \"We agree that Scotland must address the harmful use of alcohol, but policy needs to be targeted on the problem. Some 30% of those who drink consume 80% of the alcohol sold. Despite warnings that minimum pricing of alcohol would be illegal, the Scottish government has pressed ahead with its ill-targeted policy and misguided legislation. The Scotch whisky industry is left with no option but to oppose the legislation in Europe and through the Scottish courts.\"</p>",

That's what makes the book's ending scenes so heartbreaking - turning the page seems unbearable, but not as much as putting down the book would be.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/magic-rowling-new-book-casual-vacancy-full-unforgettable-profanity-article-1.1168323\" title=\"\">The New York Daily News, however, was far more damning</a>, saying the novel has \"the ready appeal of reading minutes from a planning board\". \"Rowling has said the worst anyone might say about The Casual Vacancy is that it is 'dreadful' \u2014 and that she 'should have stuck to writing for kids.' Well, here goes ... Sorry, JK,\" writes Sherryl Connelly. \"The Casual Vacancy, which one bookseller breathlessly predicted would be the biggest novel of the year, isn't dreadful. It's just dull.\"</p> <p>Booksellers are crossing their fingers that readers will feel differently about The Casual Vacancy, which Rowling's editor at Little, Brown, David Shelley, predicted would \"be read for many, many years to come\". \"Everyone's very excited and curious \u2013 and it's an affectionate curiosity, people want it to be good, they want her to have a second life,\" said Howells. \"If she takes what she's learned over seven books and moves it into the grown-up sphere, it will be fabulous.\"</p> <p>At Foyles, Jonathan Ruppin said booksellers were \"very curious to find out exactly which direction she has taken her writing post-Potter\".</p> <p>\"Her name alone will of course ensure vast sales, as well as the pleasing prospect of widespread conversation about books,\" he said. \"No doubt there will be reviewers who have already decided to pour vitriol upon it no matter its merits, but we're confident that readers will be able to make up their own minds. There are certainly plenty of Foyles booksellers who'll be diving in straight away.\"</p> <p>With a cover price of \u00a320, the novel is already selling for \u00a39.86 on Amazon and \u00a310 at Waterstones.com, and booksellers are predicting a vicious price war as shops look to land a slice of the profits. \"Whilst there will be huge discounting, with many non-traditional outlets selling the book as a loss leader, it will still sell well through Foyles and other high street booksellers,\" said Foyles' Jasper Sutcliffe.</p>",
  "<p>Despite Formula One's lofty status at the pinnacle of motorsport, and its claims to be the most-watched global sport (at least on television), in the past, the games that bore its imprimatur have struggled to achieve a similarly elevated reputation. But since Codemasters acquired the F1 licence, it has worked hard to give its F1 games more credibility, and has noticeably pulled out the stops with F1 2012.</p> <p>Games built on sporting franchises, with their annual iterations, usually struggle to provide a persuasive reason to buy every year's new effort, and that was clearly uppermost in Codemasters' minds this time around. So there are plenty of new additions. </p> <p>The first one being a new start to career mode: the young drivers' test. This is essentially a tutorial, split into two days of exercises, and is fairly reminiscent of Gran Turismo's racing-licence tests. Seasoned racing gamers will find it laughably easy, but it provides a much more instantly accessible, and less intimidating, point of entry for tyros, which has to be applauded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396713321\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348660141574/F1-2012-front-view-008.jpg\" alt=\"F1 2012 front view\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As ever, the career mode offers plenty of flexibility. If you have all the time in the world, you can do a full season, with all the practice-sessions, full-length races and so on, or you can opt for truncated practice and qualifying and races as short as five laps. </p> <p>F1 2012 has a much-improved interface compared with previous versions. Once stuck into a race weekend, you still do more or less everything via your race engineer, but the game's general layout is much more logical, helped by hub-style screens.</p> <p>Car feel and handling has always been exemplary since Codemasters acquired the F1 licence, and this year the cars are supposed to have been made more stable, but only the really hardcore racing-sim fanatics would notice that. You still have to be careful putting the power down after slow corners, and very cagey on the throttle in the wet \u2013 don't expect arcade-style concessions. The cars, as in real life, are tricky to drive (particularly if you spurn traction-control), which is exactly as it should be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396713322\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348660539180/F1-2012-rain-008.jpg\" alt=\"F1 2012 rain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two new modes for 2012 make a big impression, especially season challenge. This distils a whole season into 10 races, with adrenalin-inducing single-shot, one-lap qualifying runs (you get a ghost image of the pole position man for reference). Cleverly, it is possible to win the championship even in such a truncated set of races, as you must nominate a rival in a superior car and if you beat him in a set of three races, you win his car, thereby potentially elevating yourself to the championship-leading car. </p> <p>Season challenge's hit-the-ground-running nature means it's a good idea to do a career season before you get stuck into it, but it's very addictive and provides a lot of replay value.</p> <p>Champions mode is also new, and takes advantage of the unprecedented presence of six world champions on this year's grid. Each gets their own challenge \u2013 with different tracks and conditions, but you always have to catch and pass the relevant champion \u2013 and if you win them all, you then have to beat all six champions at the new (and still not quite finished) Austin, Texas track. Fantasy Formula One indeed, although similar scenario-modes have been seen in F1 games of yore.</p> <p>The multi-player side of the game has also been improved \u2013 up to 16 players can take each other on now, with eight AI-controlled cars making up a full grid. Thanks to the presence of Codemasters' social networks-aping system Racenet, setting up online challenges with your friends is a breeze and two people can co-operatively play through a single career, as team-mates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396713323\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348660631443/F1-2012-head-on-008.jpg\" alt=\"F1 2012 head on\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>F1 2012 is incredibly slick, polished and beautifully made, and it's difficult to imagine how Codemasters could have come up with any other means of distinguishing it from its predecessors.</p> <p>Season challenge changes the game's dynamic very cleverly, and yet it's more accessible to gamers at the casual end of the spectrum. By some distance the best Formula One video game ever. But whether that will help it break out to an audience beyond devoted F1 fans remains to be seen.<br> </p> <p><strong>F1 2012 was reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",
  "<p>As governments and universities struggle with the economics of mainstream higher education, many public systems are slowly (or suddenly) becoming mixed economy models. The OECD's <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/education/preschoolandschool/educationataglance2011oecdindicators.htm\" title=\"\">Education at a Glance 2011</a> told the story of the shift. Between 1995 and 2008, public spending on tertiary education across OECD countries fell from 77 to 69% of total spending; while from 2000 to 2008, private spending grew 117%, or four times faster than public spending.</p> <p>The full effects of the global financial crisis are not yet visible in the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag2012.htm\" title=\"\">2012 report</a>, but with mixed economy comes a need for management to match it \u2013 and Australia is already well down this path. In 1975 our university sector was small, domestically focused, and fully funded by the Commonwealth government. Today it is four times larger (if we include international students) and just half of all university revenue comes from the Commonwealth (less if we exclude student loans).</p> <p>Our universities rely on a mixed bag of income streams. Budgets and programmes stand or fall on some combination of the funding and pricing regime for public places for domestic students, tapping market demand for private places from international students, competing for research grants with other universities, and attracting third stream income wherever this may be found.</p> <p>Institutional strategies require a much wider-angle lens than previously, with immigration regulations and currency markets now relevant to the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analyses that university plans depend on. In administrative terms, universities have become extremely complex, with more moving parts than the London 2012 Olympics. And as academic enterprises, it's a given that many of these parts will have minds of their own.</p> <p>So the leadership challenge is large: an external context that keeps shifting, typically, makes internal changes very hard to introduce successfully. In the face of the uncertainties of a mixed economy, Australian university leaders have always argued for much more funding, and much less regulation. But since we know neither may come through, many are also building some version of what we might call an all-purpose, all-weather, multi-platform business model.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.curtin.edu.au/\" title=\"\">Curtin University</a> is a case in point. With its main campus in Perth, it is Australia's largest west coast university. It has 47,000 enrolments in programmes from pre-degree to PhD. One in five of its students is in a postgraduate programme; two in five are international students. Through Curtin College, the university offers pathways into degree study through certificate and diploma programmes. With private operator Navitas, Curtin offers business degrees at its campus in the heart of Sydney on Australia's east coast.</p> <p>With 10,000 international students onshore and another 9000 offshore, it has more than 3000 studying at its East Malaysian campus at Sarawak, and more than 2000 at its Singapore campus. As a member of <a href=\"http://www.open.edu.au/\" title=\"\">Open Universities Australia</a>, Curtin also enrols 16,000 students through this online channel in award and non-award programmess. And in its own right it has launched <a href=\"http://courses.curtin.edu.au/course_overview/curtin-online/index.cfm\" title=\"\">Curtin Online</a> to make its degrees in humanities and business available through online study.</p> <p>For university managers \u2013 both in Australia and abroad \u2013 these new risks and complexities present both technical and adaptive challenges. Though the world of higher learning is changing rapidly, parts of academia don't get or want all this change. Many still see university management as an alien import from the corporate sector, and terms such as 'business model' part of the problem.</p> <p>We see more anecdotal critique of managerialism than research examining university management as a profession that needs to work in tandem with scholars. For all its insights, the critique of 'management as ideology' has become a solution-free zone in a sector that is desperately in need of solutions. Given these factors, it is unsurprising that university staff often step into academic and administrative management roles without much preparation.</p> <p>So what exactly do department heads, programme leaders and administrative managers need? They need to be in touch with the big trends shaping tertiary education and how these affect the outlook for their own institutions. They need a clear grasp of the aims and values that scholars and other professionals bring to the work of a modern university. They need a shared vocabulary and a wide repertoire of management roles and practices. They need a realistic strategy for the future of their institution or department. But just as importantly, they need a clear process for engaging their colleagues in discussing, designing and introducing well-considered changes.</p> <p><em>Geoff Sharrock is programme director of the master of tertiary education management at the </em><a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lhmartininstitute.edu.au%2F&amp;ei=aalhUOfrMIG2hQelrIGAAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcKDV3NVvPbF6Bw-ncSFRyB_IYNw\" title=\"\"><em>LH Martin Institute for Tertiary Education Leadership and Management</em></a><em>, University of Melbourne, Australia</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Two years ago, Sierra Leone's government invited the women's movement to draw up a bill to usher in the quota system they had been demanding for the past 10 years. The women set about working tirelessly to draft and push through a bill stipulating that women should have a 30% representation in government and public decision-making spaces. It was to be a private members' bill that came from those demanding the change.</p> <p>The current parliamentary session closed on Tuesday. Despite the women's demands that the bill be pushed through as a government bill by executive order through a certificate of urgency, and eight other bills being enacted just before the close of parliament, gender equality was not included in the pack. We don't know how this will affect women's candidacy in the next electoral cycle, as nominations of candidates for local elections have closed and parliamentary nominations are due by 15 October.</p> <p>The way the bill has come about reflects the ambivalence male politicians feel towards it. Some activists doubt the sincerity of political will behind the bill, and feel the women have been set up to fail. The fact that it was initially handed over to the women's movement to draft, rather than being drafted within the ministry of social welfare, gender and children's affairs, is odd. The movement was initially elated when the chance to work on the bill arose, but the technical realities of drafting and gazetting the bill proved difficult and expensive. The main sticking point in the bill is the provision for reserved and safe seats, particularly unpopular with male politicians who believe it will jeopardise their positions since no new constituencies will be created.</p> <p>The issue of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/dec/15/women-parliament-quotas-gender-development\" title=\"\">whether or not quotas help</a> improve women's representation in formal politics is controversial. It is generally understood that legal changes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/04/african-women-political-influence-cultural-change\" title=\"\">need to be accompanied by social and cultural shifts</a> to have teeth. Quotas alone are not sufficient, but most view them as a necessary first step towards gender equity in politics.</p> <p>In Sierra Leone, 18.9% of local politicians are women, as are 13.4% at national level. But efforts to increase these figures face obstacles beyond the difficulties involved in pushing through the bill. A recent hike in the registration fees for candidacy nomination has added to activists' concerns about the number of women able to run for office, as it further decreases the likelihood of candidates outside the main parties being able to afford to do so (70% of the population lives below the poverty line). Add to this the legacy of violence that has historically accompanied elections in Sierra Leone, and you get a very hostile environment for potential female candidates.</p> <p>Women's rights activists fear that, even if the bill does eventually get passed, it will be so watered down as to be ineffectual. If the provision for reserved and safe seats is removed, the bill will be of little use. Elections in Sierra Leone are only every five years.</p> <p>However, a positive outcome has been how, against the odds, women have organised themselves so quickly and effectively \u2013 a sign that things are changing. Prior to the war, not one female independent candidate had won an electoral seat. Yet the increase in female independent candidates from single digits in the pre-war years to double figures and then, finally, the success of three candidates in the 2004 and 2008 local elections is a remarkable achievement that should be celebrated. Regardless of whether the quota bill is eventually passed, it will go down in history that Sierra Leonean women have forced the government to acknowledge their role and status as a political force that can no longer be overlooked.</p>",
  "<p>Happy autumn, citizens of the United Kingdom! Your friend here across the pond hears rumblings that you will soon be able to consume something my fellow citizens have long called a \"PSL\" (which stands, of course, for the autumnal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StarbucksUK/status/248413659628441600/photo/1\" title=\"\">pumpkin spice latte</a>) at your nearest corporate coffee chain, Starbucks. This auspicious event has provided me with the occasion to let you in on a little secret that most Yanks would never admit. Hopefully I won't have my citizenship revoked for saying this, but here goes: pumpkin is crap.</p> <p>Wait. Let me amend that a bit: pumpkin in North America is an idea, a symbol, a seasonal icon. And the idea of pumpkin has very little relation to an actual pumpkin patch, or to the flavour of pumpkin. And yes, I'm sure that the PSL is tasty, in its corporate, mass-produced coffee chain way, laced with its artificial flavours, caramel colour and preservatives. But I'm pretty sure the artificial pumpkin flavour that makes the PSL so addictive isn't actually pumpkin at all. Most likely it's artificial squash flavour, as squash (and spices) is really where the warm, cosy flavour we so associate with autumn truly comes from.</p> <p>Here in the US, we're engaged in this massive fraud where we pretend to eat pumpkin, but what we really eat (or really should be eating) is squash. No one eats carving pumpkins \u2013 they are tasteless and watery. A few heirloom pumpkin varieties are indeed tasty, but for the most full-flavoured pumpkin taste, squash is where it's at. I'm partial to deeply orange or green varieties, which are not only generally higher in vitamins but most deeply flavoured, too: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabocha\" title=\"\">kabocha squash</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita_maxima\" title=\"\">hubbard squash</a>, even the pale and generally underflavoured <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butternut_squash\" title=\"\">butternut squash</a>, which can be a dinnertime godsend because it has so few seeds and is so quick to peel. All of them are vastly tastier than most pumpkin varieties.</p> <p>That's where my real annoyance with products like the PSL comes from: they reduce seasonality to an artificial flavour. As a person with tastebuds, I'm offended by the fact that summertime means artificial lemon flavour in our powdered lemonade mix, winter is fake peppermint candies dyed with cancer-causing dye, and fall is pumpkin flavour from a bottle. American people want the <em>idea</em> of pumpkin, and we've decided that the word \"squash\" doesn't sound quite right. So we synthesize what fall should taste like in a lab, and that's what our taste buds become accustomed to. And when we go into the kitchen to make a fall dinner after drinking our PSL on our commute home, we can't quite get the squash risotto or pumpkin soup to taste like it seems it should.</p> <p>Multinational corporate food giants, with their labs and food scientists pushing the flavour of \"pumpkin\" to the absolute most extreme levels (so that we crave the intensity of their products, and develop dependences on them) rob us of a little old thing called \"the actual flavour of a thing\". The actual thingness of squash, its literal squashiness, is getting lost in the modern chemical soup.</p> <p>This is a shame because they are all lovely \u2013 roasted to perfection in a hot oven with warming spices (real ones!) and lots of olive oil until it develops a golden brown crust, mashed like potatoes with some coconut milk and thyme, or rosemary and saut\u00e9ed garlic. Ah, squash. This season's best friend! Don't go down the American pumpkin patch route, brave citizens of the UK. Stick with squash. Trust me on this.</p>",

  "<p>Banks have almost certainly never been less popular. From mis-sold pensions to mis-reported Libor rates \u2013 the rate at which banks lend to each other \u2013 bankers seem to be to blamed for most of our woes. Many solutions have been put forward, including splitting the \"casino\" elements from the rest, shaking up board membership and toughening regulation.</p> <p>One question that doesn't seem to have been asked, however, is whether any of this would make banking more sustainable.</p> <p>The prescriptions for avoiding a repeat of the crisis are certainly aimed at more financial sustainability within the financial system \u2013 avoiding bank busts and market mayhem. It's fair to say that this has to be the top priority. If they don't survive they can't contribute in any way. But this has little to do with economic stability \u2013 avoiding asset price bubbles, trading instruments and practices which destabilise the broader economy.</p> <p>Also, the proposals would leave the financial sector still facing the challenge of how to contribute meaningfully to sustainable development instead of returning to (unsustainable) business as usual when the crisis is finally behind us.</p> <p>It's a tough challenge, at least for the major institutions that dominate the world of finance. It's true that the likes of <a href=\"http://www.triodos.com\" title=\"\">Triodos</a> and even the UK's <a href=\"http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk\" title=\"\">Co-operative Bank</a> are focused on sustainability. They have the luxury of a small operation which does not require them to ditch or turn away significant business volumes.</p> <p>It's not so easy for bank multinationals such as Citibank, HSBC and the other inhabitants of Canary Wharf that have multi-faceted international operations and clients across the global economy. Abandoning the large chunks of their business with negative social and environmental side-effects would have much worse impact on their own employees and the global economy.</p> <p>Nobody's going to feel sorry for bankers, but they might attract a smidgen of sympathy if it was clear they were moving in the right direction. However, the evidence is not strong.</p> <p>First, the good news. <a href=\"http://www.equator-principles.com\" title=\"\">The Equator Principles</a>, which attempt to limit financing of damaging infrastructure projects such as destructive dams, have 77 signatories including many of the world's largest banks. A third version of the principles, originally launched in 2003, will soon be finalised, extending their scope and strengthening reporting requirements.</p> <p>But these principles only apply to project finance \u2013 money to build specific, complex infrastructure such as dams, power stations and mines. This is a tiny part of the world of money. In the rest of that world there has been rather less progress.</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"http://www.theclimategroup.org/programs/the-climate- principles/\" title=\"\">Climate Principles</a>, a promising idea building on the success of the project finance version. Institutions sign up to integrate climate change in all their business decisions. That means they promote low-carbon activities with clients as well as in their own operations and they support climate change policies. This covers research, trading in the markets, corporate and investment banking as well as retail \u2013 the serious stuff where most of the money is made, even today.</p> <p>It has to be said that 2008 wasn't the best of times to get something like this off the ground. But even so it's disappointing that only seven institutions signed up and one of them (Munich Re) pulled out. Only four of the signatories were banks: BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, HSBC and Standard Chartered.</p> <p>The Climate Principles now appear to be effectively dead, or at least dormant. Worse still, the last <a href=\"http://www.theclimategroup.org/_assets/files/Climate-Principles- review-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">independent review</a> found that the worst performing area was project finance \u2013 which doesn't say much for the effectiveness of the Equator Principles.</p> <p>But there are some positive developments. Many leading banks, especially in Europe, have adopted policy positions on sensitive issues and introduced social and environmental criteria in risk management processes. There's a growing volume of research, especially on climate change, and finance for clean/green technology, including renewable energy. Institutions continue to operate in carbon markets, even in their depressed state.</p> <p>But all this is tiny in the context of global banking operations.</p> <p>It could be argued that major banks have enough on their plate at the moment, negotiating the economic quagmire the world is in. But if sustainability isn't built into the strategies being developed now it will be too late once the good times roll again.</p> <p>We have heard about culture change programmes, aimed at altering mindsets and instilling different values.

I watched as the police officers from throughout the state of Mississippi attending the conference came up when I asked them to, some dressed in their crisp police uniform, some in plain clothes with their firearm on their side, some wearing jackets with the word police on the back in bold letters. But one by one, all of these law enforcement officials told the same story, and it was that they do what they do because they want to help people. They want to make a difference, that it surely wasn't for the salary.<br>.... At one point or another in all of our lives, we will all need the assistance of a social worker.

As the couriers moved on to work in bike shops, players later roped in colleagues and friends.</p> <p>What started off as an excuse to drink, hang out and crash their bikes became something riders took seriously until people started moving to Seattle's \"bike mecca\" to play.</p> <p>Over time, bike polo's familiar three-a-side format was established, with players jousting for the ball in the centre of the court to start a game. Dabbing a foot on the ground required the player to ride a 360 circle or tap a board at the side to get back in the game, depending on where they played, until the 360 rule was abandoned in favour of the tap out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396710097\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/9/25/1348575082719/Bike-blog--bike-polo--sti-007.jpg\" alt=\"Bike blog : bike polo : still for 'Hit 'Em In The Mouth'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: HEITM</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HEITM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The unwritten rule of \"don't be a jerk\" was universally agreed on.<br><br>What has resulted from years of honing is a thrilling, fast-paced sport with incredible demonstrations of bike handling, spills, some gore, and plenty of irreverent heckling, even from the judge (usually a player from another team). In short, a great spectator sport.</p> <p>HEITM describes the evolution from \"Frankenstein bikes\" to polo-specific bikes with short wheel bases. As the film's players learn, bike polo is an increasingly competitive international sport and, with tournaments across the US and Europe, players need to evolve, too.</p> <p>In late August I met the Hit 'Em in the Mouth star Dustin Rigg playing bike polo on a Hackney basketball court at the end of his European tour. His team, the Seattle Guardians, have just won second place in the <a href=\"http://www.lhbpa.org/lo2012/\" title=\"\">London Open bike polo championships</a>. Rigg is described in the film as \"a phenomenal player; a great striker able to take advantage of any opponent's mistake\". In person he is as laid back as most of the players in the film:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I don't feel like I helped get [bike polo] started but I helped make it more competitive. Riders are inspired by each other's tricks, which keeps the sport moving forward.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It took Rigg and his fellow players two years of wrangling with Seattle's parks department to get designated court space in the city to play legally. Now, not only is the sport firmly established in Seattle, it has found its place in the world.</p> <p>\u2022 You can see Hit 'Em in the Mouth at the <a href=\"http://www.bicyclefilmfestival.com/london\" title=\"\">London Bicycle film festival</a>, 4-7 October.</p>",
  "<p>Four years ago this month, the then US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson learned that the British government would not allow Barclays to purchase Lehman Brothers. \"They don't want US problems infecting the UK system,\" Paulson said. Days later, Lehman filed for bankruptcy. But, it turns out, we were far from immune.</p> <p>UK GDP will not recover to pre-crisis levels until 2014 at the earliest and we seem to be recovering at a slower pace than other nations. We are still sick. That means we need to look to the parts of our economy that are still healthy, because they will have the cure.</p> <p>Cue the green economy. By 2014, when it's expected the rest of the economy will be restored to 2007 levels, the green economy will have grown by 40%. The Confederation of British Industry <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2012/07/green-or-growth-is-a-false-choice-%E2%80%93-cbi-chief/\" title=\"\">states that</a> one-third of the UK's economic growth in the last financial year came from green business. They also believe green business could halve our trade deficit by 2014-15. That makes sense, since we already export \u00a3330m more green goods and services to China than we import from them.</p> <p>It is an undoubted UK success story, as <a href=\"http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/uploadedFiles/Publications/reports/British_success_story_Issuu.pdf\" title=\"\">our recent infographic shows</a>, with strength in jobs, infrastructure spending and international trade. There are plenty of reasons why it has done so well. Most obvious being that climate change doesn't take a time out for an economic crisis. The impact of extreme weather on supply chains has shown businesses that it's a good idea to invest in resilience. But there are other reasons.</p> <p>First, the green economy is about doing more with less. A concept that is more appealing now than ever.</p> <p>A second reason is the opportunity it offers for large-scale investment. Greening the economy is a big job, and there is a lot to do. As <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/economics/2012/06/green-investments-can-overcome-paradox-thrift\" title=\"\">economist Dimitri Zenghelis</a> argues, investors are not lacking funds, just the certainty they need to spend them. The UK previously set a clear policy direction for a low-carbon future which is why we have started to see the returns. This financial year, 88% of the UK's top 20 infrastructure projects are low carbon, with only 6% of them reliant on public money.</p> <p>But the government is now stalling. Current infrastructure conversations seem to be framed around doing something, anything, so long as it makes things look busy. More of the same, like gas, airports and roads, rather than taking on the big challenge of what we need to really grow the economy, like fibre optic cables, renewables and low-carbon transport networks. It may be easier to repeat the past, but it won't help the recovery or give us the tools we need for what is to come.</p> <p>Recently the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/george-osborne-letter-ed-davey-gas-wind\" title=\"\">chancellor made clear that he was willing to risk investment in the new green economy</a> to protract the life old way of doing things. He seems very keen on gas which, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9173373/UK-gas-imports-outstrip-production-for-first-time-since-1967.html\" title=\"\">even the most optimistic commentators admit</a> , will leave us reliant on imports in a seller's market. In fact, the <a href=\"http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/Autumn2011EFO_web_version138469072346.pdf\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics sees</a> this as key to why we're still doing so badly. It's an odd approach: stop the growth of the future to prop up the failures of the past.</p> <p>This is not a growth policy, but a witch trial: if it floats, drown it, if it sinks, invest in it. Business needs to make very clear to the chancellor that the country can't afford such an approach.</p>",
  "<p>The wettest September weather for 30 years has moved south after two days of battering northern England, where a huge clear-up is now under way.</p> <p>More than 400 households from north Wales to Northumberland face months in temporary accommodation or camping on upper floors, as insurance companies and builders deal with the effects of almost twice the month's average rain falling in 48 hours.</p> <p>Road and rail links between Scotland and the English Midlands are staggering back to normal as pumps and drainage repairs turn temporary rivers back into normal sections of the A1 Great North Road, M6 and East Coast mainline. A 40-mile diversion remains in place on the A1 across the Vale of York while engineers assess damage to recently-completed stretches of dual carriageway.</p> <p>Refugees from the floodwaters include 19 pensioners from an elderly people's home near Richmond, North Yorkshire, the oldest of them 92, and residents of a street in Stockton-on-Tees who were ferried to safety by a Teesside lifeboat operating 10 miles inland. The worst-affected town has been Morpeth in Northumberland, where temporary defences following severe flooding in 2008 failed, and major work on new measures has yet to begin. Floods remain in parts of Cheshire, including part of Noah's Ark Lane in Mobberley.</p> <p>More than 90 people there have seen their homes swamped again by the river Wansbeck, which finally retreated overnight and left a sea of debris and mud. Alan Bell, the chairman of the Morpeth Flood Action Group \u2013 which advised Cockermouth in Cumbria on recovery measures after flooding there three years ago \u2013 said: \"The flood levels were about 3ft less this time, but that doesn't keep away the trauma of the likelihood of flooding. It's terrible for those who have been flooded twice in four years.\"</p> <p>The Environment Agency warned of dangerously high river levels in North Yorkshire, where runoff from both the Dales and the North York Moors is threatening Ripon, Boroughbridge and Tadcaster, all close to the stricken section of the A1. Emergency teams are continuing work on shoring up flood defences, clearing blocked watercourses and drains and using pumps to keep water levels down.</p> <p>The agency has now sent more than 105,000 warnings to people at risk of flooding, and estimates that flood defences have protected over 18,500 properties that would otherwise have been at serious risk. Alison Baptiste, flood risk manager at the agency, said: \"We would urge people, especially in the north of England, to continue to be prepared for flooding, sign up for free flood warnings, keep up to date with the latest situation at <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood\" title=\"\">www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood</a> and stay away from dangerous flood water.\"</p> <p>Engineers have closed the A659 bridge over the river Wharfe at Tadcaster, where new defences held, and serious concerns remain about the structural safety of new townhouses at Newburn, Newcastle upon Tyne, whose foundations have been left like stilts around a hole scoured out by floods.</p> <p>The agency has 121 flood alerts and 75 flood warnings in place, 88 down on the peak during the downpours, with 69 of the alerts and 73 of the warnings still in the north. The Midlands has 29 alerts and one warning, Wales 10 and one, and the south west 13 alerts.</p> <p>There were thunderstorms in Kent early on Wednesday but the rainfall is expected to ease as it moves south, according to the Meteorological Office. Forecasters gave details of the area of low pressure measuring 973 millibars, the lowest recorded for the UK in September since 1981, which brought two conflicting weather fronts together and caused the downpour. The obstinate refusal of the rain to move from the north for two days followed a gentler jetstream than usual, although some parts of Scotland and the north west suffered isolated winds of up to 70mph.</p> <p>The highest rainfall was recorded at Ravensworth in North Yorkshire with 131mm (5.1ins) since Sunday night, over three times the September average, while Leeming on the closed stretch of the A1 had 93mm, approaching double its September average of 50mm. Rhyl in north Wales just pipped this with 95mm.</p> <p>Many other parts of the north saw from 50mm to 70mm but rainfall in the Midlands and south is not expected to be more than 20mm to 40mm and dryer weather should be the norm across the country by Thursday.</p> <p>Andy Ratcliffe of MeteoGroup said: \"Today is not going to be persistent rain but more showery, mainly across East Anglia, down into London and across southern England into Wales. There will be heavy patches and the risk of the odd thunderstorm, but as we go through to this evening and over night, many places will become dry.</p> <p>Most of the north is dry, with average September temperatures in the wake of the rain, and river levels in the north-east are well down. The river Coquet at Rothbury, which sent two cars careering downstream on Tuesday, has subsided and the Calder Valley town of Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, which has twice been devastated by floods since May, has avoided a third, just.</p> <p>Local resident Brian Smith, on watch by a bridge over the Calder, said: \"The rain's eased off so I reckon we might escape.

  "<p>More than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/north-england-floods-homes\" title=\"Floods hit 300 homes in north England\">300 homes have been flooded in the north of England</a> after almost twice the average rainfall for September drenched parts of St Helen's in Lancashire and Morpeth in Northumberland in 48 hours.</p> <p>Flood warnings and alerts remain in place in areas of the north and south-west of England.</p> <h2>What does a flood warning mean?</h2> <p>The Met Office, Environment Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency all offer advice to the public on any threat posed by the weather.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/warnings/\" title=\"Met Office weather warnings\">Met Office</a> warns the public about \"severe or hazardous weather which has the potential to cause danger to life or widespread disruption\" through its National Severe Weather Warning Service. Warnings can be issued for rain, snow, wind, fog and ice and are given a colour depending on how likely it is a weather event will occur and what impact it may have. Green means no severe weather; yellow ups the ante to \"be aware\"; amber means \"be prepared\"; red means \"take action\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/\" title=\"Environment Agency website\">Environment Agency</a> issues flood risk announcements for England and Wales with three levels of severity: flood alerts (meaning \"flooding is possible, be prepared\"); flood warnings (\"flooding is expected, immediate action required\"); and severe flood warnings (\"severe flooding, danger to life\").</p> <p>It issues these across seven regions: Anglia, the Midlands, the north-east, the north-west, the south-east, the south-west, and Wales. On its website you can look at specific flood risk locations and view maps. In Scotland, the <a href=\"http://floodline.sepa.org.uk/floodupdates/\" title=\"Scottish Environment Protection Agency website\">Scottish Environment Protection Agency</a> issues alerts on the same scale.</p> <p>For those in areas liable to flooding, it makes sense to sign up to the <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/38289.aspx\" title=\"Environment Agencys Floodline\">Environment Agency's Floodline</a>, a free service which sends a message to your phone or email when flooding is expected.</p> <h2>What will the emergency services do?</h2> <p>Emergency services do not automatically have to act when a flood alert has been issued, but they will monitor potentially affected areas more closely. Local authorities work with the police, fire and rescue services as well as the Environment Agency to co-ordinate responses during severe flooding.</p> <p>If there is a major flood incident, it is the police who co-ordinate the emergency services and help with the evacuation of people from their homes where necessary (they will also issue warnings to motorists and close roads where necessary). The fire service is primarily responsible for saving lives, but it may also pump out floodwater (contact your local service to ask about this \u2013 there may be a charge).</p> <p>The emergency services advise people to listen to local radio and TV for announcements. You should also check with your local authority for updates. If the flooding is serious, be prepared for the emergency services and your local authority to evacuate you.</p> <h2>There is a flood alert for my area. What should I do?</h2> <p>Tune in to the local radio station so you can keep up with what is going on and to check the local weather forecast. It might be sensible to locate a battery or wind-up radio in case the power supply is hit.</p> <p>Prepare a flood kit: home insurance documents, torch, warm waterproof clothing, first aid kit and prescription medicine, bottled water and non-perishable food, baby food and care items.</p> <p>Think about who will need help to get out of danger, including vulnerable neighbours and pets.</p> <h2>The alert has changed to a warning \u2013 what now?</h2> <p>Turn off your gas and electricity. Move family, pets, important and precious items (including other insurance policy documents, birth certificates etc) to a safe position (the highest floor/attic).</p> <p>Put any flood protection products you have in place, including airbrick covers, floorboards (to fit around windows and doors), sandbags (stuff pillow cases or plastic bags with earth if you don't have sandbags) and sink and bath plugs weighed down by heavy objects to stop water coming up the pipes.</p> <p>If there is time also move other items such as expensive furniture, electrical equipment, lightweight rugs and carpets to the top floor in the house, and move your car to higher ground.</p> <p>Plug water inlet pipes with towels or cloths, and disconnect any equipment that uses water.</p> <h2>I'm already flooded \u2013 what now?</h2> <p>The most important thing is to stay safe. Co-operate with the emergency services and evacuate your home if told to do so. Call 999 if you are in danger.</p> <p>If your home is actually underwater it is too late to worry about saving items, but you should think about what to do once the waters start to recede. Your first step should be to call your insurance company \u2013 most have 24-hour emergency helplines.</p> <h2>What if I can't find my policy document?</h2> <p>Don't panic, your insurer should be able to find you on its database. Look on its website or call a directory inquiries line to get its number. If you car is underwater you will have to call your motor insurance company as well. Bear in mind you will only be able to make a claim if you have fully comprehensive cover.</p> <h2>What should I do next?</h2> <p>If you are able to stay in your property but need help to prevent further damage, speak to your insurer before arranging emergency repairs and keep any receipts for work done so you can claim for the cost. Where possible, take photographs to record the damage, as this could help with your claim.</p> <p>Remember that water and electricity don't mix: if your electricity supply is not switched off, ask a qualified person to deal with this. Do not touch sources of electricity while standing in water.</p> <p>Don't throw damaged things away, even if you will need to replace them, without first checking with your insurer. It is likely to want a loss adjustor to assess the damage and work out how much your payout should be. Use a permanent ink pen to mark how high water has risen in every room and make a list of what damage has occurred, including food touched by flood water and anything in your fridge and freezer.</p> <p>Keep a note of all phone calls with your insurance company, recording the date, time, name of the person you spoke to and what was agreed.</p> <p>Check whether the insurer will pay for the cleaning of your property, or if you are expected to do that.</p> <h2>What if I've had to leave my property?</h2> <p>In the first instance, you may be moved to emergency shelter by the rescue services, but after that you may need to move somewhere else while work is done to make your home habitable again. Building and contents insurance will usually include provision for alternative accommodation if the damage is so great you are unable to stay at home. If you have both types of policy, your building insurer will be expected to take care of your claim for somewhere to stay.</p> <p>Most insurers will ask you to approve with them the accommodation you are moving to before your stay begins. Sadly, they are unlikely to stretch to the Ritz \u2013 alternative accommodation is supposed to be in keeping with your normal lifestyle, so for most people that will mean a standard hotel or B&amp;B, at least in the short term.</p>",

Every independent decision-making Nice committee includes lay members to ensure the guidance is relevant for patients.</p> <p><strong>Evidence bases:</strong> Relevant evidence needed to support the case for adoption of a technology depends very much on the claimed benefits \u2013 for patients and/or the healthcare system. In some cases, where the product is assumed to be clinically non-inferior but to release resources, more attention may be needed on the evidence and assumptions underlying the economic modelling.</p> <h2><strong>John de Pury is research networks manager at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.nhsconfed.org/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\"><strong>NHS Confederation</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Driving real change:</strong> It may not be incremental improvement that really solves the big challenges of 21st-century health care.

Externally driven, reliant on concentrations of high intellectual capital, responsive to changing demands/needs such as patient voice.</p> <p><strong>New academic health science networks have great potential:</strong> Their intention is to deliver across two broad objectives \u2013 patient and population health outcomes, and the growth agenda.

  "<p>Days before the opening ceremony, the stunt artists playing the roles of James Bond and the Queen were still on track to parachute into the Olympic stadium between a web of wires through a space no bigger than a squash court. Sensibly <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/the-people-delivering-the-games/locog/\" title=\"\">LOCOG</a> and the ceremony organisers decided that the risk of two volunteers becoming entangled (or worse) in front of an audience of 10 billion people wasn't worth the reward. They parachuted into a spot outside the stadium instead.</p> <p>The London Olympics and Paralympics have exposed people to the events world for the first time, and many have liked it. Many of the volunteer networks are filled with chatter about how to get into the industry as career.</p> <p>The truth is that they have made a step in the right direction already by volunteering. Any type of experience in the events world will help you to begin your career. Most people aren't able to fill a CV with paid work, but volunteering allows you to demonstrate the level of grit, determination and commitment required.</p> <p>Volunteering at a local festival, charity event or sporting is a great first step. But what other advice is there for people who aspire to organise the next royal wedding, 50,000-strong festival or national sporting event?</p> <p>Network as much as you can within the events industry. This will help you find openings and opportunities to gain experience. You are only ever a phone call away from a role; someone just needs to have your number. Use as many networks you can find; social networking on Linkedin, Twitter and Facebook can build your contacts and show you know your stuff. Contribute your ideas to professional event groups and observe the others involved. You can then follow them and see where they go, what they do. Keep watching and learning.</p> <p>Open a little black book of the contacts, suppliers, agencies and individuals that you bump into. The event scene can be incestuous; many of the providers have known each other for years. Keeping a note of contacts, even as a way of logging your experience, is very helpful. Make sure these opportunities then make it to your CV, which needs to be up to date.</p> <p>Considering a move might be a big step, but there is no question that London is one of the global epicenters of creative and production services for events. Students and suppliers come from all over the world to learn from the UK. The capital isn't the only place to gain experience, however; other events hubs inlude Edinburgh, Birmingham and Cardiff.</p> <p>Also consider some further training. There is a wealth of event courses out there, but make sure that you are getting value from an outfit that know what they are doing. Some kind of reputable accreditation makes all the difference to potential employers. Look for an accreditation and the experience of the course directors and lecturers, and beware of 'generic' courses.</p> <p>Placements with events organisers and companies are another fantastic way to get ahead. It is difficult to get them right, but experience will really help you build confidence, so never turn down an opportunity. Even the smallest wedding or party counts.</p> <p>It also helps to develop the kind of basic skills that all events organisers rely on. Learning to budget effectively and use tools such as Excel to their full advantage to show you are serious about events as a career path.</p> <p>But above all build your confidence and resilience. The events industry is a game of hard knocks, late nights, long hours, thankless tasks balanced by the brief glamour and reward of the show, the celebrity, the celebration and the knowledge that you were not only there but that you actually had a part in creating it. You need to be positive and no agency or organisation will want anything else but that from their team. Attitude gets experience, which gets work, which gets you ahead.</p> <p><em>Lorne Armstrong is the director of </em><a href=\"http://www.eventcourse.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Ashdown Academy</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Human rights are the most powerful tool to ensure efforts against hunger and malnutrition tackle structural causes and are not reduced to short-term strategies, civil society groups said in a report published on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rtfn-watch.org/\" title=\"\">Who Decides About Global Food and Nutrition? \u2013 Strategies to Regain Control</a> argues that it is impossible to combat the causes of hunger while keeping existing power relations untouched.</p> <p>\"Food and power are related. It is almost impossible to find one person among the powerful in society and politics worldwide who does not have enough to eat,\" said Huguette Akplogan-Dossa, regional co-ordinator of the African Network on the Right to Food (ANoRF). \"The tendency is for exclusion from economic and political decision-making to go hand in hand with incidences of hunger and malnutrition.\"</p> <p>The report expresses particular concern about the increasing influence and control of agribusinesses and financial companies over food and nutrition.</p> <p>\"Far too often, agribusinesses and nutrition companies use their weight and influence to increase their profit margins, and to manipulate the rules to their interests and convenience, without regard for the best interests of small-scale food producers and the survival of their communities \u2013 let alone the moral and legal requirements of the human right to food,\" said Peter Prove, executive director of the Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance.</p> <p>The report points to a faultline in how to deal with food security \u2013 access to safe and nutritious food. There is the \"mainstream approach\" favoured by governments and international organisations, such as Agra, Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, and backed by the Gates Foundation, which focuses on technocratic approaches \u2013 better seeds and technology \u2013 to boost productivity and access to markets. This week, Agra is holding a <a href=\"http://www.agrforum.com/index.php\" title=\"\">forum in Arusha, Tanzania, on plans for developing Africa's agricultural sector</a>.</p> <p>However, the civil society groups behind the fifth annual report on the right to food and nutrition put the emphasis on a rights-based approach. They say an agricultural system that features large US and EU farm subsidies, along with a concentration of power among a few grain giants such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/18/us-multinationals-control-food-aid\" title=\"\">ADM, Cargill and Bunge (the main corporate beneficiaries of US food aid)</a>, contribute to food insecurity in poor countries.</p> <p>\"Allowing decision-making to be in the hands of a powerful but reduced group has led to a centralised model of food supply, which in many cases results in famines, political abuse, or infringement on the state's basic obligations when it comes to human rights: to respect, protect and fulfil them,\" the report says.</p> <p>The report sees negative corporate influence at work in the <a href=\"http://www.scalingupnutrition.org/\" title=\"\">Scaling Up Nutrition</a> (Sun) initiative, involving a $2.9bn plan to promote good nutritional practices with $6.2bn on preventing and treating malnutrition with special foods. Backed by the UN, the scheme has the support of <a href=\"http://www.gainhealth.org/\" title=\"\">Gain</a>, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition. Gain's partners include food giants such as PepsiCo, Kraft and Danone.</p> <p>The UN special rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier de Schutter, while welcoming the progress on Sun, has pointed out how the private sector tries to use technical solutions for what are fundamentally social problems. De Schutter has called on countries committed to scaling up nutrition to begin by regulating the marketing of commercial infant formula and other breast-milk substitutes. He has also noted the tension between a strategy that promotes processed foods, enriched with nutrients to the point that diets become \"medicalised\", and one that promotes local and regional food systems, as well as a shift towards less heavily processed and more nutritious food.</p> <p>A chapter in the report, written by Marcos Arana Cede\u00f1o and Xaviera Cabada, cites the vigorous promotion of soft drinks on school premises in Mexico by companies \u2013 endorsed by many school authorities, which provide space for sales and advertising in exchange for school supplies or financial benefits. They note the serious problems in Mexico's regions with large indigenous populations, where obesity rates are growing faster within the poorest quintile.</p> <p>\"It is precisely in these indigenous regions where the most aggressive and unregulated marketing practices of sweetened soft drinks take place,\" the authors write. These practices include a 35% price cut, promotion in Spanish and indigenous languages, and numerous sales outlets within and around schools.</p> <p>Civil society groups are making themselves heard on the issues surrounding food security and hunger. After years of negotiations involving governments, international organisations and civil society groups <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/14/negotiators-consensus-global-land-governance-guidelines\" title=\"\">under the UN's Committee on World Food Security</a>. The body officially endorsed the <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/\" title=\"\">voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land, fisheries and forests</a> in the context of national food security.</p> <p>The guidelines promote secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, fisheries and forests as a means of eradicating hunger and poverty, supporting sustainable development and enhancing the environment. They contain provisions to protect local communities, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups from land speculation and land concentration.</p> <p>\"With the reform of the Committee on World Food Security, an innovative way of inclusive governance has been established. It has been a breakthrough for those civil society groups that traditionally have been excluded from decision-making processes on all levels,\" said Flavio Valente, secretary general of advocacy group Fian International.</p>",

Most of us haven't been lucky enough to dive on a reef but by using these tools, people will know what we mean by the beauty and diversity of our coral reefs.\"</p> <p>Around 50% of the world's coral reefs have been lost in the past 30 years to pollution, overfishing and climate change, which is increasing sea temperatures and elevating levels of ocean acidity. Coral reefs support the lives of millions of people worldwide and a quarter of the world's marine species, and are an important indicator of the health of the seas.</p> <p>Shallow reef surveys will involve scientists using state-of-the-art digital technology to capture images of the reef that can be linked to create a virtual dive experience. Automated technologies for rapidly assessing the amount of amount of coral cover and other life forms will provide a \"baseline\" for understanding change. The cameras for the shallow reef survey, the SVII, have been specially designed to take 360-degree, geolocated panoramic images every 4-6 seconds while travelling at 4kph.</p> <p>The deep reef survey will use diving robots and HD cameras to explore and reveal habitats that are rarely visited by humans. In ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef, more than 90% has not been explored because it is more than 40m \u2013 too deep for scuba divers.</p> <p>Scientists will use the deep survey to assess the potential for the deep reef to host \"refugee\" communities of species under stress because of bleaching and changes in the shallow reef due to climate change.</p> <p>They also hope to discover new species \u2013 a pilot study on Heron Island revealed a new species of pygmy seahorse and four new species of coral.</p> <p>\"This is a real opportunity to understand the story of climate change and natural ecosytems, Hoegh-Guldberg said. \"At the end of the three-year survey we will have an important snapshot and understanding of the state of coral reefs across the planet.\"</p> <p>All of the data gathered will be made public in a database called the Global Reef Record, a \"game-changing scientific tool\", according to Hoegh-Guldberg. \"We will be able to monitor change in marine environments now and in the future.

  "<p>Based on past form, the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is due to address the UN general assembly on Wednesday, will unleash a tirade against global governance sprinkled with theological lessons, insist on his country's nuclear rights, denounce sanctions and make incendiary statements on Israel.</p> <p>No matter how familiar his themes might sound, he can be confident that he still has the capacity to grab international headlines and stage an event that will cause both outrage and possibly some amusement in western circles.</p> <p>In his final year in office, the 56-year-old president has increasingly become a lame duck. And Wednesday's speech will probably be his last chance to exploit a high-profile international platform. Under Iranian law, Ahmadinejad cannot run for a third term and is due to stand down in June 2013.</p> <p>He appears to have surpassed himself with preparations, taking more than 100 people with him to the US, a move that has infuriated his critics back home and even caused uproar among the country's parliamentarians. Iranian MP Mansour Haghighatpour has criticised the president for his large entourage, saying that many have accompanied him to New York for \"a picnic\".</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's opponents in Iran are closely watching him in New York, wary of any impact his words might have on the future of their country, which is suffering from financial stringency owing to international isolation over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme.</p> <p>Conservatives suspect Ahmadinejad might use his UN appearance to bolster his political status in Iran by portraying a president still much in control. After suffering a series of setbacks in a power struggle, Ahmadinejad and his team have lost a great deal of influence over Iranian politics. The opposition is worried the president's UN speech might exacerbate the country's political and financial situation.</p> <p>Those watching outside have their eyes on any hint of a change in policy over Tehran's nuclear activities or its unwavering support for Syria's Bashar al-Assad's regime, subjects that are likely to be mentioned in his speech.</p> <p>On the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad may choose to highlight the recent assassinations of a handful of Iranian scientists, attempting to portray Iran as a victim of a western-led campaign against his country's advances in science and technology.</p> <p>Last year, Ahmadinejad caused uproar and provoked a diplomatic walkout by referring to 9/11 as a \"mysterious\" incident that he said was used by the US as a pretext to attack Afghanistan and Iraq. At the time, he also reprimanded the US for killing Osama bin Laden without putting him on trial and then burying his body at sea.</p> <p>\"By using their imperialistic media network, which is under the influence of colonialism, they threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the September 11 event with sanctions and military actions,\" he said then.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's earlier remarks in New York this week, which can hint at the range of subjects he might touch on in his speech, include issues such as the country's nuclear negotiations, the threat of an Israeli military strike, Syria and an Islamophobic film that has triggered protests across the Muslim world.</p> <p>On the threat of war from Israel, Ahmadinejad said his country did not take them seriously. \"We have all the defensive means at our disposal and we are ready to defend ourselves,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite a plea this week by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who warned the Iranian president recently to avoid \"incendiary rhetoric\", Ahmadinejad has again used his New York visit to make strongly worded statements about Israel, saying the country had no roots in the Middle East and would be \"eliminated\".</p> <p>A White House spokesman reacted by describing his comments as \"characteristically disgusting, offensive and outrageous\".</p> <p>Ahmadinejad gave an interview with AP on Tuesday in which he spoke of a world where a \"new order\" would inevitably replace the era of what he called US bullying.</p> <p>Earlier in his trip, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, he was questioned on his views on homosexuality. Ahmadinejad said: \"I'm sorry. Let me ask you this. Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality? Homosexuality ceases procreation. Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly, and others do not accept your behaviour, that they're denying your freedom?\"</p> <p>In another interview, when asked about an Iranian institute raising the bounty on Salman Rushdie, Ahmadinejad responded: \"Salman Rushdie, where is he now? \u2026 There is no news of him. Is he in the United States? If he is in the US, you shouldn't broadcast that, for his own safety.\"</p> <p>It is perhaps unsurprising then that also accompanying Ahmadinejad's visit to New York have been near-constant demonstrations in front of his hotel and at the UN headquarters.</p>",
  "<p>Modern pop is built on the denial of time. Reunions extend into the distance; the way we now listen to music means that songs from the distant past constantly jostle with songs from the present. With the increasing number of pop veterans, there is an inevitable fondness for nipping and tucking away the signs of their advancing years and inviting audiences into a huge suspension of disbelief \u2013 for a moment it can once more be 1956, or 1967, or 1989 \u2026</p> <p>Now and again, though, an occasion arrives that decisively reminds us how old post-Elvis popular culture now is \u2013 5 October is the 50th birthday of the Beatles' first single, released back when Harold Macmillan was the PM, and the Cuban missile crisis was only weeks away.</p> <p>\"Love Me Do\" sounds like the world in which it was made: tentative, still feeling the pinch of post-war austerity. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/sep/08/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Ian MacDonald</a>'s wonderful song-by-song history of the group, <em>Revolution in the Head</em>, reckoned that the song's \"modal gauntness\" is subtly cunning, serving notice of the Beatles' \"unvarnished honesty\", and \u2013 via John Lennon's wailing harmonica part \u2013 the \"blunt vitality\" of their native Liverpool. In the surviving Beatles' own account, the huge <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_Anthology_(book)\" title=\"\"><em>Anthology</em></a>, Paul McCartney recalls that the song was meant to sound hard and authentic: \"blues\" rather than \"la de da de la\".</p> <p>Many Beatles books barely mention \"Love Me Do\" at all. But there it is: a number 17 hit, long rumoured to have been propelled into the charts thanks to bulk-buying by manager <a href=\"http://www.brianepstein.com/\" title=\"\">Brian Epstein</a>. If, like me, one of your first experiences of Beatles music was the collection <em>1962-66</em> (known as \"The Red Album\", as against <em>1967-70</em> \"The Blue Album\"), you will probably have experienced it as a strangely muted opening to a listening experience that quickly flared into spectacular life: a prologue, rather than a first chapter proper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396670471\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2012/9/25/1348589778420/The-Beatles-Anthology.jpg\" alt=\"Beatles, The Beatles Anthology\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beatles, The Beatles Anthology</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Beatles' second single, \"Please Please Me\", was released in January 1963, in the midst of a legendarily biting British winter, to which its giddy sound was an antidote. \"Congratulations, Gentlemen, you've just made your first number one,\" said<a href=\"http://www.georgemartinmusic.com/\" title=\"\"> their producer, George Martin</a>. And he was right. By early the following year, their songs were crowding the US charts, and they were about to play to 73 million Americans on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em>. Once again, they were adopted as a panacea for cold and grim times \u2013 this time less a matter of the weather than the pall cast by the murder of President Kennedy. Only two years later, they would reach the apex of their fame, chased around the Deep South by fundamentalist Christians outraged by John Lennon's claim that they were \"bigger than Jesus\", while their music took on the textures and expanded horizons traceable \u2013 at least in part \u2013 to Lennon and George Harrison's use of LSD.</p> <p>Such is the remarkable pace of a story that has been told by scores of writers, a story about four young musicians but no end of other things: the cities of Liverpool, Hamburg and London; class, and the shaking of English hierarchies; pop's transmutation into a global culture; and the western world's passage from a world still defined by the second world war and its aftermath, to the accelerated modernity we know today. Everything in the tale pulses with significance and drama. It seems barely believable, and in the best Beatles books, it still burns.</p> <p><a href=\"http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Philip-Norman/18228509/\" title=\"\">Philip Norman's <em>Shout!</em></a> was first published in 1981, and remains a glorious example of how to write about music, while also writing about much more. Of the Beatles in the mid-1960s, and their phenomenal success a mere three years or so after \"Love Me Do\" appeared, he wrote this:</p> <p>\"Only in ancient times, when boy emperors and pharaohs were clothed, even fed with pure gold, had very young men commanded an equivalent adoration, fascination and constant, expectant scrutiny. Nor could anyone suppose that to be thus \u2013 to have such youth, and wealth, such clothes and cars and servants and cars \u2013 made for any state other than inconceivable happiness. For no one since the boy pharoahs \u2026 had known, as the Beatles now knew, how it felt to have felt everything, done everything, tasted everything, had a surfeit of everything; to live on that blinding, deadening, numbing surfeit which made each, on bad days, think he was ageing at twice the usual rate.\"</p> <p>Thanks to an obsession that began when a babysitter played me a Beatles record around the time of my fifth birthday, I own 67 books about the band (before I wrote this article, I counted them). They range from the crass and moronic, via the comically arcane, to the serious and brilliant. Among them, there is an American volume titled <em>The Walrus Was Paul</em>, all about the insane late 60s conspiracy theory in which McCartney had been dead since 1966 and secretly replaced by a doppelganger. If I'm feeling really masochistic, I occasionally pick up <em>The Day John Met Paul</em>, an absurd and thoroughly speculative minute-by-minute account&#xa0;of the day in 1957 when Lennon first encountered McCartney at a church fete.</p> <p>I treasure an American hardback of <em>The Longest Cocktail Party</em>, the memoir of a long-lost American called Richard DiLello, who worked for the Beatles' doomed and decadent Apple company as a PR assistant and \"house hippy\". And at least once a year, I reread Barry Miles's <em>Many Years From Now</em>, an account of McCartney's 60s that, thanks to voluminous input from its subject, reads more like a memoir, and a brittle one at that. Every few pages, McCartney decides to pick a Lennon-McCartney composition, and then specify each of their contributions: \"In My Life\", long assumed to be Lennon's work alone, was \"my melody \u2026 my guitar riff\"; when it comes to \"Ticket to Ride\", \"because John sang it, you might have to give him 60% of it.\"</p> <p>That book was a transparent response to the posthumous Lennon industry, the most compelling product of which is <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1321776.Lennon_Remembers\" title=\"\"><em>Lennon Remembers</em></a>, the full transcript of the 1970 interview he granted to the founder of Rolling Stone magazine, Jann Wenner. <em>Lennon Remembers</em> is defined by the bitterness and candour of a mind trying to make sense of Norman's \"deadening surfeit\", lashing out at former colleagues and associates, and describing the distance between the good clean fun portrayed by just about every newspaper journalist who travelled with them, and what actually happened. \"When we hit town, we hit it,\" he told Wenner. \"We were not pissing about. There's photographs of me crawling about in Amsterdam on my knees, coming out of whorehouses and things like that. And people saying [cheerfully]: 'Good morning, John.'\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396670472\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2012/9/25/1348589623765/The-Beatles-The-Authorised-B.jpg\" alt=\"Hunter Davies, The Beatles: The Authorised Biography\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunter Davies, The Beatles: The Authorised Biography</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time the interview happened, there were only two Beatles books of any quality. Hunter Davies's authorised biography was published in 1968, admirably researched and brimming with access \u2013 but stymied by his artless&#xa0;prose, and the constraints of being the band's in-house writer. There was also the Penguin paperback <em>Love Me Do: The Beatles' Progress</em>, written by&#xa0;the New Yorker Michael Braun through 1963 and early 1964. \"That was&#xa0;a true book,\" Lennon told Wenner.&#xa0;\"He wrote about how we were, which was bastards \u2026 You have to be a bastard to make it, man. That's a fact, and the Beatles were the biggest bastards on earth.\"</p> <p>Braun was a former assistant to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/stanleykubrick\" title=\"\">Stanley Kubrick</a>, and a writer whose work appeared in the Observer and the Sunday Times (he died in 1997; one of his obituaries described him as \"a penniless fl\u00e2neur\", drawn to people whose&#xa0;\"personal mythology was not limited by prosaic biographical fact\"). Contrary to Lennon's picture, his book \u2013 a tour diary, essentially, which follows them around provincial England, on to Paris and New York \u2013 largely offers a close-up of the Beatles as you might expect it: witty, blunt, quickly breaking out of the drab conventions of British showbiz.</p> <p>He evokes ordinary places witnessing quite extraordinary scenes, in incisively simple terms: in the north-east of England, for example, he keeps the Beatles company in yet another hotel, watching them do a phone interview with a DJ in far-away Melbourne, while a gaggle of fans looks up at the window. \"When the call was finished,\" Braun wrote, \"they turned the lights out and spent a few minutes looking at the girls through a slit in the curtains before going to bed. The next morning as the Beatles left Sunderland several girls were still gathered in front of the hotel, huddling against the winds blowing from the North Sea.\" This is what is so compelling about those early treks around provincial theatres and ballrooms: moments of quiet, when the band seemed to marvel at what was happening to them; and the sense of an extended goodbye (by the autumn of 1966, they had stopped touring altogether).</p> <p>Davies's book pushed an approved vision of unbroken brotherhood just as the Beatles began to come to grief. There was then a period of publishing quiet, until in the wake of Lennon's murder in 1980, Hamish Hamilton published <em>Shout!</em>, and thereby planted the seed of serious Beatles biography and commentary \u2013 arguably, of serious writing about pop in general. <em>Shout!</em> predated <a href=\"http://rockcriticsarchives.com/interviews/stanleybooth/stanleybooth.html\" title=\"\">Stanley Booth's equally accomplished <em>The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones</em></a> by three years, and <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v09/n03/danny-karlin/it-aint-him-babe\" title=\"\">Robert Shelton's flawed Dylan biography <em>No Direction Home</em> </a>by five. Perhaps because its triumph lies less in its evocation of the music than its sure grasp of how amazing the Beatles story was, and how important they were as representatives of their age, it has rather been passed over by music writers \u2013 but it is a great book.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, I spoke to Norman about the task he had faced. \"The idea of writing a proper book that happened to be about a pop group \u2026 no one had really tried it,\" he said. \"And it's a very hard thing to do. You're dealing with so much dross: you have to say things like: 'The record went to number three in the charts.' How do you say that in a literate sentence? Also, relating what happened to a performer to what was happening in the world is difficult to do, without sounding ridiculous. You skate a line between treating your subject-matter seriously, and ridiculously over-seriously. English writers tend to be flippant; American writers can be almost funereal.\"</p> <p><em>Shout!</em> arrived just as rock's golden years became distant enough to be properly considered (Norman's biographies of the Rolling Stones, Elton John and Lennon were to follow). In its wake came a trickle of Beatles books, until another game-changing work appeared in 1994: <em>Revolution in the Head</em>, a triumph of musical and cultural scholarship. MacDonald was an alumnus of the New Musical Express but was no rock hack; he had already published <em>The New Shostakovich</em>.</p> <p><em>Revolution in the Head</em> is one of those books that can be reread endlessly. I tend to pick it up at least every couple of months, alight on its analysis of Beatles songs to which I haven't listened for a while, and then go to the music. Even comparative makeweights are rigorously examined, and so given renewed allure: \"Things We Said Today\" is built from \"strident dramatic contrasts\"; \"Hey Bulldog\" is \"menacingly pointed (possibly at McCartney)\"; more straightforwardly, Harrison's \"Old Brown Shoe\" is praised as \"an archetypal B-side from an era when B-sides were worth flipping a single for\". All of it only underlines what a loss MacDonald was to writing: after a long spell of depression, he killed himself in August 2003.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396670469\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2012/9/25/1348589535686/Revolution-in-the-Head-The-B.jpg\" alt=\"Ian MacDonald, Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian MacDonald, Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fortuitously, <em>Revolution in the Head</em> arrived in the first phase of so-called Britpop, when worship of the Beatles became almost compulsory. Books about them began appearing by the dozen \u2013 often cheap, nasty and pointless.</p> <p>There are, thankfully, exceptions. Thanks to a tip from the writer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonsavage\" title=\"\">Jon Savage</a>, I now own <em>Magic Circles: The Beatles in Dream and History</em> by the self-styled \"independent scholar\" from Brooklyn Devin McKinney. Stylistically, it takes its lead from the Rolling Stone writer and pop theorist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/feb/17/greil-marcus-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Greil Marcus</a>. McKinney's book is often maddening and silly, but when he's good, he's very good. Of the Beatles' output in 1966, he writes: \"Virtually every piece of music they put their hands to this year comes out in some way twisted, acerbic, jagged.\" That year's <em>Revolver</em>, he says, was \"the first Beatle album to find itself in the dark, not the light\".</p> <p>When the band covered material by American rock'n'rollers, the key to what made their versions different was this: \"They were interested in stripping a song to its parts, exposing its frame, then retooling it with what was theirs: a group dynamic, a oneness of instruments and voices that made four discrete noises into one great noise, a syncopation of chaos; and a driving quality of hysteria.\" That captures well the Beatles' renditions of songs by Little Richard and Chuck Berry, but it also sums up the 100mph brilliance of such watershed records as \"She Loves You\" and \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" \u2013 all energy and irresistible joy.</p> <p>Now, two more significant, serious works are on the way: an anthology of John Lennon's letters, edited by Hunter Davies, and the first of a three-volume biography of the band by <a href=\"http://www.beatlesbible.com/forum/beatles-books/the-beatles-complete-story-biography-mark-lewisohn/page-2/\" title=\"\">Mark Lewisohn, the Beatles expert </a>responsible for two consummate reference books: <em>The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions</em>, and the even more exhaustive <em>Complete Beatles Chronicle</em>, a day-by-day account of their career, full of descriptions of their pharaonic lives.</p> <p>Lewisohn has been working on volume one of his biography for close to a decade: he, his agent and his publisher will say very little about when it will be published, though there are reliable indications that it will appear next year.</p> <p>Its author, incidentally, is present and correct in <em>Shout!</em>, as a Beatles-fixated eight-year-old in his native Pinner \u2013 a reminder that as well as endlessly sparking the intellect, Beatles music works more basic wonders. Page 78 portrays Lewisohn at home in 1967, listening to the album which confirmed that in the five years since the release of \"Love Me Do\", the Beatles and their art had been transformed: as <em>Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> blared from indoors, he \"stood in the garden as it played, shaking his head wildly while trying not to dislodge the cardboard moustache under his nose\".</p>",
  "<p>London 2012 was a remarkable success story, and it belongs to everyone: from our inspirational torchbearers and indefatigable volunteers, to the ground-breaking British companies who delivered the Olympic Park and the record-breaking British athletes who delivered on our medal goals.</p> <p>It is also a shining example of what this country can achieve when we work together. For government, it has shown the extraordinary power of uniting behind a single vision.</p> <p>For the staff working on the Games in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and across government, London 2012 has been about much more than a single summer of sport and celebration; it has been the culmination of a decade of hard work and dedication.</p> <p>It has also illustrated the best of our modern civil service; one defined by leadership, flexibility, a clear and defined purpose and commitment to striving for and achieving success. The skills we developed and honed from working on the Games is already feeding into current projects and plans at the department as we become a leaner, more efficient organisation.</p> <p>While the DCMS has been in ultimate charge of London 2012 since we prepared our bid, around 20 government departments have had direct responsibility for delivering the Games and their legacy of lasting benefits nationwide.</p> <p>We have also forged a uniquely effective partnership between the public and private sectors.

  "<p>Students today are living in truly exciting times. With a shrinking world and a global economy, they are destined to spend their adult lives communicating and working alongside colleagues across the world. Schools recognise the significance and benefits of teaming with a school from another country and forming strong international links. From learning about languages and food to getting to meet their international peers in person \u2013 the benefits, it seems, are colossal.</p> <p>Since the advent of technologies such as Skype, schools like <a href=\"http://www.boughton-monchelsea.kent.sch.uk/international_links\">Boughton Monchelsea Primary</a>, Kent has utilised its potential for positive communication that really impacts. Teacher Matt Wills said: \"Being able to communicate directly means our students have been able to discuss issues and debates that are important to them. We did some research on how children from other nations were feeling about the Olympics, for example. This really sparked discussion and challenged perceptions.\" </p> <p>Wills says the school has been using technologies to communicate with its partner schools in Vienna and Germany for almost a decade now. \"We've used Skype which is great, but <a href=\"http://flashmeeting.e2bn.net/about.html\">Flash Meeting</a> has enabled us to actually talk to several other schools at once. What's really fun too is having sports events and competitions across schools; we might see how far children can throw, for instance, and compare our data with others doing the same event on the same day.\"</p> <p>At Boughton Monchelsea the catchment is fairly middle-class and somewhat lacking in diversity, but Wills and the other teachers are determined that the children there will learn about respect and acceptance from the schools they partner with both in the UK (they have a connection with a school in urban Liverpool) and in Europe. \"We want the children here to learn that they are a part of the larger European community, not just the small one in which they live. While we have children from year 5 visit other schools in Europe each year, the growing technology enables a whole-school approach to learning from the partnerships,\" he explains.</p> <p>It's not all about using the newest of technologies though. Sending school work examples, writing letters and posting CDs also claim an important role in all of this. And for those itching for a more hands-on experience, visits to an international partner school can prove life changing.<br>Kate Burns, headteacher of <a href=\"http://www.kingswayprimary.com/\">Kingsway Primary School</a>, Nottinghamshire, has had staff visiting partner schools in both Spain and Mexico and Spanish and Mexican colleagues visiting her school in return. For Burns these visits are about opening minds and learning about teaching from a global perspective. \"We love sharing ideas and genuinely learn from this. Our connection with these schools is imperative to us all,\" she explains.</p> <p>In Southport, year 6 pupils from <a href=\"http://www.linakerschool.co.uk/\">Linaker Primary School trek</a> off to China every year. Head teacher Colin Coleman said: \"About 60 to 70% of these children have never left the UK. And here they are, engaging directly with their Chinese peers. We have a different theme each year. This year it was the Olympics, next year it's going to be a creative-based theme. They work on their topic together with the children in the Chinese school.\"</p> <p>One of the more demonstrable advantages of having an international link lies in language learning. At Kingsway you'll find four year-olds practising their Spanish. Burns said: \"We teach Spanish from reception. We think it's essential that our children have the opportunity to speak a second language.\"</p> <p>Kingsway is not on its own. At <a href=\"http://www.tavistockcollege.devon.sch.uk/\">Tavistock College</a> in Devon the school has an active connection with a school in Japan, born from a desire to support students who were learning Japanese. The children not only get to practise their language skills with their Japanese peers but gain a broader perspective of Japanese culture and life.</p> <p>There's plenty of lessons in altruism to be learned too, especially for schools working with counterparts in war-torn or poverty-stricken regions. The <a href=\"http://www.kampalachildren.org/about/story-so-far/\">Kampala Children's Centre</a> in Uganda supports children who have been left orphaned or injured and a governor from <a href=\"http://trafford.schooljotter.com/limetree\">Lime Tree Primary School</a> in Trafford, touched by their work, began fundraising for them. Subsequently he invited their choir to perform at the school. That was two years ago and since that day Lime Tree has developed a firm, meaningful and mutually beneficial connection.</p> <p>Spokeswoman for the school, Heather Bradshaw, said: \"Our children fundraise for them, and as they've met many of the children in person, they have a true understanding of how they're helping. We encourage the children to compare and contrast what they've got with that of the children at the children's centre. We think about their learning environment, their classrooms and play areas and compare with what we have. This has been particularly on our minds recently as we're in the middle of a re-build. Essentially we're encouraging our children to be open-minded, reflective and respectful.\"</p> <p>For Jane Girt, deputy headteacher at <a href=\"http://www.tongschool.co.uk/\">Tong High School</a> in Bradford, linking with an international school is no flash in the pan. The school's relationship with Masaka Senior School in Uganda is now in its seventh year. Jane said: \"We received funding from the <a href=\"http://schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org/\">British Council</a> under <a href=\"http://schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org/programmes-and-funding/linking-programmes-worldwide/connecting-classrooms\">Connecting Classrooms</a>. This funding has finished now, but we'll strive to keep our strong connection going.\"</p> <p>Connecting Classrooms is a programme currently operating in more than 50 countries. The goal is to promote school partnerships and professional development courses, and the chance to share successful planning and teaching methods with international counterparts. It's this element, of sharing good practice and professional expertise, that Girt says is crucial: \"As well as sending learning resources and plans and vice versa, our students have embarked on joint projects with the students in Uganda. They've done environmental projects together and further work on other pertinent issues, such as poverty, famine and the best use of world resources.\"</p> <p>So, what for the future of international links? In our globalised society, where working collaboratively across the world is a reality, surely bringing this international emphasis to education has never been more crucial.</p> <p>Coleman from Linaker Primary said: \"A decade ago there were two children at our school for whom English was an additional language. Now there are 148. Our world is getting smaller. Diversity is just a normal and wonderful part of life. The international links serve to extend and reconfirm all of this.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"What the children learn is that we're all really just quite similar.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://2012.coop/en/un-international-year\" title=\"\">UN's International Year of Co-operatives</a> reaches its climax next month with two high-profile events which \u2013 if they work as their organisers hope \u2013 could see the co-operative movement globally set on a radical programme of change.</p> <p>The major Canadian co-operative bank and insurer <a href=\"http://www.desjardins.com/en/\" title=\"\">Desjardins</a> is hosting the <a href=\"http://www.2012intlsummit.coop/\" title=\"\">2012 International Summit of Co-operatives</a> in its home city of Qu\u00e9bec. The conference, taking place from 9 to 11 October, has lined up a formidable list of participants from co-ops around the world, with the emphasis focused on how the co-operative business model can more successfully challenge conventional business. Desjardins' president and chief executive Monique Leroux is upbeat about the prospects. \"Co-operatives are part of the solution in establishing a more solid economic and financial system,\" she says. \"Co-operative and mutual enterprise is the financial business model of the future and the key to sustainable prosperity.\"</p> <p>Desjardins has commissioned a series of <a href=\"http://www.2012intlsummit.coop/site/summit-program/studies\" title=\"\">independent studies</a> on aspects of co-operative management, including a major report from consultancy firm <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/\" title=\"\">McKinsey</a>. McKinsey's findings, to be unveiled on 10 October, are expected to identify co-operatives' strengths relative to PLCs, and areas of organisational and managerial weakness. A separate study, undertaken by <a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/index.htm\" title=\"\">Deloitte</a>, will explore issues around co-operative financial and capitalisation, a major area of debate in co-operative circles in recent years.</p> <p>Co-operatives work very closely with mutual businesses in francophone Canada, and the Qu\u00e9bec summit will also provide an opportunity for the <a href=\"http://2012.coop/welcome\" title=\"\">International Co-operative Alliance (ICA)</a> to announce its plans to bring mutuals more closely into the co-op family internationally. Dame Pauline Green, the past chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.uk.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operatives UK</a> and current ICA president, will introduce a joint declaration of co-operatives and mutuals, which will be launched at the end of the event.</p> <p>Also on the agenda are discussions on, among other things, improving co-operative governance, on ways of integrating co-operative values into management practice, and closer alliances between co-operative businesses.</p> <p>Manchester takes over from Qu\u00e9bec three weeks later when the very ambitious <a href=\"http://www.manchester2012.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operatives United</a> event will occupy Manchester Central, the city's main conference hall complex, from 29 October to 2 November. Co-operatives United, which is a joint initiative of Co-operatives UK, <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\" title=\"\">the Co-operative Group</a> and the ICA, is a multi-headed beast of an event, including a co-op trade fair, stalls and workshops as well as an exhibition on the theme of co-operative living. The annual UK Co-operative congress also piggybacks on the event, on 1 November.</p> <p>However it will be the ICA general assembly, taking place in Manchester on 31 October, that will decide how the movement internationally carries forward the impetus which the 2012 year has given. The plan, according to ICA director-general <a href=\"http://charlesgould.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Chuck Gould</a>, is to convert one year of activity into ten. \"Co-operators are doing something with 'our Year' that others haven't done with theirs. We are attempting to leverage it from a Year into a Decade,\" he told his blog followers earlier this month. By 2020, he hopes, co-operatives will have become the preferred way for new businesses to be created.</p> <p>This ambitious proposal will be presented to the ICA general assembly in the form of the Blueprint for a Co-operative Decade, a detailed strategic plan for the ICA and the broader co-op movement. This document, prepared by a ICA work group and written by Cliff Mills and Will Davies from the <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/MEOB\" title=\"\">Centre for Mutual and Employee-owned Business</a> at the University of Oxford, addresses some of the issues which are currently problematic for co-ops. Action is proposed to improve member engagement and corporate governance and to strengthen the idea of what precisely constitutes a co-operative. A third aim is to work to improve the legislative frameworks under which co-operatives operate in different countries.</p> <p>The blueprint also picks up recent work on the need for more diverse sources of capital for co-operatives, under the slogan \"secure reliable co-operative capital while guaranteeing member control\". The blueprint recognises that the inability of co-ops to access conventional equity can limit growth. (Indeed some co-operatives worldwide have chosen to establish part-controlled publicly quoted trading companies to overcome this problem, representing a potentially significant weakening of the co-operative ethos). The blueprint calls for new financial instruments which attract investor capital but which \"do not impair or undermine the co-operative nature of the entity\". The proposal is extremely timely, though quite how this trick can be pulled off is by no means clear.</p> <p>The fifth and final area for strategic focus, according to the blueprint, is in relation to sustainability, the aim being to position co-operatives as businesses which are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. This part of the blueprint links directly to another issue on the ICA general assembly's agenda, that of the proposal to rewrite the last of the seven internationally agreed <a href=\"http://2012.coop/en/what-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles\" title=\"\">Co-operative Principles</a>. The seventh principle is the nearest the co-operative movement gets to any sort of ethical statement, and is at present embarrassingly weak, simply asserting that \"co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members\". The move to toughen up this wording was first proposed at the ICA general assembly last year and delegates this year will be told how the ICA plans to carry this work forward.</p> <p>The blueprint for a \"Co-operative Decade\" represents the first concerted attempt for a generation to rebuild the international co-operative movement on a platform which is both business-focused and ethical. Although the work group has had representation from Canada, Kenya and China, there is a clear sense of strong UK input. Indeed it could be argued that the blueprint is trying to achieve globally the same cultural and organisational reform of the co-operative movement which the 2000-2001 Co-operative Commission was instrumental in bringing about in Britain.</p> <p>There are, however, plenty of other issues bubbling under which may emerge at Qu\u00e9bec and Manchester. One is potentially controversial: it is whether co-operatives should endorse a maximum pay differential between their highest and lowest paid workers. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's recent proposal to limit pay differentials to 1:20 in the French public sector makes this highly topical. Another is the suggestion that co-ops should endorse good working practices for their employees by signing up en masse to the core labour standards adopted by the UN's <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">International Labour Organisation</a>.</p> <p>There are certainly plenty of less than ethical goings-on in some co-operatives worldwide which should shame the movement. Nevertheless there is a real sense that things are moving forward in the once almost moribund world of international cooperation. As the blueprint puts it, \"rarely has the argument in favour of co-operatives looked stronger than it does in 2012. But unless there is concerted action over the next few years, the moment will be lost. By 2020, we need to be able to look back on 2012 as representing a turning point for the co-operative movement.\"</p> <p><em>Andrew Bibby is a professional writer and journalist</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The assertion that wind turbines don't reduce carbon emissions is a myth, according to conclusive statistical data obtained from National Grid and analysed here in the Guardian for the first time. With a new wind generation record of 4,131 megawatts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/uk-windfarms-generate-record-power\" title=\"\">set on 14 September</a>, the question of how far the UK's wind generation fleet can help in meeting our climate targets is increasingly controversial. Now it can be shown that the sceptics who lobby against wind simply have their facts wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396694042\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348585747104/Wind-power-replacing-gas--001.jpg\" alt=\"Wind power replacing gas-fired electricity Sep \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wind power replacing gas-fired electricity Sep </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 14 September, wind turbines connected to the National Grid produced over 80 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity, just over 10% of total UK generation. This was far from being a one-off: with more than 4,000 turbines both on and offshore now connected to the grid, wind produced 48 GWh of usable electricity per day on average during September, adding up to about 6% of overall daily national electricity requirement. On many days, wind is now the fourth-largest source of UK electricity, after coal, nuclear and gas. Indeed, this figure is a significant underestimate, because about two gigawatts of wind are connected directly to local networks and so not directly visible to National Grid.</p> <p>However, according to increasingly vocal critics of wind power, the intermittent nature of wind generation means we must burn more gas to provide backup. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/9468604/The-great-wind-delusion-has-hijacked-our-energy-policy.html\" title=\"\">According to Telegraph columnist Christopher Booker</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Ramping the back-up gas plants up and down would mean running them very inefficiently, and give off so much CO2 that we could end up increasing our overall emissions rather than reducing them\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Journalist and author <a href=\"http://rationaloptimist.com/blog/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-wind.aspx\" title=\"\">Matt Ridley asserts</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The total carbon emissions saved by the great wind rush is probably below 1%, because of the need to keep fossil fuels burning as back-up when the wind does not blow. It may even be a negative number.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The climate-sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) recently gave evidence to the House of Commons energy and climate change committee, <a href=\"http://www.thegwpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Hughes-Evidence.pdf\" title=\"\">stating</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There is a significant risk that annual CO2 emissions could be greater under the wind scenario than under the gas scenario\". </p> </blockquote> <p>The essence of the wind sceptics' case is that a scaling up in wind power will have to be \"backed up\" by massive investment in gas-fired open cycle turbine (OCGT) plants, which are cheap to build but considerably less efficient than the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants which deliver the vast majority of the UK's gas-fired electricity supply.</p> <p>Their arguments are not borne out by current statistics, however. If the sceptics were right, the recent windy conditions would have seen considerable use of less-efficient OCGT as wind input to the grid ramped up and down. In actual fact, during the entire June-September period, OCGTs and equally dirty oil-fired stations produced less than one hundredth of one percent of all UK electricity. In total they operated for a grand total of just nine half hour periods in the first 19 days of the month \u2013 and these periods had nothing to do with changing windspeeds.</p> <p>From analysing <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlKCs3nBXhgZdFkxYzc4VVpwQ0ZsenNocVVkTnNCUXc\" title=\"\">National Grid data of more than 4,000 half-hour periods over the last three months</a>, a strong correlation between windiness and a reduction in gas-fired generation becomes clear. The exchange rate is about one for one: a megawatt hour of wind typically meant the UK grid used one less megawatt hour of gas-derived electricity. This means that actual CO2 savings can be calculated from the data with a high degree of accuracy \u2013 these are not guesstimates from models, but observations of real-world data.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396694043\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348585824856/Wind-generation-v-gas-gen-001.jpg\" alt=\"Wind generation v gas generation\" width=\"460\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wind generation v gas generation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over a year, based on the amount of electricity wind is currently generating each day, wind turbines save around 6.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide, or about 4% of the UK's emissions from electricity (based on CCGT plants emitting around 350 kg CO2 per mWh). This figure provides independent confirmation for the trade body RenewableUK's <a href=\"http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/\" title=\"\">estimate</a> of a current reduction in annual emissions from the entire UK wind fleet of about 6m tonnes.</p> <p>Looking to the future, about 26 gigawatts of onshore and offshore wind is expected to be connected to the grid by 2020, nearly four times today's capacity. Even so, National Grid expects to be able to handle the increased wind generation without major new investment in dirty open-cycle gas backup, contradicting the claims from the GWPF.</p> <p>The National Grid's Gillian West says:</p> <blockquote> <p>As more wind connects, there will be a need for additional back-up for that intermittency ... [however] there will be more <a href=\"http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Operating+in+2020/\" title=\"\">interconnection with mainland Europe</a> and new storage technologies may also emerge (eg battery) or additional pumped storage hydro which can provide short term response.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/may/25/wind-power-national-grid-forecasting\" title=\"\">National Grid is also improving its wind forecasting system</a> to make coping with times of low demand and high generation easier.</p> <p>Indeed, the wind sceptics may have their case backwards. The biggest blackout risk is not intermittent wind but the threat of total loss of a single giant power source, such as a large coal or nuclear plant, possibly within just a few seconds. But the grid is already engineered to withstand this catastrophic loss with existing back-up \u2013 and wind is unlikely to change this picture for the foreseeable future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396694044\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348585873060/Wind-generation-v-gas-201-001.jpg\" alt=\"Wind generation v gas 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wind generation v gas 2012</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The intermittency of wind is balanced both by the inertia of the turbines themselves and by multiple wind installations over a wide geographical area. In addition, wind is now forecasted with reasonable accuracy at least a day in advance, allowing National Grid to plan the right generation mix to accompany it. Indeed, the most difficult issues for the Grid come from the demand side \u2013 commercial breaks in Downton Abbey can lead to sudden demand spikes of hundreds of megawatts in just a few seconds. Wind, in contrast, fades up and down much more slowly.</p> <p>The researcher Damon Hart-Davis, who maintains a real-time website showing the grid's carbon intensity called <a href=\"http://www.earth.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Earth Notes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.earth.org.uk/note-on-UK-grid-CO2-intensity-vs-WIND-records-Sep-2012.html\" title=\"\">confirms separately</a> that when the wind is blowing the UK emits less CO2 per unit of electricity generated. This is much more visible currently than it has been in previous years because wind is now a significant enough player to stand out from the statistical noise, which include electricity produced by Welsh pumped-storage hydroelectricity and imports and exports from France, Holland and Ireland.</p> <p>The UK may be the windiest country in Europe, but other nations already have much greater installed capacity. Spain, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/09/spain-national-record-power-windfarms\" title=\"\">occasionally produces 50% of its power from wind turbines</a> with no impact on its electricity grid.</p> <p>Continued fast expansion in offshore and onshore wind is good news for carbon emissions and can be accommodated without major problems by the grid. Data, not assertions, are what must win the argument over wind \u2013 and the data is very clear.</p>",
  "<p>Climate change is already contributing to the deaths of nearly 400,000 people a year and costing the world more than $1.2 trillion, wiping 1.6% annually from global GDP, according to a new study.</p> <p>The impacts are being felt most keenly in developing countries, according to the research, where damage to agricultural production from extreme weather linked to climate change is contributing to deaths from malnutrition, poverty and their associated diseases.</p> <p>Air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels is also separately contributing to the deaths of at least 4.5m people a year, the report found.</p> <p>The 331-page study, entitled Climate Vulnerability Monitor: A Guide to the Cold Calculus of A Hot Planet and published on Wednesday, was carried out by the <a href=\"http://daraint.org/\" title=\"\">DARA group</a>, a non-governmental organisation based in Europe, and the <a href=\"http://daraint.org/climate-vulnerability-monitor/climate-vulnerable-forum/\" title=\"\">Climate Vulnerable Forum</a>. It was written by more than 50 scientists, economists and policy experts, and commissioned by 20 governments.</p> <p>By 2030, the researchers estimate, the cost of climate change and air pollution combined will rise to 3.2% of global GDP, with the world's least developed countries forecast to bear the brunt, suffering losses of up to 11% of their GDP.</p> <p>Sheikh Hasina, prime minister of Bangladesh, said: \"A 1C rise in temperature [temperatures have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/21/does-small-rise-temperatures-matter\" title=\"\">already risen by 0.7C globally since the end of the 19th century</a>] is associated with 10% productivity loss in farming. For us, it means losing about 4m tonnes of food grain, amounting to about $2.5bn. That is about 2% of our GDP. Adding up the damages to property and other losses, we are faced with a total loss of about 3-4% of GDP. Without these losses, we could have easily secured much higher growth.\"</p> <p>But major economies will also take a hit, as extremes of weather and the associated damage \u2013 droughts, floods and more severe storms \u2013 could wipe 2% of the GDP of the US by 2030, while similar effects could cost China $1.2tr by the same date.</p> <p>While many governments have taken the view that climate change is a long-term problem, there is a growing body of opinion that the effects are already being felt. Scientists have been alarmed by the increasingly rapid melting of Arctic sea ice, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">which reached a new record minimum this year</a> and, if melting continues at similar rates, could be ice free in summer by the end of the decade. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/14/met-office-arctic-sea-ice-loss-winter\" title=\"\">Some research suggests</a> that this melting could be linked to cold, dull and rainy summers in parts of Europe \u2013 such as has been the predominant summer weather in the UK for the last six years. In the US, this year's severe drought has raised food prices and in India the disruption to the monsoon has caused widespread damage to farmers.</p> <p>Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's climate chief, warned that extreme weather was becoming more common, as the effects of climate change take hold. \"Climate change and weather extremes are not about a distant future,\" she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/extreme-weather-new-normal-climate-change\" title=\"\">wrote in a comment for the Guardian last week</a>. \"Formerly one-off extreme weather episodes seem to be becoming the new normal.\"</p> <p>Michael Zammit Cutajar, former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: \"Climate change is not just a distant threat but a present danger \u2013 its economic impact is already with us.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Federal Reserve official's scepticism about the US central bank's efforts to stem the financial crisis alarmed Wall Street on Tuesday, as the International Monetary Fund warned that the global financial system remains as risky as it was before the credit crisis.</p> <p>US investors recorded their biggest sell-off in three months after Charles Prosser, hawkish president of the Fed's Philadelphia branch, said the bank's revival strategy, including $40bn a month of mortgage bond purchases, were unlikely to do much for economic growth or unemployment.</p> <p>In its twice-yearly <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfsr/index.htm\" title=\"\">Global Financial Stability Report</a>, published on Tuesday, the IMF argues that despite a blizzard of new regulations the banking system is still vulnerable.</p> <p>\"Although the intentions of policy makers are clear and positive, the reforms have yet to effect a safer set of financial structures, in part because, in some economies and regions, the intervention measures needed to deal with the prolonged crisis are delaying a 'reboot' of the system on to a safer path,\" the document says.</p> <p>The IMF was one of the global institutions blamed after the \"great crash\" of 2008-09 for exaggerating the benefits of financial globalisation and failing to issue strong enough warnings about the risks.</p> <p>In its latest analysis the group finds that the world's banks are just as big and intertwined and just as reliant on short-term wholesale funding (rather than more solid savers' deposits) as they were prior to the financial crash. \"Although some countries, notably the US, have reduced their dependence on short-term funding, the bulk of the evidence suggests that the structure of the system has not changed in healthier directions,\" it reports.</p> <p>The IMF points out that in many countries, including the UK, troubled banks were swallowed up by stronger rivals at the height of the crisis, leaving the financial sector even more concentrated than it was before 2008. \"Overall, risks in the financial system remain. Of particular concern are the larger size of financial institutions, the greater concentration and domestic interconnectedness of financial systems, and the continued importance of non-banks in overall intermediation. The potential future use of structured and some new derivative products could add to complexity and a mispricing of risk.\"</p> <p>With leading economies, including those of the US, UK and eurozone, struggling to generate sustainable economic growth, the IMF is also concerned about potential side-effects of the low interest rates and other radical monetary policies central banks on both sides of the Atlantic are using to stave off a deeper downturn.</p> <p>\"If the central bank initiatives are not accompanied by resolute actions to thoroughly restructure the impaired segments of the financial system and solve deep-seated remaining problems in financial institutions they may inhibit adjustments in the structure of banking systems,\" the IMF says.</p> <p>It urges global regulators to take a series of further measures, including monitoring \"non-banks\" such as hedge funds, and encouraging banks to offer simpler financial products. It also wants regulators to consider banning banks outright from certain risky activities \u2013 instead of hoping that tougher capital requirements will do the job, by making some areas more expensive and therefore less profitable.</p> <p>The IMF suggests that if banks in Britain \u2013 where the government plans to separate retail and investment functions \u2013 believe they will no longer be bailed out in a crisis, it could rein in their activities. But this benefit \"could be mitigated by large banks' funding advantage, economies of scale, and the tendency to concentration\".</p>",
  "<p>More than 300 homes have been flooded in the north of England in two days, as almost twice the average rainfall for September drenched the Pennine and Cheviot catchments and streamed off both sides.</p> <p>Boats ferried residents to safety from St Helen's in Lancashire and Morpeth in Northumberland, where defences installed after disastrous flooding in 2008 failed to contain the river Wansbeck.</p> <p>Transport was devastated as parts of the M6 and the East Coast main line became temporary rivers, and swirling underground water left a block of town houses in Newburn, Newcastle, seemingly on stilts as earth round the foundations was swept away. Police cordoned off the building amid fears it could collapse and last night the area around it was said to be like a \"ghost town\" after a power failure.</p> <p>An old fishing village in the Footdee or \"Fittie\" area of Aberdeen was covered in a white foam as wind and rain drove a thick froth of plankton and sea-spume inland. The city council said the coating was \"unusual but harmless\" and it would be swept up by environmental teams if any was left after the rain.</p> <p>An easing of the downpour in the central Pennines, turning to a fine mist by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, saved the centre of Leeds and the much-flooded Calder valley town of Hebden Bridge from serious damage. Sandbags were everywhere in Hebden Bridge and pumps on standby, while emergency teams from the Environment Agency in Leeds ran a round-the-clock clearing of drains and watercourses.</p> <p>The agency warned, however, that further flooding was likely in Yorkshire, the north-west and north Wales overnight before the obstinate centre of low pressure finally crept off the fells and turned its attention to the Midlands and south. The Meteorological Office warned that their turn would be on Wednesday as the weather backtracked down the course it took over the weekend. There are 219 flood warnings in place.</p> <p>The yo-yo pattern is the result of two weather systems \u2013 a warm front from the Atlantic and a colder one drawn from north of Scotland meeting \u2013 and dumping persistent rain. Although some areas have experienced gusts of up to 70mph, the reluctance of the dismal weather to move off north and east is also due to a weaker jetstream than usual at this time of the year.</p> <p>The Environment Agency has notified 75,000 properties of the serious risk of flooding since Sunday, but in spite of the failure at Morpeth \u2013 whose recovery was used as a model for Cockermouth when the Cumbrian town was ravaged by floods three years ago \u2013 defences held up well at Ripon, Tadcaster, Dewsbury, Appleby-in-Westmorland and other former trouble spots.</p> <p>David Jordan, director of operations, said: \"Our thoughts are with those whose homes have been flooded this week. Flooding has a devastating impact on property and possessions.</p> <p>\"Our teams have been out around the clock over the last few days to minimise the risks and prepare for flooding. We urge people to keep up to date with the weather forecast and remain prepared for flooding in their area, sign up to receive free flood warnings and stay away from dangerous flood water.\"</p> <p>Police and local authorities urged people to leave work early in much of the north-east, where many schools in Stockton-on-Tees also closed at lunchtime.</p> <p>Much of the flooding was as slow and relentless as the rain, but there were instances of flash flooding including a rapid rise in the river Coquet at Rothbury in Northumberland where two cars were sent careering downstream and riverside homes were evacuated.</p> <p>County councillor Steven Bridgett said flood barriers installed after a much worse incident in 2008 had given people time to prepare. \"There has been a fantastic, co-ordinated response from everyone and the WRVS [Women's Royal Voluntary Service] are our angels looking after people who have been evacuated with tea, coffee, soup and sandwiches.\"</p> <p>Drivers were evacuated from cars on the Great North Road in Gateshead when the carriageway became awash. A wall beside the coast road along the Tyne at Wallsend was deliberately dismantled to ease the pressure of floodwater, and an emergency cordon has been placed round recently-built, three-storey town houses at Newburn in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p> <p>Several were left apparently on stilts after water scoured out their foundations, which were damaged in June by a culvert bursting. Residents were evacuated after that incident but later allowed to return after repairs. The blocks now stand empty again and there are fears that they may have to be demolished.</p> <p>A spokesman for Newcastle city council said: \"Police took the decision to evacuate after concern about the stability of a number of residential buildings, including Spencer Court, Hareside Court, Hareside Walk and Mill Vale. This follows an ongoing problem with a collapsed culvert was made worse by the heavy rainfall last night and this morning.</p> <p>\"Eight residents have been moved to the official rest centre at Newburn Leisure Centre while the council, Northumbria Police and other agencies work to alleviate the situation and asses any other potential risks. Roads throughout Newburn \u2013 and indeed the city more widely \u2013 have been severely affected by the weather and the Mill Lane road in Newburn has collapsed and been cordoned off.\"</p> <p>A search of the river Swale near Catterick army camp in North Yorkshire was called off late on Tuesday night when a yellow flotation ring, which had been mistaken for a person in the water, was recovered at Kiplin.</p> <p>The Met Office says unsettled conditions will continue until next week but should be \"generally much quieter\" from Wednesday night.</p> <p>MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said Ravensworth in North Yorkshire had seen the highest amount of rain, with 123mm recorded since the start of the heavy downpours on Sunday night.</p> <p>The torrential downpours are still some way off the highest recorded rainfall for one day, however, when 316.4mm fell in 24 hours in Seathwaite, Cumbria, in 2009, MeteoGroup said.</p>"
