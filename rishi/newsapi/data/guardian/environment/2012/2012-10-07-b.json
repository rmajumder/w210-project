  "<p>More than 50 businesses, including household names such as Asda, Sky and PepsiCo, have called on the government to put in place a 2030 target on decarbonising the power sector.</p> <p>They argue that such a move \u2013 already backed by Labour and the Lib Dems \u2013 will stimulate investment and revitalise the UK's ageing energy infrastructure.</p> <p>Their call comes as George Osborne prepares to address the Tory party conference, a speech that may recall aspects of his oft-repeated attacks on green policies as a burden on businesses. Osborne's aides have made clear the chancellor is against a 2030 target on carbon, and last year he fought successfully to have the UK's carbon targets for the 2020s reviewed.</p> <p>Osborne also supports a new \"dash for gas\", which would entail building a fleet of about 20 new gas-fired power stations, and which green campaigners and renewable energy companies have said could raise emissions and stifle investment in renewable energy.</p> <p>The businesses \u2013 including some of the biggest in the UK, and spanning a wide range of sectors from retailers to insurance and technology companies \u2013 have written to the chancellor to urge him to support a 2030 target that would in effect ensure that almost all of the UK's electricity was from low-carbon sources.</p> <p>This would require a massive expansion of renewable energy, and potentially also nuclear power and the installation of carbon capture and storage at fossil fuel power stations.</p> <p>The letter was co-ordinated by the <a href=\"http://www.aldersgategroup.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Aldersgate Group</a>, a coalition of businesses that supports the move to a more sustainable green economy.</p> <p>In a veiled reference to Osborne's attacks on renewable energy and environmental regulation, the letter says: \"The government's perceived commitment to the low carbon transition is being undermined by recent statements calling for unabated gas in the power sector beyond 2030 and the absence of a specific carbon intensity target.\"</p> <p>The signatories point to a warning from the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Committee on Climate Change</a>, the statutory body that advises ministers on meeting carbon targets, that the widespread use of gas-fired generation without carbon capture and storage after 2030 could violate the government's own commitments on carbon reduction.</p> <p>Peter Young, chairman of the Aldersgate Group, said: \"The message of this letter is loud and clear: we must put an end to any political uncertainty surrounding the UK's energy future and start unleashing the billions of pounds of overdue investment which will deliver new growth for our economy.\"</p> <p>In a message directed at the Tory party conference, he said: \"Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties understand this huge growth opportunity and backed a 2030 carbon target for the power sector at their party conferences. Now the Conservative party must step up to the mark and provide the full cross-party support which businesses have been calling for.\"</p> <p>The businesses did not set a particular level for the 2030 target, preferring instead to ask only for a target. The biggest names on the list include Asda, Aviva, Alliance Boots, BT, British American Tobacco, Cisco, EDF, Eurostar, Marks &amp; Spencer, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Philips, Reed Elsevier, Sky, The Co-operative and Tridos Bank.</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne has opened the way for a fresh round of \u00a310bn welfare cuts by securing agreement from the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, and promising the Liberal Democrats that the cuts will be balanced by a bigger contribution from the rich.</p> <p>Duncan Smith had been the main Conservative obstacle to more welfare cuts but on Sunday he wrote a joint article with the chancellor saying he was \"satisfied\" such savings were possible.</p> <p>In return, the Treasury has given him the final political go-ahead for universal credit, his cherished but risky master plan to merge benefits and tax credits from next year.</p> <p>Senior Tory sources also suggested that senior Lib Dems had also accepted the fresh cuts as long as Osborne and Cameron stuck to their promises made that the rich would have to make the largest contribution to the next attack on the deficit.</p> <p>Osborne and the Lib Dems have been scouring Whitehall for \u00a316bn of further cuts to be implemented in 2015-16 ever since Osborne was forced in last year's autumn statement to concede that he could not eradicate the structural deficit in this parliament.</p> <p>Although Osborne does not need to spell out the precise details of the 2015-16 deficit reduction programme until next year's autumn statement, the welfare reforms will require legislation to be in place within two years at the most. The first targets are likely to be housing benefit for the under 25s and restraint on the uprating of benefits.</p> <p>Osborne's two deals \u2013 with Duncan Smith and senior Lib Dems \u2013 free the chancellor to put political pressure on Labour to explain its plans to cut the deficit.</p> <p>In a joint article in the Daily Mail, Duncan Smith and Osborne state: \"We are united in our determination to deliver universal credit, the most fundamental reform of our benefits system for a generation, on time and on budget.\"</p> <p>They say that further savings are needed in most government departments and most areas of spending at the next spending review.</p> <p>They also point out that the Treasury illustrated at the time of the last budget that if the rate of reductions in departmental budgets in the next spending review period is to be kept at the current rate, the welfare budget will have to be reduced by more than \u00a310bn by 2016-17.</p> <p>They write: \"We are both satisfied that this is possible and we will work together to find savings of this scale.\"</p> <p>Duncan Smith has also given ground by accepting David Cameron's commitment not to withdraw rich pensioners' access to TV licence, travel passes or winter fuel payments.</p> <p>The agreement between the two cabinet members has been struck as the paper serialises a biography of Osborne that lays out some of the past heated disputes over welfare cuts between the two men.Setting out his plans for further cuts, Cameron told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: \"We are going to take further action to make sure that the richest people in our country pay a fair share towards deficit reduction. The richest 10 per cent in our country are not only paying more in income tax. They are paying a greater percentage of the total income tax take than they ever did under Labour.\"</p> <p>Cameron also ruled out a mansion tax, the Liberal Democrats favoured means of squeezing the rich.</p> <p>In his speech on Monday, Osborne will say anyone remotely serious about tackling UK's problems needs to start by setting out how savings, including in welfare, will be achieved, something Labour is intent on avoiding until next year at the earliest.</p> <p>Tory strategists believe the public are in the mood to hear an honest assessment of how global forces are challenging the UK economy to be more competitive.</p> <p>He will explain how in every single year of this parliament the rich will pay a greater share of our nation's tax revenues than in any one of the 13 years that Labour were in office.</p> <p>The chancellor will also use his speech to announce a \u00a31bn of joint industry, university and government funding for world-leading science projects in the UK.</p> <p>The government will add \u00a3200m of new money to the Research Partnership Investment Fund, which supports university capital projects. The Fund was launched at the 2012 budget, with \u00a3100m of funding but has been heavily oversubscribed with a large number of high-calibre bids.</p> <p>To access the money, universities must at least double the public funding through contributions from private companies or charities. So, by tripling the government support to \u00a3300m, the total investment, including the universities own contributions, is expected to be at least \u00a31bn.</p>",

Both sides had warned that the other was preparing to destabilise the country.</p> <p>But at the polling booths the mood was peaceful and, though partisan, fiercely democratic. The lines of voters outside the polling station in La Florida curled beyond the Cervantes high school, past the housing blocks and up the hill as far as the eye could see. Locals said they had never seen such a turnout, a sign of the interest generated by the vibrant political race and what some believed was an outside chance of an upset.</p> <p>\"In every election, there are a lot of people here, but never like this. People want a change,\" said a 50-year-old housewife, Marcoline Uzcategui, as she stood outside the polling station. \"I don't want to carry on living like this. I have a faint illusion that things may change this time, but Ch\u00e1vez has all the power so I don't want to get my hopes up too high.\"</p> <p>Others said they would stick with the president. \"Ch\u00e1vez will win because he has supported the people,\" said Alfredo Alvarez, a lawyer. \"He's administered funds as he should.\"</p> <p>The show of people power was impressive. Even Ch\u00e1vez's critics acknowledge that he has encouraged greater public participation in decision-making.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397329317\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/10/7/1349642112670/Hugo-Ch-vez-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, facing his most serious challenge since he was elected president in 1998, greets crowds in Caracas.

Although he has not been as prominent on the campaign trail as in the past, a huge rally in Caracas on Thursday showed his formidable campaign power and charisma.</p> <p>His 40-year-old opponent, Henrique Capriles, has won kudos for an energetic campaign but in an election day tweet acknowledged he was the underdog. \"Today we decide the future of our Venezuela,\" Capriles tweeted. \"Today we are millions of Davids! God will be our guide,\" he added, referring to his depiction of the vote as the biblical underdog's battle against Goliath.</p> <p>Ahead of the vote, opinion polls suggested the president would be re-elected, albeit by a margin well below his previous landslide victories. But the large number of undecided voters gave late momentum to Capriles.</p> <p>With Venezuela sitting on the world's largest oil reserves and Ch\u00e1vez a leading figure in the resurgence of the political left in Latin America, the vote will have an impact on the global economy, energy supplies and regional geopolitics.</p> <p>But for most of the country's almost 19&#xa0;million voters, the key concerns are the alarming rise in the murder rate, the redistribution of oil wealth, and the personality and health of the man who has led them for the past 13 years.</p> <p>In the 23 de Enero neighbourhood where Ch\u00e1vez casts his vote, the strong revolutionary spirit is evident in elaborate wall murals depicting Karl Marx, the Paris communes, Fidel Castro and \u2013 of course \u2013 Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>But the surge in murder and violent crime have tempted some voters here to consider alternatives. \"My vote is a secret because the situation is quite difficult. There is a good candidate this year who has put up a fight against the president,\" said Plajeres Rangel, a 35-year-old hairdresser, who said security was one of her main concerns.</p> <p>Commune leaders said Chavez maintained a solid core of support, but they acknowledged gains made by the Capriles campaign. \"This area is strongly pro-Ch\u00e1vez, but the opposition has made inroads. They've been campaigning here for the first time and they've come out on to the streets, which they didn't do before,\" said Jos\u00e9 Roberto Duque, a journalist at a community radio station.</p> <p>\"I'm here with my family to share a stellar moment for Bolivian socialist democracy,\" said Noel Marquez, the director of a revolutionary music collective and composer of some of Castro's campaign jingles. \"This is a country that is deeply committed to democracy. We have a trustworthy voting system, but the opposition have plans to distort things. They have created a climate of uncertainty, but the people will defend the vote.\"</p> <p>On the eve of the vote, Ch\u00e1vez said he would accept any outcome and urged the opposition to do the same. \"I call on all political actors from the left, right and centre for us to prepare emotionally to accept tomorrow's result. It won't be the end of the world for anybody,\" he said in a televised address .</p> <p>Analysts fear a narrow win for either side could spark accusations of fraud and street violence. This has put the voting system under intense scrutiny, but it appears robust. External observers and domestic analysts have lauded the procedure as one of the most sophisticated in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397329315\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349291253838/Henrique-Capriles-010.jpg\" alt=\"Henrique Capriles\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Presidential candidate Henrique Capriles has promised that he would maintain many of Ch\u00e1vez's social programmes.

They then cast an electronic vote for their preferred party candidate on a touchscreen. Their vote entered the central counting system and was printed so that they could confirm it was recorded properly before that hard copy was put in a ballot box, more than half the contents of which would later be cross-checked with the electronic data to ensure the system had not been hacked.</p> <p>Voters then had to sign a form to confirm they had cast a vote. Before they left, the little finger on their left hand was marked with indelible purple ink so they could not return to vote a second time. \"This system is 100% fraud-proof and has been recognised as such by outside political institutions,\" said Luis Guillermo Piedra, of the National Electoral Council.</p> <p>Former US president Jimmy Carter has described the system as superior to that of the US. His Carter Centre, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has noted that many Venezuelans are concerned a new electronic voting system might enable authorities to tell how they voted, exposing them to retaliation if they voted against Ch\u00e1vez. \"This concern has no basis, however,\" the centre said. \"The software of the voting machines guarantees the secrecy of the vote.\"</p> <p>There is less certainty about what happens outside the voting booths. The opposition has lodged 110 complaints alleging abuses of election laws by the Ch\u00e1vez campaign, mostly relating to his domination of airtime on public broadcasting outlets and use of funds, staff and other resources from state-owned enterprises. They also feared that armed militias put pressure on voters before they went to the polls, though there have been no reports of this to date.</p> <p>\"I'll stay at home tonight to keep safe. If there is a close result, there might be trouble,\" said Jesus Gallardo, a shopkeeper who serves his customers through steel bars. He said he voted for Ch\u00e1vez, but added that he understands why the race has been tighter this time. \"Many people are unhappy because of insecurity and failed promises.\"</p>",
  "<p>At a dinner table in Akron, Ohio, recently half a dozen Democratic activists took a break from trashing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader\" title=\"\">Ralph Nader</a> for allowing a Bush victory in 2000 to discuss the material benefits of Barack Obama's first&#xa0;term. One had been able to keep his&#xa0;children on his healthcare plan after&#xa0;graduation; another with a pre-existing condition had been able to move plans without penalty. Then there&#xa0;was an awkward silence, broken by the mention of the jobs saved in Toledo, 140 miles away, by the auto bailout. That brought us on to Republican Mitt Romney's call to \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html?ex=1384837200&amp;en=3616fe7f95dd6a7b&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg\" title=\"\">Let Detroit go bankrupt</a>\". And soon, the conversation is flowing as easily as the beer as talk turns to how bad things might have been \u2013 and could yet be \u2013 with Republicans at the helm.</p> <p>Such are the cramped parameters within which Democratic loyalists converse. Questions about poverty, bankers, inequality, climate change or drone attacks are not engaged with a defence of Obama's record on the economy, regulation, the environment or&#xa0;foreign policy but avoided with a threat: Romney. Speculation about what&#xa0;Obama might have done differently are met with arguments about what Bush did do&#xa0;wrong. Inquire if Obama will get more done if elected, and they shrug and point to the obstructionist Republicans in Congress.</p> <p>Dare to prod further as to why anyone should vote for him given the likelihood that Republicans will win in Congress and they'll take you right back where you started: Romney. Any question about the good things that might have happened as a result of Obama's victory in 2008 is short-circuited by a response about the bad things that might happen as a result of his defeat in 2012. Hope curdled to fear. Everyone can tell you how things get worse; no one can tell you how they get better.</p> <p>The paradox of large numbers of people investing heavily in a result without expecting a great deal from the outcome is particularly stark during a presidential election. On the one hand, there is the hoop-la: the polls, bumper stickers, stump speeches, conventions and debates. All the trappings to celebrate the assumed connection between political power and the popular will. On the other hand, there is cynicism: <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/voter-turnout-europe-america_b_1660271.html\" title=\"\">the low turnout</a>, voter suppression, billionaire donors and contrived controversies. All the evidence of a system corrupted by money and openly rigged .</p> <p>These contradictions are not unique to the US. Britain is midway through its&#xa0;conference season, where the three main parties lay out their stalls. They have fewer members combined, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563715\" title=\"\">the Economist reminded</a> us recently, than the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Yet we treat their annual gatherings as though they are moments of major national significance.</p> <p>But they are particularly acute here because of the dislocation between rhetoric and reality, pageantry and practice, and the nation's belief in its own democratic values and its actual plutocratic electoral culture. And they are particularly acute now. Obama ran&#xa0;on change \u2013 a phenomenon that American elections are not equipped to deliver.</p> <p>How could they? They adhere to the golden rule that those who have the gold make the rules. That has long been a problem. In 2008, Obama and his Republican challenger, John McCain, spent as much on television ads in Florida as all the parties spent on the entire 2010 UK general election. Now it's&#xa0;even worse. A few years ago the supreme court loosened the rules to allow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/29/us-politics-vote-money-wins\" title=\"\">unlimited donations from anonymous sources</a>. Now the candidates spend almost as much time courting the&#xa0;rich as they do on the stump. \"It's really sad,\" Arnold Hiatt, a key Democratic funder, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/27/120827fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">told the New Yorker</a>. \"You&#xa0;could buy this election for a&#xa0;billion dollars.\"</p> <p>While this makes a mockery of democracy it doesn't create an illusion of choice. The outcome in these elections matter. Hanging chads and slender margins notwithstanding, by the end of the night on 6 November, either Obama or Romney will be president. There are other candidates. But that is the electoral choice. It is not a marginal one.</p> <p>The case against the Republicans is not difficult to make. Their numbers don't add up, their arguments don't make sense, and their record in office contradicts virtually every one of their professed principles. During the eight years prior to Obama's presidency they ballooned the deficit, crashed the economy, increased the power of the state over the individual, and sent America's standing plummeting throughout the world. They built that.</p> <p>The world is not marginally different because George W Bush won in 2000 or 2004. Romney is running to the right of&#xa0;him and Obama is running to the left of Al Gore.</p> <p>Insisting it makes no difference who wins is not tenable. Last year Chelsea Shinneman of Roanoke, Virginia, had a baby, Harrison, who was born with a congenital heart defect. Were it not for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/03/younge-america-obamacare-health-insurance-video\" title=\"\">the new healthcare act</a>, Harrison would have been destined for a lifetime of sky\u2011high insurance premiums.</p> <p>In Fort Collins, Colorado, the head of the Homelessness Prevention Initiative, Sue Beck-Ferkiss, could point to 36 families in the area who had been helped by stimulus money. Had there been any Latinos at the table in Akron, they might have added to Obama's achievements his executive order to halt&#xa0;the deportation of young undocumented immigrants. Had there been soldiers, they might have talked about the withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq.</p> <p>So it matters who wins. Just because improvements are incremental rather than transformative doesn't mean they're not important. The problem isn't that there's no difference between Obama and Romney but that there is insufficient difference between what Obama has delivered and is offering and what the country needs at a time when poverty is rising, wages have stalled, civil liberties have been suppressed, kill lists drawn up and drone attacks escalated. It is possible to indict the Republican party and vote for Obama without endorsing his record or making excuses for his failures.</p> <p>But it is not possible to understand his failures without recognising that an electoral system funded by the wealthy will never be capable of distributing resources and power equitably, regardless of who is in charge. Why would it? How could it? The fact that this is the choice Americans are faced with doesn't mean they don't deserve a better one. It simply reflects why, under these terms, a better choice is not possible.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Dark days are approaching for badgers. Since the government gave the go-ahead to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">trial cull</a> in an attempt to protect cattle from bovine TB, up to 100,000 badgers could be shot. Trained marksmen are preparing for the cull, which will involve using bait to lure the creatures out of their setts before shooting them.</p> <p>Yet subversive forces are never far afield. \"Jay\", spokesperson for&#xa0;the Bristol-based animal rights&#xa0;group <a href=\"http://badger-killers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stop the Cull</a>, explains that since badgers are easily disturbed, noise and lights should send them safely back underground. Likewise, if they come across any people, the marksmen are legally required to break (ie disarm) their rifles.</p> <p>Police in Gloucestershire and Somerset, where the first culls are&#xa0;due to take place, warn that disrupting licensed culling could lead to a charge of aggravated trespass. \"In farms with licences we will not disrupt the cull,\" says Jay, \"but we will make sure it proceeds legally. We will wear hi-vis jackets, use very bright torches to film, and vuvuzelas to make sure shooters know we're there and we're not shot.\"</p> <p>Dismantling any snares would be a serious offence, says Jay. \"It used to be done with bolt-cutters but it can actually be done with boulders \u2013 which means you're not walking around the countryside with anything that can get you done by the police.\" Bait points, meanwhile, can be \"neutralised\" by peeing on them, as badgers hate the smell.</p> <p>Yet Lee Moon of the Hunt Saboteurs Association says that the sheer volume of people preparing to go out in opposition to the cull \u2013 hundreds are expected \u2013 should be enough. \"I think we're going to be successful,\" he says. \"This is not rocket science.\"</p>",

Many Western countries are slipping back as emerging economies push ahead with energy and drive. Some will make the transition to this. But others will struggle with it for decades.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Ed Miliband had no right to call himself a one nation politician because he had failed to reform his party.</strong> (See 3.46pm )</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Labour] has a Shadow Chancellor who would bankrupt the country again with more spending, more borrowing and more debt, it has Trade Unions that are running amok again, and a leader that is not strong enough to control any of them.</p> <p>Last week he made claim to be Disraeli. We know a little more about Benjamin Disraeli, a great Conservative Prime Minister, than he does. Disraeli was defined by changing his party for the late 19th century while Ed Miliband will be defined by refusing to change his Party for the 21st century.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Hague said the British people had \"firmly made up their minds that they do not want to become part of some kind of European federation\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he would announce further details of his review of EU powers (the \"balance of competencies\" review) later this month.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Tories want to negotiate a new settlement with the EU and then secure public support for that.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our party we are looking towards the establishment of a new settlement in Europe, and that will in time mean, just as it will for other nations of Europe in or out of the Eurozone, a big choice for Britain which must be a real choice for Britain and which will require the fresh consent of the British people.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that Britain would launch a major crackdown on sexual violence in conflict during its presidency of the G8 next year.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are doing this because of the 50,000 women raped in Bosnia, who have only seen thirty of the men responsible ever convicted for it, because of 64,000 women and girls raped in Sierra Leone and 400,000 in Rwanda, because of all those in Colombia, Darfur, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo who endured this unthinkable violation, and for all the men and boys who have also been subjected to rape in conflict and have never known justice for it.</p> <p>For them and for millions like them who might be affected in the future, it is time to shatter this impunity. It is time to make it possible to mount many more successful prosecutions. The specialist team we are assembling will be ready for deployment by the end of this year, and we will call on other nations to join us in giving the UN and other agencies the support they need. I hope that across this party and across all parties people will join me in this campaign and take it to their hearts so that we can create a momentum that cannot be stopped and a lasting step forward in the condition of humanity.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said new funding being announced shortly would safeguard the future of Bletchley Park.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Next week I will go to Bletchley Park to announce the unlocking of funding for its restoration, to preserve the memory of some of the greatest intelligence achievements in our history and at the same time launch new schemes to recruit the brightest mathematicians of the future. When Britain has built up a key skill or advantage in the world we must always do our utmost to develop, retain and enhance it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Britain was pressing \"as a matter of urgency\" for another international conference to finalise the proposed arms trade treaty.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was wrong to assume that the murder of the American ambassador Chris Stevens meant the Arab Spring was going wrong.</strong> \"I\u2019ve been twice to Benghazi where these killings took place, and my view is that the true face of the Arab Spring is not the murderers who attacked the US consulate, but the tens of thousands of Benghazi residents who took to the streets to demand an end to militias and violence,\" he said.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50719d6dc0e3aacd18e2f857\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T15:19:09.586Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's more from what <strong>David Davis</strong> told a fringe meeting at lunchtime.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Davis said that the Conservatives would only win vote by legislating for an EU referendum before the general election because voters would not believe a promise on this issue.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't think promising a referendum would win us 10 votes in the next general election because people don't believe us anymore. Every single party has promised a referendum then broken its promise, for whatever reason, they each have a legitimate reason behind it. But nobody believes us anymore so if we are going to have a referendum we must start the process now, before the election so that we actually say to people 'this is what's going to happen, this is the question, this is the tactic'.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government should abandon its plan to raise aid spending to 0.7% of national wealth.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With one or two exceptions, like spending money on India and maybe China, most people when they think, actually think, about the use of aid broadly approve of it. When it's saving children from malaria, when it's saving children from dying from malnutrition, when it is rescuing countries that are in dire straights.</p> <p>What I don't actually agree with the government's policy on is the 0.7%.

My colleague Polly Toynbee was left out in the cold, something an ungallant Montgomerie gleefully pointed out to his fellow Tories.</p> <p>Montgomerie made his case that the Conservatives have a mountain to climb to win the next election. The party had not won an outright majority for 20 years, and no government in modern times had added to their vote share while being in power, he said. This was something neither Margaret Thatcher nor Tony Blair had ever done, and the Tories today had to do it \"after making deeper spending cuts than Thatcher ever managed\".</p> <p>The answer, according to Montgomerie, was to \"look like we are on the side of ordinary, striving, blue-collar working people\". On immigration, Europe and crime \"the British people stand with us already\", but \"we need to be a party that is equally committed to Britain's social contract: the NHS, looking after pensioners, a safety net.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We need to be a little bit like Tony Blair - constantly invading other people's territory. I don't mean Iran, I mean political territory.\"</p> <p>But as the klaxons, cheers and boos of a nearby anti-government rally threatened to drown out the speakers, the man who really electrified the crowd was from the other side of the political divide: Marcus Roberts of the Fabian Society, who said that if the Tories want to win the next election \"you're going to need to address the [EU] referendum question\".</p> <p>And he added threateningly: \"If you aren't doing that positively, just watch for us [Labour] to do so, because we will be that ruthless and we will do what it takes in order to win.\"</p> <p>He said that there was a \"moral argument\" to holding a referendum based on the changing face of Europe since the eurozone crisis and a \"bureaucratic lack of legitimacy\".</p> <p>David Davis, David Cameron's former leadership rival and a voice of the right, couldn't agree more: \"Europe is going through a massive transition at the moment,\" he said, \"towards something we don't really want to be a part of: a superstate. We want to have a relationship with them, but we have to make a decision [on whether to be part of such a superstate].\"</p> <p>Davis said he backed holding two referendums. The first would ask the British public what they wanted out of Europe. This result would then be taken by \"negotiators\" to Brussels, and what the negotiators came up with would be put to the public. All this had to start before the next election, because \"I don't think promising a referendum will win us 10 votes in the next election - because nobody believes us any more.\"</p> <p>The case was most vividly put by the delegate who asked Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, to take a message back to Cameron: \"People that I meet believe that politicians are spitting in the face of the country over Europe,\" he said. \"They want a referendum and they are being denied it.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Tim Montgomerie, Chris Grayling and David Davis at the Tory conference <a href=\"http://t.co/7L9D3Qz2\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/254929981166211072\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-07T13:03:39+00:00\">October 7, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T15:05:59.697Z\">at 4.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50717b1758f93d33437541cf\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T12:59:37.726Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 David Cameron and George Osborne have sought to defend the Conservative party's \"one nation\" credentials by insisting that the rich will be asked to pay more in the next round of deficit-reduction measures.</strong> The issue has dominated the first morning of a conference which will see the Conservatives contest Labour's claim that it is now the \"one nation\" party. In separate interviews, Cameron and Osborne both said that the Lib Dem demand for a mansion tax, or for a specific tax on wealth, was unacceptable. But, without giving details they suggested that there were other ways of extracting more money from the wealthy and that this would happen before 2015. This is what Osborne told Sky.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re not going to have a new mansion tax, nor do I think it\u2019s sensible to have a wealth tax in the sense of a sort of tax on your wealth levied annually. Other countries have tried that and it hasn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s driven enterprise and investment abroad.</p> <p>So we\u2019re not going to do those two ideas, but I\u2019m very clear that the rich will have to make a contribution to closing the budget deficit; I\u2019m absolutely clear that in the decisions we take in the years ahead, as well as dealing with welfare, as well as continuing to reduce government spending in departments, we are also going to have to ask the rich to make another contribution.</p> </blockquote> <p>Osborne said extra payments would be necessary because the government would have to find savings worth \u00a316bn in the next savings review. In a separate interview, Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, said that Osborne had increased taxes on the rich in every budget he had delivered. But the Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said that the Tories' decision to rule out a mansion tax was a mistake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/oakeshottm/status/254884765046550528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>How do Tories define Middle England?

But he also said he would like to review the rule that allows EU citizens to enter the UK freely. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, put out this statement afterwards.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Cameron has become leader, membership of the Tory party has halved. Since he last abused Ukip, our poll ratings have doubled. The prime minister is once again showing his legendary lofty disdain for ordinary voters who rate Ukip higher than the Lib Dems - who must be an even a bigger waste of his time, obviously.</p> <p>The prime minister's blueprint for a new EU settlement is very confused. His claims to be able to change the EU rules on freedom of movement will be derided by anybody who knows how the EU works.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has described Andrew Mitchell's treatment of police officers at the gate of Downing Street as \"inexcusable\".</strong> Asked about the chief whip, who is not attending the conference because the controversy is still attracting media attention, Hammond said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every time any individual slips up, steps out of line, does something they shouldn't have done, commits an indiscretion, and they are a member of a party or an organisation, of course that is bound to reflect on that organisation. We have to accept that, it is very unfortunate. Nobody is defending Andrew Mitchell's conduct but a line now has to be drawn under it. This has been a very damaging affair.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tim Loughton, a former minister, said the affair had been \"hugely and deeply damaging\" to the party.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Council leaders have expressed some concerns about the government's decision to spend money on another council tax freeze.</strong> (See 9.07am.) The Conservative-led Local Government Association put out a statement saying that the freeze would not address councils' long-term funding problems, that councils should decide their own council tax rates and that Eric Pickles' decision to ban council from raising council tax by more than 2% without a referendum undermines the government's commitment to localism. In a statement Sir Merrick Cockell, the LGA chairman, said that help for councils was \"a good thing\" but that there were problems with this offer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reducing the current referendum trigger from 3.5 per cent to 2 per cent represents less flexibility for councils and even less localism with Whitehall decreeing what constitutes excessive. If local referendums are to be truly localist, they should be triggered by local people who can determine whether a council tax increase is excessive or not.</p> <p>Any help for councils is a good thing, but we have to be clear that this is a short-term offer. It doesn't address the huge long term pressures councils are facing including bigger cuts than any other part of the public sector and an immediate and growing crisis in funding care for the elderly. Councils could now have to budget for a further future shortfall.</p> <p>It is only right that councils take a longer-term view on budget planning and that decisions on the level of council tax are made by councillors who will then rightly be held to account through the ballot box.</p> <p>Councils care for the elderly, look after vulnerable children and collect the bins from our streets and in order to carry on doing this effectively local authorities need local discretion to consider the long-term interests of their residents before deciding if they will take up this government offer.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has defended the government's decision not to rush the review of airport capacity.</strong> Boris Johnson has claimed that delaying a decision about a new airport could have catastrophic consequences. Cameron said that Johnson was \"perfectly entitled\" to his view but that the government disagreed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We made a promise about the third runway in this parliament; we\u2019re keeping that promise, but we need now a proper review to see what the right answer is for the long-term interests of this country. This is a decision we\u2019ll have to live with for decades, and so let\u2019s take the time, let\u2019s get it right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron also said that he would like Johnson to do another political job after he steps down as mayor of London. (See 12.18pm.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The Department for Transport has said that 250,000 season ticket holders could save an extra \u00a345 as a result of the government's decision to impose a new cap on rail fares.</strong> Here's an extract from<a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/press-dft-20121007a/\"> its news release.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Passengers will benefit from a two per cent cut to the planned rises in the cost of nationwide train travel and travel on London buses and tubes following today\u2019s announcement by prime minister David Cameron.</p> <p>The average increase in regulated rail fares and the cost of travel on London\u2019s buses and tube network will be limited to one per cent above inflation for 2013 and 2014. Fares had been due to increase by RPI+3 per cent.</p> <p>&#xa0;This is expected to benefit more than a quarter of a million annual season ticket holders who can expect to have an extra \u00a345 back in their pockets as a result of today's decision. Many more holders of weekly and monthly season tickets could also see lower fares and some commuters will be over \u00a3200 better off over the two years.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T13:30:39.943Z\">at 2.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50717b0dc0e3aacd18e2f84a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T12:52:29.966Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6777bdc2-f8cb-4640-bc5a-26208ab267a0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349613908044/3112472b-67b2-46ca-beb1-c268c7776ead-460.jpeg\" alt=\"samantha cameron \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographers have been focusing on the most contentious issue of the day, Samantha Cameron's choice of footwear.

I have taken some of the quotes from the Press Association and from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron said that the wealthy would be asked to pay more in tax.</strong> Although the Tories are rejecting a wealth tax of the kind proposed by the Lib Dems (see 9.07am), they are prepared to make the wealthy pay more in tax. Andrew Marr said that, at the Lib Dem conference, Nick Clegg said that the wealthy would have to pay more as their contribution to getting the deficit under control. Marr asked if there would be any new measures that would hit wealthier taxpayers. Cameron replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will make sure that the rich pay their fair share, that the burden is properly shared \u2026 I'm not going to announce the measures here on the programme, but we will always be fair and seen to be fair.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, people who are the wealthiest will pay more in tax before the election Marr said. Cameron replied: \"Yes. And it is happening already.\"</p> <p>\u2022 But Cameron said he would veto a mansion tax.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard, you save, you buy yourself a house, you try to pay down the mortgage, you save and invest into that house, I don't want to be a country that comes after you every year with a massive great tax. So that is not going to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the wealthy were now paying a greater percentage of the total amount of income tax paid to the Exchequer than they did under Labour.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he would keep the promise he made at the election to protect universal benefits for pensioners.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be absolutely clear, the promise that I made at the last election to Britain's pensioners when I said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance, your free TV licences, your free bus passes - that promise stands.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he would like Boris Johnson to do another job in politics after he stands down as London mayor.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have said to Boris: 'Once you have done your job as London Mayor, don't think your job in politics is over'. I think he has got a huge amount to offer, a huge amount to give and I encourage him to do that. I think it is great that the greatest city in the world has got such a good mayor.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said Labour had \"nothing to say about the deficit or debt\" at its conference last week.</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He played down the prospect of holding an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</strong> Instead, he said that he wanted \"a new settlement\" with Europe and that the government should gain \"consent\" for that settlement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The trouble with a straight yes-or-no [referendum] is that, frankly, I am not happy with the status quo, so I don't want to say Yes to the status quo, but I also don't think it would be right to leave now.</p> <p>I think most people in our country don't want to leave the EU or just accept how it is at the moment. They want a change now. I want a change now. A Conservative-only government after the next general election can go and change it, can have that renegotiation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said that Ukip was \"a complete waste of time\".</strong></strong></p> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said he was in favour of a review of the rules allowing immigrations from the rest of the EU free entry into the UK.</strong></strong> Free movement of labour is at the heart of the EU, but in an interview in the Sunday Telegraph Theresa May, the home secretary, said she would review this. (See 9.07am.) Cameron said he was in favour of this. The review would be part of the \"balance of competencies\" review looking at EU powers, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you ought to go through all of the things that we have in our relationship with Europe, and work out what is good for Britain, work out what we can do better, and work out what we want to change, and I think by all means look at that. Look, I believe in the single market, I believe in free movement, but two weeks ago, I visited two factories in a week, and I asked the question, \u2018how many people do you employ from other EU countries? What\u2019s the balance?\u2019. In one it was 60%, in the other it was 50%. Now heavens above, we have got so many unemployed people in our country that we want to train and educate and give apprenticeships to and get back into work. I think it\u2019s absolutely right to look at this balance of competencies, to go through every topic and see what is in Britain\u2019s interests.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he would veto a \"massive\" increase in the EU's budget.</strong></p> <p><strong><strong>\u2022 He said that eventually the EU would need two budgets; one for countries in the Eurozone, and one for countries outside.</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He suggested that he was likely to implement the recommendations of the Leveson report on press regulation.</strong> Marr said that in the past Cameron had said that, as long as the recommendations weren't \"bonkers\", he would implement them. Was that still the case? \"Absolutely,\" said Cameron. But when he was pressed to say that he would accept statutory regulation of the press if Leveson recommended it, he refused to give an explicit commitment.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We must wait for what Lord Justice Leveson says. I don\u2019t want to try and prejudge it \u2026 We don't want heavy-handed state intervention; we\u2019ve got to have a free press \u2026 We\u2019re hoping Lord Leveson is going to crack this problem for us, but we must let him do his work first.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government had no plans to hold a vote on cutting the time limit for an abortion.</strong> Asked about Jeremy Hunt's interview on this subject yesterday, in which the health secretary said he was in favour of cutting the limit to 12 weeks, Cameron said that Hunt was just answering a question, not trying to put the issue on the agenda.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Hunt] was asked a question because he previously voted for a 12-week limit and he said he has stuck to that view. It is a vote of conscience issue and the health secretary is quite entitled to have his own opinion, but it is not the Government's approach.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron said that he personally favoured a \"modest\" reduction in the current 24-week limit but that the government did not have any plans to bring forward legislation on this issue.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was \"too early to say\" whether the government would miss its target to have debt falling by the time of the next election.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T11:44:43.817Z\">at 12.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5071605ac0e3aacd18e2f845\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T10:59:58.171Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are some <a href=\"http://ftlisting.salespack.conservativepartyconference.com/admin\">amusingly named fringe events</a> at the Tory conference, reports <strong>Paul Owen</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Probably the most blue in tooth and claw is tomorrow at 9am, and is baldly called: \"Why the public should want hospitals to close.\" For sheer mad brio \"We can't afford roads!\" (Tuesday, 5.30pm, their exclamation mark) runs it close.</p> <p>Also tomorrow morning Maria Miller, the new culture secretary and women's minister, is billed as speaking at the metaphysical-sounding \"Multi-dimensional poverty: how can we improve the measurements?\"</p> <p>Female delegates worried about the government's failure to win over women voters might be interested in \"The sharp end of the Chardonnay: how things have changed for women who drink\" at 12.30pm tomorrow.</p> <p>But most Tories have something more important on their minds: the EU. \"We need to talk about Europe\" (11am tomorrow) does battle with \"We need to talk about Brussels\" (7.30pm the same day), while \"How Britain can exit the EU\" and \"Back off Brussels!\" are also on the fringe agenda - although ominously an event explaining \"Britain, the eurozone crisis and the future of Europe\" has been cancelled.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3c374a6c-cb61-44ca-a37d-7cdb949c5bce\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349609886707/bddb5eae-105e-494f-9cf3-24cd3f62343f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Roads\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roads \u2013 can we afford them?

It's obviously a Labour laptop, and did not take kindly to David Cameron.</p> <p>But I have retrieved another slab of the Marr transcript. Here it is.</p> <p><em>Q: Do you think there are signs of growth?</em></p> <p>Cameron says these are tough times for the economy. The deficit has been cut by a quarter. He is not a forecaster, but he thinks the economy is rebalancing. A million net new jobs have been created in the private sector. Britain is exporting more things.</p> <p>Last year more businesses were set up than in any recent year in our history.</p> <p>A global race is underway. Some countries will make it and some won't, he says.</p> <p><em>Q: But debt is going up. When will you get on top of that?</em></p> <p>Cameron says he inherited a deficit of around 11%. It is now around 8%. But the situation is still challenging. \"These are very difficult times,\" he says.</p> <p>Labour had nothing to say about debt and the defict, he says.</p> <p><em>Q: Nick Clegg said there would be more austerity after 2015. Was he right?</em></p> <p>Yes, says Cameron. The cuts will have to be decided before the election. The government will have to look at things like welfare.</p> <p><em>Q: So the squeeze in welfare will start before the election.</em></p> <p>Cameron says when the Tories came in some families were getting \u00a340,000 or more in housing benefit. The government has stopped this.</p> <p><em>Q: Clegg says he will not allow more welfare cuts unless the rich pay more.</em></p> <p>Cameron says the government has always been fair. The top 10% have paid 10 times more to reducing the deficit than the bottom 10%.</p> <p><em>Q: Clegg said he would persuade you to accept a new form of wealth tax.</em></p> <p>Cameron says he will make sure that the rich pay their fair share.</p> <p>He cut the top rate of tax, he says. But he raised four times as much from the rich by means like raising stamp duty.</p> <p>He will take further action to make sure the rich pay a fair share.</p> <p><em>Q: What will you do?</em></p> <p>Cameron says you cannot be expected to announce George Osborne's budget. But he will not introduce a mansion tax.</p> <p><em>Q: So the wealthy will pay more in tax before the election?</em></p> <p>Yes, says Cameron, and it is happening already.</p> <p>He also says the rich are now paying a higher proportion of tax revenue than they did under Labour.</p> <p><em>Q: Will the top rate of tax go down to 40p?</em></p> <p>Cameron says he will not announce the budget, but they have done waht they have done, he says (implying it won't go down to 40p.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50713e1558f93d33437541c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-07T08:32:21.806Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Do you have any thoughts about the Jimmy Savile story?</em></p> <p>Cameron says it is \"truly shocking\".

They calculate that the party\u2019s true level of support could be five points or more above what headline figures suggest.</p> <p>Second, they are confident that incumbency gives them an advantage. Their analysis of the last Election result shows sitting MPs tended to be insulated against the national swing.</p> <p>Third, they think they can be more targeted. In 2010, the Tories were trying to take 160 seats. This time, they are looking at just 40. I\u2019m told the list will include more than ten Lib Dem seats.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/daves-best-bet-is-a-repeat-of-the-1983-show-8200651.html\">\u2022 John Rentoul in the Independent on Sunday says he can imagine Cameron winning the next election.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is possible to see how the Prime Minister might still win through, however. It does not really depend on what happens at conference this week, provided it avoids disaster. The winning scenario was painted jointly for me by a minister and a shadow minister, in separate conversations.</p> <p>The Conservative minister asked: \"What if, in a year to 18 months' time, the economy is growing... but the cuts really start to bite?\" That is quite possible, and perhaps the parallel to which this Cameronian moderniser was pointing was Margaret Thatcher in 1983, when unemployment was still high but disposable income rising for the majority. It may seem harsh, but elections can be won even if a minority is suffering.</p> <p>The Shadow Cabinet member then said what the Tory message would be in 2015: \"Labour drove the car into the ditch; do you really want to let them back behind the wheel?\" The higher growth is, the more effective this message is likely to be.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9591161/The-Man-with-the-Plan-cant-keep-avoiding-the-Blond-One.html\">\u2022 Matthew d'Ancona in the Sunday Telegraph, who interviewed David Cameron this week, says Cameron could be overshadowed at the conference by Boris Johnson.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Throughout our interview, Cameron was visibly focused, poised on the edge of his seat \u2013 except when pressed on what Quentin Tarantino would call the \u201cBoris Situation\u201d, at which point he squirmed and gurned, seeking to end the line of questioning with the usual lines \u2013 \u201cBoris really is Boris\u201d, \u201cthere\u2019s no point trying to contain Boris\u201d, and so on \u2013 and an affable shrug.</p> <p>Sorry, Prime Minister: there\u2019s no point presenting yourself as the Man with the Plan if a hugely popular contender for your job is mysteriously permitted to say that the plan contains the seeds of catastrophe. Jovial appeasement is merely encouraging the Mayor. There is a clear and present danger that he will steal the show from the PM in Birmingham, and that Cameron will start to be seen as yesterday\u2019s tomorrow man, an obstruction to the Blond One\u2019s ascent to power. It should anger the Cameroons much more than it does that all this is so. They need to act, for once, as if they\u2019re mad as hell and they\u2019re not going to take it any more. If No 10 has a Boris Strategy, I can\u2019t see it.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/andrew-rawnsley-boris-johnsons-threat-to-cameron\">\u2022 And Andrew Rawnsley in the Observer also says that Johnson will cause problems for Cameron at the conference.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Johnson] will address the conference itself, a glorious opportunity for Borisovian grandstanding and an event that the prime minister will feel painfully obliged to attend. The compliment will not be returned: the mayor will have left Birmingham before Mr Cameron addresses the party. Cabinet ministers have to clear their conference speeches through Number 10. The prime minister's people would very much like to see what Mr Johnson has in store for the conference. One Number 10 aide says: \"He's talked to us about where his speech is going.\" In other words, they don't really have a clue. If it is comedy Boris, he will make the rest of the cabinet look even more cardboard and grey. If it is serious Boris, the would-be prime minister in waiting, that will be really alarming for Number 10.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/martinivens/article1142245.ece\">\u2022 Martin Ivens in the Sunday Times (paywall) says Cameron needs to take Miliband seriously.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like the American president, Cameron\u2019s vice is to sit back and fritter away his political capital when ahead. He switches the gears too quickly to cruise control. Expect him to come storming back in his own conference speech.</p> <p>Both men are fierce fighters in a tight corner but Obama \u2014 usually \u2014 does \u201cthe vision thing\u201d better than Cameron. On Wednesday in Birmingham the prime minister needs to convince us there is more to his own plan for one nation than austerity.

  "<p>When he was leader of the Conservative party, William Hague once likened membership of the euro to being trapped in a burning building with no fire exit. It was an apt description, as young people in Greece would testify: in a country that has already contracted by more than Germany did during the Great Depression, the jobless rate for Greeks under 25 is 55%.</p> <p>Little wonder then that Antonis Samaras, the prime minister of Greece, is warning that his country has been pushed to the limit and that there is, as with Weimar Germany, the risk of democracy collapsing.</p> <p>Little wonder, either, that Spain, only just behind Greece in the youth unemployment misery stakes, is wary of seeking the help offered by the European Central Bank. Unlimited buying of Spanish bonds by the bank will come at a heavy price: more austerity for a population already buckling under the strain.</p> <p>A study of hundreds of recessions dating from the 19th century shows that most are short, sharp affairs. They are like heavy colds, nasty but quickly over. Every now and then, however, the cold turns into something much more serious and the longer it lasts the more serious it gets.</p> <p>It becomes more like a pandemic, affecting the immune systems of economies and spreading from one country to another. That is the situation in the eurozone today.</p> <p>Activity is collapsing in Italy, is weakening fast in France, and has started to falter in Germany. Unemployment in the eurozone is at record levels as the recession starts to feed on itself. Collapsing demand leads to company failures, adding to the bad debt problems of already weak banks. These, in turn, call in loans and make credit harder to find. Government finances suffer, increasing pressure on finance ministries to find additional savings. Another chunk is taken out of demand, making it more difficult to cut budget deficits and the national debt.</p> <p>Europe's malaise is affecting the entire global economy. It is hampering an already tentative US economy and may result in Mitt Romney becoming US president. It is leading to slower growth in China, which in turn is leading to heightened trade tensions.</p> <p>The eurozone has experienced weaker growth in the past decade than Japan did in its lost decade of the 1990s. The gap between the rich and poor countries has widened rather than narrowed. Before long, one in eight working age people will be on the dole. Flows of inward investment to what is increasingly seen as an economic backwater are starting to dry up. The failure of monetary union has been complete and abject.</p> <p>In business this would not matter all that much. Enterprises fail all the time. The commercial world \u2013 with the egregious exception of the \"too big to fail\" banks \u2013 is run on empirical principles: companies that work tend to survive and thrive, while those that don't fall by the wayside.</p> <p>The single currency does not operate by empirical principles. If it did the plug would already have been pulled on it. It is a top-down project, with a lineage stretching back to the Enlightenment, in which technocrats come up with what they see as a blueprint for happiness: clear, rational and beautiful. When the blueprint does not deliver the expected results, that is not the fault of the plan.</p> <p>As made clear this year by the ECB president, Mario Draghi, the future of the euro is not open to negotiation: Europe could have a second or even a third lost decade and it would make no difference to those who think it the last word in modernity.</p> <p>A second lost decade is certainly in prospect. The International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook tells the cautionary tale of British economic policy after the first world war, which was similar in many respects to the way the eurozone manages affairs today. When the guns fell silent in November 1918 the UK found the national debt had ballooned to more than 140% of GDP and prices were double their pre-war level. The government had two priorities: to return the pound eventually to the gold standard at its 1914 exchange rate and to cut national debt.</p> <p>The upshot was that both monetary policy (interest rates and the exchange rate) and fiscal policy (taxes and spending) were kept tight. Interest rates were raised to 7% in 1920 and throughout the 1920s the Treasury ran primary budget surpluses (excluding interest payments on the national debt) of nearly 7% of national output.</p> <p>Just as in the eurozone today, great store was put on the notion of an internal devaluation. Britain had become less competitive but could price itself back into global markets through cuts in wages and prices. But as the IMF study notes: \"The combination of tight monetary and tight fiscal policy, aimed at significantly reducing the price level and returning to the pre-war parity, had disastrous outcomes.</p> <p>\"Unemployment was high, growth was low, and, most relevant, debt continued to grow. Although the price-level reduction the UK was attempting to achieve was larger than anything likely to happen today due to internal devaluation, similar dynamics are evident.\"</p> <p>In some respects, the policy regime in the eurozone today is far less draconian than in 1920s Britain. Short-term interest rates have been cut, the ECB has flooded the financial system with cash and it will buy sovereign bonds, albeit with strings attached.</p> <p>In other ways, though, it is the gold standard with knobs on. The standard was, in theory at least, a self-stabilising mechanism, since those countries that ran trade surpluses accumulated gold. This led to an expansion of credit, which in turn led to higher inflation, a drop in competitiveness and a narrowing trade surplus. Today's euro has no such mechanism to force the biggest creditor nation (Germany) to run down its colossal surpluses.</p> <p>The gold standard collapsed in the 1930s amid great economic pressure and Britain was the first country to leave. For those who view the euro with almost religious reverence, the idea that monetary union could go the same way is inconceivable.</p> <p>Let's hope they are wrong. The best thing for Europe would be if the euro were smashed to smithereens, allowing countries to devalue and impose capital controls. It would still be painful but at least they have the ability to boost their economies and pay down debts more slowly. The alternative is to sit and watch the flames lick higher.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's dismal recent summers can be blamed on a substantial warming of the North Atlantic Ocean in the late 1990s, according to new scientific research. The shift has resulted in rain-soaked weather systems being driven into northern Europe, increasing summer rainfall by about a third.</p> <p>The pattern is likely to revert to drier summers and may do so suddenly, according to Prof Rowan Sutton, at the University of Reading, who led the work. \"I can't guarantee it but it is likely,\" he said. \"However we are not sure of the timing, which is what every one wants to know \u2013 but we are working on this now.\" Sutton added that when the switch occurs, it could happen as rapidly as over two to three years.</p> <p>The summer of 2012 was the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/30/rain-chaos-summer-wettest-years\" title=\"\">wettest in a century</a> and follows a series of above average years for summer rainfall. Sutton's team, who published their <a href=\"www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1595\" title=\"\">study in Nature Geoscience</a>, examined over a century of data and found that the temperature of the North Atlantic remains above or below the long term average for decades at a time. The periods of warmer temperature, the latest of which started in the late 1990s, were found to correlate with wet summers in Northern Europe and hotter, drier summers in the Mediterranean. The team used existing detailed climate simulations to demonstrate a causal link between the warmer oceans and the change in the weather.</p> <p>Sutton said these shifts have been occurring for many hundreds of years, but that global warming was also having an impact. \"It is not now purely natural or purely a manifestation of human-induced climate change,\" he said. \"There is lot of evidence to show that climate change is changing the timing and amplitude of the temperature changes.\" For example, he said, the cooler period from the 1960s to the 1980s occurred when soot and other pollution from dirty power stations cooled the planet.</p> <p>The previous North Atlantic warm phase, which ran from the 1930s to the 1950s, also saw a run of wet summers in the UK, including severe flooding in August 1948, which closed the east coast mainline railway for three months, and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2002/lynmouth_flood.shtml\" title=\"\">Lynmouth floods in August 1952</a> in which 34 people died.</p> <p>The warming of the North Atlantic has been one reason for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">record low in Arctic sea ice</a> this summer. It is possible that the shrinking of the sea ice is also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/aug/08/shape-of-british-summers-to-come\" title=\"\">contributing to poor summers</a> in the UK, as the exposed ocean waters warm in the sun. However, Sutton said that this remains to be proven by scientific work that is now underway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397348919\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349450148331/Map---Europe-rainfall-001.png\" alt=\"Map - Europe rainfall\" width=\"460\" height=\"517\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map: Europe rainfall</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The warm and cold swings in the North Atlantic affect temperatures, rain and winds across Europe, Africa and North and South America, and previous research indicates they are related to changes in ocean circulation.

  "<p>The framework <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/philippines-muslim-rebels-peace-deal\" title=\"\">peace agreement</a> unveiled on Sunday by the Philippines government and the main southern Muslim insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), is a feather in the cap of President Benigno Aquino after 15 years of on-off talks and failed ceasefires, and may significantly boost regional security. But the autonomy deal faces a long, obstacle-strewn road to final implementation in 2016 and is certain to be challenged by splinter groups and terrorist gangs in Mindanao and by Aquino's political opponents in Manila.</p> <p>In bullish mood, Aquino stressed the prospective economic benefits that peace would bring to a region that is home to a treasure trove of largely untapped natural resources, including oil, gas and minerals. \"This framework agreement paves the way for final and enduring peace in Mindanao. This means that the hands that once held rifles will be put to use tilling land, selling produce, manning work stations and opening doorways of opportunity,\" he said.</p> <p>If the deal really does bring an end to the violence, the beneficial effects may be felt far beyond the southern Philippines. The majority Muslim population of Mindanao \u2013 the Philippines as a whole is predominantly Roman Catholic \u2013 has been caught up in a separatist struggle spanning the past 40 years that is said to have claimed the lives of 120,000 people.</p> <p>In recent years, al-Qaida-linked terrorist groups seeking regional sway, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Sayyaf\" title=\"\">Abu Sayyaf</a> in Mindanao and mainly Indonesia-based <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiyah\" title=\"\">Jemmah Islamiyah</a> (JI), sought to recast the conflict as a jihad to create an Islamic caliphate. Their trail of bombings, kidnapping, beheadings, and destabilisation and infiltration operations ranged from Mindanao to Bali, Aceh, and Jakarta in Indonesia, Malaysia and southern Thailand. As long as it continued, the Mindanao conflict provided bases and fuel for this holy fire.</p> <p>In January 2012, the Philippines military said it had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10078785\" title=\"\">killed two key JI leaders in a raid in the south</a> \u2013 Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, or Marwan, one of the region's most-wanted militants, and Mohammad Ali, alias Muawiyah. The US was alert to the threat, framing the insurgency as part of the \"global war on terror\". Special forces were sent to Mindanao to support Filipino troops against Abu Sayyaf.</p> <p>Abu Sayyaf is now said to be reduced to 400 militants in total, but both it and JI can be expected to do whatever they can to undermine the Mindanao deal. So, too, may splinter factions that have broken with MILF's leader, Al Haj Murad Ibrahim. One rebel commander, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10375683\" title=\"\">Ameril Umbra Kato</a>, formed a new 200-strong group last year specifically opposed to the peace process. His forces launched a string of attacks on army camps in August. More trouble is likely from that quarter.</p> <p>MILF's renunciation of the goal of independence and repudiation of terrorism paved the way for today's breakthrough. But its followers have not renounced armed struggle, remain armed to the teeth, and like broadly similar movements, for example in Northern Ireland, the Spanish Basque country and south-east Turkey, could quickly regress or fall out with each other if the peace process does not bring dividends quickly. In fact, history may be repeating itself. In 1996 the Moro National Liberation Front signed a peace deal that did not include disarmament. The pact foundered when a rejectionist faction broke away to form what is now the MILF.</p> <p>Aquino will also face opposition closer to home, as <a href=\"http://rightonthemark.wordpress.com/tag/2013-philippine-midterm-elections/\" title=\"\">next May's mid-term congressional and gubernatorial elections loom</a>. Politics in the Philippines is a passionate and sometimes violent business dominated by powerful family clans, political dynasties, and celebrity figures. Those lining up their 2013 candidacies include the former first lady Imelda Marcos, her daughter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10465863\" title=\"\">Imee</a>,and the former president Joseph Estrada, who was kicked out of office by a \"people power\" revolt in 2001 after previously vowing to crush the MILF in an \"all-out war\". Another former president,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10468370\" title=\"\"> Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was arrested</a> last week on corruption charges.</p> <p>Aquino's plan may struggle to survive this torrid, turbulent arena. And again, there is a discouraging precedent. In 2008 a similar preliminary autonomy pact was declared unconstitutional after political opponents petitioned the supreme court. In place of peace an upsurge in violence ensued, displacing 750,000 people and leaving more than 100 dead.</p>",
  "<p>Brendan Rodgers outlined his vision on the day he was appointed Liverpool manager. \"I want to make coming to Anfield the longest 90 minutes of an opponent's life,\" he said in June. It was all part of the learning curve when Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United departed undefeated but it threatens the patience when Stoke City join the ranks of the unscathed.</p> <p>Anfield delivered on that score, saving its wrath for Stoke's physicality, to earn another glowing tribute from Rodgers. But there is not an inexhaustible supply, as the last Liverpool manager to start a season with six points from seven games quickly discovered. The Liverpool of Rodgers and Roy Hodgson are world's apart in terms of style, promise and belief in the manager, yet it is now four Premier League home matches without a win and the only arduous aspect against Stoke was in the watching.</p> <p>Rodgers saw it differently. \"It was a physical game but there are no complaints from us,\" he said. \"I just thought it was brilliant to see the young players cope well in that type of environment. The attitude and application was fantastic but the final touch or pass wasn't always there. I also thought the crowd was fantastic. This is a club that has won only two league games at home in this calendar year and has not won two consecutive home league games in almost a year. So to get that sort of backing off the crowd was terrific. There aren't many other clubs which would get that.\"</p> <p>Liverpool could have pinched victory in the 90th minute when Martin Skrtel flicked against a post but this was an unconvincing display overall. The campaign to secure a penalty for Luis Su\u00e1rez this season also suffered a self-inflicted blow when the Uruguay international executed a ludicrous dive over Marc Wilson's foot in an attempt to win a second-half spot-kick. \"I haven't seen the incident so cannot comment,\" said Rodgers. Tony Pulis was more forthright. The Stoke manager said: \"Retrospective decisions are made on a Monday and Luis Su\u00e1rez should be punished. The one in the penalty box was an embarrassment and how he wasn't booked I don't know.\"</p> <p>Stoke ended the day with six bookings and a \u00a325,000 FA fine as a consequence. Liverpool were infuriated by the visitors' approach but their own inability to hurt opponents should concern them more.</p> <p>Injury cost Michael Owen a place in the squad and Anfield an opportunity to bait their former striker. But another former Liverpool player almost made a quick impact. Charlie Adam seized on a back-pass from Nuri Sahin after the on-loan midfielder found himself with few options when collecting a short goalkick from Jos\u00e9 Reina, under orders to play his way out from the back. The Liverpool keeper smothered Adam's shot at close range.</p> <p>The moment again demonstrated how Rodgers' instructions remain a work in progress and how, by pressing the Liverpool midfield when Reina takes possession, their play can be easily disrupted. It was repeated when Steven N'Zonzi intercepted another Reina clearance \u2013 seconds after being told by Pulis to \"get on Sahin\" \u2013 and Michael Kightly's chip forced Liverpool's keeper into a redeeming tip-over save.</p> <p>Stoke had also gone close when Glen Whelan's free-kick flashed across goal and Skrtel hooked clear as Peter Crouch lurked at the back post. Liverpool's first threat took 27 minutes to arrive, Asmir Begovic pushing away Steven Gerrard's drive from 30 yards, but as the Spaniard Suso grew into his first league start at Anfield and Su\u00e1rez began to find space outside the Stoke area, their performance improved greatly. Chances, however, remained scarce.</p> <p>Liverpool were preoccupied by perceived leniency from the referee, Lee Mason, as Stoke responded to their opponents' recovery through fair means and foul. Some grievances were imagined but not those against Robert Huth. The German defender appeared to stamp on Su\u00e1rez early on and also escaped a booking when he clattered into Su\u00e1rez's ankle in the centre circle. Less than 10 minutes later he brought down the Uruguay international in mid-flight and was shown yellow. It could easily have been his second.</p> <p>Pulis's team were on the back foot throughout the second half and Glen Johnson twice went close to opening the scoring, the first a shot from distance saved by Begovic and the second, more inviting, when sent clear by Gerrard's pass only to loft his effort over. Raheem Sterling side-footed against the outside of a post, Su\u00e1rez shot inches wide after a good run and, finally, Skrtel shaved the woodwork.</p> <p>But this was an afternoon when the absence of a Plan B \u2013 otherwise known as Andy Carroll \u2013 cost Liverpool. \"I don't really do the desperation thing in the last 10 minutes where you're kicking it long,\" was Rodgers' response to that.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Ryan Shawcross (Stoke City)</p>",
  "<p>Dance, performance art or music: the duets created by <a href=\"http://www.jonathanburrows.info/\" title=\"\">Matteo Fargion and Jonathan Burrows</a> occupy a niche somewhere between the three, and it's partly a matter of habit that they're given to dance critics to review \u2013 Burrows started his career with the Royal Ballet. In this year's <a href=\"http://www.danceumbrella.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dance Umbrella</a>, however, no less than five of their duets are being shown, and around them Burrows as guest \"curator\" has assembled a range of experimental work that similarly dodges the question of genre.</p> <p>Much of it is unknown to the audience, and the atmosphere around the festival's opening night suggests that Umbrella was ready for something new. So lively was the buzz, it even survived the dour solo by <a href=\"http://www.metteedvardsen.be/index.html\" title=\"\">Mette Edvardsen</a>, which opened the evening. For 25 minutes Edvardsen mimes a woman doing domestic tasks around her flat. And with each gesture she not only names the object and action (\"table\", \"push\", \"there\", \"better\" ) but repeats each word six or eight times, on an incantatory loop. Black may be the physical equivalent of concrete poem, but while its concept has an intriguing resonance, there's a nagging inevitability in Edvardsen's handling of it that makes for swiftly diminishing returns. The difference between conceptual art and theatre may all be in the timing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txU1tK1YylE\" title=\"\">Andros Zins-Browne</a> promises, winningly, to give us a trio of cowboy dancing on a giant inflatable set. Yet The Host opens with such unforgiving slowness (just the sound of pumping air) that my anxious neighbour has to ask whether this is the actual show.</p> <p>Once the inflatable is up and bouncing, however, the ferocity of the air supply transforms it into a dramatically turbulent presence \u2013 a herd of buffalos, a bucking bronco, a raging sea. As the three men wrestle to remain upright, there's a very watchable virtuosity involved in their struggles, as well as a convincing play of metaphors about our battles to tame the environment.</p> <p>By far the best of the evening is Fargion and Burrows's funny and clever One Flute Note. The two men begin by calling out requests for music \u2013 \"Three drum rolls\", \"45 pianos\" \u2013 as if ordering up a delivery of tools. Gradually, the sounds cohere into a kind of score to which Burrows performs fragments of dance, yet the more complex the material becomes the harder he and Fargion have to work to keep track of its construction. It's a challenging meditation on form and memory, but performed with such a droll tension that it's also a deliciously entertaining kind of dance theatre.</p>",
  "<p>Some of Britain's sharpest journalists seem to be getting fed up with innovation.</p> <p>This week, Martin Wolf, the godfather of British economic journalists, claimed that the economy is stagnating <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/78e883fa-0bef-11e2-8032-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">because modern innovations don't measure up to the breakthroughs of the 20th century</a>. Cars and flushing toilets, he says, are a bigger deal than Facebook and Twitter. The Guardian's Aditya Chakrabortty <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/01/innovation-who-dare-oppose\" title=\"\">went a step further</a>, arguing that today's innovations are unusually shallow and silly (do we need bigger plasma TVs when Africans are dying of malaria?) and that the spectacle of politicians traipsing round Shoreditch startups and talking about innovation is embarrassing.</p> <p>As someone who traipses around startups from time to time and who researches innovation the rest of the time, I'm not convinced. The potential of innovation to transform our lives is as great as it has ever been, and government has an important role to play in creating the conditions for it.</p> <p>Let's look first of all at the question of whether innovation can still deliver the goods. This matters a lot for the economy, since in rich countries most growth is the result of innovation (our <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/reports/assets/features/the_innovation_index\" title=\"\">Innovation Index</a> showed it was responsible for two-thirds of the UK's growth since 1990). Wolf and Chakrabortty both reference an <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18315.pdf?new_window=1\" title=\"\">influential new paper by economist Robert Gordon</a>, who suggests that the past 40 years of new technologies aren't a patch on the great innovations of the past. But all this assumes that the IT revolution we've seen over the last 30 years is fully played out. This would come as a surprise to pioneers of <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/indepth/making-the-future\" title=\"\">personal manufacturing</a> or <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/9755718.stm\" title=\"\">self-driving cars</a>, or to patients using technology to revolutionise healthcare. Perhaps the lesson is that if you want to know about the future benefits of technology, ask an engineer, not an economist. It's no surprise that Brian Arthur, for 30 years one of the world's most thoughtful commentators on technology and economics, is an engineer \u2013 and for what it's worth, he thinks we're only <a href=\"http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/The_second_economy_2853\" title=\"\">halfway through the IT revolution</a>.</p> <p>But does all this innovation really improve our lives? Isn't modern innovation about creating useless trash and trinkets, like the self-sorting socks and giant televisions that Chakrabortty describes? Yes and no. Like making sausages, innovation is not always an edifying thing to watch. It's inherently uncertain, and that means that most innovations will be useless, or tawdry, or even downright harmful. But it was ever thus. The golden age of Thomas Edison and Henry Bessemer also gave rise to wonders like the <a href=\"http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/quackstory.htm\" title=\"\">Revigator</a>, which would enrich drinking water with radioactive radon gas, or the hosts of quack remedies that filled the pages of Victorian newspapers. Looking at the worst innovations of a given age tells us little about whether innovation is in a healthy state.</p> <p>So we shouldn't be pessimistic about innovation. But neither can we take it for granted. Governments can make it easier or harder for innovation to flourish. Countries like Finland, South Korea, Israel and Taiwan have made innovation a priority \u2013 making it easier for new businesses to start up, investing in education and research, and helping bridge the \"valley of death\" between invention and commercialisation. The United States, which we like to think of as a bastion of market liberalism, invests tens of billions of taxpayer dollars each year in technologies through institutions ranging from the vast National Institutes of Health to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which gave rise to the internet, the graphical user interface, the global positioning system and the self-driving car. Innovation doesn't come from the government. But without good public policy, it won't thrive.</p> <p>So politicians should talk more about innovation, not less. Politicians from Finland or Korea would find it astounding that a senior politician could propose taking the proceeds of the 4G spectrum auction, the fruits of decades of technological innovation, and investing it not in the next generation of technology but into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19779395\" title=\"\">stamp duty tax breaks</a>. Investment in innovation has fallen by \u00a324bn since 2008. If we want economic recovery, our leaders should be spending less time debating Plan A and Plan B, and more on innovation.</p>",

But the large number of undecided voters and strong turnouts at opposition rallies have given late momentum to the challenger, Henrique Capriles, who has a genuine chance of an upset.</p> <p>With Venezuela sitting on the world's largest oil reserves and Ch\u00e1vez a leading figure in the resurgence of the political left in Latin America, the vote will have an impact on the global economy, energy supplies and regional geopolitics.</p> <p>But for most of the country's almost 19m voters, the key concerns are the alarming rise in the murder rate, the redistribution of oil wealth and the personality and health of the man who has led them for the past 13 years.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 who was due to vote during the morning in the revolutionary stronghold of the 23 de Enero barrio \u2013 has called his challenger a candidate from the extreme right and warned that \"all the country could lose, even the rich\" if there were a change of government.</p> <p>\"The middle classes should vote for Ch\u00e1vez because we are a guarantee of stability, peace, national development\", he said in a recent broadcast. In contrast, Capriles \u2013 who was scheduled to cast his ballot soon after noon in an upmarket neighbourhood of west Caracas \u2013 has tried to present himself as a centrist who can unify the nation. Declaring himself a David facing a Goliath, he has described Ch\u00e1vez as a formidable contender and promised to continue his poverty relief programs.</p> <p>Poll predictions have ranged from a 25-point landslide for Ch\u00e1vez to a six-point win for Capriles. With the president debilitated by an almost year-long battle with cancer, the recent momentum appears to have been with the opposition. It will not be clear until late on Sunday whether it has done enough to close the ground on one of the most charismatic and controversial campaigners in Latin American history.</p> <p>Both camps predict victory but have said they will accept the results, whatever the outcome. However, analysts fear a narrow win for either side could spark accusations of fraud and street violence. This has put the voting system under intense scrutiny, but it appears robust. External observers and domestic analysts have lauded the procedure as one of the most sophisticated systems in the world.</p> <p>Voters first register themselves by inputting their name, national identity number and thumbprint into a console. They then cast an electronic vote for their preferred party candidate on a touchscreen. Their vote enters the central counting system and is also printed so that they can confirm that it has been recorded properly before putting this hard copy in a ballot box \u2013 more than half the contents of which will later be cross-checked with the electronic data to ensure the system has not been hacked.</p> <p>Voters must then sign a form to confirm they have cast a vote. Before they leave, the little finger on their left hand is marked with indelible purple ink so they cannot return to vote a second time.</p> <p>\"This system is 100% fraud proof and has been recognised as such by outside political institutions,\" said Luis Guillermo Piedra, of the National Electoral Council.</p> <p>Former US president Jimmy Carter has described the system as superior to that of the US. His Carter Centre, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has noted that many Venezuelans are concerned that a new electronic voting system might enable authorities to tell how they voted, exposing them to retaliation if they vote against Ch\u00e1vez. \"This concern has no basis, however,\" the centre said. \"The software of the voting machines guarantees the secrecy of the vote.\"</p> <p>There is less certainty about what happens outside the voting booths. The opposition have lodged 110 complaints about alleged abuses of election laws by the Ch\u00e1vez campaign, mostly relating to his domination of airtime on public broadcasting channels and use of funds, staff and other resources from state-owned enterprises. They also fear that armed militias may put pressure on voters before they go to the polls, though there have been no reports of this to date.</p>",
  "<p>Aside from the more tragic Ken-hate cultists, few observers doubted that a victory for the Labour candidate at the mayoral election in May would have resulted in his promised 7% public transport fares cut coming into effect from 7 October - \"today\" as it also known. Ken Livingstone's pledge was too upfront and specific to have been fudged, and the view among the dispassionate and numerate was that, for all the pressures on Transport for London's budgets, he could have held the financial line for the first two years of his term before things got complicated. </p> <p>My hunch - it's no more than that - is that Livingstone would, in part, by then have been banking on the threat of an impending Labour government to help him out. A struggling Tory-led administration, desperate to avoid losses in the capital where they failed to gain as many seats as they'd hoped for in 2010, would have had good reason to keep the capital's fare-payers sweet by making sure the necessary funding was supplied. And then the two Eds would have come to the rescue. </p> <p>So much for guess work. Here's a sound urban policy principle instead: the cheaper their public transport is to use, the better big cities do. Livingstone's grasp of this core reality is a prime example of why his understanding of how London can thrive and grow is deeper and more coherent than that of Boris Johnson, whose transport programme has always been a dogs dinner of bones thrown to client groups: affronted private motorists; affluent West Londoners; subsidy-phobics; corporations in search of <a href=\"http://www.mayorwatch.co.uk/boris-fails-to-deliver-no-cost-to-taxpayer-cable-car/201117067\">something-for-nearly-nothing</a> sponsorship deals.</p> <p>As the time for Johnson's 2013 fares package approaches - yet more inflation-plus hikes are widely anticipated - it's worth reflecting once again on the low standing of London in the world league table of fares. In the past three years surveys have found visitors <a href=\"http://www.insights.org.uk/articleitem.aspx?title=Visitor%20Perceptions%20of%20Public%20Transport%20in%20London\">dissatisfied with them</a> and London <a href=\"http://www.priceoftravel.com/595/public-transportation-prices-in-80-worldwide-cities/\">comparing badly</a> on price with most big cities around the world. </p> <p>Even the <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/05/the-evening-standard-campaigning-for-boris/\">Evening Boris</a> reported <a href=\"http://politics.standard.co.uk/2012/01/how-londons-fares-compare-with-other-big-cities-you-guessed-it-theyre-higher.html\">earlier this year</a> that it costs more to get around in London than in any other large European or American metropolis. This is bad for most Londoners, bad for tourism, bad for the environment and bad for London's economy. And the response of London's mayor is to make it worse.</p>"
