  "<p>You might be fooled into thinking that election day only features the presidential race. Nothing could be further from the truth. Americans will be voting on a whole host of local and statewide elections that will have a great effect both on their local communities and the national landscape.</p> <p>I'm not going to try to cover the House of Representatives: if you're interested in coverage of those, you can check the <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political</a> or <a href=\"http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/\">Rothenberg Political</a> report. My own estimation, as it has been throughout this entire campaign, is that the Republicans will retain control of the House with room to spare.</p> <p>I will, however, run down some Senate races here. At the beginning of the year, Republicans looked primed to take the four seats necessary to win an outright majority in the United States Senate. That's when moderate Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine decided to retire, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/05/angus-king_n_2075691.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">leaving the seat open</a> for Democratic-leaning Independent former Governor Angus King. It's been all downhill since then for Republicans: poor Republican candidates who have made gaffe after gaffe, and good Democratic ones have left the GOP Senate effort staggering.</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats look to split fairly equally the ten Senate seats discussed in detail in this article. All told, it looks like Democrats will maintain control of the Senate with 53 seats +/-2 (out of 100).</p> <p>To get more of an idea of how the Senate races will breakdown, including what times polls close, the polling averages and key swing counties, see below. I start with the earliest poll closing times. Keep in mind that swing counties are more difficult to pinpoint in Senate than presidential races, since swings can change from midterm (when these seats were last up for election) to presidential year and depending on whether an incumbent is running or not.</p> <p><strong>Group 1: poll closing at 7pm ET (Indiana's eastern counties close at 6pm ET)</strong></p> <h2>Indiana (incumbent Republican Richard Lugar defeated in primary)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Joe Donnelly (Democrat) +3.7 points</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population (in every case, percentage points more Democratic than state in 2008 presidential election):</em> Allen (-5.4), Madison (+5.6), Vanderburgh (+1.5)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Lake County on the Northwest Illinois Border, Marion Country (Indianapolis) in the center of the state, Monroe County (Bloomington home to Indiana University) in the southwest</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Indianapolis suburbs such as Hamilton, Hendricks, and Johnson County, rural areas that dominate the state outside the major population centers, and the South Bend (home to Notre Dame) suburb of Elkhart County</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884345\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352152746697/mourdockt.jpg\" alt=\"richard mourdock\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Mourdock (R-IN) Photograph: richardmourdock.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republicans had this seat locked with long-time GOP Senator Richard Lugar. Then, conservative challenger State Treasurer Richard Mourdock took out Lugar in the Republican primary.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee, Congressman Joe Donnelly, decided to take a run at the Senate seat after his House district was redrawn, becoming more Republican. Donnelly is no \"progressive\", earning endorsements in the past from the National Rifle Association and called \"anti-choice\" on the issue of abortion by Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>The race had been a close battle, with Mourdock holding a small edge in this reddish state. It turned in Donnelly's favor after Mourdock made an ill-advised remark on the subject of rape and God in a recent debate. Unless the polls are wrong, expect Donnelly to win and for Democrats to gain a seat.</p> <h2>Virginia (Democratic incumbent Jim Webb retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Tim Kaine (Democrat) +2.0pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Henrico (+5.9), Loudoun (+2.0)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Northern Suburbs of Washington, DC, including Arlington, Alexandria City and Fairfax County, and Richmond City in the south-east</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Richmond suburbs of Chesterfield and Hanover, south-western Roanoke County and pretty much all the southern rural areas and western areas bordering the Appalachians</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884346\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352153739284/timkaine.jpg\" alt=\"tim kaine\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Kaine (D-VA) Photograph: virginiacops.org</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm not sure you can have two more different types of politicians than George Allen and Tim Kaine. Allen, known for wearing cowboy boots and cowboy hats, is a former governor and senator who lost his re-election bid to the senate in 2006 after <a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/06/george-allen-im-really-sorry-about-that-whole-1.php\">making comments towards an Indian American that were viewed as racist</a>.</p> <p>Kaine is the type of politician who would follow King Solomon's advice and divide the baby if he could. This triangulating \"middle-ground\" stance came across awkwardly during a debate earlier this year when <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/20/tim-kaine-47-percent-income-tax_n_1900567.html\">he said he would be open to federally taxing all Americans</a>, which would include the poor and elderly. He won the governor's mansion in 2005 on the strength of the new population growth in the north. He recently served as head of the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>This race is very tight and either candidate could win. Kaine seems to be running a little ahead of Obama in the state. Still, there aren't many split tickets to be had in the Old Dominion. I would think whichever party wins the presidential election here is likely to win the Senate election as well.</p> <p><strong>Group 2: poll closing at 8pm ET</strong></p> <h2>Connecticut (independent Democratic incumbent Joseph Lieberman retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Chris Murphy (Democrat) +6.2pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Middlesex, (+0.6), New London (-1.6), Windham (+0.6)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> they do well in all the cities that dot the landscape, such as Bridgeport in Fairfield County.

Republican Linda McMahon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/nyregion/linda-e-mcmahon-has-spent-nearly-100-million-in-senate-races.html\">has outspent Democrat Chris Murphy into the ground</a>, thanks to her family fortune earned through World Wrestling Entertainment. McMahon is conservative on fiscal issues and a moderate on social issues (ie she's pro-choice and has an unclear position on gay rights).</p> <p>Murphy is currently a congressman from Connecticut's 5th district. In comparison to McMahon's unique background, he's a relatively boring politician. Murphy's a lawyer who's both socially and fiscally liberal. You might say he is the type of candidate you'd expect to win in a blue state such as Connecticut.</p> <p>McMahon was able to keep this race close through advertising. She hit the relatively unknown Murphy on past financial problems and a poor congressional attendance record. But like her race against the better known, current Senator Dick Blumenthal in 2010, McMahon looks to fall victim to Connecticut's blue tint. Obama won't win the state in a blowout, yet it should be enough to carry Murphy across the finish line.</p> <h2>Massachusetts (Republican incumbent Scott Brown running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Elizabeth Warren (Democrat) +4.5pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Bristol (-2.6), Hampden (-0.5), Middlesex, (+4.3)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Berkshire, Franklin and Hampshire County in the west, along with Suffolk (Boston) in the east </p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Barnstable and Plymouth in the south-east, along with Worcester in the center of the state</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154090928/Elizabeth-Warren.jpg\" alt=\"elizabeth warren\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Photograph: elizabethwarren.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm not sure there has been a more fascinating race to watch unfold than this highly-financed affair. Republican incumbent Scott Brown <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0110/31674.html\">shocked</a> the world when he won a special election to replace liberal icon Ted Kennedy in 2010. Brown did so by combining a favorable national environment with moderate positions and seriously impressive retail campaign skills</p> <p>Democrat Liz Warren isn't exactly a moderate: she's an old-school liberal who isn't afraid to voice her position on the need for the rich to pay a fairer share of taxes. Warren's bid to become director of the Consumer Protection Bureau <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/160900/house-gop-escalates-attack-elizabeth-warren-consumer-bureau\">failed when Republicans stalled her nomination</a>. Republicans may very well regret helping redirect this Harvard law professor's energies to winning one of their Senate seats.</p> <p>Brown and Warren bounced back and forth in the polls all year. Brown took a lead late in the summer because of questions surrounding Warren's American Indian background and how it impacted her being hired at Harvard. Warren regained the edge after being featured at the Democratic National Convention. She's held onto the lead in most polls, and is now the favorite.</p> <h2>Missouri (Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Claire McCaskill +7.5pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Clay (-0.5), Jefferson (+2.7)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Boone County (home to the University of Missouri in the center), Jackson (Kansas City) in the west and St Louis City and County in the east </p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> pretty much everywhere else, including Greene (Springfield) and the St Louis suburb of St Charles County</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884349\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154282707/Todd_Akin.jpg\" alt=\"todd akin\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Todd Akin (R-MO) Photograph: Wikipedia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a gimme for the Republicans. Incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill had all sorts of financial ethics problems including <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51675.html\">taxes on a personal airplane</a>. She also faced an electorate that has become increasing Republican over the years. McCaskill's approvals had been in the toilet, and then she saw her opening.</p> <p>Republicans had a competitive primary, and the Democrat McCaskill decided to spend money pumping up Republican Congressman Todd Akin. It worked, spectacularly.</p> <p>Akin won the primary and immediately repaid the favor: in a television interview, Akin spoke of \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\">legitimate rape</a>\" and about the ability of the body to prevent pregnancy from rape. That turned a small Akin lead in the polls into a McCaskill edge.</p> <p>Akin refused to step down despite pleas from national Republicans. He's been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/newt-gingrich-raising-cash-profile-for-gop-rep-akins-challenge-of-mo-sen-mccaskill/2012/10/30/8d119932-22a8-11e2-92f8-7f9c4daf276a_story.html\">boosted</a> by one-time Republican presidential nominee Newt Gingrich. That hasn't been enough. McCaskill has held onto the lead and looks set to win. The only question is whether Mitt Romney's strong standing in the state can bring disaffected Republicans currently voting for Libertarian Senate nominee Jonathan Dine back to the Akin clan.</p> <p><strong>Group 3: poll closing at 9pm ET</strong></p> <h2>Arizona (Republican incumbent Jon Kyl retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Jeff Flake (Republican) +3.8pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Maricopa (-1.9), Pinal (-5.8)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Pima (Tuscon) in the south, in the American Indian regions of Coconino (Flagstaff) in the north and Apache in the north-east</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Mohave in the north-west and Yavapai in the center</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884350\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154480676/carmona.jpg\" alt=\"richard carmona\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Carmona (D-AZ) Photograph: carmonaforarizona.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's no better example of a race that has flown underneath the radar than this one.

Democrats have argued that the growing Latino population, along with a high American Indian presence, would put this state in play. It hasn't on the presidential level, but it <em>has</em> for the Senate.</p> <p>Fiscal libertarian Republican Jeff Flake had held a small lead in the polls for most of the year. He's also a Mormon in a state with a good-sized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints population. Democrat Richard Carmona brandishes bipartisan bonafides for <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/about/previous/biocarmona.html\">having served as surgeon general under President George W Bush</a>; he had actually been recruited to run as a Republican by some party leaders in Arizona. Painting Flake as an extremist, Carmona has turned his small deficit in the polls into a tie, or even slight edge.</p> <p>Flake, aided by National Republicans, fired back. They pointed to Carmona's past unflattering interactions with female co-workers, including an ad in which one former colleague called him \"scary\". Carmona didn't help himself when he referred to a male debate moderator as \"<a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/19/carmona-calls-male-debate-moderator-prettier-than-candy-crowley/\">prettier</a>\" than CNN's Candy Crowley.</p> <p>Flake has regained his edge, and will likely hold onto this Republican seat. </p> <h2>Wisconsin (Democratic incumbent Herb Kohl retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Tammy Baldwin (Democrat) +0.7pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Kenosha (+4.2), Outagamie (-2.3), Racine (-6.7), Winnebago (-2.3)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Dane (Madison and the University of Wisconsin) in the south-central, La Crosse in the west and Milwaukee in the south-east</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Ozaukee, Walworth, Washington and Waukesha in the south-eastern Milwaukee suburbs</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884351\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154650005/tammybaldwin.jpg\" alt=\"tammy baldwin\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) Photograph: Wikipedia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The LGBT community is likely to have a historic evening on Tuesday, and aside from marriage equality ballot measures elsewhere, one of their victories might be in the Badger State.

Few, including myself, thought that her liberal voting record would play in Wisconsin. It looks like we may have been wrong.</p> <p>Part of our confidence was because well-liked former Governor Tommy Thompson emerged from a very competitive Republican primary. Thompson's record of bipartisan accomplishments as governor were playing well, but analysts missed something key: Thompson's lead was built on name recognition; his edge collapsed once the general election campaign began in earnest.</p> <p>Wisconsin has a recent history of electing true progressives to the Senate. Russ Feingold served three terms before being defeated for a fourth in the Republican wave of 2010. Baldwin looks to build on this tradition. She is holding a small lead, though Thompson isn't too far behind.</p> <p>This race could still go either way, but Baldwin is the slight favorite.</p> <p><strong>Group 4: poll closing at 10pm ET (North Dakota's eastern counties close at 9pm ET)</strong></p> <h2>Montana (Democratic incumbent Jon Tester running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Jon Tester +1.2pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Yellowstone (-4.1)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Cascade in the west-central, Gallatin (Bozeman home to Montana State University) in the south-west, Lewis and Clark (Helena) in the west-central and Missoula in the west</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Flathead in the north-west and Ravalli in the south-west</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884352\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154831416/Denny_Rehberg.jpg\" alt=\"denny rehberg\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denny Rehberg (R-MT) Photograph: Wikipedia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many races have had their ups and downs this year. Montana isn't one of them. Democratic incumbent Jon Tester and Congressman at-large Denny Rehberg (meaning he represents the entire state in the House of Representatives) have been locked in a tight contest since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>Tester won during the Democratic wave of 2006, thanks to a localized campaign that can only be described as brilliant. His flat-top haircut and farming background made voters feel like he was one of the boys, even though his political stances are slightly more liberal than the state's bent.</p> <p>Rehberg has taken pains to appear as a moderate voice in a state that may not be liberal, but isn't all that conservative either. Rehberg won't be out-done, either, on being a native Montanan. While Tester is a third-generation farmer, Rehberg is a fifth-generation rancher. Rehberg has had some issues <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2012/10/report-on-rehberg-boat-crash-released-147927.html\">involving statements</a> made to a court regarding the role alcohol played when a friend crashed a boat in 2009.</p> <p>Tester looks to have neutralized any advantage Rehberg might have had because of Romney's expected strong showing in the state. The polls are close: it really could go either way.</p> <h2>North Dakota (Democratic incumbent Kent Conrad retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Heidi Heitkamp (Democrat) +0.3pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> None</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Cass County (Fargo) and Grand Folks in the east</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Burleigh (Bismarck) in the center and Ward in the north-west</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884353\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352155024572/Heidi.Heitkamp.jpg\" alt=\"heidi heitkamp\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) Photograph: Facebook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's an argument in the political forecasting community on the role of candidates v fundamentals. North Dakota is an example of when candidates truly matter, though they may not be enough. Democrat and former state Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp has run a campaign for the ages. Pointing to her North Dakota roots and playing on the fact that North Dakota is actually a fairly moderate state in non-presidential politics, Heitkamp has turned an expected easy Republican victory into a heart-stopper.</p> <p>Republican at-large Congressman Rick Berg isn't a disaster of a candidate. He just isn't a very good one. While Heitkamp has tried her best to localize the race and focus on issues such as farming in a state that has many agrarians, Berg has tried to nationalize the race: Super Pacs have spent millions tying Heitkamp to national Democratic positions \u2013 and that seems to have had some effect.</p> <p>Berg has open the smallest of leads in this open Senate race, according to insider information. If that's right, it just goes to show that the fundamentals do matter. One has to think that if Berg wins on Tuesday, it will hold out an example of what might have been for other red-state Republicans involved in tight races this season, such as Richard Mourdock \u2013 if they had only kept their mouths shut.</p> <h2>Nevada (Republican incumbent Dean Heller running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Dean Heller +3.8pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Washoe (+0.1)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Clark County (Las Vegas)</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> pretty much everywhere outside Las Vegas and Reno (Washoe), including the Churchill in the west and Elko County in the north-east</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352155155283/Heller.jpg\" alt=\"dean heller\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Heller (R-NV) Photograph: Twitter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Republican Dean Heller was appointed to this seat in 2011. Heller is neither a well-known brand nor a political titan. He benefits from having done little to offend and from fitting in well enough with the state's middle-of-the-road political profile. Put another way, Heller hasn't done anything to make the normal swing voter want to throw him out of office.</p> <p>Democratic Congresswoman Shelley Berkley is also moderate, but does not have the benefit of a squeaky clean profile. She's been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/09/politics/house-ethics-berkley/index.html\">subject to attacks</a> over whether she used her leverage in the House of Representatives to keep her husband's kidney transplant center open, despite Medicare officials wanting to shut it down.</p> <p>Heller would likely win this race if everything else were equal. The issue is that Berkley is going to benefit from strong Democratic turnout backing President Obama in Berkley's Las Vegas congressional district. Berkley will also be helped out by Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid's \"get out the vote\" machine, which helped him defy the pre-election polls in the 2010 midterms. Heller will be relying on a good rural turnout, including a large Mormon vote coming out to support Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Either candidate could win, but polls show a slight lean towards Heller.</p>",

It's cold and the grass is heavy with dew, but thick stratus is building ahead of me, blanking out the blue. A wren shouts from a branch at eye level, and a knot of coots and mallards are busy on the river Lathkill, pivoting forward into the crystal-clear water. I see an elongated trout hanging in what appears to be thin air.</p> <p>On the far bank a doleful heron sits tucked up on the mossy branch of an ash tree. At this time of year, the ash can seem rather anonymous. Beeches on the steep hillside above are still gloriously bronze, whereas the mature ashes are now empty, save for their \"spinners\" \u2013 clumps of damp seedpods. Ash leaves are late appearing and, as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Step\" title=\"\">Edward Step</a> observed, \"Like Charles Lamb and his office hours, they make up for it by an early departure.\"</p> <p>Downstream from the village of Over Haddon, other species dominate but, as the white walls of the limestone dale close in, the powerful silhouettes of ash trees rise towards the brim of its southern wall like an army scaling the walls of a castle. Just before the ruined cottage of the 19th-century lead-mine agent Thomas Bateman, I arrive at an evenly spaced sequence of half a dozen mature specimens on the river's north bank. I cannot help but put my hands on the cold bark of the tallest.</p> <p>Nearby saplings, still with a few leaves, show the first cracks in their surface, which will deepen into the familiar diamond-patterned fissures I can feel under my palms. Not for the first time, I feel I'm running my hands over the skin of an elephant, a behemoth that prompts an affectionate calmness within me. On my way back, I pause to read a notice from Natural England telling me Lathkill Dale is a good place to find fungi. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ash-dieback\" title=\"\">The irony is too dark to provoke a smile</a>.

  "<p>This has been a great year for women in power in Africa with the election of a second female president, the appointment of the first female head of the African Union and not one, but two female Nobel prizewinners.</p> <p>In April we saw the election of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Banda\" title=\"\">Joyce Banda</a> as president of Malawi; in June, Gambia's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jun/14/fatou-bensouda-international-criminal-court\" title=\"\">Fatou Bensouda</a> was declared chief prosecutor of the international criminal court and in July <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18846210\" title=\"\">Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma </a>became the first female head of the African Union. This trio join Liberian president and Nobel prizewinner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/nov/02/liberia-johnson-sirleaf-women-politics-video\">Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf</a> (video), Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Head of Africa at the World Economic Forum Elsie Kanza and founder of the Ethiopian commodity exchange <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/eleni_gabre_madhin.html\" title=\"\">Eleni Gabre Madhin</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.ariselive.com/articles/arise-100-dynamic-women/128508/\" title=\"\">ARISE100</a> list of women shaping modern Africa launched in the US and worldwide this week. The magazine created the list to reflect the changes in relatively young states in Africa, where 16 countries have more female parliamentarians than the UK.</p> <p>The Rwandan parliament is made up of 56% women, while in the UK parliament women are languishing at a measly 22%. Rwanda is not a one off, in fact 16 African countries including South African (42%), Mozambique (39%) and Angola (38%) have a higher proportion of women in parliament than the UK.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the increasing visibility of African women in power translates to better prospects for women on the continent. \"The fact that we've now had three female heads of state shows that we are making progress,\" says Hadeel Ibrahim, executive director of the Mo Ibrahim foundation, whose annual Index charts good governance within Africa. \"If you look at our index, the area in which the most progress has been made is gender, but there's still clearly a long way to go,\" says Ibrahim. Lack of equality of opportunity \u2013 be it education or employment, poor maternal health, particularly in rural areas, and the fact that rape is being increasingly used as a weapon in conflict are just some of the frontline gender issues on the continent. For all the gains, women lead only two out of 54 African countries.</p> <p>It is too soon to say what difference their presence makes. A recent Gallup poll found that Rwandan women feel safer walking alone at night than UK women, for example, but in South Africa, where representation is also more equally split than in the UK, rape statistics are still shockingly high.</p> <p>More women in positions of power may lead to these issues being pushed higher up the political agenda, but for these conversations to be meaningful they must also include men. \"One of my frustrations in talking about gender on the continent is that it's always women talking about women; there aren't enough conversations about men, because in the end, women aren't beating themselves, they're not raping themselves, and we're not going to deal with these inequalities unless we understand what is frustrating and holding back our young men,\" says Ibrahim. There may be much more work to be done, but there are also many signs that the west should reconsider its image of what African power looks like.</p> <p><em>Hannah Pool is associate editor of Arise magazine</em></p>",
  "<p>Here's a remarkable thing. Neither Mitt Romney nor Barack Obama \u2013 with the exception of one throwaway line each \u2013 have mentioned climate change in the wake of hurricane Sandy.</p> <p>They are struck dumb. During a Romney rally in Virginia on Thursday, a protester held up a banner and shouted \"What about climate? That's what caused this monster storm\". The candidate stood grinning and nodding as the crowd drowned out the heckler by chanting \"USA! USA!\". Romney paused, then resumed his speech as if nothing had happened. The poster the man held up? It said \"End climate silence\".</p> <p>While other Democrats expound the urgent need to act, the man they support will not take up the call. Barack Obama, responding to his endorsement by the mayor of New York, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\" title=\"\">mentioned climate change last week</a> as \"a threat to our children's future\". Otherwise, I have been able to find nothing; nor have the many people I have asked on Twitter. Something has gone horribly wrong.</p> <p>There are several ways in which the impact of hurricane Sandy is likely to have been exacerbated by climate breakdown. Warmer oceans make hurricanes more likely and more severe. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, increasing the maximum rainfall. Higher sea levels aggravate storm surges. Sandy might not have hit the United States at all, had it not been for a blocking ridge of high pressure over Greenland, which diverted the storm westwards. The blocking high \u2013 rare there at this time of year \u2013 could be the result of the record ice melt in the Arctic this autumn.</p> <p>This might sound like the wisdom of hindsight. But in February the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n6/abs/nclimate1389.html\" title=\"\">Nature Climate Change</a> published an article warning that global warming is likely to \"increase the surge risk for New York City\". As storms intensify and the sea level rises, it predicted that storm surges previously described as 100-year events would become between five and 30 times as frequent.</p> <p>Four years ago, <a href=\"http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president_elect_barack_obama_to_deliver_taped_greeting_to_bi_partisan_gover/\" title=\"\">Obama pledged that</a> \"my presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change\". He promised a federal cap and trade system and \"strong annual targets\" to reduce carbon pollution. But he ran into a ridge of high pressure. His cap and trade bill was killed in the Senate in 2010.</p> <p>At a meeting in the White House in 2009, his strategists decided that climate change was a banned topic: it caused too much trouble. From then onwards, Obama would talk about clean energy and green jobs and improvements in fuel economy, but would seldom explain why these shifts were necessary. The problem with this approach is that you cannot engineer a sustained reduction of greenhouse gas emissions only by getting into clean energy: you also have to get out of dirty energy. And that requires statesmanship: active and persuasive engagement with the public.</p> <p>In April, Obama <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/ready-for-the-fight-rolling-stone-interview-with-barack-obama-20120425\" title=\"\">said that global warming</a> \"will become part of the campaign\" and that he would be \"very clear\" about how he would deal with it. It hasn't happened. There were a couple of noncommittal paragraphs in his speech to the national convention, during which he also boasted that \"we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we'll open more.\" There was more of the same in the Democratic platform (the party's manifesto). Otherwise, this remains the issue that dare not speak its name. For the first time since 1984, climate change wasn't mentioned in any of the presidential debates.</p> <p>This, remember, is after a year of climate disasters: the droughts and wildfires that devastated much of the continental interior of the United States, the Arctic meltdown, the superstorm that ripped through the Caribbean before piercing the financial and spiritual heart of the nation. You wonder what it takes.</p> <p>As for Romney, his contribution has been confined to mockery. Even as hurricane Isaac cut short the Republican national convention, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/31/mitt-romney-obama-climate-change_n_1846440.html\" title=\"\">he ridiculed Obama</a>, to the delight of the delegates, for wanting to stop the sea level from rising. It was a revolting spectacle, which, in the aftermath of Sandy, would have become a major liability, had climate change not been taboo.</p> <p>In the Republican party platform, \"climate change\" \u2013 yes, in quotes \u2013 is mentioned only once, to <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012GOPPlatform.pdf\" title=\"\">attack Obama for taking it seriously</a>. The platform commits the party to blocking all effective measures to curb it, and to developing new coal (which Romney now professes to \"love\"), the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and oil drilling on the outer continental shelf and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Planetary ruin, for the Republicans, seems no longer to be an unfortunate side-effect of development: now it looks almost like a desirable end in itself; a test of manhood and corporate muscle.</p> <p>Successive polls show that an effective response to climate breakdown will not lose votes. Votes are not the problem: the problem is money and traction. Anyone who tries to address this subject encounters a storm surge of attack ads, obstruction and manufactured fury.</p> <p>During the crucial year \u2013 2009 \u2013 in which the cap and trade bill was struggling through Congress and governments were preparing for the summit in Copenhagen, environmental groups threw everything they had at climate change. After massive fundraising efforts, a coalition of green NGOs managed to find $22m for federal lobbying. But Exxon alone outspent them with a casual flick of the wallet. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/01/exxonmobil-oil-profits-slump\" title=\"\">$27m it dropped into the counter-campaign</a> represented half of a day's profits. The other fossil fuel companies <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2010/08/pro-environment-groups-were-outmatc.html\" title=\"\">threw in a further $150m</a>. Without a major reform of both lobbying and campaign finance, the big money will keep winning. Protecting the planet and its people is impossible in a plutocracy.</p> <p>The Republicans in Congress have no choice but to keep obstructing or filibustering every means of addressing our foremost global crisis, for to alter their position would be to jeopardise their political funding. As David Roberts of <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-futility-of-climatespotting-no-matter-what-he-says-obama-cant-make-big-moves-on-climate/\" title=\"\">grist.org</a> points out, Obama has little incentive to talk about climate change when he knows that any promise he makes will be thwarted. All he can do is to \"fight for gridlock because gridlock is better than the alternative\".</p> <p>So the two candidates remain struck dumb. Speech fails them, action is abominable, they will not even raise their hands in self-defence. The world's most pressing crisis, now breaking down the doors of the world's most powerful nation, cannot be discussed.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012, to say that for the first time since 1984, climate change wasn't mentioned in any of the presidential debates.

  "<p>George Osborne, the chancellor, has joined forces with the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, to announce an international crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies.</p> <p>The intervention comes came as the business secretary, Vince Cable, weighed into the Starbucks tax affair by berating corporate behemoths for \"taking from the British economy and putting very little back\". According to a Reuters report last month, Starbucks has not paid tax in the UK for three years.</p> <p>Cable told the Guardian: \"At times of hardship, when tens of thousands of British companies are paying their basic tax, to discover that leading multinationals are getting away with it is not acceptable.\"</p> <p>Osborne said he and Sch\u00e4uble, meeting at the G20 finance ministers' summit in Mexico, had called for \"concerted international co-operation to strengthen international tax standards that at the minute may mean international companies can pay less tax than they would otherwise owe\".</p> <p>Neither was he eager to identity individual corporate culprits</p> <p>government sources said the spread of e-commerce, and the ponderous nature of international corporate tax rules had left governments trailing as multinationals shift profits around the globe.</p> <p>Osborne and Sch\u00e4uble said they would back work by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to identify possible gaps in tax laws.</p> <p>Trying to balance his defence of low tax rates with the need to act against firms that repeatedly pay virtually no tax, Osborne said: \"We want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes. The best way to achieve that is through international action that ensures strong standards, without pricing ourselves out of the global market.\"</p> <p>The joint statement by the two countries, a rare example of Anglo-German co-operation, admits, that \"international tax standards have had difficulty keeping up with changes in global business practices, such as the development of e-commerce in commercial activities.\"</p> <p>The two countries add: \"As a result, some multi-national businesses are able to shift the taxation of their profits away from the jurisdictions where they are being generated, thus minimising their tax payments compared to smaller, less international companies.\"</p> <p>In the statement, Britain and Germany say they expect the first report from the OECD at the next G20 meeting in Russia in February 2013. The two men agreed their joint approach when the chancellor visited Berlin on Thursday last week.</p> <p>The co-operation comes ahead of a meeting between David Cameron and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on Wednesday.</p> <p>Starbucks has paid only \u00a38.6m income tax since 1998 on \u00a33.1bn sales, thanks to reporting consistent losses. Cable said: \"It is worrying and frankly a bit of a disgrace that Starbucks is a tip of the iceberg.\"</p> <p>Pointing to similar arrangements among other multinationals with UK operations, he added: \"They are taking a lot of value out of the British economy and British consumers, and putting little in.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There appears to be a loophole in American legislation which encourages them to put their money through tax havens. And that is unacceptable from a UK point of view because they are taking from the British economy and putting very little back.\"</p> <p>Starbucks reiterated its claim that it has paid more than \u00a3160m in taxes over the past three years, including national insurance and business rates.</p> <p>Google said it complied with all UK tax rules. \"We make a substantial contribution to the UK economy through local, payroll and corporate taxes,\" said a Google spokesperson. Amazon did not return calls seeking comment.</p> <p>Britain has the lowest rate of corporation tax in the G7, and has cut its rate by more than any other G20 country over the past two years (from 28% in 2010 to 22% by 2014).</p> <p>Last year, around half of the \u00a3136bn taxes paid in the UK by the biggest businesses came from foreign-owned companies; while inward investment created or safeguarded more than 100,000 jobs.</p> <p>The HMRC has raised more than \u00a31.5bn since March 2010 through increased efforts to tackle transfer pricing. This aims to ensure multinationals pay the right amount of tax by determining the taxable profits of each company as if it were an independent entity trading at arm's length from other members of the same group.</p>",
  "<p>A dog barks as we walk up the scruffy front path. Gemma Ferguson, assistant headteacher at a large primary school, is taking seven-year-old Robert home for his lunch hour and a bit of time with his mum.</p> <p>A young woman opens the door. The dog leaps up at us and then bounds over the back of the sofa: one of the men sitting in the front room grabs at it. Glancing over, I'm startled to see a small baby on the sofa, right where the dog would have landed. The room smells of smoke and is cluttered with stuff heaped up against the walls.</p> <p>We leave Robert to eat his lunch. But the little boy is subdued. He has not smiled once, not on the journey home and not even when he saw his mum. She didn't smile or hug him, either.</p> <p>\"When he goes off on one, he's really violent,\" says Ferguson as she hurriedly drives back to school. \"Last week, he scaled the school gate. Then he started throwing things at cars. At that point I said I'd have to restrain him.\"</p> <p>Another member of staff will pick Robert up after he has had a short burst of the attention he craves from his mother. She has four other children and has been diagnosed with postnatal depression. Ferguson says she's barely coping, but \"what he needs and wants most is to have some time with her\", so this ferrying back and forth is the deal that has just been done to incentivise his good behaviour in class.</p> <p>As we drive back to the school, which is situated in a deprived part of a town in southern England, Ferguson continues to list the compounding disasters and disadvantage affecting just this one family.</p> <p>Robert's brother made a disclosure recently that he had been sexually abused. \"I referred that to Camhs (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) but because the family was too dysfunctional\" \u2013 Ferguson gives a wry smile \u2013 \"they said they couldn't take it on. So I referred mum to parenting classes. She's been, but I don't think she'll implement it.\"</p> <p>Last month in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/24/child-protection-schools-childrens-commissioner?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">an interview</a> with Education Guardian, the children's commissioner for England, Maggie Atkinson, said that schools needed to do more and act earlier to safeguard children who were at risk of neglect and abuse. Her remarks, made in the context of savage welfare and council cuts that she emphasised had not yet taken hold, provoked protest from teachers saying they were doing exactly that, and were working beyond capacity already.</p> <p>Many heads and senior teachers say that they receive virtually no support from statutory services until a child is at crisis point, and often their professional judgment is disregarded when they make a referral \u2013 which they do only in situations where they think a child is at serious risk. One head explains how hard she has had to work to get a response: \"In one instance of severe neglect it took me six telephone calls before social services went round \u2013 they only did so because one of the children told me the father was going to stab them and then himself. The police came to the school with the social worker, who favoured speaking to the mum and supporting her: it was the police who listened, spoke to the eldest child then took them into protective custody.\"</p> <p>Shadowing Ferguson for a day to find out the reality of the welfare issues she deals with is to plunge into a world of families poised on the edge of crisis and schools pumping money and staff time into trying to keep children from acute harm.</p> <p>This school has contacted its First Response social services team about 23 families so far this half term. Just seven of these referrals have been actioned. These are in addition to Caf (common assessment framework) and Taf (team around the family) meetings also taking place as a result of concerns about other children: these are instituted when a situation is not yet concerning enough to involve social services, and any actions recommended can be implemented only if a parent consents.</p> <p>Ferguson tells me about a girl whose anorexic and depressed mother can't show affection and doesn't feed her adequately, a girl who was unknown to the education system until she was six, a group of siblings who have arrived mid-term in a very upset state because their mother has just had to go into the local refuge, and a boy who has spent time in care and whose brother's 16-year-old girlfriend is giving birth today.</p> <p>It's a couple of days before half term, and Ferguson says that many of the children are \"wobbly\" at the prospect of having to spend so much time in their home environment. \"Wobbly\" is a word that's heard a lot from staff here. Despite working three days out of her week, supposedly in a Senco (special educational needs co-ordinator) role but actually as a welfare support worker, Ferguson knows that she can't prevent many of her pupils suffering substantial levels of neglect, or emotional and physical abuse. Their parents are too damaged for that.</p> <p>We head swiftly to her office to find a child's file for a meeting with the social worker who has just arrived. It's three inches thick, with contemporaneous reports made by teachers relating to suspicious marks and worrying conversations they've had with him. The social worker is clear that she is \"looking for specific examples of emotional abuse\". It's not difficult. The meeting takes half an hour; afterwards Ferguson rings a mother whose children's emotional state \u2013 and hence their ability to learn \u2013 is being badly affected by complex and distressing home circumstances. It's a taxing interaction with a parent who has taken offence at information about her being disclosed to a social worker, and takes 20 minutes. Then Ferguson goes into what she's expecting to be \"a difficult\" Caf meeting.</p> <p>She does not stop at any point in the day. She is constantly checking with children around school and in the \"nurture suite\" \u2013 for pupils so keyed up or upset when they arrive that they can't access normal lessons \u2013 about what is happening at home. Many headteachers now re-deploy staff to support children in this way, and some employ dedicated family-support experts to perform a function that increasingly goes way beyond prevention or the early intervention that the children's commissioner wants schools to perform.</p> <p>Families' needs, however, are becoming more extensive and complex, according to the senior staff interviewed for this article. Working in a variety of areas around the country, they list the usual, devastating suspects: mental ill health, domestic violence, alcohol and drug misuse, unemployment and poor parental education. Despite this, none of the staff interviewed had any doubt that the thresholds for social services to take action have risen.</p> <p>\"They will not touch anything now without a Caf, which is a waste of time as families either won't engage \u2013 in which case everything is dropped \u2013 or they just expect schools to cope with more and more,\" says a primary head.</p> <p>\"The Caf is now used to deal with situations that would previously have been accepted by social care,\" adds another head. He has employed a family-support worker and says that if budgets became more stretched he would lose classroom staff rather than her role, so great is his concern for pupils' welfare.</p> <p>\"Our practitioners are being expected to work with families with extremely complex needs,\" he says. \"There are families that fly just below the threshold, but are struggling a great deal. They may well have received support in the past, but now this may not be the case.\"</p> <p>Being \"triaged\" by a social services admin person when trying to refer a child, says an assistant head, \"makes you feel helpless \u2013 we're experienced professionals and we only phone when it's really necessary\".</p> <p>The response heads say they get from social care often depends, it seems, not on the seriousness of the concern, but on the resource levels of the local authority. Bruises will get a response: neglect \u2013 which can kill, and even in less acute manifestations can decimate children's life chances \u2013 has to be extreme for anything to be done.</p> <p>Some local authorities have as good as said they won't intervene unless children are at crisis point. In their local authority, notes Ferguson's headteacher, Susannah Elland, the \"child in need\" designation is no longer recognised. In terms of escalating seriousness, this comes just below putting a child on a protection plan.</p> <p>\"This term, we've had children move here who've been 'child in need' in their previous local authority, and because our council doesn't recognise that, they have to drop to a Caf,\" says Elland.</p> <p>If parents won't then engage with the Caf, she says, with some desperation, \"we have nothing official, and that child is still at significant risk\".</p> <p>All senior staff spoken to agree that when capped universal benefits start next April, already vulnerable and struggling families will be put under further strain, and the effects will be seen in pupils who will become more stressed, under-nourished, disrupted and unable to learn.</p> <p>Ferguson hasn't stopped all day. She'll be working on referral letters tonight, and emailing class teachers about what's going on in their pupils' lives so they understand better why they might be kicking off, or hungry, or silent, or withdrawn tomorrow.</p> <p>She does get angry, and sad. \"It's not our job to do all this,\" she says, \"but if we don't, the children will suffer.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Names and some potentially identifying details have been changed</p>",
  "<p>Last November, 70 Harvard economics students walked out of a lecture by their faculty head, <a href=\"http://hpronline.org/harvard/an-open-letter-to-greg-mankiw/\" title=\"\">Greg Mankiw</a>. Angry at the conservative nature of Harvard's economics course, they were suspicious of their lecturers' failure to predict the ongoing financial crisis, and their unerring faith in the theories that led to the crisis in the first place. So up stood the students, and out they went to join a march organised by Occupy Boston instead.</p> <p>It's this kind of campus reaction that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kalle-lasn\" title=\"\">Kalle Lasn</a> wants to inspire with his latest book, Meme Wars \u2013 the Creative Destruction of Neo-Classical Economics. \"I want to light a fire under the economic students around the world,\" he says. \"I&#xa0;can imagine a few of them asking: how come we are still being taught the old economics? Why did not even one in a hundred of you professors see the meltdown coming? It's an invitation to&#xa0;the students who get wind of the book to create a bit of a ruckus within the university.\"</p> <p>Lasn is the founder and editor of <a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org/\" title=\"\">Adbusters</a>, the very leftwing, very well-designed magazine that has railed&#xa0;against consumerism since 1989. Among&#xa0;other successful stunts, Adbusters has popularised TV Turnoff Week \u2013 where, as you would expect, millions try to avoid television for seven days. Then there's the annual Buy Nothing Day, which is again fairly self-explanatory. Both campaigns go hand in hand with what Adbusters is&#xa0;most famous for: culture-jamming, or&#xa0;subvertising, which sees the magazine's team create spoof versions of well-known adverts. It's also the organ that&#xa0;invented the concept of <a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/occupywallstreet\" title=\"\">Occupy Wall Street</a>, and Lasn is the&#xa0;man who first registered the movement's <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">website</a>.</p> <p>Like anyone involved in Occupy, Lasn doesn't want to be identified as its figurehead or posterboy. He is proud of the movement's horizontal structure, and has been running from the authoritarian left since he was a child. Born in&#xa0;Tallinn in 1942, his family fled the Russian invasion two years later. For the next half-decade, he lived in a German refugee camp, before spending the next two decades in Australia and Japan. Lasn made it to Canada in 1970, where he now lives on a small farm outside Vancouver, <a href=\"http://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/commentary/2011/10/12/adbusters-kalle-lasn-brilliant-flawed-genius-behind-occupy-wall\" title=\"\">apparently padding to work in wellington boots</a>. Before founding Adbusters, he made TV documentaries that critiqued capitalism. Yet he defines himself against consumerism, rather than with the old-school left.</p> <p>\"For the past 15 to 20 years, we at Adbusters have been saying we have to jump over the dead body of the old left,\" he says. \"I'm not all that interested in the political left, unless it's this new&#xa0;horizontal left that's coming out of&#xa0;Occupy.\"</p> <p>But Meme Wars is not, he stresses, a&#xa0;manifesto for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy-movement\" title=\"\">Occupy</a>, a movement often criticised for its lack of direction. It is nevertheless an attempt to do what Occupy couldn't: it's a radical economics textbook that Lasn hopes will spread the spirit of Occupy from the town square to the university campus. \"It was of the things that the Occupy movement didn't quite achieve, unlike in 1968 \u2013 the great moment in my life, when I became politicised,\" he says. \"For some weird reason, when almost the same thing [as 1968] happened in Zuccotti Park, and then spread around the world like it did in '68, it didn't really happen in the universities.\"</p> <p>The book is billed as an alternative textbook, and it certainly looks it. Adbusters pastiches adverts to satirise consumerism \u2013 and Meme Wars does something similar for economics primers. \"Darling!\" reads a subverted image of two 50s lovers. \"Let's get deeply into debt.\" Elsewhere, graphs that chart economic growth over the past half-century are overlayed with ones that show a simultaneous rise in depression and pollution. While the text's content is pretty dense, visually it has the look and feel of a messy scrapbook or graphic novel. There aren't even any page numbers: a rejection of what Lasn sees as the faux-rationalism of mainstream economics. \"That's deliberate. We don't like page numbers. It's one of the left-cortex things that you don't actually need if you want to understand something such as economics.\"</p> <p>Lasn sees three problems with conventional economics teaching. First: orthodox or neo-classical economics has brought the world to the brink of financial ruin. Second: by fostering a consumer culture, it has turned humanity into a selfish, anxious race. Third: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/15/economics-the-no-growth-future\" title=\"\">it fetishises economic growth</a> \u2013 even though this growth is ultimately destructive, since it both makes us unhappy and wreaks unsustainable havoc on the planet's natural resources. \"This is one of the most fatal flaws in neo-classical economics,\" says Lasn, in a delicate Estonian lilt that belies the passion of his argument. \"We cannot keep on selling off our natural capital and calling it income. It's the most <em>stupid</em> mistake of all \u2026 When they measure growth, they don't measure real progress.\"</p> <p>The \"they\" to which he refers is the economics establishment. People such as Harvard's Greg Mankiw, whose textbook, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-N-Gregory-Mankiw/dp/0538453052\" title=\"\">Principles of Economics</a>, is taught in many universities, and which \u2013 Lasn argues \u2013 helps entrench the values of orthodox economics in the minds of each successive generation of economists, who then use their influence to maintain the status quo inside governments.</p> <p>Lasn's modest hope is therefore to inspire the next generation to grab Mankiw and his brethren \"by the scruff of their neck and throw them out of power. In a sense, I am calling for a scientific revolution: a revolution where the new guard \u2013 the heterodox, maverick people who have been sniping for a long time \u2013 rise to the top and finally create a new kind of economics.\" Once that happens, Lasn argues, a new crop of economists will emerge \u2013 \"and they'll become economic advisers to the people running governments all around the world, and bit by bit the whole practice of economics can begin to <em>heave</em>.\"</p> <p>As Lasn himself acknowledges, his hopes are not new. In fact, Meme Wars is structured around the thoughts of leftwing economists who have been making these arguments for years. The book features interviews with <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105\" title=\"\">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, and essays by, among others, <a href=\"http://steadystate.org/eight-fallacies-about-growth/\" title=\"\">Herman Daly</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Akerlof\" title=\"\">George Akerlof</a>. \"We,\" says Lasn of his colleagues at Adbusters, who helped him edit the book, \"took all these people who we had fallen in love with over the years, and we put together a jigsaw puzzle of them.\"</p> <p>Meme Wars takes those existing radical arguments and uses them to flesh out what Lasn sees as a new(ish) brand of radical economics. Something that is humbler than the orthodox schools \u2013 that doesn't hubristically see itself as an exact, rational science, but a social one. Lasn suggests the concept of \"psychonomics\" \u2013 economics that takes into account human behaviour \u2013 or \"bionomics\", which bears in mind the cost of environment damage. \"There has been a maverick tradition out there that has been snapping at the heels of the dominant paradigm for a long time,\" he argues. \"But they haven't quite zeroed in on exactly what [the alternative] could be. And I thought of those two words.\"</p> <p>There is no faulting Lasn's ambition. \"At the risk of sounding a bit grandiose,\" he says, Meme Wars \"is an attempt to do something that actually could put humanity on a new path.\" Of course, it probably isn't quite as revolutionary as all that. Behavioural and no-growth economics already exist as concepts. Tim Jackson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/properity-without-growth-tim-jackson\" title=\"\">Prosperity Beyond Growth</a> and Ha-Joon Chang's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/29/ha-joon-chang-23-things\" title=\"\">23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism</a> are just two recent books that also contradict traditional economic ideas. But Meme Wars \u2013 with its unusual visuals and collation of today's main radical thinkers \u2013 is nevertheless a welcome addition to the fray. And if its unique graphics can turn a few more heads than its predecessors on campus, then&#xa0;so much the better.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781846146985,00.html#\" title=\"\"><em>Meme Wars: the the Creative Destruction of Neo-Classical Economics</em></a><em>, by Kalle Lasn/Adbusters, is published in the UK by Penguin \u00a319.99, and in the US by Seven Stories Press.</em></p>",
  "<p>Pricey American universities look a lot more Hogwarts than their British counterparts. As one of the 10 most expensive private colleges in the US, Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh almost oppresses visitors with neo-gothic grandness; yet it was the setting this September for one of the scratchiest academic arguments I have ever heard.</p> <p>I was a guest of Carol Goldburg, the director of CMU's undergraduate economics programme, who had gathered a few colleagues to give their take on the presidential election. Here were four top economists huddled round a lunch table: they&#xa0;were surely going to regale me with talk of&#xa0;labour-market policy, global imbalances, marginal tax rates.</p> <p>My opener was an easy ball: how did they think President Obama had done? Sevin Yeltekin, an expert on political economy, was the first to respond: \"He hasn't delivered on a lot of his promises, but he inherited a big mess. I'd give him a solid B.\"</p> <p>I threw the same question to her neighbour and one of America's most renowned rightwing economists, Allan Meltzer. He snapped: \"A straight F: he took a mess and made it even bigger.\" Then came Goldburg, now wearing the look of a hostess whose guests are falling out: \"Well, I'm concerned about welfare and poverty, and Obama's tried hard on those issues.\" A tentative pause. \"B-minus?\"</p> <p>Finally it was the turn of Bennett McCallum, author of such refined works as <a href=\"http://papers.nber.org/papers/w9837\" title=\"\">Multiple-Solution Indeterminacies in Monetary Policy Analysis</a>. Surely he would bring the much-needed technical ballast? Um, no. \"D: he's trying to turn this country into France.\"</p> <p>Some of these comments were surely made for the benefit of their audience: faced with a mere scribbler, the scholars had evidently decided to hold the algebra, and instead talk human. Even so, this was a remarkable row. Here were four economists on the same faculty, who probably taught some of the same students; yet Obama's reputation depended on entirely on who was doing the assessment. The president was either B or F, good or a failure: opposite poles with no middle ground, and not even a joint agreement of the judging criteria.</p> <p>It's hardly news that US politics is now so polarised. You watch either Fox or MSNBC; you read these blogs or those; you're an Occupier or a Born Again. And you never talk to the other side. The playwright Arthur Miller summed up this state of affairs best during the 2004 election: \"How can the polls be neck and neck when I don't know one Bush supporter?\" Even so, what I saw in the dining hall at Carnegie Mellon showed just how divided US politics has become: that even technical experts no longer share a common language.</p> <p>Explaining the Great Gulf is now a cottage industry, with experts serving up a&#xa0;variety of paperback-ready explanations. It's all to do with how arguments are framed (George Lakoff); it's false consciousness (Thomas Frank); birds of the same socio-political feather flock together (Bill Bishop's The Great Sort). The most recent and radical thesis has been advanced by the evolutionary psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who argues that liberals and conservatives have different mental wiring.</p> <p>So far, so completely lacking in history. Go back to the 60s and the sense of continuity between Republicans and Democrats was strong enough that sociologists such as Daniel Bell wrote about The End of Ideology. And very few analysts have done the obvious thing of putting together America's political polarisation with the other great trend of the past 30 years: the chasm that has opened up between the rich and the rest.</p> <p>Rather than ask why US politics is broken, a&#xa0;more obvious question is surely: how can a society this divided produce anything but political gridlock?</p> <p>In their 2006 book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Polarized-America-Ideology-Walras-Pareto-Lectures/dp/0262633612/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352197585&amp;sr=8-1\">Polarized America</a>, the political scientists Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal plotted the voting behaviour of elected representatives and their constituents, and compared them with the rise in inequality. They found an overwhelming link: as the US economy became more unequal from the 70s, its Congressmen and voters became increasingly extreme \u2013 and their incomes became an ever more reliable guide to their affiliations. The richest fifth of Americans are now 2.5&#xa0;times more likely to vote Republican than the bottom fifth, a trend that McCarty says didn't exist back in the 70s.</p> <p>And as the wealth gap increased, and voters became more polarised, the Republicans moved away from policies aimed at redistributing wealth&#xa0;and focused instead on cutting taxes and&#xa0;slashing regulation.</p> <p>This argument about voting with your wallet doesn't cancel out all the others about the role of values or religion. But the authors point out that even among evangelical Christians, the poor are far more likely to skew Democrat than those at the top. As for Congress, McCarty's vote-crunching leads him to pronounce this last parliament the most polarised since records began. And given that US inequality only intensified after&#xa0;the crash, there is little hope of any agreement on such issues as government spending or climate change.</p> <p>Supersize inequality leads to crashes, economists from the IMF to the Bank of England now agree. But it surely also corrodes democracy. One of Clinton's national security advisers, Richard Feinberg, observed: \"If a&#xa0;society fundamentally disagrees on fundamental issues \u2013 the nature of property and what&#xa0;constitutes a legitimate political system \u2013 democracy can't handle it.\" At the time, his words were a lecture to Latin American nations. Now they sound like a reproach to his own countrymen.</p>",

  "<p>Until a few months ago, 10-year-old Zhao Ai went hungry from dawn to dusk, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/china-rural-poor-left-stranded\" title=\"\">the two-hour trek between his mountain home and school</a>. Now he enjoys a free lunch with classmates.</p> <p>Like tens of millions of households in China, his family are farmers who live on meagre profits from the crops they can spare and wages sent back by relatives working in cities hundreds of miles away. In a land now dotted with skyscrapers and designer stores, they are scraping by in one of the poorest areas, a remote part of south-western Guizhou province. As others prosper, they fall further behind. Yet in the past decade, a string of measures have offered some relief: the abolition of agricultural tax and tuition fees, the rolling out of medical insurance that reimburses most of their bills, a 55-yuan monthly (\u00a35.50) pension for Zhao's grandfather, and now the school lunches.</p> <p>\"Compared to rich people, our life is not that good \u2013 but it is much better than before,\" said Zhao's grandmother, Xu Zuxian.</p> <p>As China prepares for its leadership transition, state media hail a \"golden decade\" under the incumbents. Critics call it a lost decade, rife with wasted opportunities for the economic, social and political reforms the country needs. They say Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao have maintained high growth \u2013 not an insignificant achievement, given the wider global economic woes \u2013 but failed to tackle the problems now accumulating thanks to that model.</p> <p>Yet others believe that for all the disappointments, the administration is leaving behind what could yet prove a significant political legacy: building the skeleton of a welfare state and attempting to put a shelf below those at the bottom of society.</p> <p>\"The government invested a lot of money in ordinary people's living standards \u2026 China is starting to enter the 'welfare China' stage, although it is still at quite a low level,\" noted Beijing-based scholar Deng Yuwen, in many ways an outspoken critic of the authorities' record.</p> <p>Wang Dewen, social protection economist with the World Bank in Beijing, added: \"The government has done a great job.\" At the beginning, the social insurance programme targeted urban workers, but it gradually extended to migrant workers and introduced rural medical insurance and pension programmes. \"They have set up ambitious objectives \u2026 They have mobilised resources from the whole society to achieve them.\"</p> <p>A decade ago, 147 million urban employees and 55 million rural residents had pension coverage. Now 229 million urban employees are covered, and 449 million rural and urban residents; 124 million are already receiving payments. A few years ago, barely 20% of rural dwellers had medical insurance; now 96% of the population are covered.</p> <p>While inequality has soared over the past decade \u2013 the gap between town and country has expanded, with rural dwellers enjoying less than a third of average urban incomes on official measures and perhaps as little as a fifth according to experts \u2013 research by Tony Saich of Harvard University found that satisfaction with the government had actually gone up between 2003 and 2011.</p> <p>Strikingly, significant increases were seen among the poorest and the wealthiest. \"When we started, those in the poorest categories were least satisfied with the local government,\" Saich said. \"That's where I think things like the <em>dibao</em> [a subsidy for the poorest] and some kind of medical insurance have improved their view.\"</p> <p>How much credit Hu and Wen deserve is a matter of opinion; their predecessors began some programmes and other leaders would presumably have sought to address the problems that emerged with China's development. \"But you also have to look at the individuals,\" said Saich. \"Hu has not spent most of his career in the glitziest parts of Shanghai and Beijing; he's been in quite poor areas \u2026 [I once heard] Wen say: 'I can't guarantee that I've been to every county in China, but I can guarantee that I've been to every poor county.'\"</p> <p>The significance of their legacy will depend on how their successors build upon it. \"There's been a foundation, but there is a long way to go,\" said Dorothy Solinger of the University of California Irvine. As an expert on the dibao, she points out: \"The whole programme remains miserable and very, very stingy.\" The urban expansion of the dibao was made under the previous leaders, she notes, and the urban poverty line \u2013 which is set in each city \u2013 worked out nationally at 15% of urban average disposable income last year, down from the high 20s a decade ago.</p> <p>Even at existing payment levels, there are obvious funding problems. The pensions of current retirees are being paid by new workers, for instance, said David Kelly, research director of Beijing-based consultancy China Policy \u2013 and the demographics are working against the system. China is ageing rapidly and its workforce is shrinking. In 2000, there were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/20/china-next-generation-ageing-population\" title=\"\">six workers for every person over 60</a>. By 2030, there will be barely two.</p> <p>Authorities must also address broader issues. Corruption and incompetence need to be tackled to ensure funds reach their intended beneficiaries: \"There are already cases of fraud and fingers in the till,\" warned Kelly.</p> <p>Many also believe that creating a proper welfare state will require a long-awaited overhaul of the <em>hukou</em>, the household registration system that defines people as urban or rural and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/15/china-migrant-workers-children-education\" title=\"\">allocates their rights to services such as education</a> accordingly. At present migrants \u2013 and their children, who inherit their parents' status \u2013 in effect become second-class citizens in cities.</p> <p>\"It's the hardest thing to touch because it involves popular sentiment. City dwellers don't want a wave of people coming to share the same benefits as them,\" warned Kelly.</p> <p>Developing a welfare state in China will require the support not just of China's new leaders \u2013 but of its citizens, too.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>An escalating row between solar panel makers stepped up a gear on Monday when China complained to the World Trade Organisation that Italy and Greece had unfairly favoured domestic suppliers.</p> <p>China, the world's largest solar panel maker, accused the European Union of breaching world trade rules only days after saying it would consider blocking imports of solar technology from Europe.</p> <p>It said the crux of its complaint centred on offers by Rome and Athens of higher electricity prices to solar power producers that use mainly locally sourced components.</p> <p>Concerns that the financial crisis would bring simmering protectionist disputes to the surface proved misplaced until this year. During 2012 the WTO received 25 complaints compared to eight in 2011. Analysts blame the downturn in global growth this year for sparking a series of disputes that range from the US and Mexico complaining about Argentinian import restrictions on meat and fruit to objections from Brazil over South African anti-dumping duties on Brazilian frozen meat.</p> <p>The biggest disputes involve the four major trading blocs \u2013 the US, China, Japan and the EU. Solar panels have become a flashpoint after Chinese panel makers maintained production despite a sharp slowdown in demand.</p> <p>Washington has come under intense pressure to raise tariffs on Chinese goods after firms objected to panels being dumped in the US market.</p> <p>Congress recently sanctioned sweeping restrictions on goods it says are dumped by China under rules allowing \"the application of countervailing measures to non-market economy countries\".</p> <p>China has responded with a series of complaints to the WTO, one of which appears to be the same complaint that the EU and Japan have brought against Canada for protecting its solar panel industry.</p> <p>\"The Chinese government has the right and the responsibility to fight for a fair international trade environment for China's solar industry,\" Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said in a statement.</p> <p>Shen said all countries should strengthen industry cooperation and reject short-term \"protectionist\" measures.</p> <p>By lodging its complaint, China triggers the formal process for a WTO dispute and, if talks with the EU fail to resolve the issue, after 60 days it could ask the global trade body to adjudicate.</p> <p>While Germany has built a strong domestic solar industry, much of it in the former communist region around Leipzig, Italy and Greece have struggled against local corruption and a reluctance among investors to build solar farms to replicate the same manufacturing base.</p> <p>However, the EU is the world's largest market for solar products and is a particular target for Chinese manufacturers.</p> <p>Tensions rose earlier this year after Chinese firms dropped their prices 30% after a long period of over-supply. EU countries accused the Chinese authorities of dumping artificially low cost panels that undermined domestic businesses.</p> <p>About 60% of China's exports of solar panels and components went to the EU in 2011, generating \u20ac21bn (\u00a317bn) and accounting for 7% of all Chinese exports to the region, according to Bloomberg.</p> <p>A group of 25 European companies, led by Germany's SolarWorld, filed a complaint with the European Commission in September, claiming Chinese rivals were unfairly benefiting from illegal subsidies.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012. The original referred to the former communist region around Liepzig rather than Leipzig. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Green jobs and the growing ranks of green businesses are one of the few bright spots of the UK's recession hit economy \u2013 environmental and low-carbon business now makes up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\" title=\"\">8% of the UK's GDP</a>, and provided a third of what growth the economy has seen.</p> <p>There are now nearly 1 million people employed in green jobs, from biofuels and electric car manufacturing to wind turbine installation, with more than 25,000 jobs created last year.

So why are so many in the government so reluctant to talk about it?</p> <p>The chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, usually keen to trumpet any signs of the economy picking up, has been notably silent on how well the green economy has fared. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/coalition-wind-farm-dispute-renewables\" title=\"\">David Cameron, forced into a defence of energy policy last week at prime minister's questions</a>, mentioned renewable energy on Wednesday but that was a rare event. Even the Liberal Democrat business secretary, Vince Cable, did not issue a press release this summer when his own department found that the green economy was the biggest single source of growth in the previous year.</p> <p>Andrew Raingold, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.aldersgategroup.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Aldersgate Group</a> of companies that includes Asda, BT and Microsoft, said the failure of senior ministers to champion the sector was \"very surprising\" and likely to put off investors.</p> <p>Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said the real reason the government had been reticent on the issue was that an increasing section of the Conservative party were antagonistic to anything associated with the environment \u2013 even if that involved economic growth. She said: \"The dawning reality is that David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/16/uk.conservatives?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">pre-election conversion to green issues</a> was nothing more than a PR stunt designed to trick people into thinking the Conservatives had changed, when in reality it was always same old Tory party.\"</p> <p>\"David Cameron's failure of leadership will cost UK plc dearly as we miss out on good-paying clean energy jobs and new low-carbon industries,\" she told the Guardian.</p> <p>Businesses are also frustrated at the lack of political attention and leadership, which they say is hindering attempts to raise investment from overseas. <a href=\"http://www.regwindpower.co.uk/meet_the_team\" title=\"\">Matt Partridge, development director at REG Wind Power</a>, said: \"We are on the cusp of either achieving [tens of billions of pounds] in investment or blowing it. I'm astonished that the government is not seeing this.\"</p> <p>Michael Heseltine, the former Tory minister, in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/heseltine-report-blasts-coalition-growth\" title=\"\">report on the economy on Wednesday</a>, commended the importance of wind energy to deprived regions such as the north-east. He said in his report: \"It goes without saying that a secure and affordable supply of energy is essential to everything we do. It also provides opportunities for growth. During a trip to the Humber I heard from everyone I met the importance to the region of investment in offshore wind. Similarly the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/may/15/severn-barrage-peter-hain-energy\" title=\"\">Severn Barrage</a> offers the possibility of both a long term source of energy and extraordinary economic regeneration.\"</p> <p>And he warned: \"Without real certainty about the UK's long-term energy policy, private investors simply will not risk the enormous sums of capital required to build our energy infrastructure. These problems will not go away. Just as with major infrastructure projects, clear decisions are needed now.\"</p> <p>In jobs terms, with about 940,000 workers in the sector, the green economy compares favourably to aerospace, which employs 100,000 people directly and supports a total of 230,000 people, and the automotive industry, which employs 135,000 directly and 518,000 people indirectly. The IT workforce is bigger than green, but not by much \u2013 there are about 600,000 people in the IT industry itself and 650,000 IT professionals working in other industries.</p> <p>Although many of the 940,000 workers in the green economy are still doing traditional jobs \u2013 such as the 73,000 workers in water and sewage and 45,000 in waste management, most of whom are engaged in the sort of work that has been largely unchanged for years \u2013 these sectors too are showing innovation and growth as the UK finds ways to make better use of its rubbish, to be recycled into new materials or producing energy, and to improve water security, such as by fixing leaks. Nearly a quarter of a million people are now employed in making alternative fuels and green vehicles, such as electric cars, and more than 112,000 are employed in green building technologies, which includes insulation. Wind energy employs nearly 100,000 people.</p> <p>Alternative fuels and vehicles have brought in some of the biggest returns \u2013 nearly \u00a325bn in turnover in 2011, according to the Department of Business, while water treatment amounted to about \u00a36bn and wind to just over \u00a35.5bn.</p> <p>Overseas companies are crucial to the UK's green economy \u2013 more than 10 foreign companies are considering investments in wind energy manufacturing alone in the UK, while potential nuclear investors are coming from France and Japan, and the majority of renewable energy investments being built are led by overseas companies, such as Dong Energy of Denmark and Siemens of Germany. But British businesses are also exporting environmental goods and services. More than \u00a32.5bn was exported last year, to countries including China, India, Brazil, Germany and the US.</p>",
  "<p>Ask a senior academic about their PhD and they may recall their desperate scramble to break the silence by speaking to the postman in the mornings, or the supervisor who thought training meant breathing the same air as them every so often. Janice Robottom, who started her bioscience PhD at Leeds University last month, is already having a vastly different experience.</p> <p>At 33, she is embarking on a PhD researching biosensors having had children and a career in high-street banking. As well as two supervisors in different departments and a third tutor for independent advice, Robottom is relieved to know she is surrounded by lots of research students in related fields.</p> <p>Her studentship is one of 60 part-funded by a new Doctoral Training Partnership grant from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) spread across Leeds, York and Sheffield universities. Students will share training on science as well as softer skills like presentation. But, crucially, they are all part of a community. \"It's great to have other people in the same boat as you, whatever is going on in your research,\" Robottom says. \"It makes it all feel less isolated.\"</p> <p>There has been a decisive shift among the research councils to funding specialist doctoral training centres like this within key universities or consortia. Five of the seven councils now operate variations on this model, and the Natural Environment Research Council is set to follow suit. This echoes a clear steer from within government to concentrate pressured funds for training in areas of proven research excellence.</p> <p>This may seem uncontroversial \u2013 and the general idea of doctoral training centres has many supporters. Yet by focusing PhD training on a smaller number of top institutions, the councils are striking at the heart of the highly charged debate about what it means to be a university.</p> <p>Prof Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, says: \"I think if you've not got a doctoral training centre you're in real trouble. It's not the money so much \u2013 it's the kitemark. It's like musical chairs. The chair gets pulled away and if you've got nowhere to sit what happens?\"</p> <p>The ultimate fear is that if you are not marked as a flagship training organisation, other research grants might tail off too.&#xa0;</p> <p>Research councils are not the only supporters of PhD studentships, but universities outside of their chosen elite report that it is proving hard to find cash elsewhere. They are angry about the knock-on effect in the all-important Research Excellence Framework, which will distribute more than a billion pounds of government research funding. Data on research doctoral degrees will form a key part of their REF assessment.</p> <p>Prof Paul O'Prey, vice-chancellor of Roehampton University, says: \"What they are doing is creating a catch-22. If they limit research council studentships to the big players, that limits the scoring in the REF, and if you don't score highly in that you don't get studentships in the future.\"</p> <p>However, this is more than just a funding row. Unlike in the US, most modern British institutions remain fiercely resistant to the concept of teaching-only universities, and few are willing to give up training the next generation of researchers without a fight.</p> <p>Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the modern universities group Million+, says: &#xa0;\"It is really serious that the government is failing to track what's actually happening on doctoral training. It is not just a handful of universities who will produce the researchers of the future.\"</p> <p>The elite Russell Group fanned the flames last week with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/25/russell-group-universities-public-funding\" title=\"\">report urging the government to focus funding on the \"jewels in the crown\"</a> or risk falling behind globally. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/25/russell-group-universities-public-funding\" title=\"\">It quotes a \"strong body of evidence\" that doctoral training is best carried out in world-leading universities</a>. Million+ slammed the report as \"entirely outdated\".</p> <p>But the research councils argue that concentration was a fact of life long before their PhD policy shift \u2013 mirroring what is happening all over the world. Prof Rick Rylance, chief executive of the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and chair of the councils' umbrella group RCUK, explains: \"Overall 75% of the AHRC's funding goes to 30 institutions and 39% goes to 10 institutions. That is pretty consistent across the councils. Concentration is already happening without any engineering: this is what peer review is telling us should be funded.\"</p> <p>Although the Medical Research Council hasn't officially switched to doctoral training centres, it follows the same principles \u2013 40% of its PhD funding goes to 24 universities, with automatic block grants for the 16 biggest players, including Oxford and Cambridge and University College London. Dr Peter Dukes, head of research career awards at the MRC, is unapologetic about the council's aims. \"It is all about quality over quantity,\" he says. \"We used to think it was our duty to pump out students, but now we are training the research leaders of tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Sometimes such a policy means that money is not neatly spread around the country. There is currently no BBSRC PhD training partnership in Wales, for instance. Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, admits this is a concern, though he says universities like his should partner with English institutions to stem gaps. And he adds: \"I can absolutely see why people should be concerned about concentration, but keeping everyone happy can't be the priority here. We have to think about what will produce the top cadre of students to come into the sector.\"</p> <p>Sarah Worthington, professor of law at Cambridge University, and a member of a recent government taskforce on postgraduate education, agrees. \"My personal view is that the research playing field is global, not national, and the tough consequence is that training at this very top level can't be delivered by all universities,\" she says. \"Research students need more than a good supervisor; they need deep engagement in the full breadth of their discipline. That can only happen in an environment where there is a critical mass of teachers and like-qualified students.\"</p> <p>Critical mass has become a serious focus for research universities. Prof Nancy Rothwell, president of Manchester University, which has around 4,000 PhD students, says: \"I'm always concerned if a department has only two students as there is so much that needs to be done collaboratively \u2013 journal clubs, presentations. How can you justify running a workshop on intellectual property for two people?\"</p> <p>But there is a growing backlash in newer universities against the notion that volume trumps all. Prof Janet Beer, VC of Oxford Brookes University, says: \"I think critical mass is an overused phrase that doesn't really have much meaning. Scale is always raised as an issue, but modern research is very collaborative, often taking place across institutions and countries. In my field, humanities, that critical mass argument doesn't hold up at all.\"</p>",
  "<p>This is not the first time Israel's political and security establishments have been at loggerheads, and it will not be the last. It comes with the territory for a country that has spent so much of its existence in conflict and has a long tradition of feisty generals. But what is spectacular about the rift over Iran is the high stakes and the fact that it has become so public so soon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/05/israel-planned-iran-attack-claim\" title=\"\">The events recounted in the Israeli television documentary</a> took place two years ago but that is fresh enough for them, in normal circumstances, to be blacked out by the military censor. Yet this programme \u2013 involving a disconnect, to say the least, between the heads of the Mossad and the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) on one hand, and the prime minister and defence minister on the other, on a matter of vital national security \u2013 is being broadcast with the protagonists expressing their views on air two months before elections. It is possible it has been allowed to run by the military to convey to voters, who are generally highly respectful of men and women in uniform, that the current political leadership is reckless.</p> <p>When Israel bombed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981, Menachem Begin overruled the heads of the Mossad and military intelligence who feared an international backlash. This time it is the prime minister who blinked. After warning for months that Israeli action could not be put off, Binyamin Netanyahu told the UN general assembly in September that the moment of truth for the Iranian nuclear programme would come next spring or summer.</p> <p>Neither Meir Dagan nor Gabi Ashkenazi are still in office, but it appears their successors also have reservations about the wisdom of Israel attempting military action on its own. Benny Gatz <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/apr/25/israel-iran\" title=\"\">went on the record in April</a> to differ with Netanyahu on what constituted Israel's \"red line\".</p> <p>\"The current head of Mossad and the chief of staff are still not on the same page on this issue it seems to me,\" said Yossi Alpher, a former Iran analyst at the Mossad. \"As recently as six months ago they presented a picture quite different from that presented by Netanyahu and Barak.\"</p> <p>\"Meanwhile, Netanyahu has taken it off the agenda until spring and summer. This is about the influence of American pressure, opposition within the ranks, possible a change of mind by Barak \u2026 And he has seen from his own polling that the Israeli public is not in favour of a unilateral strike. This has calmed things down and there has been no perceived need for the heads of the security services to speak out about this recently.\"</p> <p>What to do about Iran's nuclear programme will be one of the issues hanging over Israel's elections on 22 January next year. How important it will be will depend on who takes part. If former prime minister Ehud Olmert and former foreign minister Tzipi Livni enter the ring, they are likely to attack Netanyahu as a loose cannon on Iran. Ashkenazi himself might also figure as an adviser or minister-designate for Olmert or Labour.</p> <p>But as Iran's nuclear programme advances, and as the country increases its stockpile of 20%-enriched uranium (the central proliferation concern) the gaps between the politicians and the security establishment will shrink, argues Danny Yatom, a former Mossad chief.</p> <p>\"There is a mutual understanding that Iran should not be nuclear, and I believe all the players share the belief that Iran will be nuclear when it has enough 20%-enriched uranium for a weapon,\" Yatom said.</p>",
  "<p>Did we mention it's our first birthday here on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network\" title=\"\">Guardian Culture Professionals Network</a>? Strange to think it was only a year ago that we <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/culture-professionals-network/2011/nov/04/about-us\" title=\"\">landed on go</a>.

  "<p>We started with questions on work and pensions. Small packets of misery are unwrapped by MPs and presented to Iain Duncan Smith. There are families on low benefits, young persons with nowhere to live and quadraplegics told by Atos, the private company employed by the government, to get a job. If that Frenchman can write a novel by flickering his eyelids, they should be able to work as shelf-stackers. Or so the aim seems to be.</p> <p>Mr Duncan Smith replies to these cries for help with a blast of jargon. MPs respond in kind. In Scotland, we learn, there are only two \"mental health champions to improve the making of capability assessments\". (This may mean that there should be psychologists saying something like: \"This person is only a bit mad. Make him enter politics.\")</p> <p>The government has also brought in a \"jam jar strategy\", by which people are asked to save their money in jars \u2013 one for the gas bill, one for water, booze, etc.</p> <p>This would not work in the Eric Pickles household, since all the jam jars would be full of jam. Mr Pickles is the minister for local government. Back in 2010, he was a very big man. Now he is enormous. Great folds of flesh surround his facial features and blur into where his chest must be. He is the only man I know who has a double chin \u2013 at the back of his neck. With his white hair and bright red face, he resembles an immense strawberry meringue. If you read Kipling's Just So stories you may recall Small Porgies, the gigantic monster that rose from the sea and ate people, and whom Kipling would have modelled on Mr Pickles, had he been born.</p> <p>When he sits back on the front bench, it shakes, and his fellow ministers wobble up and down. He speaks in equally orotund language. The growth and infrastructure bill he was moving would help us to \"compete in a global world\". (What other kind of world do we have?)</p> <p>MPs were worried about the threat to village greens. \"The national planning policy framework strengthens green places,\" Mr Pickles declared elliptically, before adding \"but we need to make sure that the registration system is not used to hinder legitimate development,\" which sounds threatening. If I were a duck in a duck pond, I'd expect to be concreted over by a new NCP any day.</p> <p>His shadow opponent is Hilary Benn, who is very thin. His job must be like trying to stop a hippopotamus with a stiletto \u2013 you might manage it but it would take a long time. He made the point that Mr Pickles's professed localism was really communist \"democratic centralism\" in disguise. \"The only thing growing is the secretary of state's power; he is mentioned 144 times in 45 pages!\"</p> <p>But not growing half as fast as the secretary of state.

  "<p>There goes another $800m (\u00a3500m). HSBC's latest provision to settle money-laundering allegations takes the total to $1.5bn but there is still no end in sight. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver has warned that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/05/hsbc-warns-money-laundering-fines\" title=\"\">eventual fines could be \"higher, perhaps significantly higher.\"</a> A serious hit is coming.</p> <p>There are good reasons for Gulliver to be fearful. First, he can't be confident that HSBC's pleas of contrition will yield any benefit. As he says, the various US authorities have \"substantial discretion in deciding exactly how to resolve this matter\". What's more, the bank could face corporate criminal charges.</p> <p>Second, Standard Chartered forked out $340m for offences, relating to the reporting of Iran-related transactions, that look puny compared to what went on at HSBC. The Standard settlement was widely regarded as a shake-down led by a new-ish New York regulator trying to make a name for itself. But if $340m is the going rate for minor infringements in the US, what's the score for an HSBC-style real deal? Five times as much, which is roughly where the provisions stand now? Ten times? More?</p> <p>When a final tally is established we may reflect on what a soft ride the officer class at HSBC has received for this disgraceful chapter in the bank's history. Remember the seriousness of the allegation: a Senate committee said HSBC \"exposed the US financial system to a wide array of money laundering, drug trafficking, and terrorist financing risks due to poor anti-money laundering controls\". And remember that the period in question is more than half a decade \u2013 from 2004 to 2010.</p> <p>Some individuals have left the bank as a result, says Gulliver, but he won't say how many. Some bonuses have been clawed back but, again, he won't provide details. Such shyness hardly meets the test of accountability that shareholders, who ultimately pay these fines, would expect.</p> <p>For example, has Lord Green \u2013 chief executive from 2003 to 2006, then executive chairman to 2010 and now a government trade minister \u2013 been caught by the claw-back principle? Or is this a case of a bank admitting that mistakes were made but simultaneously maintaining that nobody in the boardroom could have been expected to do anything differently?</p> <p>Gulliver's efforts to improve HSBC's culture appear sincere and forceful. But they would be improved by a fuller account of how the Mexican operation, in particular, fell so short of acceptable standards. Negotiations with US authorities currently make that demand difficult to meet. But when a settlement is finally reached, the bank should tell all. Sparing the blushes of former bosses shouldn't enter the equation. A \u00a31bn bill for bad behaviour deserves a fuller explanation than anything HSBC has offered to date.</p>",
  "<p>It was hearbreaking to see my letter of September 2009, warning of the danger of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ash-dieback\" title=\"\">ash dieback disease</a> spreading to this country, being featured on BBC1's News at Ten last week. The letter appeared alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/ash-dieback-cobra-crisis-meeting?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">news of the meeting of the government's Cobra committee</a> to discuss the emergency. My worst nightmare of three years ago is now being played out in reality.</p> <p>I sent the letter to the Forestry Commission and Defra in my capacity as a professional nurseryman and the then chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Horticultural Trades Association</a>. It followed an HTA nurseryman's trip to Denmark to look at nursery production. There, both in nurseries and in the Danish landscape, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/disease-killing-denmarks-ash-trees\" title=\"\">disease was rife</a>. Dieback, like frost damage in June, created \"stag-headed\" trees (ie those with leafless, dead limbs at the top).</p> <p>For me, a lifelong tree nurseryman, it was the nearest thing to Armageddon. The letter I wrote was our response to this disaster. I received one response \u2013 from the Forestry Commission \u2013 telling me that the disease was already present here in a benign form, thus it would be illegal to implement a ban on plant imports for a fungus disease of the same species.</p> <p>And yes, it is a great shame that though we saw this plague coming across Europe, we fiddled while countries fell like ninepins to the enemy attack. Now the disease is here. Some would say \"I told you so,\" and self-destruct in pointing fingers, wringing of hands and litigation.</p> <p>My own nursery, Wyevale Nurseries of Hereford, stands to lose some \u00a3150,000 worth (sale value) of healthy ash trees, carefully grown here and nurtured over years. More crops are in the process of maturing. Movement of these trees is now banned, and regardless, demand has ceased, they will now likely never be sold. The delay in government action has probably trashed our heritage and our legacy \u2013 and the value of our nursery crops (as well as my own family name).</p> <p>What should our response be? Certainly not the mealy-mouthed containment effort that has given that other foreign foe, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=oak%20processionary%20moth&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forestry.gov.uk%2Fpdf%2Ffr_advice_note_oak_processionary_moth.pdf%2F%24FILE%2Ffr_advice_note_oak_processionary_moth.pdf&amp;ei=rdyXUOykBI62hAeQs4CwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiPnd7qP_ZhmZHmNQp1ZxWQQnWQA&amp;sig2=XxlgoJFsJ2DxbYy3LWqLRA\" title=\"\">oak processionary moth</a>, a foothold <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10838343\" title=\"\">in our own capital city</a>. No, we must use every resource known to us and more still. Known to us is conventional warfare: biosecurity, destruction of infected trees, maybe calculated sanitary felling. But more than that our response must be backed up by science and the guile of practical people out on the battleground; Battle of Britain, yes, but also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/places/bletchley_park\" title=\"\">Bletchley Park</a>.</p> <p>Scientists, geneticists, botanists but also practical foresters, stewards of our countryside and towns \u2013 even nurserymen \u2013 must work in harmony. Surely the might of the National Trust, the Woodland Trust, the National Farmers Union, the Horticultural Trades Association, the Royal Forestry Society, <a href=\"http://www.confor.org.uk/Default.aspx?pid=1\" title=\"\">Confor</a>, Campaign to Protect Rural England, experts from mainland Europe and many, many more will sharpen and focus the professionals at the Forestry Commission and Defra.</p> <p>We need knowledge, wisdom and action. We can be sure that the man in the street, all 60 million of them, will support us to save \u2013 or is it reinstate \u2013 our 80 million ash trees.</p> <p>Again we can be a beacon of hope for Europe to free itself of this scourge, now using all the 21st-century skills at our disposal to find an answer. We have a chance. Dutch Elm Disease thrived because of the English elm's propensity towards vegetative propagation, which produces genetic clones, but the ash is naturally wise. Sexual propagation is its way, and it is indeed way better. Naturally growing from seed it has a wide genetic base. There will be some, 5% to 10%, it is said, in the natural population that are resistant to the disease. Our task is to find these and understand how to concentrate that trait, propagate a wide gene pool and offer them back into the landscape. Further we must work on selections of silvicultural and superior horticultural value.</p> <p>So we will not just let this invasion break our hearts: we will use our knowledge and skill to defeat it.

  "<p>Barring a complete and systematic failure of pretty much every single polling organization in America, Barack Obama will be re-elected president of the United States Tuesday night.</p> <p>Still, no matter what happens on Tuesday \u2013 and even if Mitt Romney pulls off the most extraordinary political surprise in the history of American presidential campaigns \u2013 the more than 18-month slog for the White House provides us with rather clear outlines on the changing nature of the US electorate and the ideological positioning of the two parties. While it would be incomplete and, indeed, probably incorrect to call this a realignment election, there are a number of crucial takeaways from campaign 2012 \u2013 and they augur much brighter days ahead for Democrats than for Republicans.</p> <h2>The Republican party's continued descent into madness</h2> <p>The single most defining element of American politics over the last four years is that the Republican party has fallen out of the crazy tree and hit every branch on the way down. It is no longer even appropriate to say the Republican party is dominated by its conservative wing; but rather, that the GOP is controlled by its extreme, radical wing.</p> <p>The shift of the Republican to the far, far right is not a recent development. Instead, it is reflective of a four-decade shift in ideological orientation in the GOP: from a party once torn between distinct conservative and moderate wings, to one in which moderates have gone the way of dinosaurs and VCRs. But there is no question that in the past four years, the extremism of the GOP has increased dramatically \u2013 so much so that their most recent president, George W Bush, is persona non grata in the party because he is viewed as <em>too moderate</em> and not sufficiently conservative. Imagine that.</p> <p>For years, the national Republican party emboldened this wing of the GOP and made it the vanguard of its efforts to maintain national power. That group now holds ideological sway in the Republican party. In the naked pursuit of short-term partisan gain, the Republican party has unleashed forces that it can no longer fully control.</p> <p>The result is a set of policies that not only are radical, but also are out of step with the mainstream of American politics. This includes everything from efforts to privatize Medicare, eviscerating social security, rejecting any role for fiscal policy other than cutting taxes, and taking the position that illegal immigrants should not receive amnesty but rather \"self-deport\". This is not to mention the GOP's growing extremism on abortion rights and reproductive health in general.</p> <p>Republicans once aspired to, and briefly held, the mantle of a party of ideas. Today, the GOP in its deference to the ideological rigidity of its radical wing has reached a position where Republicans have no serious ideas for reforming healthcare, creating jobs, stimulating the economy, or fixing the nation's crumbling infrastructure. They also have no proposals for achieving energy independence and certainly no thought as to how to save the planet \u2013 particularly since they reject almost unanimously the science underpinning global warming. (Well, I take that back: Republicans have one policy for all these issues \u2013 cut taxes and trim regulation.)</p> <p>This has forced their party standard-bearer, a technocratic moderate from Massachusetts, to become a caricature of a modern conservative. In the process, Romney has adopted a host of toxic policy positions and rhetoric (<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser\">remember the 47%</a>) that has dramatically undermined his candidacy. It's always difficult to beat an incumbent president; it's even more difficult when you're not a very good politician. But when your own party hangs around your neck policy positions that narrow, rather than increase, your chances of being elected, it becomes a herculean task. </p> <p>To be sure, one of the most important drivers of the Republican's rightward turn has been the unceasing obstructionism toward President Obama's agenda. From early on, the GOP decided that, for political reasons, it must oppose everything he wanted to do. It was an approach that kept the economy under-performing but did help return Republicans to power in the House of Representatives in 2010. Blanket opposition to Obama's policies and, in particular, economic stimulus is pretty much the only reason this election is even close.</p> <p>If Obama is to win on 6 November, it's possible that Republicans will, at least in the near term, narrow their steadfast hostility to him. Indeed, even against their better judgment, they may find themselves compromising with the White House on the Bush tax cuts and sequestration, just as they compromised on the payroll tax cut in 2012, over the 2011 budget showdown and even on the debt limit.</p> <p>Providing Obama with the stimulus he has so desperately sought, for the past four years, might even suddenly seem acceptable, particularly if a boost in the economy helps incumbent congressional Republicans keep their constituents happy \u2013 and their jobs in place, at the next midterm elections in 2014. Of course, that doesn't mean anyone should get their hopes up: Republicans will still continue to oppose any use of government power and resources to ameliorate social inequalities. And as we get closer to midterm elections in 2014, as well as the next presidential race, it's quite possible, even likely, that GOP obstructionism and obstinacy will get worse.</p> <p>If Romney wins, congressional Republicans might be even less inclined to compromise, but it won't matter much. No one expects them to take back control of the Senate, which means the Republicans' far-right agenda will go no further than the House of Representatives (at least for the first two years of a Romney presidency). If Republicans were to take back the Senate in 2014 (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014\">a possibility that can't be completely discounted</a>), this would be a very different story. One could expect them to make a desperate push to enact some variation of the Ryan budget \u2013 and probably succeed.</p> <p>Still, one of the great ironies of this election \u2013 and the capture of the GOP by its extreme wing \u2013 is that if Romney were to emerge victorious, he would be protected from having to enact a more radically conservative agenda \u2026 by Harry Reid. In fact, if Romney were to win, he might even end up being a fairly popular and successful president.</p> <h2>Demographics are destiny</h2> <p>The problem for Republicans, however, is what happens if he loses. In no area of American politics are Republicans more vulnerable and Democrats in better position to capitalize than when it comes to the country's changing demographic make-up. </p> <p>Consider, for a moment, this paradox. On Tuesday night, Barack Obama could potentially lose white voters by 20 points. He's going to get crushed among white men \u2013 and he's still likely to be re-elected, maybe even comfortably.</p> <p>The reason for this is clear: among non-whites, Obama enjoys an extraordinary advantage. Aside from winning practically the entire African-American vote, Obama is likely to prevail among Hispanic voters by considerably more than 30 points. The latest <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/\">Latino Decisions poll has him up nearly 50 points</a>.</p> <p>Among younger voters, he is likely to dominate as well. In short, among the demographic groups that represent the future of the American electorate, Democrats enjoy an enormous edge \u2013 and one that will only become more pronounced.</p> <p>It's not hard to understand why this has happened. Young people who came of age in the Bush years naturally gravitated toward Obama. Moreover, these voters tend to be aligned on social issues with Democrats. On the flip side, GOP positions on immigration have alienated Hispanics and moved them toward the Democrats. Beyond young people and minorities, women voters have increasingly turned their back on the GOP because of its uncompromising stances on abortion and reproductive health, as well as the party's attitude toward poverty programs and maintaining the social safety net.</p> <p>Republicans have, for decades, relied on the support of whites, religious and cultural voters, and on rural residents. If Obama were to win Tuesday, it would provide conclusive evidence that this is no longer a 50.1% coalition \u2013 and that for Republicans to win back the presidency, they must broaden their share of the electorate.</p> <p>But here's the rub: there is no easy way for them to do it. Even if Republicans could find a way to work with Obama on an issue like immigration reform (an unlikely scenario considering the die-hard opposition of the Tea Party), a legislative victory for the president would only serve to strengthen his support in the Hispanic community. If Republicans oppose reform, however, they will only dig their hole deeper with the fastest growing demographic group in the country. In fact, if Obama were smart, he would make the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform one of his first legislative priorities in 2013.</p> <p>On abortion and reproductive health, it's virtually impossible to imagine any sort of compromise coming from the GOP. And so long as the party has Senate candidates talking about \"legitimate rape\" and children born as a result of rape being gifts from God, things are likely to get worse for the Republican party, before they get better. The same goes for gay marriage and other social issues.</p> <h2>A bluer map</h2> <p>The Democrats' evolving political coalition has also shifted the electoral map in a bluer direction. In states like <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/in-nevada-obama-ryan-and-signs-of-a-new-democratic-leaning-normal/\">Nevada</a> and New Mexico, Democrats enjoy a huge advantage because of those states' large Hispanic population. Similar trends can be seen in Colorado, Florida and even Iowa. It is not hard to imagine that Democratic dominance among Hispanic voters will soon put Arizona and even, potentially, Texas in play.</p> <p>In places like Ohio, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/in-virginia-its-tradition-versus-change/\">Virginia</a> and North Carolina, the Democrats' overwhelming advantage among minority voters and, increasingly, among college-educated whites \u2013 another key element of the emerging Democratic coalition \u2013&#xa0;has put these states into play and even leaning blue.</p> <p>Flip the map for a second to look at it from a Republican perspective and things get ugly quickly. Look, for example, at the <a href=\"http://electoralmap.net/PastElections/past_elections.php?year=2000\">2000 electoral map</a>. Of the states won by Al Gore that year, only Iowa and perhaps Wisconsin are even in play this cycle. Conversely, seven states that Bush won that year are swing states or leaning Democratic. From a starting point of 271 electoral votes (one more than the bare minimum needed to win a national election), Republicans have seen their electoral map narrow rather than widen.</p> <h2>A recovering economy</h2> <p>There is one final consideration. As the economy has steadily improved, so, too, have President Obama's approval ratings. All economic indicators indicate that this will be a continuing trend, which means that if Obama were to win Tuesday, he would see his political standing rise as unemployment continues to fall. (Of course, if Romney were to win, he would be the beneficiary of this improving economy.) Throw in the fact that as Obamacare becomes the law of the land and provides a new entitlement for middle-class Americans, the Democrat's long-term policy advantage could be strengthened even further.</p> <p>None of this is meant to suggest that Republicans won't continue to be a competitive national party. The problem, however, is similar to that faced by Democrats 20-30 years ago: when your base is shrinking, how do you appeal to a broader cross-section of the electorate?</p> <p>The fact is, there is no easy way for Republicans do it. The GOP needs desperately to reform itself, to cast aside its most radical and extreme wing, and to moderate its policies to appeal to an electorate that is dramatically changing. Democrats simply need to continue the policies \u2013 and political approach \u2013 that has given them a political advantage going into election day.</p> <p>What this means is that, should Romney lose tomorrow and Obama emerge victorious, we may be on the cusp of a dramatic shift in national politics.</p>",

  "<p>Israeli and Iranian officials are taking part in a nuclear non-proliferation meeting in Brussels on Monday, in the hope of paving the way for a full international conference in the next few months on banning nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East.</p> <p>A handful of officials from both Israel and Iran are involved in the two-day event, ostensibly in their capacity as private citizens, in what was billed as an academic seminar.</p> <p>But the delegations are led by senior officials and have the permission of their respective governments to take part in an informal discussion with representatives from about 10 Arab states, US officials and European moderators to explore the possibility of holding <a href=\"http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/un-chief-urges-mideast-nations-hold-wmd-free-zone-talks/\" title=\"\">a UN-sponsored conference</a> on establishing a WMD-free zone in the Middle East.</p> <p>The Israeli team is led by Jeremy Issacharoff, an ambassador for strategic affairs at the foreign ministry; the chief Iranian representative is Ali Asghar Soltanieh, the country's long-serving ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Also taking part is Jaakko Laajava, the Finnish diplomat tasked by the UN secretary general to organise the planned conference in Helsinki.</p> <p>In contrast to the ever-worsening sabre-rattling over the Iranian nuclear programme, the mood at the meeting, convened by the EU Non-Proliferation Consortium, was described by one participant as \"respectful and positive\".</p> <p>Mark Fitzpatrick, a non-proliferation expert from the International Institute for Strategic Studies and former state department official, said \"there were no fireworks and no denunciations\" at the conference. That marks an improvement over a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2011/jul/11/iran-israel-nuclear-talks\" title=\"\">similar event held last year</a>, when the tone was described as mutual finger-wagging. However, it was unclear from the meeting whether the Helsinki conference would go ahead on schedule in December.</p> <p>Washington has been going out of its way in recent weeks to brief observers that <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international-affairs/263269-the-2012-conference-on-wmd-free-zone-in-middle-east-bites-the-dust\" title=\"\">the talks would be postponed</a>, although it was not clear whether that was a tactic to avoid reports emerging in the midst of the election campaign that the US had pressured Israel to sit at the negotiating table with Iran.</p> <p>Two junior US officials are taking part in this week's meeting but have so far said little. One source said Washington's intentions would be clear once the elections were over, but noted that participants had taken to calling the UN-sponsored event the 'Helsinki conference', rather than the '2012 conference', as uncertainty increases over its timing.</p> <p>Israel's official position is neither to confirm nor deny its widely reported nuclear arsenal, and it would consider signing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, thereby renouncing its right to have such weapons, only if its existence and its right to exist had been guaranteed by its neighbours and the region was at peace.</p> <p>Nevertheless, European mediators hope the UN conference will initially represent a way of coaxing Israel into more transparency in return for continued Arab and Iranian abstinence from nuclear weapons under the increasingly strained treaty.</p>",
  "<p>Mining shares led the market lower on renewed worries about a slowdown in China and news that Australia was scrapping plans for additional listings for foreign companies.</p> <p>Disappointing non-manufacturing data from China - a key consumer of commodities - sent copper prices to a two month low and hit the whole resources sector. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 17.5p lower at 717.5p, <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> fell 12.2p to 321.3p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> lost 69p to \u00a331.45. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> dropped 42p to \u00a311.18, not helped by Citigroup downgrading the group from buy to neutral.</p> <p>On top of that, Australia's stock exchange has reportedly decided against a proposal to quote unsponsored depository receipts of foreign companies.

There were also poor monthly service sector surveys from UK and US, while investors were unsettled by the imminent American election, as well as the forthcoming vote in the Greek parliament on its austerity package and 2013 budget.</p> <p>Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Markets trod cautiously at the beginning of this week as uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the US presidential elections dominated trade putting investors on the back foot. With the outcome far from certain the future shape of the US political landscape remains in doubt. With both candidates offering two very separate paths the result of this election is as significant for the US economy as much as it is for the global economy. </blockquote> <p>Banks were also under pressure. <strong>HSBC</strong> fell 8.1p to 618p following a disappointing update and news of hefty money laundering fines, while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 0.575p to 42.85p despite weekend reports it was considering a sale of its 60% stake in wealth manager <strong>St James Place</strong>, down 3.6p to 394.9p. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> At the current share price, Lloyds stake is worth around \u00a31.2bn, albeit we think the shares are currently undervalued by the market, so a sale at this price would not maximise value for Lloyds' shareholders. </blockquote> <p>Two years after <strong>Prudential</strong> failed to buy Asian rival AIA, the insurer has made a move in the fast growing region.</p> <p>In another challenge to AIA, Pru is paying \u00a3368m in cash for Thailand's Thanachart Bank, following its announcement of plans to open an office in Cambodia. The deal includes a 15 year exclusive partnership to sell bancassurance in Thailand through Thanachart branches.</p> <p>The Pru's shares slipped 2.5p to 856p, and Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas repeated his underperform rating.</p> <p>Heading in the other direction was <strong>Weir</strong>, up 80p at \u00a318.31, after the pumps and valves group said it was on track to meet full year expectations despite a weak oil and gas sector.</p> <p>Accounting software specialist <strong>Sage</strong> added 1.9p to 313.6p as Numis raised its recommendation from hold to add.</p> <p>But George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon kept his sell rating despite applauding some of the company's moves:</p> <blockquote> Research from industry analysts IDC points to European IT users accelerating their 'cloud' deployment. Fortunately Sage is just in time demonstrably weaving cloud technology into its core products \u2013 we note CRM and ERP X3 in particular. While the moves may seem piecemeal they do not appear to be a case of 'too little/too late' but will do little to drive Sage's missing ingredient - growth. <br> Our sell recommendation is predicated on those false take-over stories (gone in a puff of smoke) which have inflated the share price and lead to a valuation, a PE of 16.5 times, well ahead of the operational and valuation reality. </blockquote> <p><strong>Centamin</strong> recovered some of the ground which it lost last week on reports an Egyptian court had ruled its rights to operate the Sukari gold mine were invalid.</p> <p>The reports wiped around 40% off its share price, but the company eased some of the concerns, and they bounced back 14.05p to 74.55p, a 23% increase which made it the biggest riser in the FTSE 250.</p> <p>It has now received the court's ruling, which rejected any attempt to terminate the company's concession agreement although it said insufficient evidence had been submitted to demonstrate ministerial approval had been given to allow the company to mine.</p> <p>Centamin said it would appeal the decision and maintained it had documents showing the minister of petroleum and mineral resources had given approval, although these were somehow not in the court papers</p> <p>But <strong>Telecity</strong> dropped 78p to 835p despite an in-line update, as the European data centre operator unveiled what analysts said was an expensive - albeit small - acquisition.</p> <p>The company said trading remained strong across Europe, and its full year earnings were expected to be in line with City forecasts. But it also announced the \u20ac28m cash purchase of Academica in Finland. Analyst James Goodman at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> At \u20ac28m for 1MW of operational capacity, today's (admittedly small) deal seems very expensive. However, the business has an expansion plan to quadruple the capacity to 4MW which would clearly lessen the price, but would depend on the incremental capital expenditure required. </blockquote> <p><strong>Dixons Retail</strong>, boosted last week following news that rival Comet was going into administration, suffered a bout of profit taking as investors had second thoughts about how much benefit the electrical retailer would actually get from the situation.

  "<p>George Osborne has joined forces with the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, to announce an international crackdown on tax avoidance by big multinationals, such as eBay and Amazon.</p> <p>Osborne said he and Sch\u00e4uble, meeting at the G20 finance ministers's summit in Mexico, had called for \"concerted international co-operation to strengthen international tax standards that at the minute may mean international companies can pay less tax than they would otherwise owe\".</p> <p>Neither man was eager to identity individual corporate culprits, but government sources said the spread of e-commerce and the ponderous nature of international corporate tax rules have left governments trailing behind multinationals as they shift profits around the globe.</p> <p>The two men, determined to give the issue a political push, said they would back the OECD's current work on identifying possible gaps in the standards, as a first step in promoting a better way of dealing with profit shifting and base erosion of corporate tax at the global level. The OECD is viewed as the guardian of global tax standards.</p> <p>Trying to show a balance between his defence of low tax rates and the need to act against firms that repeatedly pay virtually no tax, Osborne said: \"We want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes. The best way to achieve that is through international action that ensures strong standards, without pricing ourselves out of the global market.\"</p> <p>The joint statement by the two countries \u2013 a rare example of Anglo-German co-operation \u2013 said: \"International tax standards have had difficulty keeping up with changes in global business practices, such as the development of e-commerce in commercial activities.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"As a result, some multinational businesses are able to shift the taxation of their profits away from the jurisdictions where they are being generated, thus minimising their tax payments compared to smaller, less international companies.\"</p> <p>In the statement, Britain and Germany said they expect the first report from the OECD at the next G20 meeting in Russia in February 2013.</p> <p>The two men agreed their joint approach when the chancellor visited Berlin on Thursday. The co-operation comes ahead of a meeting between David Cameron and Angela Merkel on Wednesday.</p> <p>Government sources said there was growing international political support for a crackdown on some of these multinationals that were in some cases either paying next to no tax or funelling profits to low corporation tax regimes such as the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands or Ireland. The sources added there was equal determination to act in the US, even though many of the companies under the microscope are US-based.</p> <p>Changes to the international standards have to be agreed at the international level. But the British government believes there have been time lags in updates to technical tax standards that may be creating unintentional gaps in them. The OECD will present the next stage of its proposals to its committee of fiscal affairs (CFA) on 16 November in Paris.</p> <p>Britain has the lowest rate of corporation tax in the G7, and has cut its rate by more than any other G20 country over the past two years (from 28% in 2010 to 22% by 2014). In the last year, around half of the \u00a3136bn of taxes paid in the UK by the biggest businesses, came from foreign-owned businesses; while inward investment created or safeguarded more than 100,000 jobs.</p> <p>THe HMRC has raised more than \u00a31.5bn since March 2010 through increased efforts in tackling transfer pricing. The transfer pricing rules aim to ensure that multinationals pay the right amount of tax by determining the taxable profits of each company as if it were an independent entity trading on arm's length terms with other members of the same group.</p>",

This money doesn\u2019t come from nowhere \u2013 to introduce the living wage would cost about \u00a312bn, \u00a313bn and that has to come from somewhere.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/economy/tuc-21614-f0.cfm\">\u2022 The TUC says many employers can afford to pay the living wage.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The TUC believes that far more companies can afford to pay the living wage. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the UK's biggest companies increased their cash reserves by over \u00a380bn between 2007 and 2011. There is no excuse for cash-rich employers to deny low-paid staff a decent wage, says the TUC.</p> <p>The TUC added that paying the living wage is in the interests of employers, as it improves staff motivation and productivity, and enhances corporate reputations.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/11/Livingwage051112\">\u2022 John Swinney, the Scottish finance minister, says the Scottish government will pay the living wage to Scottish public sector workers.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/11/05/the-pony-politics-of-the-living-wage/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">\u2022 John Rentoul on his blog says that Miliband's support for the living wage is irresponsible.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The basic problem is one of unequal returns in the labour market. The Labour government made important advances, such as the national minimum wage and spreading higher educational standards, although it also decided to allow free movement of low-skilled central European workers, which may have kept low wages lower. Overall, though, income inequality in the UK did not change significantly in the Labour period.</p> <p>But, yes, it would be nice if differentials were smaller. The tax system is doing its bit, even if the Coalition Government is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/how-the-tax-facts-get-in-the-way-of-the-tory-story-8229280.html\">too incompetent to collate the figures</a>. So how can the gap between high and low pre-tax pay be narrowed? Ed Miliband accepts that simply putting up the minimum wage for everyone, which would seem to be fair and fiscally expansionary, would put people out of work.</p> <p>So he takes refuge in the warm marshmallow fudge of the Living Wage. Banks, who don\u2019t employ many people on low wages, should pay it. And public-sector employers. Apart from the NHS, obviously. And any other \u201csocially responsible\u201d company that can be morally coerced into it. What about contract staff and suppliers and cleaners employed by friends of the MD\u2019s tennis partners? Do they have to pay the Living Wage too? No doubt a working party is being set up now.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/11/the-living-wage-is-a-good-idea-but-we-could-and-should-do-more/\">\u2022 Mark Ferguson at LabourList says the living wage does not go far enough.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we accept that the National Minimum Wage still leaves people living in abject poverty \u2013 and it does \u2013 then why are we willing to accept that as a legal wage floor? If the Living Wage is the level at which people can be reasonably expected to live and support themselves, why don\u2019t we demand that the NMW is set at that level? To do otherwise is to tacitly accept that some will still be employed on poverty wages. I find that difficult to stomach.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/staggers/2012/11/where-next-living-wage\">\u2022 Matthew Pennycook at the Staggers says there is still a long way to go in extending the living wage.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the success of the living wage campaign relatively few workers have secured a higher wage as a result of a living wage initiative. For example, there are an estimated 651,953 workers in London earning less than the London Living Wage, yet only around 10,341 London workers won a living wage in the six years between 2005 and 2011. This is not a cry of despair, simply a call for realism about the role that living wage initiatives can play in tackling our reliance on an extensive pool of low-paid labour and for targeting efforts where they will be most effective.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2012/11/how-much-would-milibands-living-wage-plans-actually-change\">\u2022 Jon Stone at the Staggers says Miliband's proposal to \"name and shame\" firms not paying the living wage may have disappointing results.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Miliband\u2019s pledge recalls the strategy of anti-tax-avoidance protest group UK Uncut, which drew attention to high profile companies that avoided large sums of tax, in the hope of shaming them into paying more.

My officials have been in touch with North Wales Police.</p> <p>An extensive inquiry into North Wales child abuse \u2013 the so-called Waterhouse Report was published in 2000. It was commissioned - before devolution began- by the then Secretary of State for Wales William Hague and reported to Paul Murphy, as Secretary of State, in 2000. It made extensive recommendations for improving child protection, many of which were subsequently implemented by the Welsh Government. I have asked for urgent advice on the terms of reference of the Waterhouse Inquiry at the time when it was set up.&#xa0;</p> <p>I need to understand fully what was included in those terms of reference and what was excluded.

And frankly the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, is doing it, so if it's illegal, I'm afraid David Cameron is going to have to have words with him.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T13:18:49.005Z\">at 1.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5097ae26b579f74bac764adc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T12:58:18.115Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fa2c0297-3817-4962-9217-e85d19dca3e5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348141207528/10-Downing-Street-010.jpg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 David Cameron is taking a \"close interest\" in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/nov/03/man-claims-sexually-abused-politician\">the allegations about a senior Tory being implicated in the north Wales child abuse scandal</a> and is going to ensure that they are properly investigated.</strong> This is what the prime minister's spokesman said when asked about the affair.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is something that we are looking at actively.

He also said that David Cameron was in favour of the living wage.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We back the idea of a living wage and we encourage businesses to take it up.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, when asked what the government was doing to encourage firms to pay the living wage, the spokesman just cited exhortation. The spokesman said most people directly employed by the government were paid the living wage or more. He acknowledged that some people employed by contractors on behalf of government departments (ie, cleaners) were not on the living wage. The government would encourage those firms to pay the living wage, he said. But he said the government was opposed to making it mandatory because that would \"reduce business flexibility\" and \"ultimately it could be bad for jobs\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 refused to back Iain Duncan Smith's comments criticising Barack Obama's handling of the US economy.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/04/mitt-romney-uk-press_n_2073476.html\">In an interview last night, </a>Duncan Smith said that the US deficit had \"gone from something like 4-500 billion dollars to three or so trillion dollars\" under Obama.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fact that it [the US economy] hasn't bounced back from this recession, arguably for the first time since the war, makes it a very worrying picture indeed - with unemployment really historically very high in the US and really not a lot of serious new economic activity taking place.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if Cameron agreed with this assessment, the spokesman said that with the American presidential election looming, it was not appropriate for him to make a comment.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street refused to say whether Cameron was embarrassed by <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227459/Camerons-horseplay-texts-Rebekah-Brooks-Intimate-messages-PM-reveal-likes-fast-unpredicatable-ride.html\">the release of fresh text messages sent between him and Rebekah Brooks.</a></strong> Asked about the emails published in the Mail on Sunday yesterday, the spokesman said the Leveson inquiry was given all the text messages that it asked to see and that it was up to the inquiry to decide what was published.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Nick Clegg is taking PMQs on Wednesday because Cameron will still be abroad.</strong> For the same reason this week's cabinet meeting (which is normally on a Tuesday) has been cancelled.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street played down <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227531/Justine-Greening-Tories-slash-UKs-280m-India-aid-HALF-amid-claims-country-rich-handouts.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490\">reports that Justine Greening is planning to announce a cut in British aid to India this week</a>.</strong> The spokesman said he did not think an announcement was planned for this week. \"Nothing has changed,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is holding a summit on tree health on Wednesday.</strong> He is chairing meetings twice a day on the ash dieback crisis, the spokesman said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street rejected claims that Cameron is refusing to hold regular press conferences.</strong> The spokesman said that Cameron regularly takes questions from the press. When it was pointed out that he has not held a general press conference at Number 10 all year, the spokesman said that Cameron always holds a press conference when he visits Brussels for European council meetings, which now take place about once a month.

But I already know what he is going to say, because the party released<a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/the-living-wage-can-help-us-rebuild-britain-as-one-nation\"> a text of his remarks in advance.</a> Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are almost five million people in Britain who aren\u2019t earning enough the living wage; people who got up early this morning, spent hours getting to work - who are putting in all the effort they can - but who often don\u2019t get paid enough to look after their families, to heat their homes, feed their kids, care for elderly relatives and plan for the future ...</p> <p>It\u2019s not how it should be in Britain, it\u2019s not how we will succeed as a country in the years ahead because we can't go on with an economy that works for a few at the top and not for most people. We need to change it ...</p> <p>Britain needs a government that will work with the best of British business to build greater prosperity and share it more fairly. That is what One Nation is about. The living wage is an important part of helping to make that happen. It is an idea whose time has come.</p> </blockquote> <p>Miliband says that 11 Labour councils have already become living wage employers and that more are on the way to acquiring living wage status. In contrast, only one non-Labour authority is a living wage employer, and that's the GLA, where Boris Johnson inherited the policy from Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>Miliband says that, although David Cameron described the living wage as \"a good and attractive idea\" while in opposition, the Department for Business has recently said that the living wage \"does not consider any potential adverse employment effects\" and that it is \"unlikely to be a well-targeted poverty measure\".</p> <p>And he announces that Labour is considering three policy proposals that could be used to promote the living wage.</p> <p><strong>1. Forcing firms to pay the living wage if they want to bid for public sector contracts.</strong> Islington council did this when it awarded its ground maintenance contract to Enterprise, he says. All 80 Enterprise staff are now on the living wage, at a cost to the company of \u00a3150,000. Miliband says the company absorbed the entire cost, which was just a fraction of the value of the \u00a320m contract.</p> <p><strong>2. Paying firms a subsidy if they pay the living wage.</strong> Firms that pay the living wage save the taxpayer money because their employees do not require such high in-work benefits. Miliband says Labour is exploring ways of sharing this saving with employers, Here's an extract from his briefing paper.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The IFS estimated in a report two years ago that for every person moved on to the LW the saving for the Treasury would be around \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation and the IPPR are looking more closely at how you might could incentivise or support the spread of living wage by allowing employers to share in some of the savings that could be made in tax credits etc as a result of them paying living wage.</p> <p>This might involve councils and big employers adopting living wage <br> policies across a city or geographical area such as a Living Wage zone or getting some transitional support for policies that would help them make the transition - eg in return for investments in skills, or support for small businesses. It would see government, employers, and local authorities working together to develop One Nation solutions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3. Forcing firms to say how many of their employees are receiving less than the living wage.</strong> Miliband says that Labour has already called for more transparency in relation to pay at the top (it backs full disclosure of executive pay) and that this would be a natural extension of the transparency principle. In theory, it could \"shame\" employers into paying their staff more.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T13:24:44.053Z\">at 1.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50978e5995cb1506d24448e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T10:01:40.093Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's the full list of accredited living wage employers.

Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister has already visited [the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia] since taking office and the fact that these are two of the few countries he is now returning to signals the PM's commitment to cementing long term partnerships with two of Britain\u2019s most important strategic allies in the Gulf. It follows a sustained government effort to build a reinvigorated partnership with countries in this region through the Gulf Initiative that was initiated in 2010 after a period of neglect.</p> <p>This strategic partnership is focused on delivering security, prosperity and openness in the region. A central pillar is our defence relationship with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia given our shared commitment to security and stability and defeating the threats we face in the wider Middle East region.</p> <p>On this visit, the prime minister hopes to begin the next chapter in our relationship, establishing a truly strategic defence partnership. This presents an opportunity to significantly boost the British defence industry - worth \u00a35.4 billion in annual exports and sustaining 54,000 jobs \u2013 and the prime minister will use to the trip to specifically promote the Typhoon fast jet to Gulf leaders.</p> <p>The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman have all expressed an interest in purchasing Typhoons and the Government is aiming to secure sales of over 100 aircraft to the region in the coming year, deals that together would be directly worth over \u00a36 billion to British firms with additional benefits through supply chain work.</p> <p>Oman is already in negotiations with BAE Systems for 12 fast jets with the contract due to be signed before the end of the year. And the Saudis have signalled that they are interested in placing a second substantial order, on top of the 72 jets they have already acquired.</p> <p>On the back of this success, the government is now encouraging the United Arab Emirates to choose Typhoon as they seek to replace their current fleet of French Mirage jets. The Emiratis have shown interest in placing an order for up to 60 jets and the prime minister will fly straight into a military airbase near Dubai where he will accompany the deputy chief of staff the UAE Armed Forces and the Emirati minister of state for foreign affairs to inspect the Typhoons with RAF pilots on hand to share their experiences of flying one of the best fast jets in the world. The government is currently working with the companies involved in the construction of Typhoons to ensure that the fast jets are kitted out with the latest targeting technology to increase the prospect of boosting their export sales.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7b337806-e019-43cd-8d13-a57333f50309\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352108053338/f745bdb1-6f1c-4f58-b6b4-9cc9739c9981-460.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron in Dubai\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron looks on beside Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airlines and Group, and president of Dubai's Civil Aviation Authority, during a visit to the Dubai metro.

I guess that a \u00a35000 deposit is a bit of a turn-off, as must be the general public apathy and lack of understanding of what it's all about.</p> </blockquote> <p>North Yorkshire is one of five northern police areas where local people might be thought to have particular reasons for getting involved (including by ballot-spoiling).

Welcome to Middle East Live. Here is a round-up of the latest developments.</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/syria-opposition-united-qatar-conference\"><strong>Sharp disagreements have emerged at a Syrian opposition conference in Qatar meant to forge a more cohesive leadership.</strong></a> The Syrian National Council has balked at a plan backed by western powers that would dilute the SNC's influence. But with international pressure mounting, it also suggested it was willing to negotiate a compromise that would give it more influence in a new leadership team. The SNC is due to decide on Wednesday whether to accept a plan proposed by a prominent dissident, Riad Seif, to set up a new leadership group of about 50 members. The SNC would get about 15 seats, while military commanders and local leaders in rebel-held areas would win wider representation. SNC chief Abdelbaset Sieda said he and others in the group no longer trusted promises of international support linked to restructuring of the opposition. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We faced this situation before, when we formed the SNC. There were promises like that, but the international community in fact did not give us the support needed for the SNC to do its job.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/11/201211552650353858.html\"><strong>The UN-Arab League envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, has called for a new UN security council resolution to formalise an declaration adopted in Geneva in June, which called for a transitional administration but did not specify what role, if any, Assad would take.</strong></a> The initiative came after Brahimi met the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrovin Cairo yesterday. Brahimi said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is important that the Geneva Declaration be turned into a resolution from the security council to gain the power to enable it to become an applicable political project.</p> </blockquote> <p>Al-Jazeera reported that Lavrov dismissed the need for a resolution, saying \u201csome countries which participated in Geneva don't speak with the government but only with the opposition and encourage them to fight till victory and this has very negative implications\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-syria-damascus-bombardmentbre8a409w-20121104,0,3187029.story\"><strong>The Syrian army has bombarded rebel strongholds in southern Damascus on Monday with artillery and from the air, hours after opposition fighters attacked militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, opposition activists told Reuters.</strong></a> Warplanes fired rockets and tanks and artillery pounded the neighbourhoods of Sbeineh, Yalda, Bibla, al-Tadamun and Hajar a-Aswad, they said. The working-class Sunni Muslim neighbourhoods have been at the forefront of the 19-month-old revolt against Assad</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_JAPAN_SYRIA?SECTION=HOME&amp;SITE=AP&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\"><strong>Japan is to host international talks in late November aimed at widening sanctions against Syria, it said today.</strong></a>Existing sanctions include freezing assets of the Syrian president and military leaders and an embargo on oil and arms trade with Syria.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/syria-rebels-capture-oilfield\"><strong>Syrian rebels captured an oilfield in the east of the country on Sunday after three days of fierce fighting with government troops protecting the facility, activists said</strong></a>. The head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdul-Rahman, said rebels overran the al-Ward oilfield in the province of Deir el-Zour near the border with Iraq. About 40 soldiers were guarding the facility that the rebels had been pounding for the past three days, he said, adding that opposition fighters also captured several regime troops.</p> <h2>Kuwait</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/teargas-protesters-kuwait-city\"><strong>Kuwaiti security forces have fired teargas to disperse a banned demonstration by about 2,000 opposition supporters against new voting rules for parliamentary elections due on 1 December.</strong></a> The emir announced changes to the electoral law last month which some opposition politicians say are an attempt to give pro-government candidates an advantage in the polls.</p> <h2>Libya</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/libya-militia-fire-central-tripoli\"><strong>Rival Libyan militias fired guns and rocket-propelled grenades at each other in Tripoli on Sunday and set fire to a former intelligence building in one of the worst breakdowns in security in the capital since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi</strong></a>. At least five people were wounded and a stray bullet entered a hospital in the city centre, where residents rushed to arm themselves, saying calls to police had gone unheeded.

  "<p>China's elite would normally be watching the election more closely. But with its own once-a-decade leadership transition beginning days after the US votes, it has other matters on its mind.</p> <p>For many in China, the election is of relatively limited interest. Some will follow results avidly, but others are only concerned about the impact on China.</p> <p>\"I like Obama's style. He is a very charming guy \u2026 Romney seems quite aggressive,\" said Beijing-based marketing researcher Ming Ming, adding: \"I'm more concerned about who will have better policy towards China.\"</p> <p>Zheng Jihua, an entrepreneur, said: \"I don't think it makes much difference whether it's Obama or Romney.\"</p> <p>Despite the tough-talking on tackling China during debates, he said: \"The economic connections [between the countries] matters more than political things. If they become president they will be more realistic.\"</p> <p>China is used to playing its part in US presidential races. \"It's an old story, China becoming a political card to play in US elections. This year, Romney and Obama seem to be playing it more heavily,\" an editorial in the populist state-run Global Times said last month.</p> <p>But Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, said most people were more concerned by issues such as tensions with Japan over disputed islands.</p> <p>\"For those who are paying attention, I guess they may feel both sides are not so nice towards China,\" he said. \"I think maybe in government and the foreign policy elites they feel the lesser evil is still Barack Obama because they're familiar with him.</p> <p>\"If you look at the campaign statements, Romney has been much more combative in terms of US economic rivalry.\"</p> <p>Shen Dingli, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, disagreed. He argued that while China did not officially have a preference - due to the country's doctrine of non-interference in other nations' domestic affairs - in reality it leant to Republicans.</p> <p>\"The Republicans are pro-development, pro-foreign trade, pro-efficiency, pro-capitalism,\" he said, and were unlikely to push hard for cuts to China's carbon emissions, while Democrats \"are pro-American poor people and want to protect jobs\".</p> <p>Shen added: \"People claim if Romney is in power, the next day he will tackle China for manipulating the currency. It's a joke. Romney will be China's best friend because he will not honour his threats.\"</p> <p>Experts say tough talk from US candidates is rarely matched by their action once in office. Even so, Shi warned that in general \"Sino-American rivalries have become more profound and sometimes more tense.\"</p>",
  "<p>The announcement by chocolate manufacturer Hershey in October that it would source all of its cocoa from certified sources by 2020 is further evidence that certification is not a niche market activity.</p> <p>Mars, Incorporated made a similar commitment in April, 2009, while Mondeleez (Kraft's new name for its confectionery business), and Unilever (owners of the Magnum ice-cream brand) are all buying certified cocoa for their chocolate. The Rainforest Alliance system alone has 60,000 certified cocoa farms in its programme.</p> <p>Certification awards a certificate to a producer or group of producers to confirm compliance with a set of practices detailed in a standard. Well-known certification bodies differ mainly because of the differing standards on which they are based. In Rainforest Alliance's case, <a href=\"http://www.sanstandards.org\" title=\"\">the sustainable agriculture standard</a> deals with how the farmer manages the land and how people working on it are treated, including the farmer and any workers \u2013 and are subject to continuous improvement and local interpretation as our knowledge and understanding evolves..</p> <p>The cocoa industry embraced certification much later than the coffee industry, with the major growth only happening in the last few years. We have seen a steady growth in chocolate products bearing certification seals. But this is not the main driver of the expansion of certification in the cocoa industry. Most of the work is unseen by the consumer, as the industry addresses a crucial supply issue: cocoa markets are growing strongly, but cocoa farmers have generally low productivity and low incomes. With land a finite resource, and young people wanting to live better than their parents, the issue is where cocoa in the following decades is going to come from.</p> <p>Certification is part of a major push by cocoa and chocolate companies to modernise the industry. Nobody wins if cocoa farmers are so poor that their children abandon the farm and move to the city, or if the soil is so exhausted and the trees so old that they don't produce a decent harvest. No company wants illegal child labour in its supply chain and nor do the governments of the major producing countries in West Africa. It's unacceptable in today's market.</p> <p>The unseen work that is happening to address this significant supply chain risk involves training farmers in improved and sustainable management techniques, increasing their access to business and financial services, strengthening their organisations, developing more productive planting material and the nurseries to grow them, research into soil management and many other aspects affecting a farm's productivity.</p> <p>This work was included in the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/new-business-models-for-sustainable-trade\" title=\"\">new business models for sustainable trade project</a>, for which we partnered with the <a href=\"http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org/\" title=\"\">Sustainable Food Laboratory</a>, <a href=\"http://crs.org/\" title=\"\">Catholic Relief Services</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> (IIED) and <a href=\"http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/Paginas/index.aspx\" title=\"\">The International Centre for Tropical Agriculture</a>.</p> <p>This project \u2013 on which <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/16034IIED.pdf\" title=\"\">a new report is published by the IIED</a> \u2013 has deepened our institutional knowledge about how market systems can be coupled with critical on-the-ground services which farmers need to advance toward stability, profitability and long term sustainable practices.</p> <p>It is not just the companies with leading high street brands that are involved. Companies supplying cocoa beans and processing them into chocolate ingredients are working directly with the farmers to upgrade their skills and knowledge. It is they, alongside the Rainforest Alliance, that has trained the 60,000 certified farmers. That is how certification has grown so quickly as part of an effort to make sure there is enough cocoa produced under good environmental and ethical conditions without needing to clear forests and damaging fragile ecosystems for new planting.</p> <p>Much is made of the premium prices associated with certified products. Farmers expect to be paid more for certified products because of the effort they have made to achieve the certification. But the real gain is not in the market but on the farm. <a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/sites/default/files/publication/pdf/ra-certification-cocoa-cote-divoire-cosa_0.pdf\" title=\"\">An independent survey published in 2012</a> found that Rainforest Alliance certified farms in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire registered as much as 70% more productivity than a control group of non-certified farms. The improved earnings of the farmer do not depend on a niche market; they come directly from the farm management.</p> <p>Sustaining and further increasing these achievements will secure the cocoa supply that the world needs and provide a competitive livelihood for the next generation of cocoa farmers. Brands will continue to use certification seals but the bigger focus is, and must remain, on the farmer and the farm, which is where certification bodies started out.</p> <p><em>Edward Millard is director of sustainable landscapes for the </em><a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Rainforest Alliance</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>When my headteacher asked me if I would be ready to go to Denmark on a preparatory meeting for a <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/comenius\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comenius</a> project I'm ashamed to admit that my first thought was \"Where's Denmark again?\" and my second was \"I'll need to buy a suitcase\". You see, I was a home bird. Wales had always been enough for me. I'd never felt the need to take a gap year or go on exotic holidays. I went to Denmark though. I came back as secretary for a Comenius project for 10 countries and helped to fill in an application form which meant that all 10 countries were accepted.</p> <p>I've been busy. Our project was called Citizenship Locally and Globally and we held seven meetings about different themes such as creativity and bullying. I had to collect information about our school to present during project meetings. It sounds strange to say that one effect of Comenius was that I got to know my school better because I was asking questions I wouldn't have asked but for the project. I was working with colleagues I wouldn't have worked with otherwise.</p> <p>I have wanted to tackle things that I wouldn't have had the confidence to try previously. I'm taking on the responsibility for preparing materials for the project website. I'm deciding that we need to hold a Comenius Week in school. Suddenly I'm going to the headteacher and saying \"We need to apply for an <a href=\"http://schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org/accreditation-and-awards/isa/uk-schools/about\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intermediate International School Award</a>, I've started the form\". We got the award and, somehow, I became international coordinator.</p> <p>From the start it wasn't enough for me that I had seen other countries, eaten different food, talked about different education systems. What was the point of that? Just one person having an amazing experience? I wanted the effect of my Comenius experience to be greater. I wanted the children in my school to realise that there was more to the world than their little corner. I wanted them to be inspired. So I started to talk, I told my class about what I'd seen. I told them about the cross country skiing at playtime for the children in the Norwegian school, about the policeman on duty all the time in the Latvian school and about the massive headteacher's office in the Bulgarian school.</p> <p>Every time I came back from a Comenius project meeting the children in my class couldn't wait. They wanted to know what foods they eat in Spain or Slovenia, what was special about Norway or Bulgaria, was the Latvian school different from ours? And I knew the answers without having to Google them. But the best day, the day I knew that Comenius would really influence the school life of these children, was when a child asked me if Norwegian sounded similar to Danish. My answer? \"You can find out for yourself, they'll be visiting us soon.\" They looked at each other for a split second. The response? \"They want to visit us miss?\" Yes, they did, and I had to work with the headteacher to organise it. But it was okay, I had 27 willing helpers.</p> <p>So we started preparing. We wanted to show our country and our school at their best. Our culture was about to take centre stage. It was our turn to create the stories for those teachers to take home to tell their pupils. We prepared a special welcome assembly, rehearsed our 10 year old tour guides, learnt how to say welcome in nine different languages and planned every activity meticulously. We were examining our own culture and our own community and trying to include as many people as possible in our project.</p> <p>The proudest moment of my career so far has been standing in front of my choir in that special assembly as 50 children sang their hearts out, words about a red dragon on our flag showing their pride for their country. For those two minutes every child looked straight at me as I conducted and they couldn't have given any more. I had tears in my eyes at the end because those children cared about this because I cared. Because I had told them all about these teachers who were excited to visit Wales and see our school. Because they wanted to meet those teachers and ask all their questions. Their joy at the end, hearing these international visitors break one of the rules of assembly and cheer and whistle instead of applauding politely, made all the sleepless nights worth it. Comenius had made a difference to our school.</p> <p>Could I have done it without travelling to project meetings? Without meeting all these wonderful people? Not a chance. I was taken out of my comfort zone and confronted with a whole host of new and different experiences. Such a great experience makes you think about your own teaching, your school and about yourself. I have finished this project a different person from when I started. I approach school life with a different mind-set. I take on responsibility and have the confidence to try something new.</p> <p>Now, teaching children a few facts about a country, teaching them to recognise a country on a map, looking at the weather will never be enough for me. I want children to be excited about their own and other countries. I want them to be fascinated by differences and similarities between their culture and the culture of others. I want them to love learning phrases in other languages. I want them to leave my class as curious and respectful citizens. The impact of Comenius will be seen in my class for many years to come.</p> <p><em>Sioned Hughes is a teacher and international co-ordinator at Llandrindod Wells Church in Wales Community Primary School, Ysgol Trefonnen, in Wales.</em></p> <p><em>Content on this page was provided by the <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/schools\" title=\"rel=\" \"nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\">British Council</a> and <a href=\"http://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">eTwinning</a> - supporters of the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network\" title=\"\">Teacher Network</a>'s Teaching and learning in the global classroom week.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional%E2%80%9D title=\" %e2%80%9dguardian\" professional\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The last of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">17 climate change campaigners perched on a power station tower</a> for a week have abseiled down to be arrested, ending the longest occupation of a plant in the UK.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nodashforgas.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The group</a> called it a day after using their 300ft-high platform for a range of stunts to encourage debate on carbon emissions and what they called the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/03/uk-dash-gas\" title=\"\">\"dash for gas\"</a>. These included solar panels, a portable toilet and a kite flown to rig up a rope walkway between two cooling towers, and mock <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\" title=\"\">last week's coalition row over windfarms</a>.</p> <p>Police ringing the \u00a3600m EDF plant at West Burton in Nottinghamshire finished a series of peaceful arrests when the group's main spokeswoman, Ewa Jasiewicz, slid down a rope after promising more protests to come. She said: \"This was the first time activists have managed to successfully shut down a power station, and the longest occupation of a power station the UK has ever seen.</p> <p>\"We stopped 20,000 tonnes of CO2 being emitted, prevented any construction work on the site for a week and got our message about how reckless and ridiculous George Osborne's proposed 'dash for gas' is out to thousands of people. I'm proud of what we've achieved \u2013 but it's only the start of the battle for our energy future.\"</p> <p>Before descending the central tower of three water-coolers at the 1300MW combined cycle gas turbine station, whose pre-production tests were stopped by EDF as soon as the occupation started in the early hours of Monday 29 October, the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/nodashforgas\" title=\"\">protesters sent final tweets</a> in a stream which has included photographs of dawn, sunset and work on a flimsy but ingenious tarpaulin tent. The occupation also saw a platform lowered into the chimney flue, one of the few places at 300ft above the Trent valley sheltered from the wind.</p> <p>The protest was strongly criticised by local Labour MP John Mann and Nottinghamshire police who warned that the county's taxpayers would have to pick up the bill. For its part, EDF defended its plans to reduce carbon emissions by 60% between 2006 and 2020, with West Burton's new gas-fired station adding to the UK's \"balanced energy mix.\"</p> <p>An EDF statement said: \"While we support the right to peaceful protest, this act of trespass put at risk the safety of the individuals involved and has diverted the valuable resources of the local police and other agencies.</p> <p>\"Once completed, West Burton B will provide electricity to around 1.5m homes at a time when many of our nation's powers stations will be coming to the end of their operating lives. The project to build West Burton B was commenced as far back as 2007. It will play its part in our strategy to deliver a diverse, low-carbon energy generation including mix alongside nuclear and renewables but it is the only gas-fired station currently being developed by EDF Energy.\"</p> <p>The plant stands next to the large West Burton coal-fired power station, built in the late 1960s and now also operated by EDF, which was not affected by the protest and continued to generate as normal.</p> <p>The 17 arrested chimney-climbers have been bailed along with five other protesters who were caught at the plant on the night of the invasion, when a police helicopter led a search at around 4am. All have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, an offence introduced along with anti-rave measures in the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act which carries maximum penalties of three months' jail and/or a \u00a32,500 fine for anyone refusing a senior police officer's direction to desist.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire police gave details of six separate descents from the central chimney and a second, incomplete one, which was also occupied. A total of eight women and nine men from the chimneys have been bailed with ages given so far for only two of them, a man of 32 and a woman of 35. The police said: \"The protesters come from locations throughout the country and none of them live in Nottinghamshire.\"</p>",

It gives of itself in an attempt to help others improve. Applied to the NHS, it rises above the interest of self, profession and organisation. Yet it could also be a tough love if applied to health inequality. Might unconditional love put populations of people ahead of individual patients in its pursuit of better and more equitable outcomes?</p> <p>The British love affair with our NHS brings strength and weakness. As with all strengths, we should seek to build on them and with all weaknesses, seek to strengthen them. As we continue in our efforts to improve the NHS together, how can we ensure that our love for it neither blinds us to the change required, nor renders others blind and stifles debate?

  "<p>With its glamorous presenter, primetime slot, nervous participants and eager crowd \u2013 brandishing smiling or frowning cardboard faces to indicate approval or disdain \u2013 it might sound like another of China's glitzy dating shows. But the anxious men facing the cameras on Wuhan Television have more than romance on their minds. All are officials facing up to angry complaints from the public and a potentially career-stalling audience verdict.</p> <p>\"Ordinary people take part. Ordinary people comment. Ordinary people supervise,\" growls the voiceover on a trailer.</p> <p>America is not the only global superpower picking a new leader this week. On Thursday, China opens its 18th party congress, designed to usher in the new generation of Communist party officials who will govern the world's most populous country into the 2020s. The process will be choreographed to within an inch of its life. Its outcomes, decided in advance by the leadership, will not be properly known until the middle of November. But the men (there almost certainly will not be any women) who file on to the stage for collective approbation face a public that increasingly demands the right to hold its government to account. The party is seeking new ways to respond without undermining its rule.</p> <p>Officials are adopting additional methods of observing and channelling the public mood, whether that be using <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/16/internet-china-censorship-weibo-microblogs\" title=\"Guardian: Microblogs\">microblogs</a> \u2013 there are 80,000 government accounts, according to state media \u2013 or television shows such as Wuhan's.</p> <p>Citizens expect more from their officials, and stories of malfeasance or incompetence spread quickly online. Governance problems are given a face by figures such as \"Uncle House\" - a Nanjing official under investigation after internet users revealed he and his family owned more than 20 properties, despite his modest monthly salary of around 10,000 yuan (\u00a31000).</p> <p>Authorities have repeatedly vowed to crack down on corruption. State media have reported that 600,000 officials faced punishment for disciplinary violations over the last five years.</p> <p>Yet in 2008, just under 40% of Chinese people deemed corrupt officials a very big problem. That has risen to 50%, according to the Pew Global Attitudes Project.</p> <p>The Chinese leadership \"knows the legitimacy of the party now depends on performance, in terms of delivering services and improvements in living standards\", said Steve Tsang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham.</p> <p>The result is what he calls \"a consultative Leninist system \u2026 They want to know what people think so they can take away the causes of discontent and potential challenges to the party. That's not the same as the accountability we would talk about and expect in Europe or North America; it's more of a safety valve and has an element of [the Maoist injunction] 'from the masses, to the masses'.\"</p> <p>The Wuhan show, which aired this summer and is due to return next month, is limited both in the subjects it tackles and in the personnel taking part. While vice-mayors appeared this summer, the city's most senior leaders were absent. It touched on issues such as food safety, but steered well clear of sensitive topics such as birth control.</p> <p>Even so, the questioning was pointed at times. \"I'm still sweating,\" vice-mayor Hu Lishan told the Global Times after appearing on the show.</p> <p>Both Wuhan Television and government officials declined to respond to queries from the Guardian.</p> <p>Zhao Zhenyu, a scholar at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology who also participated, said: \"Because it's live, the officials can't prepare; you can tell they are nervous during the show. They have to fix the problem after appearing on the programme, as people are watching them, and they have pressure.</p> <p>\"There are many ways to supervise the government. This TV show is just one of them.\"</p> <p>In one programme, a disgruntled resident complained: \"You always ask us ordinary people to report it if the lake is getting filled [up with stuff], but actually even if we report it we're just wasting our time. You said you would ask people to take responsibility. You just cheat people.\"</p> <p>An official's promise to clear up the rubbish quickly met with short shrift from the presenter: \"Next month? You said 'as soon as possible',\" she reminded him.</p> <p>\"By the end of this month,\" he responded.</p> <p>\"There are only a few days left,\" she said.</p> <p>\"In a week,\" he added, with a nervous smile. In another show, not available online, the head of the industry and commerce administration was reportedly confronted with footage showing his workers asking businesses to give them cash-filled envelopes - then was handed an empty letter by a presenter.</p> <p>Mao Yushi, a leading economist who has pushed hard to improve governance, said improving communication with the public was a positive step, but warned: \"If it becomes propaganda, it will be meaningless.\"</p> <p>Critics see such projects as essentially tokenistic and argue they do little to tackle the problems at their roots. They say what is needed are measures to improve transparency, such as publishing officials' assets, and, ultimately, democratic reforms.</p> <p>\"These new programmes sanitise and normalise the 'trials by internet' of corrupt and incompetent government officials which has already been going on for some years in China,\" said Dr Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on propaganda at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch.</p> <p>Those had developed, she argued, because the justice system cannot be relied on to resolve such problems and the Chinese media is muzzled and shackled.</p> <p>\"These programmes represent an attempt to appease the popular desire to hold officials accountable and will also likely attract a wide audience - meeting both the Party line and the bottom line,\" she added.</p> <p>\u2022 What better way to prepare to ring in the new, than to clean out the old? And so the week began with the formal expulsion of Bo Xilai, the erstwhile rising star who fell from grace, accused of numerous crimes including corruption and bending the law to hush up the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood by his wife, Gu Kailai.</p> <p>Once his wife was convicted, Bo's fate was never seriously in doubt. The only surprise, perhaps, was that it took a four-day closed-door meeting to ratify it.</p> <p>\u2022 Few things encapsulate the authorities' approach to the 18th congress \u2013 the simultaneous desire for fanfare and secrecy \u2013 better than state news agency Xinhua's report on plans to update the party's constitution. It announced that the central committee had approved an amendment, which can only be made at the congress, and that the heir apparent, Xi Jinping, had elaborated on it.</p> <p>It said that the amendment had been decided at a Politburo meeting last month \u2013 and that it would reflect the party's latest theoretical achievements in localising Marxism and practical experience. Is that clear?</p>",

The scores were derived by measuring 39 softer, more human perceptions of how voters feel \"brand Obama\" and \"brand Romney\" can improve their lives from both community and personal perspectives. In particular, this methodology shows how voters feel each candidate is placed to deliver meaningful messages as the impact of superstorm Sandy inevitably shifts the campaign focus back on to communities, the environment and the people within it.</p> <p>The analysis revealed that although two-thirds of voters believe Barack Obama will win the election, voter fatigue set in immediately following each of the four presidential debates. Viewing figures and overall faith in either candidate's ability to improve quality of lives fell. Overall, Obama continues to hold the lead across all 39 meaningful metrics after the final debate, but before superstorm Sandy hit his numbers were softening. Mitt Romney's numbers were showing some signs of life, especially as he either led or was close to Obama on the two metrics that voters cared most about: promoting business and creating jobs and confidence in the country.</p> <p>However, in the wake of superstorm Sandy and focus shifting towards communities and the environment, Obama's figures start to show considerable strength. On both personal and collective issues, Obama is much stronger in all areas associated with the community, the environment and safety.</p> <p>How each candidate is placed on key issues in the aftermath of superstorm Sandy: 1. \"Listens to and cares about people\" \u2013 Obama's scores are double those of Romney throughout the four recent tracking periods. His scores are on average at 45% compared with scores in the low 20s percentile for Romney</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> \"Is truly interested in and committed to solving environmental issues\" \u2013 Obama's scores overshadow Romney's at an average of 38% over the last four weeks compared to those of Romney's which are languishing in the early teens.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> \"Is taking a lead on environmental issues\": \u2013 again Romney lags way behind, ending the month just two points up at 13% compared to Obama's 39%.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> \"Helps voters feel part of a community\": \u2013 Obama leads again by more than double each week, yet the figures are still low for both \u2013 26% for Obama compared to 12% for Romney.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> \"Fosters community development\" \u2013 Obama scores started at 28% and ended on 32%, while Romney started at 15% and ended on 19%.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> \"Helps voters protect the environment\" \u2013 Obama more than doubles Romney's score, although both are low. Obama ending at 23% and Romney at just 10%.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> \"Makes people feel safer from threats and harm\" \u2013 Obama started a month ago at 26% and ended at 29%, while Romney started and finished at 19%.</p> <p>Hernan Sanchez, CEO of Havas Media Intelligence comments: \"While we don't doubt that both candidates are genuine in their repositioning towards the communities which have been hit, it's interesting to see how credible, meaningful and believable their actions will be in these crucial days before the election. We see from these results just how solid Obama's footage is on these issues. At the same time however, should the relief effort fail, he has more to lose.\"</p> <p>Umair Haque, director of Havas Media Labs adds: \"Hurricane Sandy is a dramatic example of why people across the globe are beginning to look to their leaders and institutions not just for more, bigger, faster, cheaper \u2013 but meaningfully better; for lives that are meaningfully well lived. And you can't live meaningfully well if there's a superstorm blowing down your door. Throughout our election research, American voters have delivered one single message: while elections are contests between two imperfect candidates, neither candidate is seen to be living up to their expectations of taking on the challenges that matter most, whether rebuilding the real economy, education, healthcare, transport, or infrastructure \u2013 or, of course, protecting the environment. This great political meaning gap \u2013 the gap between what people want from leaders, and what leaders give to people \u2013 is why the relationship between politics and people is broken and America. And the great challenge for today's leaders isn't winning an election, but fixing this broken relationship, by getting serious about what matters: the promise of meaningfully better lives.\"</p> <p><em>By the Havas </em><a href=\"http://www.havasmedia.com/our-thinking/meaningfulbrands/\" title=\"\"><em>Meaningful Brands</em></a><em> team</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>One response to the development impasse caused by modernisation and dependency theories <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/30/neoliberalism-approach-development-ignored-past-lessons\" title=\"\">was \"can do\" neoliberalism</a>; another involved reflection on the very purpose of development. This took shape across \"alternative\" approaches including environment, gender and sustainability. All these approaches grew up alongside the neoliberal right, but most were drowned out, for a time at least, by its noisiness.</p> <p>Perhaps the most distinctive new approach, however \u2013 one set on meeting the new right's noisiness with a strategic and all-encompassing silence \u2013 was the post-development thinking embodied by the work of Colombian scholar Arturo Escobar.</p> <p>Escobar's ideas are best summed up in his 1995 book <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Encountering_Development.html?id=Y35aclb012YC\" title=\"\">Encountering Development</a>, which offered much more than an analysis of mainstream development economics or the sprawling array of development actors and institutions it spawned. It was a critique of the whole rotten edifice of western ideas that supported development, which Escobar regarded as a contradiction in terms and a sham. For Escobar, development amounted to little more than the west's convenient \"discovery\" of poverty in the third world for the purposes of reasserting its moral and cultural superiority in supposedly post-colonial times.</p> <p>Escobar felt development was, unavoidably, both an ideological export (something Walt Rostow would willingly have admitted) and a simultaneous act of cultural imperialism. With its highly technocratic language and forthright deployment of norms and value judgements, it was also a form of cultural imperialism that poor countries had little means of declining politely. \"Perhaps no other idea has been so insidious, no other idea gone so unchallenged,\" Escobar sneered.</p> <p>But what exactly did he mean? Surely some planning is better than outright anarchy? Surely, whatever one's political views, when confronted by a world as unequal as our own, it is important to try to do something?</p> <p>As a glance at his intellectual influences suggests, Escobar's argument was a good deal more sophisticated than such questions allow. The first of these influences was the French philosopher Michel Foucault and his idea that power is not simply something that (rich, powerful) people hold over others, but is produced in and through all the things we do \u2013 even things like helping others. Through Foucault, Escobar came to the conclusion that development planning was not only a problem to the extent that it failed; it was a problem even when it succeeded, because it so strongly set the terms for how people in poor countries could live. Told how to behave, poor people were made subjects of development as much as they were subjects of their own government.</p> <p>Escobar also sought to channel the insights of the Palestinian literary theorist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/26/guardianobituaries.highereducation\" title=\"\">Edward Said</a> and his analysis of what he termed \"Orientalism\". Said had shown how western constructions of the Orient as exotic and enticing, yet also dangerous, were not merely passive descriptions of other people and places, they were central to the imaginative production of those places. And they were usually constructed either as sites of excess (sexuality, say) or conversely as lacking in some fundamental value (civilisation, say). In either case, those abnormalities needed bringing into line. Development was just a modern way of doing this: a re-enactment of Orientalist tropes in technocratic guise. Hence it was ultimately a way for the west to manage the rest for their own gain, only ever allowing poor people a future that the rich could imagine for them.</p> <p>Coming at a time when western universities were in the grip of the postmodern challenge to systems of knowledge, Escobar's post-development critique sparked considerable debate. Coming at a time when mainstream development was beginning to incorporate a softer, more human approach alongside the market-driven solutions of the 1980s, Escobar found ever more evidence to support his ideas. As he saw it, the more the development industry claimed to be improving on past practice \u2013 as it tramped from anti-poverty to pro-poor to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/policy/wess/wess2010workshop/wess2010_emmerij.pdf\" title=\"\">basic human needs approaches</a> \u2013 the more it continued to fall into the serious trap of imposing a western agenda on others.</p> <p>But if the first finger that people lift to help is on a hand destined to meddle, what are those who wish to see a fairer world to do? While some anti-development writers have encouraged a back-to-the-soil populism in response, Escobar's answer is again a good deal more sophisticated. For him the answer lies in creating space \u2013 intellectual first and foremost \u2013 for \"local agency\" to assert itself. In practice this means one of two things:</p> <p>First, it means encouraging local communities and traditions rooted in local identities to address their own problems. Not buying into the western development agenda does not mean denying that some societies lack both resources and power relative to others. This was an argument that Escobar developed in dialogue with feminist scholars like Vandana Shiva, and it can be found today in such initiatives as the <a href=\"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/development/journal/v54/n4/full/dev201186a.html\" title=\"\">Buen Vivir</a> moment in Latin America.</p> <p>Second, and related to this first, it means criticising any existing distortions \u2013 economic or political \u2013 that limit peoples' ability to develop. Escobar has therefore been highly critical of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8208254.stm\" title=\"\">free trade zones</a>, such as the <a href=\"http://www.udel.edu/leipzig/texts2/vox128.htm\" title=\"\"><em><i>maquiladoras</i></em></a> in Mexico, or what is happening on a vaster scale in parts of China. Instead, he points to a politics of \"degrowth\" as a way of addressing some of these distortions.</p> <p>But can local always be the answer to the problems of globalisation? As many have argued, and as Escobar would doubtless acknowledge, when there are material differences in life chances (not to mention life expectancy) between different places, an excessive localism may end up as no less essentialising than an all-out universalism: little more than a romanticism of the poor.</p> <p>But these are lessons that development has in large measure learned (which isn't to say it doesn't repeat many others). And if it has indeed failed to the extent that great poverty still exists, it has nonetheless helped bring about remarkable gains in life chances and opportunities. It has done this, moreover, despite as much as because of the unequalising effects of global capitalism.</p>",
  "<p>Cases of a deadly tree disease that causes ash trees to die back have been found in Kent and Essex, the government said on Monday.</p> <p>The infected trees are the first found in the wild outside of Norfolk and Suffolk, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/24/ash-dieback-disease-east-anglia\" title=\"\">first cases outside of nurseries and recent plantings were confirmed two weeks ago</a>.</p> <p>Tree experts have warned that the fungus, <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, threatens 95% of the UK's estimated 80 million ash trees. David Cameron's spokesman today said the government was \"taking this issue very seriously\", and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is convening a summit on Wednesday on proposals to tackle the disease.</p> <p>The confirmation of infections in Kent and Essex follows a weekend where volunteers looked for cases of the disease, which causes the crown of the tree to die back and leaves to turn brown. There are now a total of 82 confirmed sites, up from 52 as recently as this weekend.</p> <p>However, Defra stressed that it did not believe the new cases had necessarily spread from East Anglia, but may have been present in the environment already, with the spores born on the wind from the continent, where the disease is widespread.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, said: \"We're doing everything we can to identify where the disease is so that we can focus our efforts on those areas. Once we had the scientific advice that the disease in mature trees had probably arrived here by wind from Europe, it was always likely that we'd find it in coastal areas. Sadly that's the case with the confirmation today of the disease in Kent and Essex. I would expect even more cases to be confirmed as our urgent survey of ash trees continues.\"</p> <p>A crowdsourced effort to map the spread of the disease in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/ashtag-app-tree-disease-dieback\" title=\"\">AshTag</a>, is expected to release details later today of public sightings verified by a tree expert.</p> <p>But a shortage of botanists is adding to the problem of dealing with ash dieback. Diane Hird of the University of Bristol, who led a report into plant pathology education and training in the UK, said there had been a \"serious decline\" in the teaching of and research into plant diseases in the UK, going back for two decades.</p> <p>British universities have appointed very few new plant pathologists since 1990, and many of the number still at UK universities were appointed more than three decades ago. Only one in seven universities now provide practical courses for trainee botanists in looking at plant disease.</p> <p>Plant disease is a wider problem than the ash dieback disease, serious though that is. Farmers are battling with new and variant diseases, and globalisation has meant a huge increase in the risk of new plant diseases, affecting everything from crops to people's herbaceous borders. As some herbicides have lost their edge, the number of diseases spread by weeds has also increased. The UK's forests are under \"unprecedented threat\" from foreign pests and diseases, the Forestry Commission <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/uk-forests-unprecedented-threat-disease\" title=\"\">said last week</a>.</p> <p>Prof James Brown, president of the British Society of Plant Pathology, said the job losses in plant science were \"severe\". He said: \"Britain is not producing graduates with the expertise needed to identify and control plant diseases in our farms and woodlands.\"</p> <p>A plant nursery forced to destroy 50,000 ash trees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/05/ash-dieback-government-legal-action\" title=\"\">said today it was suing the government</a> for failing to block imports of the tree sooner. A ban on imports of live ash trees was imposed on 29 October.</p> <p>Paterson is holding twice daily meetings on the threat of ash dieback disease, and is focused on the future rather than criticising any previous government failure, the prime minister's spokesman added.</p> <p>He refused to be drawn into responding threats of claims for compensation over past failure of government policy, saying: \"If people are going to demand compensation that is something that will be decided in the courts.\" But he pointed out that other countries across Europe have struggled to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>",
  "<p>\"I can't single-handedly build a new Jerusalem,\" said John Hayes, the Tory energy minister, last week, \"but I can protect our green and pleasant land.\" What was he on about? Windfarms. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/john-hayes-energy-wind-renewables\" title=\"\">He wants them stopped because he says locals don't like them.</a></p> <p>But that isn't always the case. Take Sams\u00f8, a pretty island off the coast of Denmark. In the late 90s, Sams\u00f8's 4,000 elderly farmers were famous for their early crop of new potatoes. Smothering their isolated Eden with windmills was far from a priority.</p> <p>Yet 15 years later, that is exactly what's happened. These conservative islanders have installed 11 onshore windmills, while another 10 lie just off the coast. Astonishingly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/21/renewableenergy.alternativeenergy\" title=\"\">Sams\u00f8 is now one of the world's largest carbon-neutral settlements</a>.</p> <p>To find how it happened, I visited the island this spring while researching my new book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781780721330\" title=\"\">How to be Danish</a>. The answer? Community ownership. Sixteen of the 21 new turbines are owned either by local co-operatives, or by individual farmers. This means that the turbines haven't been sprung on the locals. Instead, the latter are invested in the former, both emotionally and financially. The excess energy created by the turbines is sold back to the national grid \u2013 and the profit creates a handy annual dividend for each local. \"There's money in it,\" smiles 66-year-old Erik Andersen, who owns a herd of rare Red Danish cows. \"It's a good investment.\"</p> <p>So wind power doesn't always alienate locals. Denmark has over 6,000 turbines \u2013 2,000 more than Britain, despite being a sixth of the size. This is partly down to its topography: it's flat, so there's a lot of wind. But it's also to do with how the Danes involve local communities. <a href=\"http://www.wind-works.org/articles/Russ%20Christianson%20NOW%20Article%201.pdf\" title=\"\">Around 70-80% of those turbines are co-owned by local groups</a> \u2013 little wonder there's more of them.</p> <p>Could it happen in Britain? <a href=\"http://www.icmresearch.com/community-owned-renewable-energy\" title=\"\">An ICM poll suggests so</a>: while only one in two Britons would back a windmill within two miles of their home, 68% would support one that was community-owned. John Hayes, take note.</p>",

  "<p>Atishoo! The cold season is well under way, and you may already be half-way through your first bottle of Olbas Oil. So how about making money as you snuffle? That's exactly what you can do at <a href=\"http://www.flucamp.com\" title=\"Flucamp.com\">Flu Camp</a>.</p> <p>Run by a company called <a href=\"http://www.retroscreen.com/\" title=\"Retroscreen Virology Ltd website\">Retroscreen Virology Ltd</a>, the camps, which perhaps unsurprisingly are popular with students, offer participants thousands of pounds to take part in short-term trials. A paid trial at one of their facilities will involve being administered a small dose of a respiratory virus, placed in quarantine and then treated with ethically approved vaccines and antiviral medications.</p> <p>The name may conjure up images of people huddled coughing round a campfire, but if you look at the website you'll find a picture of beaming students running through a field. Although the quarantined facilities are probably not this idyllic, the cash on offer will certainly make you rub your eyes. </p> <p>The company lures volunteers with payments of \"up to \u00a33,750\" for trials that last between 10 and 18 days. Applicants are promised \"a very comfortable room, sharing with only one other volunteer; an en suite bathroom; wireless internet access; three meals a day; TV and Playstation!\" As a package, that's not to be sniffed at.</p> <p>It sounds good, but there have been horror stories related to medical testing \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/mar/15/health.medicineandhealth1\" title=\"Guardian: Drug trial leaves men critically ill\">the 'Elephant Man' trial</a> where six men in north London were admitted to intensive care. The trial, using the drug TGN1412 to treat arthritis and leukaemia, almost took a fatal turn but luckily the men survived. Although these instances are extremely rare, the memory lingers on.</p> <p>The company behind Flu Camp assures me there have been no unfortunate incidents to date. And it seems they can afford to be picky about who to sign up.</p> <p>Flu Camper Ben Jones, 23 and from Bristol, likened the experience to \"auditioning on The X-Factor\". Candidates are put through various medical checks to make sure they are suitable. These include screenings, urine and blood tests, a full health check-up and barometer readings. Due to the nature of the virus applicants must be aged between 18 and 45 and be alcohol-, drug- and cigarette-free.</p> <p>\"People say 'I would never gamble with my health', but medical testing is worth it if you consider your mental health,\" Jones says. \"Think about the number of months you'd have to work on minimum wage in a bar, cafe or office to get the amount you could in a safe environment for a few weeks.\"</p> <p>Put like that, 'snot a bad way to make money is it \u2013 particularly at a time when your nose is probably already running? Or does the thought of contracting any kind of illness for cash make you shiver?</p>",
  "<p>Nothing \u2013 not cricket, not the flag of St George \u2013 is as English as beef. It has been a symbol and source of national pride for centuries. The song <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roast_Beef_of_Old_England\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Roast Beef of Old England</a>, written in 1731, was once a national anthem, sung by the audience in theatres. It's still played when officers of the Royal Navy sit down to eat.</p> <p><strong>When mighty Roast Beef was the Englishman's food,<br>It ennobled our brains and enriched our blood.<br>Our soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good<br>Oh! the Roast Beef of old England,<br>And old English Roast Beef!</strong></p> <p>As the lyrics go on to tell you, English roast beef summed up the differences between us and namby-pamby, ragout-loving nations that messed around with their meat. (In turn, in the 18th century, French writers would sneer about how the national diet made the English \"rosbifs\" oafish and uncivilised).</p> <p>But there's no doubt, as the old cookbooks show, that the British loved their beef. A big roast was the usual Christmas food (turkey is an import from the United States), because male cattle were often killed at the end of the year. Later in the winter, salted beef was the norm; I have a 1920s cookbook with instructions on how to \"salt a whole bullock\". Salt beef could be rinsed and boiled, and it survives today as a sandwich filling \u2013 and as corned beef (the \"corns\" are the grains of salt).</p> <p>We ate our roasts in the old days well-matured, usually till the outside of the carcass was turning rotten. Nowadays, traditional high street butchers who dry-age the best cuts of beef at low temperatures for three or four weeks don't wait for maggots to appear, but I've watched them sniff a side of beef in the cold store for a hint of \"cheese\" to tell them it's ready. The meat, properly aged, is gorgeous: a dark red, more tender and with a fuller flavour.</p> <p>Breeding cattle for meat, rather than for the dairy trade, appears to have been invented in Britain, with breeds singled out for eating from the 15th century onwards. The classic breeds, such as Hereford, Galloway, South Devon and Aberdeen Angus, have now been adopted across the northern hemisphere. A good butcher will be able to tell you what the breed is and where it comes from, and some supermarkets now list breed and provenance.</p> <p>British beef is certainly better, and not just because the cattle species used in hotter places such as Australia and South America that export here are not as tasty. But by far the most important factor in the taste of beef, the research shows, is the animal's diet. Unlike in America, English cattle are still largely fed on what they would naturally eat - grass and fodder made from it like silage and hay. Grass-fed meat always proves tastier in comparison tests and it's certainly healthier, with more vitamins, less unhealthy fat and beneficial Omega-3 fatty acids. Free-range cattle are also much less of a strain on the environment than cattle reared in feed-lots. Butchers, and some supermarket labels, may be able to tell you if beef is grass fed, and organic beef must be fed on a minimum of 60% foraged material.</p> <p>Our beef is safer and healthier now than it has ever been. We don't perhaps eat as much of it as our ancestors: if they took the advice of The Cook's Oracle, a best-selling 19th century lifestyle book, they would have been eating 3kg of meat a week. But our love of a good roast has not changed since the journalist Ned Ward wrote in 1809 of London clubs serving \"the true British Quintessence of Malt and Hops, and a broil'd Sliver off the juicy Rump of a fat well-fed Bullock\" and of men eating steaks until they were \"Knuckle deep in the Gravy\".</p> <p><em>\u2022 Next month read Alex Renton on how to get the most out of your beef</em></p>",

He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>There were all these people getting \u00a3100,000 for rent, families with generations of people not working, people having children just to get more benefits, it goes on and on. All have been debunked by respected fact-finders and by benefit experts who actually deal in statistical analysis.

The people being affected are the polar opposite of Duncan Smith's crude demonisation: they are typical families who are seeing their aspirations smashed by the reforms.<br>The Government's story that all this would lead to landlords reducing rents has also been exposed. Rents continue to rise and more landlords are refusing to take people on housing benefit, another turn of the screw both for the families and for councils.</p> </blockquote> <p>See also the new CPAG report, <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/between-rock-and-hard-place-early-impacts-welfare-reform-london\">Between a Rock and a Hard Place</a>, on the early impacts of welfare reform on London.</p> <p> \u2022 An eye-opening graphic showing the proportion of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobleFrancis/status/265389579195019264/photo/1\">interest only mortgages</a> by region in the UK (thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobleFrancis\">Noble Francis</a>)<br> </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Stepfamilies</strong>.

Blogger Sarah Ismail says the work and pensions secretary's aim was drive home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown. She writes a moving post, dedicated to step-parents, explaining that many studies have shown that families with disabled children are <a href=\"http://www.cafamily.org.uk/what-we-do/our-story-%281%29/\">more likely to break up</a>. And she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is easy to understand that Iain Duncan Smith is a supporter of marriage. However, I do not share his view that it is necessary for any child to live with both biological parents from birth to adulthood in order to have a stable life.<br>As the saying goes, any man can be a father, but not every man can be a dad. Iain Duncan Smith needs to realise that children need mums and dads, not just mothers and fathers.

  "<p>New jobs and financial investment in the energy sector are at risk if the government does not ensure its imminent energy bill supports low-carbon power, an unusual coalition of the trade bodies representing the renewable energy, nuclear power and carbon capture industries has warned.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2012/nov/05/letter-renewableuk-ccs-nuclear-carbon\" title=\"\">letter</a> to the energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, strongly backs the call from the government's climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), to include a reference in the bill for the power sector to be almost entirely decarbonised by 2030.</p> <p>On Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/03/uk-dash-gas\" title=\"\">the Observer revealed</a> that the amount of power expected to be generated from gas by 2030 has quadrupled in the last year, raising fears that carbon targets will be missed and low-carbon generation crowded out. The final version of the energy bill, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/22/government-announces-energy-reforms\" title=\"\">due to bring in the biggest reforms to the energy market in two decades</a>, is expected towards the end of November. The draft version <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">was published in May</a>.</p> <p>The letter signed by the heads of RenewableUK, the Carbon Capture and Storage Association and the Nuclear Industry Association says that a decarbonisation reference would lower \"the perceived political risks, but could also reduce the cost of capital for decarbonising the power sector. We therefore believe that this could be very important for investment going forward.\"</p> <p>The CCC has recommended electricity in 2030 be produced at no more than 50g of CO<sub>2</sub>/kW by 2030; gas power stations emit around 350g of CO<sub>2</sub>/kW. The current energy bill draft has no such target.</p> <p>The trade body chiefs, who represent more than 1,000 companies between them, say that any significant delay in the bill \"could result in investment being postponed, with major implications for associated new industrial development and jobs in a high-tech, high growth sector.\"</p> <p>John Sauven, the executive director at Greenpeace, which opposes nuclear power, took the surprising step of welcoming the letter, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nuclear-wind-and-wave-power-chiefs-in-joint-appeal-on-green-energy-8281122.html\" title=\"\">saying</a>: \"This letter shows that whilst different industries will have differing preferences for the exact mix of energy technologies, there is unity from across huge swathes of the business community on the need for a clear goal in the energy bill to take carbon almost completely out of the electricity system by 2030.\"</p>",
  "<p>The author of this week's poem, <a href=\"http://www.poetrykit.org/iv00/gallagher.htm\">Katherine Gallagher</a>, was born in 1935 in Maldon, a gold-mining town in central Victoria, Australia, and grew up on a farm in nearby Eastville. She lived in Paris for a number of years before settling in the UK in 1979. The journey in \"The Year of the Tree\" is, by contrast, a modest one, confined to the London Underground. But it seems to have larger journeys, like tree rings, wrapped and compressed inside it.</p> <p>The narrative, laid out in spare, short-lined couplets, begins with an arresting hook. As in some of those <a href=\"http://bryantmcgill.com/wiki/poetry/vasko_popa/hide-and-seek\">parables written by eastern European poets in the past century</a> there's a faintly surreal scenario (\"I carried a tree/ through the underground\") presented in a simple, deadpan style. But while plain, the diction is pointed. \"It was hard\" immediately describes the effort of carrying the tree, but extends to the tree's texture and rigidity. The picture we first imagine \u2013 of a whole tree being carried \u2013 is intended: at least, this tree doesn't turn out to be a sapling tucked away in a plastic bag. It's \"heavier than a suitcase\" and possibly human-size, as seems borne out by the use of the pronoun \"we\" at the beginning of stanza five.</p> <p>Typical commuter behaviour is observed as part of the background story. People \"scarcely noticed\" the unusual duo at first \u2013 or perhaps, being seasoned Tube-travellers, they quietly pretended to scarcely notice. Then a few bold spirits venture the reader's own question: \"Why a tree?\"</p> <p>The little vision of tree carrying as a daily \"rite\" may be a tease, but it adds a dimension and further direction to the poem. The answer to \"Why a tree?\" is deliberately humorous. That prim, Latinate abstract noun \"edification\" has grabbed a whole line, mocking its own self-importance. Yet the word is far from hollow: it expands on the existing potential of the tree for building, with a notion of self-building. The following stanza is less tongue-in-cheek: \"A tree always/ has something to teach.\" This may nod towards Gallagher's Irish heritage, and the Celtic tradition of the oak as a source of wisdom. Also, despite its un-fussed and coolly playful tone, by evoking the difficulty of \"lugging\" the tree along, the poem is inevitably a reminder of the Christian significance of tree-carrying.</p> <p>New sounds occur in the next stanza: the \"sharp gusts\" which \"whirred\" (an unusual verb choice) along the Underground's corridors, making the branches rustle. The rustling here is a good detail, and a little ambiguous because, while the tree is destined for replanting (and living foliage, of course, can rustle) the verb is usually associated with autumn and dead, dried-out leaves. The observation that the sweepers are picking up \"scraps of paper\" \u2013 one of the end-products of the timber industry \u2013 enhances this idea. The sweepers, nicely in character, are polite but anxious that the tree shouldn't be left behind \u2013 the image of the tree as unwanted litter is not far away.</p> <p>There doesn't seem to have been a Year of the Tree in the UK, though the UN declared 2011 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2011/jun/03/united-nations-forests-david-attenborough\">International Year of Forests</a>. Gallagher's poem was written considerably earlier. However, her title alerts us to the irony in such well-meaning designations. A mere year of tree awareness would hardly save the planet's forests. It's a mark of the poet's tact and gentle humour that an environmental message is present: potent but not preached. Her oak tree retains an older, mythical resonance.</p> <p>We never see the speaker emerging into daylight so as to fulfil her intention of starting a forest in her garden. We don't even see her boarding a train. At the end of the poem, speaker and tree are still in transit, and the curiosity shown by the other travellers has edged towards paranoia, judging by the comment \"Relax\u2026/ it's a tree, not a gun\".</p> <p>The poem's story has characteristics of a quest, as corridors and escalators are endlessly traversed and questions posed and answered. The shadowy setting hints at a deeper underground, perhaps: the underworld.</p> <p>Descents into the underworld recall <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus\">the Orpheus myth</a>, among others. Oaks were the trees that tore up their roots so as to follow the singer-poet's music to the seashore, and Euridice herself was an oak-tree nymph. Orpheus's music is a kind of peaceable weapon, calming and taming (\"\u2026 a tree, not a gun\"). Though one of the charms of \"The Year of the Tree\" is its light touch, its mythical elements form a strong underpinning. The oak tree seems a fitting symbol of both the natural and inner worlds we neglect at our own risk, of the past lives and journeys we carry with us as we travel, and the importance of holding on to these riches, though they may single us out for scrutiny or be otherwise heavy and \"difficult to balance\".</p> <p>\u2022 \"The Year of the Tree\" appears in Gallagher's fifth full-length collection <a href=\"http://www.arcpublications.co.uk/book.php?description_id=403\">Carnival Edge: New and Selected Poems</a>, published by Arc, who will bring out a new volume of her work in 2014.</p> <h2>The Year of the Tree</h2> <p>I carried a tree<br>through the Underground. </p> <p>It was hard. At first,<br>people scarcely noticed me</p> <p>and the oak I was lugging<br>along the platforms \u2013</p> <p>heavier than a suitcase<br>and difficult to balance.</p> <p>We threaded through corridors,<br>changing lines: up and down stairs,</p> <p>escalators, and for a moment<br>I imagined everyone on the planet</p> <p>taking turns<br>to carry a tree as daily rite.</p> <p>A few people asked<br>Why a tree?</p> <p>I said it was for my own<br>edification \u2013</p> <p>a tree always<br>has something to teach.</p> <p> \u2022 </p> <p>Sharp gusts<br>whirred through the corridors</p> <p>rustling the branches<br>as I hurried on</p> <p>past the sweepers<br>picking up rubbish, scraps of paper.</p> <p><em>Be sure to take the tree<br>with you</em>, they said.</p> <p><em>Don't worry, I'm taking it<br>to my garden,</em></p> <p><em>the start of a forest.</em><br>When people stared,</p> <p><em>Relax</em>, I said,<br><em>it's a tree, not a gun.</em></p>",
  "<p>Britain's services sector almost ground to a standstill last month, dampening hopes that the economy is on the road to recovery.</p> <p>The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the dominant services sector dropped to 50.6 last month from 52.2 in September, only just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. It is the slowest pace of growth in almost two years and way below analyst expectations of a much smaller decline to 52.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">UK economy grew by 1% in the third quarter, pulling the UK out of the longest double-dip recession since the second world war</a>. But economists warned that the figures were helped by a boost from the Olympics and a rebound from lost output as a result of the jubilee weekend.</p> <p>Andrew Harker, economist at Markit, said: \"The latest UK services PMI data provide a warning to those who saw the strong growth in GDP during the third quarter as symbolising the start of a strong and speedy economic recovery. Although there are signs of improvements, [companies surveyed] still referred to the fragility of both demand and confidence among clients. The expectation among firms is for activity to improve over the coming year, but the road to full economic recovery still looks to be a long one.\"</p> <p>Some economists said the release pointed towards the UK economy shrinking again in the fourth quarter,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/oct/31/triple-dip-recession-brace-yourself\" title=\"\"> raising the prospect of a triple-dip recession</a>. Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank said: \"With manufacturing output suffering from weak exports and domestic demand and the service sector flirting with contraction, a fall in GDP in the fourth quarter now looks most likely.\"</p> <p>The data will reignite the debate over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/04/bank-brushes-calls-to-pump-funds-into-economy\" title=\"\">whether the Bank of England will expand the quantitative easing programme this week</a>. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"While we just about still lean towards the view that the Bank of England will hold off from more QE for now and monitor how the economy is developing and what impact the Funding for Lending Scheme is having, it is looking an extremely tight call.\"</p> <p>While new orders in the services sector did grow in October \u2013 largely due to overseas demand \u2013 they did so at a slower pace than in September and companies said incoming new business did not make up for the completion of existing projects.</p> <p>For the second month running, service companies cut jobs in October. Archer said: \"A second successive, albeit modest, drop in services employment in October is a warning sign that there is no guarantee that the recent remarkable resilience of the labour market can be sustained.\"</p> <p>Companies reported rising costs but were reluctant to pass them on to customers as a result of strong competition. They did, however, say they remained optimistic that service sector activity will improve over the coming 12 months, with 42% of those surveyed forecasting higher activity over the coming year.</p>",
  "<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's largest professional services firm, is not known for scaremongering. So it is worth paying particular attention to its latest annual low carbon economy index.</p> <p>Behind the understated language, it points to a catastrophic future unless radical action is taken now to combat climate change.</p> <p>\"Business leaders have been asking for clarity in political ambition on climate change,\" says partner Leo Johnson. \"Now one thing is clear: businesses, governments and communities across the world need to plan for a warming world \u2013 not just 2C, but 4C or even 6C.\"</p> <p>The trigger for its dire warning comes from the failure of the global community to reduce carbon emissions by anywhere near the amount needed to restrict temperature rises.</p> <p>PwC's latest report shows the required improvement in global carbon intensity to meet a 2C warming target has risen to 5.1% every year from now to 2050. The improvement in 2011 was just 0.7% despite the global economic slowdown, and since the turn of the century the rate of decarbonisation has averaged 0.8%.</p> <p>PwC, the largest of the big four accounting firms, points out that even if the 5.1% improvement might be achievable in the longer term, it is unrealistic to expect that decarbonisation could be stepped up immediately \u2013 which means that the reduction required in future years is likely to be far greater.</p> <p>\"We have passed a critical threshold \u2013 not once since the second world war has the world achieved that rate of decarbonisation, but the task now confronting us is to achieve it for 39 consecutive years,\" says the report.</p> <p>It adds: \"Even doubling our current rate of decarbonisation would still lead to emissions consistent with 6 degrees [C] of warming by the end of the century. To give ourselves a more than 50% chance of avoiding 2 degrees [C] will require a six-fold improvement in our rate of decarbonisation.</p> <p>\"Governments' ambitions to limit warming to 2C now appear highly unrealistic. This new reality means that we must contemplate a much more challenging future. Whilst the negotiators continue to focus on 2C, a growing number of scientists and other expert organisations are now projecting much more pessimistic scenarios for global temperatures. The International Energy Agency, for example, now considers 4C and 6C scenarios as well as 2C in their latest analysis.\"</p> <p>It is worth remembering what a world might look like if we fail to rapidly decarbonise the global economy.</p> <p>Mark Lynas, in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Six-Degrees-Future-Hotter-Planet/dp/0007209053\" title=\"\">Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet</a>, wrote that at 4-5C warming, much human habitation in southern Europe, north Africa and the Middle East will be uninhabitable due to excessive heat and drought. If we reach 5-6C of warming, average global temperatures will be hotter than they have been for the last 50m years. Sea levels will rise so rapidly that coastal cities across the world will be abandoned by&#xa0;environmental refugees in their millions. Past 6C of warming, perhaps 90% of species will become extinct.</p> <h2>What should business be doing to adapt to this possible reality?</h2> <p>PwC says any investors in long-term assets or infrastructure, particularly in coastal or low-lying regions, need to consider more pessimistic scenarios. Sectors dependent on food, water, energy or ecosystem services need to scrutinise the resilience and viability of their supply chains. More carbon-intensive sectors need to anticipate more invasive regulation and the possibility of stranded assets.</p> <p>\"It's the boy scout motto \u2013 be prepared,\" says Jonathan Grant, PwC's director for sustainability and climate change. \"Businesses need to be prepared for unpredictability \u2013 whether that's policy, climate or consumer change. Extreme weather events have become more common, and unpredictability looks set to increase. Businesses that have failed to prepare will find it difficult to keep their operations running smoothly as the risk of disruption increases.</p> <p>Grant add: \"Tools like real options analysis, developed as part of the investment decision-making process in the oil industry for example, analyse the impact of significant uncertainty on a decision.</p> <p>\"Working with our clients, the reality is we will have to advise on a much wider range of climate scenarios. Resilience is the watch word. Businesses need to get engaged on the areas materially relevant to their business.&#xa0;For example if you're a consumer goods company you need to consider the longer-term security of supply of the resources you need, where you will source them from, and the more day-to-day issues of how you deal with the potential for disruption to their supply or delivery caused by extreme weather events.\"</p> <p>Doesn't the latest analysis just make Grant want to give up? \"Doing the analysis makes you realise the sheer scale of the issues we face,\" he says. \"It would be too easy to hold your hands up and say what's the point? We can see from the businesses, NGOs and policymakers we work with that climate change is on the agenda. But we do need more progress, faster.\"</p> <h2>On a more fundamental basis, what needs to change?</h2> <p>PwC's report says there will need to be radical transformations in the ways the global economy currently functions, a rapid uptake of renewable energy, sharp falls in fossil fuel use or massive deployment of carbon capture and storage, removal of industrial emissions and halting deforestation.</p> <p>It also warns against seeing the dash for gas as a long-term panacea. While the boom of shale gas in the United States may buy some time to help limit emissions growth, low prices may also reduce the incentive for investment in lower-carbon nuclear power and renewable energy.</p> <p>Malcolm Preston, PwC's global lead, sustainability and climate change, tells me: \"Even with progress year-on-year in emissions reduction, the reality is the level of corporate reduction is nowhere near what is required. The new normal for businesses is a period of high uncertainty, subdued growth and volatile commodity prices. If regulatory certainty doesn't come soon, businesses' ability to plan and act \u2013 particularly around energy, supply chain and risk \u2013 could be anything but 'normal'.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>With leading shares weaker after signs of a slowdown in China and ahead of the US election, <strong>Weir</strong> was an exception.</p> <p>The pumps and valves maker has jumped 55p to \u00a318.06, a 3% increase which makes it the biggest riser in a falling FTSE 100, following a positive update. The company said it expected to report full year profits of \u00a3440m to \u00a3450m, in line with market forecasts, despite global uncertainty and mixed markets.</p> <p>Third quarter revenue and profits saw a slowdown because of a lower order book, but were ahead of last year's figures thanks to the benefit of recent acquisitions. The value of orders received in the quarter fell by 15%, mainly due to declines in the US and Canadian oil and gas sector. In its mineral division, whose largest exposures are to copper and gold, it said revenues were likely to be below its guidance in July. Chris Dyett at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> A solid update, slightly ahead of our expectations, with only modest evidence for a bear attack on minerals growth rates which were always going to slow. Oil and gas has upside in the medium term as the US gas price recovers to a level when US horizontal drilling will begin adding back gas rigs after the rapid switch to liquids/shale oil seen in the first half of 2012. We expect to upgrade 2012 pretax profits by around 2% and place our target price under review, but retain our buy. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 35.26 points to 5833.29, with miners among the weaker performers after lower than expected service sector figures from China - a key consumer of commodities. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> is down 26p to \u00a311.34 - not helped by a downgrade from Citigroup - while <strong>Antofagasta</strong> has fallen 24p to \u00a312.91.</p> <p><strong>HSBC</strong> has lost 13p to 613.1p following its figures, while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> is 0.755p lower at 42.67p despite weekend reports it was considering a sale of its 60% stake in wealth manager <strong>St James Place</strong>, down 9.6p to 388.9p. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> At the current share price, Lloyds stake is worth around \u00a31.2bn, albeit we think the shares are currently undervalued by the market, so a sale at this price would not maximise value for Lloyds' shareholders. <br> Instead, we believe the rationale behind a sale is that it would be beneficial to capital as bank investments in other financial institutions will be treated less favourably under the incoming Basel 3 capital framework. Selling the stake would therefore help in closing the 'fully loaded' Basel 3 core tier 1 capital deficit that we estimate will be around circa \u00a37.7bn at the end December 2012.  Such a decision could also revive questions about whether Lloyds will look to sell the rest of its insurance operations, which largely comprise of Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical, both wholly owned subsidiaries.

People need to know why they should invest in you, value you and trust you.</p> <p>This need to articulate a narrative applies to companies, education institutions, even governments \u2013 it's commonly known as branding. We want brands we can rely on, that meet our expectations and share our values. They are the reliable round peg to our clearly, and distinctly, circular hole. So what does this have to do with the aspiring graduate, desperate for a first tentative step into their career journey?</p> <p>Tangible values \u2013 not attributes or abstract CV statements of intent \u2013 are essential. Just in the same way companies spend millions of pounds creating value statements, graduates can increase their employability and success by identifying <a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/beginners-guide-creating-your-brand\" title=\"\">their core values</a>. It's not enough to know that graduates hold a particular principle \u2013 they need to show how that principle manifests itself in their behaviour. Knowing who you are, what core values you hold and how these influence and shape your attitudes, actions and interactions enables you to make better strategic decisions when pursuing your career.</p> <p>By understanding and articulating your core values, you can 'vet' an environment, a career or a company to see if they share your values; this will increase your chances of success. The value of knowing your own brand means you can sell it more effectively and identify a market that is more likely to buy.</p> <p>So how do you know what your core values are?</p> <p>In this instance, 'core' means central to your behaviours \u2013 a principle by which you act without exception. It isn't about creating a persona that you think employers will want to see, or a blueprint for the person you'd like to be (although you could use that as a framework for personal and professional development). Remember, if you take a superficial approach to establishing what is core, the result will be superficial and employers can spot this from a mile away.</p> <p>Next, establish the difference between an attribute and a value. Confusingly, they can often be both but you should consider the implications of your chosen value. For example, if you consider yourself 'generous', think about what that means. Do you mean generous with money? Time? Support? None of these or all three? Then ask yourself: would any of those contexts appear valuable to an employer? If so, what sector would this align with? Someone who considers themselves generous in their support of others, for example, may find themselves well aligned to a caring profession.</p> <p>Once you've established your value, how can you demonstrate it in a concrete way? Articulation is the key as this unlocks the potential of your brand. You must show how this value manifests itself.</p> <p>Construct a sense of yourself through a value statement (a concise version should be a sentence or two explaining your values and their importance). Integrate this into your CV, the statement sections of application forms, interviews, networking events, or even your own blog or website. Remember, a value statement is a representation of you so don't be nervous of it; you know you better than anyone.</p> <h2>Here's a quick summary of how to create and articulate your brand:</h2> <p>\u2022 Identify your core values \u2013 any more than four tends diffuse version your brand.</p> <p>\u2022 Establish context for the value \u2013 without context the word describing the value has little validity.</p> <p>\u2022 Align the value with the type of employer that it would appeal to. This can increase your chances of success; by mirroring an employer's values, you demonstrate understanding of the market and your potential employer.</p> <p>\u2022 Articulate how the value manifests itself \u2013 if you can't talk about it, it's the wrong 'value'.</p> <p>\u2022 Integrate your values statement \u2013 any communication with potential employers should include a representation of your brand.</p> <p>\u2022 Be honest, considered, consistent; branding is king.</p> <p>People who understand their core values tend to be more successful in all aspects of life, primarily because they spend less time trying to bang square pegs in round holes.</p> <p><em>Sonia Hendy-Isaac is a senior lecturer in curriculum design for employer engagement at </em><a href=\"http://www.bcu.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Birmingham City University</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Scientists may be reluctant to link <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">Hurricane Sandy</a> with climate change, but extreme events could be the tipping point that wakes America up to the seriousness of global warming, according to Tom Steyer, probably the richest climate change champion in the US, and arguably the most effective.</p> <p>\"The connection between extreme weather events and climate change is like that between steroids and home runs: you can't tie any one home run to steroid usage, but the number and distance sure increase,\" he said.</p> <p>Whether Hurricane Sandy is enough to trigger change in public pressure and political action on climate change remains to be seen, but the hedge fund manager has previously compared America's inaction on climate change to those who buried their heads in the sand in 1938 when they knew something awful was happening in Europe.</p> <p>\"I believe that there will be some event that changes the way we think about this,\" he said at a Hamilton Group forum at Stanford University earlier this year.</p> <p>Steyer founded <a href=\"http://www.faralloncapital.com/\" title=\"\">Farallon Capital</a> in 1986, which now has $20 billion under management. Steyer's own personal fortune valued at $1.3bn puts him firmly in the bracket of America's 1% richest people. San Francisco-based Farallon Capital doesn't focus on sustainable investments and like many hedge funds, its asset management strategy is murky. Unlike many hedge fund managers though, Steyer is extremely outspoken and has ploughed a great deal of his own fortune into social and environmental causes.</p> <p>In 2010, Steyer fronted $5m to fund the campaign to defeat <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/03/prop-23-climate-california\" title=\"\">Prop 23</a>, an aggressive ballot measure put forward by California's oil refiners which would have left the state's climate change AB32 legislation in tatters.</p> <p>\"My support for Prop 23 was considered a stupid thing to do and a foolish waste of time and money. In struggles at the polls between oil companies and environmentalists, traditionally the thinking was that environmentalists were poor and stupider, and less ruthless.\"</p> <p>Many investors and business leaders would be reluctant to take a political stand over such a high-octane issue for fear it would hurt their company, but the campaign defeated the measure, also partly thanks to high-profile support from Robert Redford, Bill Gates and Leonardo Di Caprio.</p> <p>In this election, Steyer has spent $21.9m on a ballot initiative when California goes to the polls on 6 November. <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_39,_Income_Tax_Increase_for_Multistate_Businesses_%282012%29\" title=\"\">Prop 39</a> aims to close a corporate tax loophole worth $1bn a year, money that Steyer believes could be re-appropriated for alternative energy investments.</p> <p>\"I am committed to trying to get stuff done in the areas where I am passionate, one of them is energy,\" he said. \"I don't expect to stop working in energy and I want California to be well governed.\"</p> <p>Steyer added again to his pugnacious reputation by launching an all-out attack on Mitt Romney at the Democratic National Convention. Romney's energy plan, largely dependent on oil sands from Canada, is \"mindblowing\", he said.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney and I share the same income bracket,\" he told delegates in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"[But] Romney and I don't share the same vision for the future, especially when it comes to energy.</p> <p>\"Romney would do nothing to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and much to increase it. He would gut President Obama's investments in clean energy. He wants to keep giving four billion taxpayer dollars to oil companies every year \u2013 the very same oil companies pouring millions into the outside groups backing his campaign.\"</p> <p>Often described as a bulwark against the corporate carbon heavyweights such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/koch-brothers\" title=\"\">Koch brothers</a> in the US, Steyer has had to increase his political clout since the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that corporations could give unlimited donations to campaign. Koch-affiliated groups are estimated to have spent $400m on Romney's campaign.</p> <p>\"I disagree with many of the things that the Koch brothers have done,\" he said. \"There's definitely concern in the US about the ability of corporations to effect the policy especially in light of the Supreme Court ruling. That was one which enables purely economic thinking to have a disproportionate impact.\"</p> <p>\"I have gotten myself convinced that this is an area that is important and where there is a vacuum in terms of pushing for what I think are important changes. I've been compelled to fill the vacuum ... I am really intent on making a difference in areas where I think we're off the rails,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite his involvement in politics so far, including fundraising for Barack Obama, Steyer said that he remains \"agnostic\" about taking office himself or the 'climate champion' mantle as former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had done.</p> <p>Large chunks of his wealth have also been spent on academic institutes, including the establishment of the <a href=\"http://www.tcng.org/\" title=\"\">Center for the Next Generation</a>, a non-profit dealing with children's issues and the environment run by his brother James. In 2009, he and his wife, Kat Taylor, helped establish the <a href=\"http://tomkat.stanford.edu/\" title=\"\">TomKat Centre for Sustainable Energy</a> at Stanford University.</p> <p>\"I was just trying to help them get the resources to apply their incredible capability to what I think is going to be the biggest problem in the world. The opposite of living in a sustainable world is living in an unsustainable world. That seems to me to be an overwhelming problem.\"</p> <p>In 2010, Steyer and his wife signed the <a href=\"http://givingpledge.org/\" title=\"\">Giving Pledge</a> started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet to encourage American billionaires to give half their fortune to charity.</p> <p>\"Even the richest Americans have a responsibility to their society and their fellow citizens. We are all tied to each other's success or failure. We are one society that will rise and fall together. It's not an atomised group of people in a Darwinian struggle. It's a collective society trying to move forward.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The deals could be worth more than \u00a36bn to Britain.</p> <p>The prime minister landed in Dubai on a mission to patch up relations with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where major British businesses such as BP and BAE have important interests.</p> <p>Cameron, who is irritated by claims that he uses his overseas trips to sell defence equipment to countries with questionable human rights records, has made arrangements to minimise the media coverage of the trip.</p> <p>But, speaking in Dubai on Monday, he insisted he would not shy away from raising concerns. \"On human rights, there are no no-go areas in this relationship. We discuss all of these things but we also show respect and friendship to a very old ally and partner,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"We have one of the strictest regimes anywhere in the world for sales of defence equipment but we do believe that countries have a right to self-defence and we do believe that Britain has important defence industries that employ over 300,000 people so that sort of business is completely legitimate and right.\"</p> <p>While in the UAE, Cameron will join forces with some of the country's senior political and military figures to inspect Typhoons at al-Minhad airbase, which is used as an air bridge for British forces flying between the UK and Afghanistan. Britain hopes to persuade Gulf leaders to buy 100 Typhoons on top of the 72 bought by Saudi Arabia, where he will arrive on Tuesday.</p> <p>The looming confrontation between Iran and its regional adversaries will also feature heavily in Cameron's talks with leaders in the Sunni-dominated Gulf countries. Britain could base Typhoons, built by a European consortium that includes BAE Systems, in the UAE if relations with Tehran deteriorate.</p> <p>Reflecting these wider concerns in Dubai, Cameron said: \"It is not just about trade and investment. We are also partners in defence and security; we worked together in Libya and Afghanistan and we will be talking about all the key regional and global issues.\"</p> <p>While in the Gulf, the prime minister will be accompanied by only a small pool of two newswire reporters, a broadcast camera person, a broadcast producer and a photographer. Other journalists, making their own travel arrangements, are invited to attend a limited number of events, though it is impossible for those outside the pool to report on any aspect of Cameron's short visit to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>No 10 is restricting media coverage partly out of sensitivity to Saudi Arabia, which has been upset by Britain's response to the Arab spring. Prince Mohammed Bin Nawaf Al Saud, the ambassador to London, recently broke with diplomatic protocol to say that Saudi Arabia was \"insulted\" by the decision of the Commons foreign affairs committee to investigate Britain's relations with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. British ministers have made clear that they have no control over a parliamentary committee.</p> <p>But Daniel Kawczynski, the Tory chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Saudi Arabia, rallied to the kingdom's defence. He said: \"There is a huge amount of prejudice in the House of Commons, as there is in the country as a whole, because you only ever hear negative press reports. People have a very distorted view of the kingdom. I would be very put out if the Saudis came to this country and challenged and berated me about all our social ills \u2013 whether neglect of the elderly or drug abuse or inner city crime.\"</p> <p>Downing Street denied that the prime minister was seeking to limit press coverage of the trip. A No 10 spokeswoman said: \"This is not a secretive trip in any shape or form. We have the media travelling on the plane with the prime minister \u2013 they will have access to the events he is doing in country.</p> <p>\"The prime minister will take part in a debate with Emirati students on Monday which will be broadcast in full and is open to the press. There is a complicated programme and there are logistical challenges as a result. But this is striking a balance between getting out there and helping British companies and giving the media access.\"</p> <p>But No 10 has been trying for two years to restrict media access to the prime minister's overseas visits. This would make him the only leader of a G7 country who is not accompanied abroad by a full press corps.</p> <p>Andy Coulson, the former Downing Street communications director, tried in Cameron's first months in office to recreate the arrangements in opposition when the Tory leader would take just one broadcaster with him on trips. Coulson failed but his successor Craig Oliver, a former BBC editor, is trying to reimpose the restrictions.</p> <p>No 10 aides have complained that the prime minister is often asked questions unrelated to his official programme during overseas trips. There was irritation in No 10 during the prime minister's recent visit to New York and Brazil when journalists persisted in asking questions about the embattled chief whip Andrew Mitchell, who subsequently resigned.</p> <p>Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, the trade minister, is taking a parallel trade delegation whose members will meet David Cameron in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The prime minister will attend a trade fair in Abu Dhabi which will be attended by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce.</p> <p>Cameron wants to persuade the UAE to buy the Typhoons to replace their ageing fleet of French Mirage jets. The Emiratis have expressed interest in ordering 60 of the jets. Oman has expressed interest in 12, while Saudi Arabia is considering placing a second order on top of the 72 it has already bought.</p>",
  "<p>My name is Shairaz and I am a member of <a href=\"http://www.unitedresponse.org.uk/\" title=\"\">United Response</a>'s campaigns panel. We are a group of people with learning disabilities and some family members who want to speak out on issues that are important to us.</p> <p>United Response asked us to tell them what we thought about the government's plans for social care. The government has put these plans in its white paper and draft care and support bill.</p> <p>Our opinions have been turned into a report by United Response, published today, called <a href=\"http://www.unitedresponse.org.uk/press/campaigns/our-future-campaigns-panel-report/\">Our future</a>. In the report we tell people about what it is like to have a disability and what we think the government should be doing to make things better for us.</p> <p>Many of us (two-thirds) had not heard about the changes that the government was going to make to social care, before we took part in the report. Those of us who did know about the changes were worried about our benefits as we knew that funding was being cut.</p> <p>For me, I think that if I was prime minister, I'd make sure that everyone had better support and funding.</p> <p>I'd make sure that disabled people were always cared for and that they were not neglected and I'd want people to have the facilities and things that suit them; for example someone might need a wheelchair or things changed in their home to make it easier to live there.</p> <p>It's really important that people's living environment is right, because it helps people to live a good life.</p> <p>The government is looking at who will receive care in the future and how it will be funded. We all felt that disabled people should receive free care.</p> <p>It's all about fairness. Some people will need support forever and the government just has to accept us as we are.</p> <p>We didn't choose to be disabled, so it's not fair for the government to expect us to pay. A lot of the time people with disabilities are neglected, and they shouldn't be.</p> <p>We need to help all people with disabilities.</p> <p>We also felt that people should have support for their needs early on. For example, if someone has depression, it's really important to spot it early. If people get more support early on, then they're less likely to end up in a crisis.</p> <p>Some of us had bad experiences when we moved from one sort of service to another and so we think its good that the government is going to help people more with change and to set a minimum standard of care. But we also think that there should be more support for people who only have a few needs.</p> <p>Just because someone has a disability that's under the surface, it doesn't mean they don't need help.</p> <p>Disabilities are not all the same and they're not just about physical difficulties. Things can go wrong inside your head too. People can be like apples or eggs \u2013 they look fine on the surface, but you don't know what's going on underneath.</p> <p>Disabled people shouldn't all be classed as the same. People need to see the human underneath and see that everyone had been born with differences.</p> <p>The campaigns panel liked many of the government's plans, but we are concerned about funding and benefits and how things will actually work.</p> <p>For things to be better in the future the government must listen more to disabled people.</p> <p>All politicians should meet disabled people; just sit down and have a chat. Once they understand us, they can support us better.</p> <p><em>Shairaz is a member of </em><a href=\"http://www.unitedresponse.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>United Response</em></a><em>'s campaigns panel.</em></p> <p><strong>Why not join our community?

  "<p>So far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/clare-carlisle\" title=\"\">in this series</a> I've considered evil as if it were an individual matter \u2013 a question of personal virtue, or the lack of it. In emphasising the relationship between sin and freedom, Christian philosophers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/does-freedom-make-us-evil\" title=\"\">Augustine and Kierkegaard</a> seem to assume that if we look hard enough at the human condition we will gain insight into evil. This attitude implies that evil has nothing to do with history or culture \u2013 as if <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man\" title=\"\">the fall</a> is the only historical event that matters, at least as far as evil is concerned.</p> <p>In the 20th century, a series of scientific experiments on the psychology of evil told a very different story. Among the most infamous of these are the experiments at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment\" title=\"\">Yale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/41\" title=\"\">Stanford</a> universities conducted in the 1970s by Stanley Milgram and Philip Zimbardo. Both Milgram and Zimbardo found that, under certain conditions, well-educated and apparently ordinary university students were capable of immense cruelty. Under the instructions of an authority-figure, Milgram's students were prepared to administer painful electric shocks as a penalty for poor memory: two-thirds of them increased the voltage to lethal levels as their \"subjects\" cried in agony. These results demonstrated how dangerous and immoral obedience can be. In his experiment, Zimbardo created a prison environment in the psychology department at Stanford, assigning roles of guard and prisoner to his group of undergraduates. Within a few days guards were treating prisoners with such cruelty and contempt that the experiment had to be terminated early.</p> <p>Reflecting on his Stanford prison experiment <a href=\"http://www.prisonexp.org/pdf/evil.pdf\" title=\"\">in 2004</a>, Zimbardo wrote eloquently about the conditions that make good people do evil things. The prison, he suggested, is an institution set apart from normal society in which brutality can be legitimised. Wearing uniforms and sunglasses, identifying prisoners by numbers and guards by official titles and removing clocks and blocking natural light all helped to dehumanise and deindividualise the participants. In this \"totally authoritarian situation\", says Zimbardo, most of the guards became sadistic, while many of the prisoners \"showed signs of emotional breakdown\". Perhaps most interestingly, Zimbardo found that he himself, in the role of prison superintendent, rapidly underwent a transformation: \"I began to talk, walk and act like a rigid institutional authority figure more concerned about the security of \"my prison\" than the needs of the young men entrusted to my care as a psychological researcher.\"</p> <p>Although Zimbardo insists that \"there were no lasting negative consequences of this powerful experience\", his conclusions raise ethical questions about scientific experimentation itself. Does the laboratory, like the prison, provide a special kind of environment in which pain can be inflicted with approval? Do the white coats and the impersonal manner of recording results dehumanise both scientists and their subjects?</p> <p>These questions point to a larger philosophical issue. Does contemporary society give rise to conditions more conducive to evil than in the past? Do science and technology, in particular, dehumanise us? Modern technology has certainly created forms of communication that allow people to remain more safely anonymous. Take the internet, for example; it's right here. In recent years the malevolent online behaviour of internet trolls and vitriolic commentators, hiding behind their pseudonyms, has become a much-discussed cultural phenomenon. Maybe it's quite natural that we have a delicious taste of freedom and power when given the opportunity to go undercover \u2013 like Stevenson's Jekyll-turned-Hyde as he runs gleefully through the night to the wrong side of town, stamping on children as he goes. But in such circumstances are we really in control? Milgram's electrocutors thought they were in control, and so did Philip Zimbardo. It turned out, of course, that they too were part of the experiment.</p> <p>As usual, Plato has something to contribute to this debate. In <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html\" title=\"\">the Republic</a> Socrates' pupil Glaucon recounts the story of a shepherd, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges\" title=\"\">Gyges</a>, who fell into the earth during an earthquake and found a ring that made him invisible. \"Having made this discovery,\" says Glaucon, \"he managed to get himself included in the party that was to report to the king, and when he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help attacked and murdered the king and seized the throne.\"</p> <p>Plato uses this story to depict the prevailing immorality within his own Athenian society \u2013 a society which had, after all, sentenced to death its wisest and most virtuous citizen. Plato suggests that his contemporaries regard hypocrisy and deceit as the surest route to happiness, since they seek all the benefits of a reputation for virtue, or \"justice\", while promoting their own interest by vice, or \"injustice\", wherever possible. In the Republic he argues, through the voice of Socrates, that this view is not only morally wrong but misguided, since true happiness and freedom can only come from living virtuously.</p> <p>The story of Gyges's ring seems to suggest that evil is a simply a fact of human nature. When anonymity releases us from responsibility for our actions, we will gladly abandon morality and harm anyone who obstructs our pursuit of what we think will make us happy. In this way, we might point to Gyges in arguing that there is nothing particularly modern about evil. On the other hand, though, Plato had to resort to a myth, and a magic ring, to illustrate the conditions under which our tendency to evil manifests itself. In our own time, technology has worked its magic, and the fantasy of invisibility has become an everyday reality.</p>",
  "<p>Every morning, mile upon mile of women stream along Dhaka's roadsides, heading towards the city's garment factories. This urban workforce is now the largest contributing group to Bangladesh's vital export economy.</p> <p>In a country with more than 4,000 factories \u2013 which now relies on the ready-to-wear garment industry for 80% of its export income \u2013 women have become a powerful economic force. About 1.5 million women are employed as garment workers, and their labour has allowed the Bangladeshi garment industry to compete seriously in the global market.</p> <p>Employment in the export-oriented garment industry, and in other industries such as electronics manufacturing, has directly opened up the labour market for poorer sections of the population, most notably young rural women with limited local employment options.</p> <p>For many of these women, a move from the country to the city has brought an economic independence that would have been almost inconceivable to earlier generations. Their migration has been one of the most visible signs of the rapid urbanisation in Bangladesh, where the urban population is growing by roughly 6% year-on-year and <a href=\"http://www.unbconnect.com/component/news/task-show/id-69712\" title=\"\">28% of people now live in cities</a>. The total urban population is expected to reach 50 million by 2015.</p> <p>Many women are contributing to the family and national income for the first time. Money is returning to the countryside as women working in the cities send remittances to their families. At the same time, urbanisation is slowly changing women's status as their economic role becomes more established.</p> <p>\"The mass migration of largely very poor women from the countryside to the cities to work in industries like the garment sector is seeing a cultural shift start to take place,\" says Fayaz Ahmad, a senior manager at <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org/bangladesh\" title=\"\">ActionAid Bangladesh</a>.</p> <p>\"It [Migration] is helping raise the status of women in their families and home communities because they are becoming visible earners. Urbanisation has brought different opportunities to women and, as a result, the idea of girls getting an education and having jobs instead of getting married early is growing. The idea that women can be police officers, doctors, drivers is slowly taking hold.\"</p> <p>Yet even as urbanisation has galvanised women's march towards greater economic freedom, the equality and safety of Bangladesh's new workers are still major issues.</p> <p>In the garment industry, women are an easy target for exploitation and discrimination. With an average age of 19, usually unmarried and with little education or training, many women enter urban employment with a comparative disadvantage in terms of pay, working conditions, the possibility of promotion and even getting paid for overtime. They earn 60% of the salary of male colleagues.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://cpd.org.bd/pub_attach/unfpa26.pdf\" title=\"\">a 2003 report</a> (pdf) by the <a href=\"http://cpd.org.bd/\" title=\"\">Centre for Policy Dialogue</a> and UN Population Fund, there is a clear link between the increased sexual harassment of Bangladeshi women and their improved economic status, increased mobility and newfound visibility away from the home.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/attachments/Stitched%20Up.pdf\" title=\"\">2011 War on Want report</a> (pdf) on the Bangladesh garment industry found that 297 out of a total of 998 women workers interviewed reported unwanted sexual advances, while 290 said they had been touched inappropriately. A further 328 reported \"threats of being forced to undress\", while almost half said they had been beaten and hit in the face by their supervisors.</p> <p>Sexual harassment of women on the street and in urban schools is on the increase, according to <a href=\"http://www.brac.net/\" title=\"\">Bangladeshi NGO Brac</a>, which in 2010 launched Mejnin, a project to tackle the increasing harassment of women and girls. Mejnin now works with 20,000 adolescent girls of school age in Dhaka.</p> <p>At a school on the outskirts of Dhaka, a Mejnin counsellor is running a session for 14- and 15-year-old girls. She says instances of sexual harassment are increasing rapidly in urban areas, where there are few legal or other support structures for adolescent girls. Teachers in this secondary school have seen girls dropping out of class because they are harassed on their way to school. Some parents are keen to marry off their daughters early as a way to protect them.</p> <p>\"Many of these girls come from very conservative and rural families and this is a huge problem for them,\" says Safiqul Islam, director of the Brac education programme. \"We've found that the harassment has increased as communities have become more fragmented.\"</p> <p>He says problems arise as people move from towns and villages where everyone knows each other into urban centres where traditional community support structures simply don't exist.</p> <p>\"At the same time, it still isn't normal to see large numbers of girls out on the streets without male relatives,\" he says. \"To some extent, our society is still catching up to the changes that urbanisation has brought.\"</p> <p>Back at the school, 14-year-old Tahmina Aktar offers her own solution to the problem of harassment. \"We have to learn how to be strong and that we have equal rights to be on the street as men,\" she says. \"One boy was giving me big problems on the way to school, so one day I turned round and told him I would punch him in the nose if he talked to me that way again. He stopped after that.\"</p>",

  "<h2>Israel and the Palestinians</h2> <p>Two weeks ago, Randi Mellman Oze, 54, printed off her absentee ballot paper, marked a cross next to Mitt Romney's name, sealed the envelope and took it to the post office to send it back to the US.</p> <p>A lifelong Democrat voter until she came to live in Israel five years ago, changing her political stance had been \"a very big deal\" to her.</p> <p>\"I was always a Democrat, and my family are all Democrats. But I don't feel Obama has Israel's best interests at heart,\" she said. \"Instead of concentrating on sanctions against Iran in the first two years of his presidency, he made nice to them and he put pressure on Israel. If he hadn't followed this policy, we would not now be on the brink of war with Iran.\"</p> <p>She is among up to 250,000 American-Israelis entitled to vote in Tuesday's US presidential election, the majority of whom are believed to be backing the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Polls of all Israelis, not just immigrants from the US, have shown a majority in favour of ousting Obama and installing Romney in the White House.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is widely perceived to be rooting for a Romney victory, against all protocol. Many commentators have accused him of interfering in internal US politics in his eagerness to see an ideological soulmate in the White House.</p> <p>Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been severely strained by the Israeli leader's insistence on a tougher US stance on the Iranian nuclear programme, which the US has resisted. Romney is seen as more hawkish on this issue. But he is also even less inclined to push Israel towards allowing the Palestinians an independent state \u2013 another factor endearing him to Netanyahu.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Shaul Mofaz, publicly accused the prime minister of trying to influence the outcome of the election. \"Israeli meddling in internal US affairs and turning the US administration from an ally to an enemy has caused us severe damage,\" he told the Israeli parliament.</p> <p>Some commentators have warned that a re-elected Obama could seek a payback for what is regarded as Netanyahu's transparent support for his opponent. Netanyahu rejected accusations of interference, saying they were \"completely groundless\".</p> <p>Israel has figured strongly in the candidates' own campaigns. According to Eytan Gilboa, a specialist in US-Israel elections at Bar-Ilan University, \"never in the history of US presidential elections has Israel occupied such a prominent place\".</p> <p>This, he said, had been largely driven by Republicans, who \"thought if they can move a few percent [of Jewish voters] into their camp it could have a positive result in a very close election\".</p> <p>He added: \"Some in Israel are happy that the candidates are competing over who is the biggest supporter of Israel. But this is a negative development. It would be much better for Israel to enjoy bi-partisan high level support.\"</p> <p>Palestinians are watching the election campaign with cynicism. Many feel badly let down by Obama's failure to force progress towards a Palestinian state, but they also know that Romney is unlikely to be a friend to their cause.</p> <p>\"Obama is not a saviour, and Romney will not be a devil,\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee. \"Neither one is a free agent; there is a US policy of bias and support for Israel.\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee.</p> <p>Those who expected a re-elected Obama to \"suddenly develop a backbone and stand up to pressure\" were likely to be disappointed, she said. <br><strong>Harriet Sherwood, Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>Obama's election provoked euphoria in his ancestral village in Kenya, as well as among African governments who scented a chance to move up the US's list of priorities.</p> <p>Four years later, there is largely a sense of deflation and, judging by column inches in the press, somewhat less enthusiasm for this year's presidential race. Sub-Saharan Africa has barely been mentioned in the campaign and the feeling of apathy is mostly mutual.</p> <p>Yet residual loyalty to Obama remains deep and, if Africa's billion citizens got to vote, it seems likely he would win by a landslide.</p> <p>\"Four years ago there was so much hope in this country,\" said Boniface Mwangi, a photographer and political activist whose office in Nairobi, Kenya, is decorated with Obama's image in life-size cardboard replica. \"Now we're no longer that hopeful and asking where did we go wrong. I thought Barack Obama would do well for Africa but I'm ashamed to say that George Bush did more. Obama has done nothing for us. People are very mad, especially in Kogelo, his family village: they're still expecting some kind of handout from [him]. I hope his second term plans will include Africa; otherwise he's a hoax.\"</p> <p>Kenya is preoccupied with its own elections. Yet despite everything, Mwangi, who took out a bank loan to be in America for Obama's historic 2008 win, hopes that he will repeat the feat. \"He's more progressive than Romney in every way. Romney will be bad for America and the world. He's shallow and slimy, like a car salesman selling junk.\"</p> <p>Obama, who once hailed the \"blood of Africa within me\", has spent only 20 hours on sub-Saharan African soil since becoming president (it was a stopover in Ghana in between summits elsewhere).</p> <p>By contrast, the president of China, Hu Jintao, has made seven trips to Africa, five as head of state, and visited at least 17 countries, according to the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>But the Democrat remains way ahead of Romney in terms of brand recognition. Shehu Sani, an author and human rights activist in Nigeria, said: \"Not many people in Africa know who Romney is and what he stands for and what he is capable of doing.</p> <p>\"Almost everyone knows who Obama is for the very fact that he is partly an African and there is still hope he will do something for Africa as far as peace, stability and economic development is concerned. There is a saying, 'better the devil you know'. If we haven't seen the actions, we have seen the intentions, so we give him the benefit of the doubt. We hope the second term will be better.\"</p> <p>Commentators note that Obama's principal African focus has been security, for example in combating Islamist militancy in Somalia, with pragmatism based on American self interest.</p> <p>Ousseynou Bissichi, a guide at the African Renaissance Monument, in Dakar, Senegal, who points out to tourists that his workplace is taller than the Statue of Liberty, said: \"A lot of people in Africa thought Obama would be the president of Africa. Go to any centre in Africa four years ago and people were celebrating.</p> <p>\"Later we realised he's an American president, not an African president. Even George Bush did more for Africa and he's a white man. Bill Clinton did, too.\"</p> <p>Yet Bissichi also remains loyal to Obama. \"In Africa, we like the Democrats more than the Republicans. We think they have more humanity than the Republicans. Mitt Romney is a very rich guy. Even in America, people think he knows nothing about poverty and misery.\"</p> <p>Some admit that Africa's hopes for the president were impossibly high. Asked if he had lived up to expectations, Michael Amankwa, an entrepreneur in Accra, Ghana, said: \"I think he has to a large extent, even though some might have been a bit disappointed. He came in with too much star power, which raised the bar very high for him. Some also understand that he inherited a bad situation with the economy and so on.\"</p> <p>South Africa, the continent's \"superpower\", has hosted the US's first lady, Michelle Obama, but still awaits the photo opportunity of America's first black president meeting Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>Karabo Kgoleng, a radio presenter in Johannesburg, said: \"I think it is disingenuous for Africans to expect anything from any American president. He is not African. He is American and his most important priority is the American people not the Africans.</p> <p>\"I think Africans rejoicing at his making it to office came from the need for a psychological boost as well as an indication of Africans buying into the American dream \u2013 that one's roots can be African and one can succeed in life, with those roots. Africans need to hold their own leaders to account before pinning their hopes on anyone else. Obama owes Africa nothing.\" <br><strong>David Smith, Africa correspondent</strong></p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p>The Obama-mania that swept Europe four years ago has faded fast amid transatlantic rows over the euro crisis, the administration's failure to deliver on its promise to close down Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the waning attention paid to Europe by the US.</p> <p>But despite the fact that the centre-right remains in the ascendancy across most of Europe, disaffection with Barack Obama is not translating into support for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Quite the opposite. There is strikingly little support for the Republican contender whose gaffe-prone visit to Europe in July won him few friends and who regularly turns European welfarism and \"entitlement societies\" into points of mockery in his campaign speeches.</p> <p>According to the New York Times, European diplomats in Washington have been discreetly lodging complaints with the Romney camp about the candidate's criticism.</p> <p>An opinion poll last month showed widespread dislike of Romney, and residual, if no longer starry-eyed, support for Obama among Europeans.</p> <p>Just 5% of those polled in France, Germany, and Britain had a good opinion of Romney. Only 4% of Germans polled said a President Romney would make them better-disposed towards the US, while 12 times that figure took the opposite view. Two in five French people said a Romney victory would turn them more against the US, while only 5% said they would be happier with him in the White House.</p> <p>By contrast 87% of Germans said they would vote for Obama, while in France 67% described him as their president of choice.</p> <p>The ongoing German love affair with Obama started in July 2008 when the would-be president was famously denied the chance to speak at Berlin's Brandenburg gate by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and opted instead for the roundabout at the Victory column where thousands gathered to hear him speak, cementing his celebrity status in Berlin at least.</p> <p>Exploring why Obama's popularity had endured despite certain disappointments, Friedrich Mielke, said the president was viewed by Germans as a \"dove of peace\".</p> <p>The publicist and American expert said: \"We love him because we can project our own hopes and desires on to him,\" he said. Most people here see him as a leader of the free world, who combines intelligence and strength of character with charm and rhetorical lustre.\"</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was viewed as a \"locust capitalist\", he said, who \"spreads social frigidity and egoism\".</p> <p>It appears that Europeans see Romney as a return to the days of George W Bush who was hugely unpopular on this side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Romney has hardly sought to endear himself with Europeans, holding the EU up as a failed model and implicitly accusing Obama of being a closet \"European\" \u2013 big government, social welfare, and \"entitlement\" culture. <br><strong>Ian Traynor, Europe editor, and Kate Connolly in Berlin</strong></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>China's elite would normally be watching the election more closely. But with its own once-a-decade leadership transition beginning days after the US votes, it has other matters on its mind.</p> <p>For many in China, the election is of relatively limited interest. Some will follow results avidly, but others are only concerned about the impact on China.</p> <p>\"I like Obama's style. He is a very charming guy \u2026 Romney seems quite aggressive,\" said Beijing-based marketing researcher Ming Ming, adding: \"I'm more concerned about who will have better policy towards China.\"</p> <p>Zheng Jihua, an entrepreneur, said: \"I don't think it makes much difference whether it's Obama or Romney.\"</p> <p>Despite the tough-talking on tackling China during debates, he said: \"The economic connections [between the countries] matters more than political things. If they become president they will be more realistic.\"</p> <p>China is used to playing its part in US presidential races. \"It's an old story, China becoming a political card to play in US elections. This year, Romney and Obama seem to be playing it more heavily,\" an editorial in the populist state-run Global Times said last month.</p> <p>But Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, said most people were more concerned by issues such as tensions with Japan over disputed islands.</p> <p>\"For those who are paying attention, I guess they may feel both sides are not so nice towards China,\" he said. \"I think maybe in government and the foreign policy elites they feel the lesser evil is still Barack Obama because they're familiar with him.</p> <p>\"If you look at the campaign statements, Romney has been much more combative in terms of US economic rivalry.\"</p> <p>Shen Dingli, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, disagreed. He argued that while China did not officially have a preference - due to the country's doctrine of non-interference in other nations' domestic affairs - in reality it leant to Republicans.</p> <p>\"The Republicans are pro-development, pro-foreign trade, pro-efficiency, pro-capitalism,\" he said, and were unlikely to push hard for cuts to China's carbon emissions, while Democrats \"are pro-American poor people and want to protect jobs\".</p> <p>Shen added: \"People claim if Romney is in power, the next day he will tackle China for manipulating the currency. It's a joke. Romney will be China's best friend because he will not honour his threats.\"</p> <p>Experts say tough talk from US candidates is rarely matched by their action once in office. Even so, Shi warned that in general \"Sino-American rivalries have become more profound and sometimes more tense.\"<br><strong> Tania Branigan, Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>\"Which one is better for Iran, Obama or Romney?\" asked Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, a political activist and leader behind the US embassy hostage-taking after the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>\"The answer is not very difficult,\" he said, during the television debate. He was insinuating that Iran should be worried about the prospect of Romney winning.</p> <p>Asgharzadeh, who is now sympathetic to reformists, suggested Iran should play a role in helping Obama stay in office. \"We influenced American elections back at the time of Reagan [with negotiations over hostage crisis] and we can do it now. Iran can influence with a surprise.\"</p> <p>Iranians are closely following the election. There is concern that a Romney victory will significantly increase the possibility of an Israeli military strike against the regime's nuclear facilities, and weaken the prospect of a possible breakthrough in negotiations between Tehran and the west. The Obama administration, by contrast, is keen to give sanctions more time to bite.</p> <p>\"The US election results can potentially change the fate of my country,\" said an Iranian journalist based in Tehran. \"Many activists and those with access to internet or [illegal] satellite dishes are watching it closely.\"</p> <p>Iranian state agencies are reporting the developments of Obama-Romney campaigns but with little commentary. Iranian officials, however, say that the outcome is immaterial to Iran.</p> <p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, while speaking among to reporters in New York during a visit to the UN general assembly last month, refused to show support to either candidate.</p> <p>Ali Larijani, Iran's speaker in parliament, said a Romney win would not be a threat. In his view, the governor's support for Israel's possible attack amounted to little more than campaign rhetoric. <br><strong>Saeed Kamali Dehghan</strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>With anti-Americanism creeping back to the forefront of political rhetoric in Moscow, many in Russia slyly smiled when Romney this year called Russia \"our No 1 geopolitical foe\".</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, said the remark showed Romney was \"open and sincere\". He added: \"That Romney considers us enemy No 1 and apparently has bad feelings about Russia is a minus, but, considering that he expresses himself bluntly, openly and clearly, [this] means he is an open and sincere man, which is a plus</p> <p>\"We will be oriented toward pluses, not minuses. And I am actually very grateful to him for formulating his position in a straightforward manner.\"</p> <p>The statement harked back to Soviet times, when Russia's leaders preferred dealing with Republicans \u2013 who were seen as straight-talking, if tough \u2013 to Democrats, seen here as masking their anti-Russian stance behind talk of human and civil rights, viewed with suspicion inside Russia.</p> <p>Maria Lipman, an expert at the Moscow Carnegie Centre, said: \"Particularly after the expulsion of the USAid, Washington's international aid agency, the Kremlin is now too committed to a path of using its old cold war foe as a bogeyman to consolidate wavering domestic support. Anti-American rhetoric in Russia has gone too far to shift easily now.\"</p> <p>Nor has there been much effort from the US presidential candidates to address policy towards Russia except for cheap point scoring, she added, and the next occupant of the White House was unlikely to seek to introduce any significant changes.</p> <p>Romney even appears in private to be backpedalling on his \"number one geopolitical foe\" comment. He used his son, Matt Romney, to pass a placatory message to Putin last month during a business trip to Moscow, according to a recent report in the New York Times.</p> <p>Many Russians have little interest in the race going on in the US, remaining sceptical that it can influence their lives.</p> <p>In a suburban train heading into Moscow on Friday evening, there was widespread indifference. \"Honestly, I don't care,\" said Sergei Chernenko, a 23-year old barman, adding that the election's outcome was irrelevant.</p> <p>Irina Kaidina, an accountant, concurred. Her son lived in New York, she said, but she couldn't remember the name of Barack Obama's challenger.</p> <p>Assistant engineer Nikolai Kuprianov, 32, however, said he had been following the presidential campaign. \"Obama would, of course, be a better choice in terms of attitudes towards Russia but Americans have never loved Russia and they only want us for our natural resources,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama had made the \"reset\" in relations with Russia an early foreign policy priority, but with recent disagreements over Syria, plus Moscow's accusation that the US stands behind opposition protests against Putin, what was once hailed as a success is now seen as dead.</p> <p>Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said as much in an interview published this week: \"If we talk about the 'reset', it is clear that, using computer terminology, it cannot last forever. Otherwise it would not be a 'reset' but a program failure\".</p> <p>Among Russia's chief concerns are energy policy \u2013 Putin's ability to govern rests on a high oil price, analysts say \u2013 and US plans for missile defence in Europe, which it opposes but both candidates support. <br><strong>Miriam Elder and Howard Amos</strong></p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>The US elections have serious implications for Pakistan and policy making, but that is not reflected in popular debate or discussion.</p> <p>While government officials complain that there is little chance of key issues, such as efforts to draw the Taliban into a political process, being dealt with before the the election, public interest in the contest is virtually nil.</p> <p>Perhaps that is not surprising with anti-Americanism appearing to be at an all-time high in Pakistan.</p> <p>There has been little media interest in the campaign, with some of the most recent reports about the US president concerning the burning of effigies of him to protest against a blasphemous anti-Islam film posted on YouTube.</p> <p>There is certainly none of the enthusiasm Obama mustered in the Muslim world in 2008, said Munawar Hasan, president of the conservative Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami.</p> <p>\"After the last four years people now know that Americans are Americans and George Bush and Barack Obama are two sides of the same coin,\" he said, damning US policy on the region, including the sharp increase in drone strikes and the troop surge in Afghanistan. No one is interested in this election because, whoever wins, US foreign policy is not going to change.\"</p> <p>Some suspect the country's military establishment may harbour a stronger desire to see the back of Obama as his administration, in sharp contrast to that of George Bush (and Republican governments in general), was not afraid of playing rough with Pakistan, even at the expense of humiliating its armed forces.</p> <p>The May 2011 raid to kill Osama bin Laden within Pakistani territory still haunts the army and the country has struggled to cope with the massive increase in US drone attacks on its tribal areas.</p> <p>Even worse was the accidental US airstrike on the Afghan border last year which killed 24 troops and prompted months of acrimony between Islamabad and Washington. <br><strong>Jon Boone, Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>The US election has been watched with no little self-interest in Latin America, where many politicians and commentators partly define themselves by their admiration or rejection of US values.</p> <p>While most national leaders have remained diplomatically quiet about their preferences, the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who recently won re-election, has bucked the trend by stating his preference for Obama.</p> <p>\"I hope this doesn't harm Obama, but if I was from the US, I'd vote for Obama,\" Chavez said on state TV and indicated that he felt the admiration was mutual. \"Obama is a good guy \u2026 I think that if Obama was from Barlovento or some Caracas neighborhood, he'd vote for Chavez.\"</p> <p>The US president is likely to pick up more Hispanic votes from the endorsement of the Mexican band Man\u00e1, who played a set at an Obama rally in Las Vegas this month. \"We have the conviction that Obama is the best candidate for all Latinos,\" said Man\u00e1 frontman Fher Olvera. \"Vote for the president who has cared most for Latinos and minorities.\"</p> <p>In Brazil, which is in the midst of a municipal election campaign, the president, Dilma Rousseff, does not appear to see any political advantage in allying herself to either US candidate, partly because of differences in foreign policy.</p> <p>Regarding Obama's speech on the handling of the crisis in Syria at the UN late last month, Rousseff said: \"He has his position, I have mine.\"</p> <p>Brazilian media commentators have been underwhelmed by the performance of the two US candidates.</p> <p>\"The speech in which US president Barack Obama, formally accepted the nomination of the Democratic Party to run for a new mandate caused an anticlimax, even for his most excited voters,\" noted Folha de S. Paulo in one of the few Brazilian editorials on the US election. <br><strong>Jonathan Watts, Rio de Janeiro</strong></p> <h2>Arab world</h2> <p>Arabs watching the US presidential race are mainly interested in how the next administration will deal with the Arab spring \u2013 as well as the perennial question of the unresolved Palestinian issue.</p> <p>Barack Obama has, in significant ways, failed to live up to the expectations he created in his long-awaited Cairo speech in June 2009. Many in the region say they see little difference between him and Romney, but Obama is probably still the preferred candidate.</p> <p>Obama was criticised initially for reacting slowly to the revolution in Egypt but has been measured since the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi became president and hopes to encourage a shift toward pragmatism and moderation.</p> <p>Following the murder of the US ambassador to Libya, Washington also signalled continued support for the new government in Tripoli.</p> <p>Syrian and Arab opponents of Bashar al-Assad hope that in a second term Obama would be more openly supportive than he has been so far.</p> <p>Romney's policies reflect a more conservative world view that appeals to Saudis and their Gulf allies, who believe Obama has been too soft on Iran. Saudis hope that a Romney administration, with a neoconservative element, might be more aggressive on Syria. The Republican has expressed \"disappointment\" at the rise of Islamists. </p> <p>He is also likely to give greater weight to Israel's regional views, for example as they pertain to policy towards Egypt. Both candidates would likely remain muted in response to the ongoing protests and crackdown in Bahrain, a key US ally in the Gulf. </p> <p>The novelty for the next president will be that public opinion is now a more significant factor in the Arab world than it was when Obama entered the White House. It did not inspire confidence when Romney referred to the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin as taking place at a \"sheikh\" temple. <br><strong>Ian Black, Middle East editor</strong></p> <h2>Afghanistan</h2> <p>For a place where US troops are still dying in their hundreds and for which billions of dollars are spent each year, Afghanistan has garnered very little attention over the election.</p> <p>With a strange kind of symmetry Afghanistan might be dependent on US cash to keep its government afloat, and the US military to keep the Taliban at bay, but there is very little focus on the presidential race on the streets or in the TV studios of Kabul.</p> <p>This lack of interest is in large part because most people in Kabul feel the broad outlines of US policy have already been set. The timeline for the departure of US and other foreign forces will not alter, regardless of who wins.</p> <p>\"The Afghan people are not paying a lot of attention to the US election, because as we heard during the campaign, both candidates are agreed about taking their troops home from Afghanistan,\" said Najibullah Hosseini, a 32-year-old 32, a professor at a private university.</p> <p>Newspapers and television channels are running stories about the election, but there is little debate on popular chat shows or in the opinion pages.</p> <p>In one report, the popular newspaper 8am underlined that the US had already made a long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"Both candidates said there should be no worries about US and international aid to the country,\" the report said, before adding that it was in Washington's interest to ensure the country did not become a haven for terrorists, regardless of who was in the White House.</p> <p>Diplomats are similarly sanguine about the election results. The winner will have to decide exactly how fast they want to bring the rest of US forces home, but neither Romney nor Obama is likely to deviate from a 2014 deadline agreed with Nato allies and the Afghan government.</p> <p>\"A review of policy will take place any way, irrespective of who wins, and the overall mood in the US is very much focused on the honourable exit,\" said one senior diplomat in Kabul. \"If Romney wins, there may be more of a deep dive. He may be more critical in assessing what is under the surface of the positive narrative \u2026 but overall I don't think the election result will have a major impact here.\"</p> <p>Some Afghans, however, are still hopeful the election will bring change, with aspirations not far different from those of US voters weary with the steady flow of young men and women returning home in coffins, and the steep cost of a war amid a struggling economy.</p> <p>\"I want to ask the US voters to select a man who will talk with the Taliban to end the war. We don't want any more people to be killed, we want the economy to be fixed,\" said 50-year-old Shah Agha Nazari, head of a local council in Kabul's Neka Khana area. <br><strong>Emma Graham-Harrison and Mokhtar Amiri</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012.

  "<p>Sixth formers at <a href=\"http://www.impington.cambs.sch.uk/\" title=\"\">Impington Village College</a> are more accustomed than most students to questioning their place in the world.</p> <p>The popular comprehensive school just outside Cambridge is one of the pioneers of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/english-baccalaureate?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">International Baccalaureate</a> in the UK and its sixth form attracts young people from all over the world. This year, 57 overseas students have signed up for the two-year IB diploma programme making the school's international sixth form centre seem more like a mini United Nations than a traditional English state school.</p> <p>Their presence, says Impington principal Robert Campbell, is invaluable because it enables the school's home-bred students to benefit from a wide range of cultural perspectives they would not be exposed to otherwise.</p> <p>\"Our students have to know themselves and where they come from \u2013 and identity is always important \u2013 but we also encourage them to look beyond <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/cambridge?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Cambridge</a> and recognise the incredible opportunities that are created by diversity and the richness of culture that there is across our planet.\"</p> <p>Teaching children about global issues and encouraging them to see the world through other eyes is of huge importance, according to Campbell and a growing movement of internationally-minded educators. In an increasingly interconnected world, today's young generation need to learn be able to engage in communication with people from a wide range of different cultures and traditions, they argue.</p> <p>This view is supported by evidence from an ICM survey of UK business leaders carried out for a report by the <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/schools\" title=\"\">British Council</a> and <a href=\"http://www.think-global.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Think Global</a>, a charity that works to educate and engage people about global issues. The report, <a href=\"http://www.think-global.org.uk/resources/item.asp?d=6404\" title=\"\">The Global Skills Gap: preparing young people for the global economy</a>, reveals that when recruiting new staff employers rate knowledge and awareness of the wider world as more important than a candidate's degree classification or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels\" title=\"\">A-level</a> results.</p> <p>Three-quarters of businesses also think the UK is in danger of being left behind other countries unless young people think more globally and are worried that many young people's horizons are not broad enough for them to operate in a globalised and multi-cultural economy.</p> <p>The vast majority of businesses believe schools should help young people to think more globally and four out of every five believe schools should be doing more.</p> <p>Significantly, twice as many business leaders rate knowledge and awareness of the wider world as an important skill as ability to speak a foreign language. While they still regard language skills as important it is the 'soft' skills of cultural awareness and understanding global issues that are particularly valued.</p> <p>\"Because we live in such a globalised world today our mission should be to ensure every young person in school feels more confident and able to live in that world,\" says Tom Franklin, Think Global chief executive.</p> <p>\"There is altruism to that. A lot of our research has shown that by understanding global issues and the challenges we face such as international development, sustainability, climate change and conflict resolution people are more likely to take action to make the world a better place. It might be as simple as donating, volunteering or taking action in their professional lives.</p> <p>\"But it's also good from a selfish point of view as well. As our research with the British Council has shown, giving young people an understanding of how the world works can be a really important skill as far as getting on in life is concerned.</p> <p>\"What we need to create in our future workforce is a nation of Little Worlders - instead of Little Englanders - who understand the world and how it works.\"</p> <p>Increasingly, schools in the UK are looking to do just that. The IB diploma has been gaining popularity in recent years and is now offered by 194 schools ranging from leading independents such as <a href=\"http://www.wellingtoncollege.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Wellington College</a> in Berkshire to <a href=\"http://www.georgegreens.com/\" title=\"\">George Green's School</a> in Tower Hamlets, a comprehensive that serves one of the most disadvantaged communities in the country.</p> <p>A key feature of the IB diploma programme is its emphasis on developing cultural understanding, multilingualism and global engagement across a broad range of subjects.</p> <p>Other prestigious alternatives to A-levels and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/gcses?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">GCSEs</a> also stress the importance of global understanding. The Cambridge Pre-U <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/diplomas?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">diploma</a> has global perspectives and research as a core component while the Cambridge International GCSE aims to develop students' ability to think critically about a range of global issues.</p> <p>While global learning features prominently in several A-level qualifications such as Edexcel's AS and A2 geography, there is growing pressure for it to be incorporated in all examination specifications.</p> <p>According to the Global Skills Gap report, one of the many possible reasons for the narrow horizons of British school-leavers is the relentless focus on exam results combined with an overburdened and outdated curriculum that has squeezed out any time in schools for learning about the wider world.</p> <p>The report calls for concerted action from business leaders, government and civil society and recognises that schools cannot be expected to achieve this shift in emphasis on their own. It calls for greater investment in schools-based programmes to encourage global thinking, including a young global enterprise scheme. It also calls on the government to use its current review of the national curriculum to give schools the space and legitimacy to incorporate global issues into science, geography, history and other subjects such as maths and English.</p> <p>Robert Campbell would like to go even further. He would like to see exams at 16 scrapped altogether with children's core skills assessed at the age of 13 and an IB-style curriculum introduced in place of A-levels.</p> <p>\"What is the point of an exam at 16 when the norm is no longer to leave school at 16? It's such a backward-looking view of education. It doesn't look at it holistically which being part of a globally aware school does encourage you to do.</p> <p>\"There are many good things about our education system but it's got its ugly side too. At their worse GCSEs and A-levels cultivate a sort of Little Englander mentality. We would want to have the opportunity to do the IB's middle years programme here and not be beholden to GCSEs,\" he says.</p> <p>There is also growing interest in teaching children global awareness in primary schools. While there are only 13 UK schools that offer the IB primary years programme more than 1,000 follow the popular International Primary Curriculum which is designed to encourage international-mindedness.</p> <p>There are many other reasons why schools are taking up the global awareness agenda. Some use it to promote tolerance and an appreciation of different beliefs, cultures and backgrounds while others use it to give their pupils an understanding of emerging industries and opportunities for training potential future leaders.</p> <p>\"What comes through strongly from talking to headteachers who have really embraced this agenda is that it can be good for schools in both prosperous areas and schools in areas that are much more deprived,\" says Tom Franklin.</p> <p>\"Headteachers in more prosperous areas say that by teaching from a global perspective they help to open students' eyes to challenges they otherwise wouldn't see and to the fact that there are others around the world that are less fortunate and need help. It helps to teach them about compassion and understanding.</p> <p>\"In schools in areas of high deprivation what heads say is that a global perspective can help to raise the aspirations of young people. A lot of their pupils have rarely travelled outside their locality. So by teaching from a global perspective it helps to raise children's sight and encourage them to look at the bigger picture.\"</p> <p>Robert Campbell agrees: \"Teaching children global awareness makes for a more vibrant and more encompassing school community. It certainly means that for us as a school community there is greater harmony.</p> <p>\"One of the characteristics of Impington that was cited by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/ofsted?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Ofsted</a> when they visited in May [the school sixth form was rated 'outstanding'] is the incredible acceptance of real difference whether it be of children from other countries or of children with very pronounced special needs. Our students are always the first to stamp on any racist comments and chastise their peers.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of BP's longest-running energy concessions is threatening to become a high-profile victim of tensions between the United Arab Emirates and Britain over criticism of the Middle East state's crackdown on Islamist extremist groups.</p> <p>BP was first given a stake in a vast onshore oil field in Abu Dhabi back in 1939, but the concession comes up for renewal in 2014 and BP has been excluded from the bidding list.</p> <p>The UAE is one of the top five oil exporters in the world and Abu Dhabi is the headquarters for BP's entire exploration and production operation across the Middle East \u2013 the birth place a century ago of the business as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.</p> <p>BP said \"discussions are still continuing\" with the UAE authorities but its exclusion from the bid is a major blow. The company is already in the middle of a row with Azerbaijan over falling output there, and has been hit by a series of serious problems in recent years, most notably the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The oil major is privately said to be still hopeful the British government can sweet-talk the UAE into changing its mind at a time when its chief rivals, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and others have been accepted as prequalified to bid.</p> <p>UAE officials have also accepted privately that BP's failure to make the list of bidders is a problem associated with the UK government rather than the company. Oil analysts in London, who preferred not to be named, said it was generally accepted that BP was the victim of a wider political row.</p> <p>The UAE has indicated that it is still to make a final decision on the issue, giving it leverage to encourage the UK government to dissuade political commentators in Britain from giving what it perceives as support to Islamist groups such as al-Islah.</p> <p>According to Human Rights Watch, the group \u2013 whose name translates as Reform and Social Guidance \u2013 is a \"non-violent political assocation advocating greater adherence to Islamic precepts\".</p> <p>BP holds a 9.5% holding in the 1.4m barrels-a-day concession alongside four western oil majors and the local state-owned group Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.</p> <p>The loss of its interests would deprive the company of 125,000 barrels a day, which is around 3.5% of its total global production.</p> <p>This is a significant amount given that BP is struggling to keep its volumes from falling, especially at a time when it is in the middle of selling its 50% stake in TNK-BP, its highly productive Russian operation.</p> <p>The financial loss from Abu Dhabi, however, would be less pronounced as the company is only paid around $1 for each barrel produced under the terms of the concession, which is structured as a \"contractor fee\".</p> <p>Abu Dhabi is one of the few Gulf states that allow western companies to explore for oil, and BP's exit would be a blow to the company's image as a blue-chip operator in demand all over the world. BP does not have any business in other major Middle East producers such as Saudi Arabia, but it does have oil interests in Iraq. It also has gas production in Oman and is developing gas fields in Sharjah.</p>",
  "<p>In the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/angela-merkel-bae-eads-merger\" title=\"\">failed \u00a325bn merger with the Franco-German owner of Airbus, EADS</a>, BAE Systems and its investors are looking beyond the western world.</p> <p>The UK's largest defence contractor sees the Middle East as an important growth market, building on the substantial position it has established on the back of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/bae-saudi-yamamah-deal-background\" title=\"\">controversial al-Yamamah arms deal</a>.</p> <p>That contract with the Saudi Arabian government brought BAE more than \u00a340bn of revenue, as well as a Serious Fraud Office investigation that ended abruptly under government orders in 2006.</p> <p>BAE is close to securing an order for 12 Typhoon jets from Oman, a Gulf state with which it has a decades-long relationship. Further down the track, multibillion-pound aircraft deals in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar beckon.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia will play an important role following the collapse of the merger, which has led to BAE's largest shareholder calling for the resignation of the company's chairman, Dick Olver. Investors and market analysts are hoping that BAE will soften the blow of the EADS failure, and buy the firm's management more time, by returning the proceeds from a renegotiation of a Saudi contract for 72 Typhoons. BAE is expected to receive up to \u00a3600m and shareholders hope it will be diverted towards them by way of a special dividend or share buyback.</p> <p>In the longer-term, however, the Arab spring could alter a business environment that has been a consistent earner for BAE and other western defence contractors.</p> <p>Indeed, a list of defence suppliers to Saudi Arabia throws up some powerful multinationals: Boeing, Microsoft and Rolls-Royce are among the blue-chip names. According to analysis by IHS Jane's, Arab states may seek to reduce their reliance on individual defence contractors in case an internal crackdown leads to an arms embargo that would deny access to maintenance, upgrades and spare parts for military equipment.</p> <p>\"There is a fear that if there is an uprising and states go too far in terms of controlling it, they will have their wrists slapped by their friends in the west,\" says Guy Anderson, chief analyst at IHS Jane's, who estimates that the Middle East and Africa account for around 15% of BAE's revenues. If this leads to reliance on a broader array of suppliers or deeper relationships with countries that have fewer qualms about supplying controversial regimes, the likes of BAE could suffer.</p> <p>Anderson adds that Britain can no longer treat certain Middle Eastern states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, as guaranteed customers because of a general trend towards broader supplier ties. \"The UK is going to face a bit of a struggle. Many parts of the Middle East were guaranteed markets in past years. You could almost take it for granted that Oman would buy British, or that Saudi Arabia would alternate between the US and the UK. But now it will be harder to take them for granted.\"</p> <p>IHS Jane's adds that Middle Eastern states, including Saudi Arabia, have pumped billions of dollars into social programmes and employment schemes in the wake of the Arab spring, which could lead to cutbacks in defence procurement.</p> <p>But the political upheaval over the past year contains opportunities for BAE, which has a burgeoning cybersecurity business. After all, the Egyptian uprising was fuelled by a Google employee and social media played a role elsewhere. \"The security services were, in many cases, caught on the hop,\" says Anderson. \"So expect them to beef up on cybersecurity.\"</p>"
