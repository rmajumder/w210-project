  "<p>With the South African flag draped around his shoulders, a smile stretched across his face, Oscar Pistorius was in no rush to finish his lap of honour on Saturday night. He mouthed his thanks to the crowd, stopping to wave and shake hands as he made his way around the track. It was \u2013 at last \u2013 his moment and he was going to enjoy every second of it.</p> <p>The final sporting event in this gasp-inducing Olympic Stadium was, to the joy of the 80,000 watching inside it, won by the man who has done more than any other to pull the Paralympics from the edge of sporting endeavour and into the public consciousness. It was a fitting ending to an extraordinary summer for the man they call \"Blade Runner\". Since the opening ceremony of the Olympics he has run 11 races in this stadium, leaving it until the very last to win his first individual gold.</p> <p>Pistorius made history last month, becoming the first double-leg amputee to take part in an Olympic Games after winning a fierce battle with his own sport's governing body for the right to compete. The sprinter, who had both legs amputated as an 11-month-old, failed to make it to the final of the 400m, but the accolades that rained down on him set the stage for the 25-year-old to become the king of the London 2012 Paralympics, an event he was expected to dominate. It didn't quite happen like that. There was a shock defeat in the T44 200m final, in which Pistorius came second to the 20-year-old Brazilian Alan Oliveira, followed by an accusation from Pistorius that the younger sprinter was running on blades that were too long and had an unfair advantage.</p> <p>The controversy engulfed the Games and forever changed the image of a man who until these Games had been the only Paralympian with a truly global reach. Pistorius, who won his first gold in Athens as a 17-year-old, was soon back on winning form with the South African team, taking gold in the men's 100m relay and setting a new world record of 41.87 seconds. But the following night there was further disappointment when he was roundly beaten by the British sprinter Jonnie Peacock in the T44 100m final, finishing in fourth place.</p> <p>The Blade Runner that leaves these Paralympic Games, then, is a different man to the sprinter who arrived in a blaze of glory from the Olympics. But his lack of dominance in London \u2013 and the size of the row that erupted around his comments \u2013 is surely testament to his impact on Paralympic sport. A 15-year-old Peacock saw Pistorius win three gold medals in Beijing and was inspired to push harder on the track. When the 200m finalist David Behre from Germany lay in his hospital bed after a double-leg amputation it was a documentary about Pistorius that got him up and running.</p> <p>It is difficult to overestimate the esteem in which other athletes hold the sprinter. Before his 100m win, Peacock spoke of his idol with a respect that bordered on reverence. Oliveira looked crushed when he heard, in the wake of his shock victory in the 200m, that the South African had questioned the length of his blades, saying: \"For me he is a great idol and to hear that from a great idol is difficult.\"</p> <p>Whether the blades row has permanently tarnished Pistorius's image \u2013 and his brand, which is estimated to be worth around \u00a32m a year \u2013 will be played out in the months and years to come. But the impact of his outburst and the mea culpa of sorts that followed \u2013 he apologised for the timing of the outburst, if not its contents \u2013 may not be entirely negative. After it, he is no longer Pistorius the poster boy, the magnanimous mouthpiece of disabled sport, but an athlete who can lose and be unhappy about it. Human, not superhuman. That does not detract from his achievements leading up to and including London 2012 \u2013 it magnifies them.</p> <p>Pistorius, who will be 29 in Rio, will undoubtedly see more of his titles disappear, perhaps even the beloved 400m he won so comfortably on Saturday night. But he will ever be the man who opened the door for outstanding Paralympians to take part in the Olympics and the athlete who changed the face of disabled sport. The huge roar that went up in the Olympic stadium on Saturday night, as he received the final track medal of London 2012, felt like a resounding recognition of that.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister's friends say that he has always been a reluctant reshuffler and now we know the real reason why. He isn't much good at them.</p> <p>There are 10 reasons to recast a government or, if you like, 10 tests of whether there was any serious point to holding a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/04/cameron-cabinet-reshuffle-full-list-moves\" title=\"\">reshuffle</a>.</p> <p>Test 1. To try to make the government more liked by the public. There was one potentially popular move available to the prime minister. That was to sack George Osborne and find a new chancellor less likely to be booed whenever he is in the proximity of anyone who is not a close relative. That was also something that Mr Cameron was never going to do because it would have been the betrayal of his closest collaborator and an admission that the economic and political strategy that they have pursued for the last 28 months has been a terrible mistake.</p> <p>Given that he wasn't going to eject the next-door neighbour, the prime minister might have been expected to take more care not to be gratuitously aggravating with other aspects of the reshuffle. When you need all the support you can get, it is not recommended to offend an important demographic who represent more than half the electorate, namely women. We do not have to believe that he fired one female minister while cradling a glass of wine and implied to another that she was too old to continue in cabinet. We just have to be able to do basic maths. The number of female full cabinet members has fallen from five to four, which is not compensated for by the promotion of some talented women to the lower rungs of the ministerial ladder. This when the Tory party already had a problem with women.</p> <p>Test 2. To make the prime minister look more authoritative. Number 10 is in total denial mode about accounts of Flashmanesque conduct at reshuffle interviews: sacked ministers in puddles of tears as the prime minister swigged from a bottle of claret while strangling a rabbit. In a way, though, these stories have done him a favour by suggesting that he acted more than ruthlessly than he actually did. On the man-or-mouse measure, it was a squeaky reshuffle. To Iain Duncan Smith, he offered a choice whether or not to move from the Department of Welfare and Pensions. IDS decided that this was an offer he could refuse.</p> <p>He knew he needed a new health secretary, but couldn't bring himself to sack Andrew Lansley outright so he was parked in the departure lounge role of leader of the Commons. He also knew that he needed a new culture secretary and dealt with that by making the eye-popping decision to swap Jeremy Hunt to health. Even the Archangel Gabriel would struggle to overcome the huge complexities of introducing highly contentious and deeply distrusted health reforms at a time of austerity. Mr Hunt is not the Archangel Gabriel. I guess it is only a matter of time before News Corps puts in its takeover bid for the NHS.</p> <p>His promotion has generated all sorts of conspiracy theories, most along the lines that he knows where all the Murdoch bodies are buried, but there could be a simpler explanation. Mr Cameron is weak about disposing of failed colleagues, especially when they are his mates. To a disconsolate minister who asked why he was getting the sack, Clement Attlee tersely replied: \"Not up to it.\" That was brutal, but it is perhaps just as cruel and it is certainly misguided to put people in unsuitable jobs because you don't have the cojones to sack them. It is also a bit pathetic to try to pretend to those you are demoting that it isn't really happening. The number of ministers allowed to attend cabinet has risen to a silly 32 after Ken Clarke, Sayeeda Warsi and David Laws were given consolation rights to sit around the table.</p> <p>Test 3. To relieve internal discontent. Mr Cameron clearly spent a lot of time worrying about how to soothe the fevered brows of his fractious backbenchers. Andrew \"Thrasher\" Mitchell gets to fulfil a long-nurtured ambition to become chief whip with a brief to make the Tory parliamentary party more disciplined. Good luck with that. The most obvious gesture to the Conservative core constituency is the appointment of Chris Grayling as justice secretary in place of Ken Clarke, whose mistake was to take Mr Cameron seriously when he used to argue for the reforms to penal policy that Mr Clarke has tried to pursue. Old Hush Puppies was always much too liberal for the Tory grassroots, tabloids and web propagandists. Mr Grayling will have a different problem. He will have to square his party's expectations that his arrival will lead to many more criminals being incarcerated for much longer with the fact that police budgets are being cut and there is no money to build all the prisons that would be required to satisfy that craving.</p> <p>Test 4. To give the government a fresh look. Reshuffles only impinge on the consciousness of the public when they are triggered by a scandal or a change in one of the big jobs. The foreign secretary, home secretary and chancellor stayed put. The prime minister's lack of courage about removing other cabinet ministers further limited his chances of making the government seem reinvigorated.</p> <p>Test 5. To generate 48 hours or so of positive media coverage. A trivial test, but it is always very important to Downing Street. Mr Cameron's team spent weeks preparing. They didn't expect the left and liberal media to be well-disposed. The disappointment for them was the reception from the rightwing media. The <em>Times</em> was unimpressed. The <em>Telegraph</em> was underwhelmed. The <em>Sun</em> and the <em>Daily Mail</em> didn't even make the reshuffle their lead story. That was mean when a lot of it was designed for them.</p> <p>Test 6. To remove cabinet members who are impeding the prime minister. There was one very stark example of this. Justine Greening was shunted out of transport for the high treason of sticking to the Tory party's manifesto pledge not to build a third runway at Heathrow. This might be worthy of a bit more respect were it clear that Mr Cameron now backs expansion of Heathrow. We would then know that he was U-turning from some sort of conviction. But what Boris Johnson calls the \"ditherama\" of holding an inquiry into airport capacity suggests that Mr Cameron shafted Ms Greening to get the pro-Heathrow lobbyists off his back. So a sign of steel there, but for a feeble reason.</p> <p>Test 7. To clear out the duffers and the discredited. This should be one of the easier tests to pass since all governments accumulate dead wood over time. Mr Cameron was a fairly vigorous axeman, removing nearly 30 ministers. But there is discontent that the cull swept away a clutch of decent ministers who were masters of their subjects and had done nothing visibly wrong. The explanation from Number 10 is that they had to be sacrificed to create job opportunities for the hungry, younger generation and the displaced should not take it personally. I have news: some of them are taking it very personally. Incidentally, to sacked Lib Dem ministers, Nick Clegg offered the interesting explanation that he had to share jobs around because the Lib Dems would probably not be in power again.</p> <p>Test 8. To promote able communicators. Tory activists will probably take to the new party chairman, Grant Shapps. He is energetic and aggressive and will talk their kind of language. The public will find him more of an acquired taste. This illustrates one of the broad failings of this reshuffle: most of the effort went into appeasing the Conservative party rather than reaching out to the country.</p> <p>Test 9. To promote people who might prove good at making and executing decisions. Mr Cameron took the opportunity to bring some of his backbench talent into government \u2013 \"the stars of the future\", as one of his aides puts it. Some of them do look as though they have the potential to go very far, but they will need road testing before we can be sure. Mr Lansley and Mr Hunt were stars of the future once.</p> <p>Test 10. To set a clearer sense of direction for the government. This reshuffle has certainly clarified some important things about the prime minister. A particularly striking decision was to put <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/07/owen-paterson-climate-change-sceptic?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Owen Paterson </a>in charge at environment. What is the reverse of one of those labels that tells you a product is eco-friendly? In politics, it is getting the approval of Lord Lawson of Blaby, leading voice of the climate-change deniers, who has given a warm endorsement to the new environment secretary.</p> <p>How far Mr Cameron has travelled from those balmy days when his aides would hand out tree saplings at news conferences and he would promise to lead \"the greenest government ever\". I am also old enough to remember when he wanted to \"hug a hoodie\". I can further recall his previous incarnation as the champion of \"localism\", which sharply contrasts with his present one as the leader of a government that says Whitehall will overrule planning decisions that it doesn't like. The most important thing we learned from the reshuffle is that the original Tory modernising project has evaporated. Gay marriage is left \u2013 and that's about it.</p>",
  "<p>Finally, it took the intervention of Tony Blair to break the impasse \u2013 a standoff that almost everyone assumed had ended the \u00a356bn deal that Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg had been dreaming of for five years.</p> <p>On Thursday night in London, the former prime minister brought together Glasenberg and the oil-rich Qatari investors who had been ready to kill off his masterplan to merge his global commodity trading house with the mining giant Xstrata. That deal would create a group that is the world's largest producer of zinc, controls just under a third of the coal used for power stations and trades wheat, sugar and oil in more than 40 countries, putting it at the centre of the global trade in vital commodities.</p> <p>The previously little known billionaire had endured the publicity generated by floating Glencore last year mainly in order to pursue the \"merger of equals\" with Xstrata. He even seemed prepared to give up being chief executive of the newly created commodities powerhouse, ceding the role to his longstanding friend and rival Mick Davis, the Xstrata boss.</p> <p>Indeed, so friendly was the arrangement that Davis was lined up for a \u00a350m retention package, and it was there that the snags started. Investors, already buoyed by a newly discovered sense of rebellion in the \"shareholder spring\", were furious at Davis's potential rewards. But when Glasenberg went on the offensive to defend the merger during a speech to the London dinner of the Melbourne Mining Club in June, he ended by courting more controversy.</p> <p>\"Thank God my partners were entrepreneurs,\" he said. \"They want to work in a company that looks towards the long term \u2013 that wants to take advantage of a cheap asset that comes available ... So really, that's the real reason we went public\".</p> <p>It was already known before Glasenberg took to the stage that Glencore's listing had been designed to create a vehicle that could use paper, rather than cash, to buy access to natural resources. But what Glasenberg also appeared to be saying was that he thought Xstrata was cheap \u2013 so cheap, in fact, that he was willing to give up running the company in which he was to be the largest shareholder. The problem with such a line was obvious: other Xstrata shareholders might also suspect that Glasenberg could be underpaying. The Qataris certainly did.</p> <p>In February, when Xstrata and Glencore confirmed one of the sector's worst kept secrets and finally announced plans for a merger, the proposed terms of 2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share did appear slightly stingy.</p> <p>Sitting quietly in the background was Qatar Holding \u2013 the sovereign wealth fund that owns Harrods plus large stakes in Barclays and Sainsbury's, among other high profile investments. It then held around 3% of Xstrata and that stake began to edge up.</p> <p>Then, just under three weeks after Glasenberg's after-dinner speech, the bombshell was dropped. After diverting spats over executive pay, price was back at the top of the agenda. Xstrata's announcement of a revision in the controversial terms of Davis's retention contract almost directly coincided with a statement from Qatar that it would require Glencore to pay more. Much more. Rather than exchange every Xstrata share for 2.8 Glencore shares, QH wanted 3.25.</p> <p>Even in an industry used to explosives, This was dynamite. By now Qatar held 10% of the miner and as Glencore was barred from voting its own 34% on the merger, it immediately looked like a blocking stake. That seemed even more true by the end of last month, by which time Qatar owned 12% of Xstrata. Even so, Glasenberg \u2013 who had started insisting Xstrata was not a \"must-do deal\" \u2013 refused to board a plane to Doha and negotiate. There is a sense that he may have been reluctant to repeat the trip, as previous efforts to sell Glencore to Qatari investors had fallen short after he was rebuffed by the sovereign wealth fund at the commodity trader's 2011 flotation.</p> <p>Those close to the Qataris also suggest the pitch alerted the emirate to another investment, as Glencore had a 34% stake in Xstrata. Quite why the fund preferred Xstrata to Glencore is not clear. However, according to those who have worked with it, dealing with Qatar Holding can be a lengthy process and the fund can eschew investments that might cause it embarrassment, especially in the west.</p> <p>Glencore, on the other hand, is a controversial company even within a controversial sector. When Glasenberg admitted publicly in April that the City viewed his company's assets as lower quality, it was essentially an acknowledgement that Glencore owned projects in territories other FTSE 100 companies might have shied away from. In May, Glencore was asked by non-governmental organisation Global Witness to explain alleged \"potentially corrupt deals\" in the Democratic Republic of Congo with partner Dan Gertler. In June, a Glencore subsidiary hit trouble when it was fined \u20ac500,000 by a Belgian court for bribing EU officials to obtain market-sensitive information.</p> <p>Whatever Blair said to Glasenberg on Thursday night, it was enough to overcome the arch-trader's refusal to budge on price. Even as the meeting to vote on the deal got under way at Glencore's Swiss HQ in Zug on Friday, he shifted part of the way towards the Qataris' demands. Now he's offering 3.05 shares \u2013 but on condition he gets to be the boss.</p> <p>Back in June, Glasenberg asked: \"If I wasn't a shareholder and just the CEO of Glencore, why the hell would I do the deal when I get to lose my CEO job?\" Mick Davis and his camp may now be asking the same question.</p>",
  "<p>The forthcoming party conferences may leave a hollow feeling. Quite apart from the unseemly pandering to the prejudices of a weak and narrow activist base, the mixture of vague values and small solutions that politicians conventionally offer for our nation's pressing problems will feel desperately inadequate. Speech writers may abhor big theory, but without it we can't see the barriers to change.</p> <p>Reflecting the way we have evolved as a species, there are three fundamental ways of thinking about and pursuing social change: hierarchical authority, solidarity and individual aspiration. So, for example, if we want seriously to tackle social injustice or to make an ageing population an asset, not a burden, it will require a strong and consistent framework of policies, substantive shifts in social norms and expectations, and new ways for individuals to pursue their interests. Successful societies, organisations and policies direct and combine authority, solidarity and aspiration. This is where the problem lies. Today, the sources of social power are weak or distorted.</p> <p>Take the challenges besetting authority. The recent global survey found public trust in government across 18 countries at a new low of 38%. The survey also found the credibility of company CEOs and government officials had plummeted.</p> <p>Several factors are implicated. For two decades, many western economies have suffered stagnant living standards for most workers and high unemployment. We live in a complex society with a public that has differentiated needs and personalised expectations. Technology has increased the pressure: open information, virtual networks and the speed of online mobilisation all challenge hierarchical bureaucracies.</p> <p>What about the force of social solidarity and shared values? Private affluence, population mobility and social diversity are among the factors weakening solidaristic institutions and impulses. The last 30 years have seen the decline of a set of \"congregational\" institutions such as the church, trade unions and political parties. Also important has been the fracturing of class, most vividly illustrated by the shift of social housing from a mainstream tenure of choice to a residual sector catering overwhelmingly for people without work.</p> <p>In contrast, and contributing to the declining power of authority and solidarity, individualism is the dominant force of our times. But unlike classical or Enlightenment conceptions of the good life well lived, it is a narrow and materialistic form of individualism.</p> <p>The lens through which problems are viewed and solutions offered can be telling. A recent report on failing care for frail older people in hospital blamed managers and a lack of compassion among nurses. Yet neglect is more likely when vulnerable people have no loved ones as advocates. The problem is, therefore, not only about public service standards but also isolation, provoking wider questions about an ageing society.</p> <p>A facile debate about social mobility focuses almost entirely on how to get a few talented poor people to be upwardly mobile (something that would only concentrate disadvantage), but questions about the characteristics of a just society or the fierce resistance of the privileged to downward mobility are avoided.</p> <p>To restore public faith in social progress and to develop credible solutions to difficult problems we need to renew our sources of power. This means radically different ways of thinking about and exercising political and organisational leadership. It means a much deeper understanding of what binds people together and how social networks and shared values can be mobilised for progressive ends.</p> <p>Barack Obama took a risk last week when he told his party that change in America will take a generation: \"It'll require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one.\"</p> <p>This insight is just a starting point, but unless our politicians face up to, and confront us with, the challenge of renewing social power, we are doomed to the exhausting futility of trying to fix big problems using broken tools.</p>",

  "<p>China's green energy industry has long been seen as a world-beater.

It has just pushed rival Iberdrola of Spain off the global top slot, according to a new report from Make Consulting.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the grid problems and other issues have led Chinese wind-turbine maker Sinovel to report a 96% dive in first-half profits, while sales income was down by almost half.</p> <p>Sinovel is the second largest of its kind in the world behind Vestas of Denmark, while Goldwind (third biggest) recently reported an 83% plunge in first-half profits on the back of a 42% slump in sales.</p> <p>These setbacks may be temporary and are expected to increase Chinese activity overseas, rather than reduce it, according to Robert Clover, research director of Make Consulting. He says: \"China has seen 50% compound growth [in wind energy] since 2005 but is now taking a pause \u2026 There is no doubt that manufacturers of turbines and asset owners [wind-farm operators] are now looking at international markets for growth.\"</p> <p>And there are already signs that Chinese and other Asian firms are buying European rivals that have been hit by the credit crunch, the running-down of local subsidies and low-cost competition from abroad.</p> <p>One high-profile example of this has been revelations that Mitsubishi of Japan has been talking about buying a stake in Vestas, whose share price has been hit by a series of problems.</p> <p>The Danish wind-turbine maker, which has issued a series of profit warnings and has been through a major board and management team upheaval, has already sold off a wind turbine tower factory at Varde in Denmark to China's Titan Wind Energy.</p> <p>And this comes at the same time as the financially stricken German solar business Q-Cells, once a world leader, has been rescued from the liquidators by Hanwha Chemical of South Korea.

The obscure settlement in eastern Zhejiang province became an export-driven boomtown, producing as much as a third of the world's sock supply and thriving even through the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent global recession.</p> <p>Last year, Datang made roughly two pairs of socks for every person on earth. Long and short, Argyle or polka-dotted, they cram the stores of the nearby wholesale market. In Xu's spacious new factory, the shelves are stacked with huge reels of red, blue and orange thread. But ask Xu about the future and he grimaces. \"I'm very worried. This year is much worse than 2008-9,\" he says.</p> <p>The biggest of his rivals to have gone under in May \u2013 the Anli Sock Group, which produced 60m pairs of socks annually \u2013 could prove to be \"the Lehman Brothers of Datang\", according to Fan Jianping, chief economist of the State Information Centre.</p> <p>Failures such as Anli's and a slew of disappointing data in recent weeks are raising fears far beyond China that a slowdown in the world's second largest economy is turning into a hard landing. In the face of Europe's woes and the weak US recovery, Chinese growth has become more important than ever: the ripples are already being felt globally, with commodities analysts blaming tumbling prices on falling demand from China.</p> <p>The country's premier, Wen Jiabao, has issued repeated warnings about the economy, saying growth is under pressure and exports need support. Last week's <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/china-boosts-economy-infrastructure-plan\" title=\"\">announcement of approval for infrastructure projects</a>, which some estimate to be worth 1tn yuan (\u00a399bn), appears to be an indication of just how alarmed authorities have become about the largely investment-driven economy.</p> <p>Until now, they have taken a series of milder measures, such as cutting the reserve ratio requirement and reducing interest rates, mindful of the painful hangover that resulted from the huge 4tn yuan stimulus they adopted to stave off the last crisis. That inflated property prices again and left a legacy of massive local government debt and questionable loans and infrastructure projects.</p> <p>China's economy saw second-quarter growth of 7.6% year-on-year: enviable to US or European eyes, but the lowest rate in three years, and the sixth straight quarter of slowing growth. Export growth slid to 1% in July \u2013 the lowest rate for three years, bar January, which was skewed by the lunar New Year holiday \u2013 and earlier this week, the official factory purchasing managers' index fell to 49.2 \u2013 the first time since November that it had dropped below the 50 barrier separating expansion from contraction.</p> <p>\"We should be very worried,\" says Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of Beijing-based J Capital Research. \"The economy has been in a hard landing since the fourth quarter of last year, but seems to have been helped by the consumer economy \u2026 That's now down as well.\"</p> <p>Most analysts are more optimistic, at least for now. While growth has fallen from a peak of 11.9% in the first quarter of 2010, when there were concerns about overheating, the decline is far less steep than last time, when it plummeted from a peak of 14.8% in the second quarter of 2007 to a low of 6.6% in early 2009.</p> <p>But Alistair Thornton of IHS Global Insight warns: \"More of the indicators we are looking at are showing strain and weakness. It's nowhere near what we were looking at four years ago, but nonetheless pretty ugly.</p> <p>\"There are huge stockpiles of coal at Qinhuangdao; steel factories in Hebei are over capacity; in retail, auto dealers have two, three, four months' more stock than they are used to.\"</p> <p>Cranes still tower over construction sites, but no one is working in them, says Yu Wankun, the sales manager for SANY Excavators in Jiangsu, the neighbouring province to Zhejiang.</p> <p>\"I feel like a blossoming summer has suddenly turned into a dull winter,\" he laments. \"In 2008, we didn't feel the crisis at all. This year, we do feel the crisis has really struck. The government's stimulus created a bubble. But many local governments are in debt now and the central government's financial support has stopped.\"</p> <p>The knock-on effects hit people hard when exports started falling in May, says Xiao Zhou, boss of another Datang firm. \"A lot of sock companies started doing real estate in Jiangsu \u2013 they went bust because of the property market, not because of sales,\" he says.</p> <p>Back in the sock factory, Xu has heard that 73 clothing firms have gone under this year, with some leaving behind debts of billions of yuan. Things have not been so bad since 2003, when foreign buyers stayed away because of the Sars crisis. Usually Xu goes to the US once a year; this time, he has made three trips \u2013 but one major customer halved its usual $5m order anyway. Sales to civilian customers are down by at least a fifth.</p> <p>It is a sign of the times that his firm, Huazhong, considers the boom in sales to the Syrian army as a rare bright spot. \"Last year they bought 870,000 pairs. This year it's 960,000 already,\" he says. Few might imagine that camouflage or khaki ribbed socks came in so many varieties, but French, Singaporean and Saudi Arabian soldiers have proved exacting customers.</p> <p>But Datang also has its strengths. Smart entrepreneurs have moved away from piling high and selling cheap to targeting foreigners. Xu decided early on to focus on high-quality products and military sales, which he hoped would prove more stable and more lucrative. Though his company has dabbled in producing woolly hats, lacy tights and dog booties, Xu's latest target is the medical market, with products such as support stockings. Others in Datang have focused on domestic consumers or sought new markets in rival developing countries.</p> <p>The rise in Chinese purchases and the increase in trade to the Middle East should also help to offset problems elsewhere, says Hou Zhiping, general manager of the city's hosiery market.</p> <p>So far, there is little sign of rising unemployment \u2013 admittedly a trailing indicator \u2013 which might fuel fears of social unrest. At the labour market in nearby Yiwu, a recruiter for the Xialaite sock company grumbled about the difficulties of finding enough employees.</p> <p>Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based group supporting mainland workers, says there have been noticeably more layoffs than last year, especially in Zhejiang and Guangdong, \"but nothing like 2008-9, when 20m workers were laid off \u2026 I don't think there's a huge number of unemployed migrant workers wandering around.\"</p> <p>Recruiters in those provinces had previously complained of severe labour shortages, he points out, and opportunities in migrants' home provinces have improved: \"Recently it was reported that, for the first time, there were more rural labourers from Sichuan working within the province than outside it.\"</p> <p>Beijing's push to develop inland areas has also had some success, as Crothall points out: while Zhejiang's economy grew 5.2% in the first half of 2012, down from 12.1% in the same period last year, western areas like Sichuan, Chongqing, Shaanxi and Guizhou all saw rates of above 16%, according to official figures.</p> <p>But growth is now slowing in those regions, too \u2013 and because their economies are so much smaller, they have less effect on the overall situation. \"You would have to triple Xinjiang's economy to have an impact on the national picture&#xa0;\u2026 If you can't fix Guangdong, you can't fix China,\" says Thornton.</p> <p>Yet, says Patrick Chovanec of Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management, the outlook is not uniformly negative: \"This is an economic adjustment and, in the long run, will be good for China and the world, but it doesn't mean it won't be painful.\"</p> <p>Officials and analysts have long warned that the Chinese economy is unsustainable; that the years of double-digit growth were fuelled by investment and exports, and that rebalancing and reform were desperately needed.</p> <p>A powerful editorial in <em>Caixin</em>, the country's most influential business magazine, raised fears that local governments were ignoring the centre's cautious approach and instead attempting another major stimulus that would crowd out smaller private enterprises, deter competition and increase distortions in the system.</p> <p>Continuing to pursue high-speed growth, fuelled by government investment, will mean that \"growth will fall; discrimination will become pervasive, and rent-seeking and corruption rampant; our society and environment will be pushed to their limits; and development cannot be sustained. The mass protests, riots and environmental disasters we have seen are just some of the consequences of this distorting growth model. They are a warning,\" it said.</p> <p>\"If we continue to hanker for economic 'miracles', we must be prepared to pay a high price in future.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Cecily Huang and Kathy Gao</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2012 to correct comments made by Xu Leile.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/hayward-gallery-and-visual-arts/tickets/rachel-gadsen-unlimited-global-academy-1000298\" title=\"\"><strong>Unlimited Global Academy</strong></a> is an evening of work directed by the British visual artist Rachel Gadsden and born of the notion of \"invisible trauma\". Handicapped by spinal problems and fast-diminishing sight, Gadsden has been working with a group of HIV-positive South African township dwellers who use art to explore their condition. She made contact with the group after visiting the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge and seeing a \"bodymap\" created by the painter <a href=\"http://unlimitedglobalalchemy.com/nondumiso-hlwele\" title=\"\">Nondumiso Hlwele</a>, who is one of the group.</p> <p>This work, a graphic self-portrait illustrating the battle between the HIV virus and antiretroviral drugs, was the starting point for the evening's live performance event, <em>Alchemy</em>, created by the choreographer Athina Vahla. Alongside Gadsden, the piece features Freddie Opoku-Addaie, a contemporary dancer well known to UK audiences, and Sarah Chin, a working NHS physician who also trained in dance.</p> <p>The work opens with Chin's entrance. She is white-coated and wields a syringe with professional intent. Behind her are images of spreading blood. In the foreground, in track pants and battered trainers, Opoku-Addaie is swaying, twitching and shadow-boxing. Anything to remain in motion, so that he can avoid Chin's diagnosis. She rattles off the list of pharmaceuticals he will need to survive, but he runs off, wild-eyed.</p> <p>Eventually he collapses and Gadsden maps out his form on the stage with chalk. \"There have been things happening in my sleep,\" Opoku-Addaie tells us, rigid with fear and denial. \"Someone sent demons to have sex with me. That's why I'm afraid to test.\" Vahla shows us her character's eventual acceptance of his condition and \u2013 eloquently embodied by Opoku-Addaie \u2013 the ensuing interplay between exhaustion and the will to survive. Beside him, meanwhile, Gadsden is creating an artwork with frantic speed, fighting her own real-life fight against the dying of the light. In the act of painting, she tells us, she is \"living in the second\".</p> <p>A profoundly affecting reminder of our shared humanity, the work is one of 29 commissioned by the Southbank for its Unlimited festival, celebrating disability, art and culture. Dance fans in search of something completely different, meanwhile, should seek out Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury's film <strong>Livid</strong> (<em>Livide</em>), recently released on DVD. Set in a small town in Brittany, it tells the story of three friends who break into the house of the mysterious and sinister Madame Jessel, played with hideous gusto by former Paris Opera Ballet \u00e9toile Marie-Claude Pietragalla. Film reviewers have been flummoxed by its bizarre plot, but dance aficionados will recognise a retelling of the <em>Copp\u00e9lia</em> story, complete with terrifying automata and a grotesque reanimation scene.</p> <p>Ballet has often featured in dark cinema, most famously in Dario Argento's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81513/suspiria\" title=\"\"><em>Suspiria</em></a>, and more recently in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/darren-aronofsky\" title=\"\">Darren Aronofsky</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137726/black-swan\" title=\"\"><em>Black Swan</em></a>. The tendency harks back to the Romantic ballet's roots in the gothic movement of the early 19th century, when, in ballets such as <em>Giselle</em> and <em>La Sylphide</em>, gas lighting and the pointe shoe combined to present the ballerina as an unearthly and often lethal creature. \"So much suffering to achieve beauty,\" says <em>Livid</em> director Bustillo, drawing comparisons between classical dance and his own work. \"For me, there's something sublime about seeing a young girl in a tutu drenched with blood.\" For those of a like mind, <em>Livid</em> will not disappoint.</p>",
  "<p>Venturing into inhospitable wildernesses to collect data, today's scientific warriors are between a&#xa0;rock and a&#xa0;hard place. Actually they are usually in Antarctica. There's a&#xa0;research gold rush to the South Pole as record numbers of scientists (5,000 each year, from 27 different countries) head out to various stations. The prize? Essential research and their own data charting the effects of climate change at the front line. Lest we forget why this is important: if the ice melted in Antarctica, global sea levels would rise by 50m.&#xa0;</p> <p>As a way of funding their expeditions, many programmes now \"carry\" a&#xa0;number of amateur scientists. This is not an easy jolly; participants must be fit. They occupy an uneasy space between scientist and tourist. The latter are habitually blamed for putting pressure on ecosystems everywhere. But while there will be those who want to gawp at penguins, most are very well-intentioned. A&#xa0;recent report by Professor Steven Chown on the dangers to Antarctica found that tourists are unfairly taking all the flak for damage. Embarrassingly his research shows that when it comes to the distribution of invasive plant seeds (a serious form of pollution), scientists are more to blame than tourists. Peter Convey, a terrestrial ecologist for the British Antarctic Survey, pulled up his first weed in Antarctica in January this year and was suitably horrified.&#xa0;</p> <p>There are good scientific expeditions and bad ones. The good ones are meticulously planned from an ecological point of view. Take Professor Martin Siegert of Bristol University. When his team journeys to Lake Ellsworth in the Antarctic in November to continue his vital work into subglacial lakes, the environment will be a priority. So although it might have taken 16 years to plan this work in order to avoid using kerosene or chemical contaminants, his team will be using a \"clean\" borehole even though that will give them just 24 hours to collect samples.&#xa0;</p> <p>Leaving a trail of chemicals not only pollutes the ecosystem, it contaminates the area for future scientists so that when the next group arrives in the field to collect data, their probes detect oil and chemicals left by the last lot. Every expedition should be \"clean\" in this way.&#xa0;It's a&#xa0;travesty that every expedition is not yet compelled to offer a complete life cycle analysis. Any expeditions ignoring their ecological obligations are on very thin ice.</p> <h2>Green crush<br></h2> <p>Catch the free bus from Lewes, East Sussex, to the Woodfair at Bentley Museum. The grounds of the historic house will host 200 exhibitors who live or work in woodland. There's a Sussex tree-seed trader, woodsmen, carvers, trug makers and more advice on living off the land than you can shake a&#xa0;stick at.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRDhXCphrCw\" title=\"\">Eric Knight</a> wants us to look at the bigger picture. In this, his first book, he argues that in order to solve the most intractable global problems we need to abandon the obsession with detail that makes us look for solutions in the wrong places.</p> <p>Knight applies his theory to a wide range of problems, flitting in consecutive chapters between the environment, the banking crisis and the death of Osama bin Laden. When it comes to fighting terrorism, the Rhodes scholar believes killing terrorists isn't the answer. Instead we need to promote a wider democratic agenda that steers allegiance away from extremism. See, it's easy. Simply \"reframe\" the problem and all becomes clear.</p> <p>Knight studied climate change at Oxford, and the book is littered with personal anecdotes involving leading professionals in various fields, leaving you in no doubt of his credentials. But he tends to avoid actually coming up with answers, preferring instead to provide the means to get to them. The result is that you finish this book with more questions in your head than when you began it, and a feeling that the \"world's trickiest problems\" are unlikely to disappear any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>What did your front room look like 10 years ago? Probably mainly Ikea with a dash of Habitat. Hopefully the past decade has seen it flourish, find a&#xa0;little individuality, even some panache. If it has, you have British design to thank for that.

  "<p>For David Cameron, the need to calm the growing grousing about his leadership and for him to be seen to act to tackle a double-dip recession, made a reshuffle imperative. By Tuesday, the prime minister had promoted and demoted dozens of people of varying talent in his first extensive changes in power.</p> <p>But far from reassuring defenders of his integrity, resolve and navigational abilities to steer the coalition through the ever choppier waters ahead, the net result appears less than successful. It is a reshuffle that betrays signs of panic on the part of the prime minister rather than providing what he hoped would be an example of strong strategic pragmatism.</p> <p>The danger for the prime minister is that \u2013 as a succession of post-reshuffle leaks seem to bear out \u2013 his image as \"Dithering Dave\" is further reinforced. Since the start of the year there has been a growing chorus of internal critics wondering what, precisely, Mr Cameron stands for. Is he a radical or a moderate? A pragmatist or an idealist? The harshest among them say he lacks authority, gravitas and character \u2013 qualities needed to hold together an increasingly fragile coalition.</p> <p>If this was a reshuffle to answer some of those questions, then it failed. It did not show a ruthless, courageous prime minister fearlessly laying waste to under-performers or off-message ministers.</p> <p>Iain Duncan Smith, the welfare secretary, refused to vacate his post. Partly out of deference to a former leader of the party, but mostly because Duncan Smith has vociferous support among the right of the Conservative party, Cameron felt unable to oust him. And so, the running battles between Duncan Smith and the Treasury over the implementation of his preferred universal credit \u2013 the most significant overhaul of the benefits system since the welfare state began \u2013 will likely continue even though the chancellor is opposed on grounds of cost. Similarly, Ken Clarke was ousted from his post as justice secretary, but was left in cabinet where he lays claim to a new post: minister without portfolio. Or, minister without department. Or staff. Or budget.</p> <p>The only real surprise is that Mr Clarke, an accomplished, likeable and popular politician, agreed to such a non-position in what will be, in all likelihood, his last cabinet post.</p> <p>As a result, Labour has erroneously called this the \"no change\" reshuffle. It is anything but. In fact the reshuffle signals very clearly that Cameron is ready to jettison much of the modernisation model that he and his team have so assiduously constructed.</p> <p>It is instructive to remember the care and with which that image was constructed \u2013 due in large part to his now-departed adviser Steve Hilton. It was fashioned around an agenda that embraced women, ethnic minorities, compassion and environmentalism. Cameron even promised that by 2015, a third of his government would be female. After his reshuffle, less than 20% are women, mostly in the junior ranks. Another two key strands of brand Cameron circa 2005-2009, \"hug-a-hoodie\" compassionate conservativism and a passion for green issues, have been buried.</p> <p>More than anything last week was a re-branding exercise. The last marketing director \u2013 Hilton \u2013 has left the building. George Osborne seems to have assumed those duties.</p> <p>Welcome Chris Grayling as justice secretary as Ken Clarke departs, taking with him his intelligent observations on the savings that can accrue from rehabilitation. In comes a more traditional and populist view on penal policy. Crudely put, this means more prisons and more prisoners. Except that there is no money for increasing the number of prisons. This opens up the possibility of banging up more prisoners in the same number of cells, adding to the threat of recidivism.</p> <p>Among the other new appointments are Owen Paterson at environment, described as \"a prominent hater of wind farms\" and a climate change sceptic, and Nick Boles at planning. \"It's essential that we \u2026 do not allow the hysterical scaremongering of latter-day Luddites to strangle developments that will boost living standards,\" Boles said this year, fuelling suspicions that the green belt is no longer sacrosanct.</p> <p>In reinforcement of that message, ministers launched a string of initiatives ranging from state guarantees for house building to a temporary relaxation of planning requirements for home extensions to boost an economy that Osborne insists is far from flagging.</p> <p>It seems only yesterday that David Cameron was urging us: \"Vote Blue, Go Green\". He even had solar panels fitted to his London home in 2006. More recently, the man who fitted those panels charged Cameron with \"lying\" over his commitment to environmentalism, and claimed that the coalition's slashing of public subsidies has destroyed the solar electricity industry.</p> <p>Cameron always insisted that he is a small state, low taxes disciple of Thatcher, liberal on social issues, green at heart with a strong belief in decentralised power and localism. The reshuffle, in particular the impression it bolsters that environmental policies and restraints on development are being sidelined, seems evidence of a rising fear that the market, left to itself, is not riding to the rescue of the British economy at the speed anticipated. If this search for growth mines too narrow a seam, the misjudgments and flip-flops can only multiply.</p> <p>An example of that occurred within days of the reshuffle. Eric Pickles, the communities minister, warned that he will strip local councils of their planning powers and hand them to a centralised planning inspectorate if they show a record of poor quality or slow decision making. The threat is designed to force councils living in \"an economic La-La Land\" to allow more house building. Whether in bypassing the planning system, hinting at a third Heathrow runway or building a high-speed rail line via the Chilterns, Cameron is coming into increasing conflict with those who should be his natural supporters.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Cameron continues to be the Conservatives' greatest asset with supporters inside and outside the party. His fluency and presentational skills, which won him such plaudits in the early days of his leadership, have begun to be replaced by a growing sense of arrogance, entitlement and a lack of the common touch. This is most dangerous for the prime minister. The booing of the chancellor at the Paralympic Games was an extraordinary public rebuke and gave voice to those who feel that the heart of this government has become dangerously disconnected from the rest of us.</p>",
  "<p>Xstrata's independent shareholders must feel exhausted and baffled. The Glencore merger saga had already run for seven months before it was transformed on Friday into a possible hostile takeover battle. And now the mining group's board finds itself in a bizarre spot: arguing that a share-exchange ratio of 2.8 times was adequate for a merger, but that a higher proposal of 3.05 times is not enough when presented as a takeover.</p> <p>But even that assumes Glencore's proposal is firm. The trader's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, had months to arrange his cards in a presentable fashion but didn't even bother to issue an outline version of his offer on Friday. The skimpy details were instead made public by Xstrata.</p> <p>Outsiders are left to guess what Glasenberg discussed in a Mayfair hotel with a single shareholder, Qatar Holding, late on Thursday night \u2013 with Tony Blair in attendance. Take your pick: Qatar is either ready to back Glencore at the revised price, or furious that Glasenberg wants to dispatch Xstrata's Mick Davis and claim the chief executive's job for himself.</p> <p>This is no way to conduct a merger or takeover in a supposedly grown-up market such as London. We're talking here about a possible \u00a356bn mining and trading colossus with huge positions in the global coal, zinc, copper and nickel markets. Transparency should be everything. Instead, Friday was a shambles \u2013 and the Takeover Panel should be asking itself why it allowed Glencore to stay silent.</p> <p>Who will eventually prevail? The answer, of course, depends on what Qatar values more: the improved share ratio, or Davis. Glasenberg's hardball stance is that it can't have both.</p> <p>The saga may have more twists to come (and nothing is certain until Glencore gets round to tabling a proper proposal) but Glasenberg has one key advantage: he offers a clear ending to the tangled tale.</p> <p>Xstrata's board, like its shareholders, must also feel weary and confused. After the events of Friday, is it really credible that the two companies could return to their old life \u2013 that is to say, a life where Glasenberg and co own 35% of Xstrata's shares, have a veto over capital expenditure programmes and act as the marketing agent for much of the output from its mines?</p> <p>The personal relationship between Glasenberg and Davis, which has been prickly on occasions in the past, is surely now shattered beyond repair. The spirit of togetherness had already started to evaporate in recent weeks, even when both sides were officially still pursuing a happy \"merger of equals\". The Glencore camp criticised Xstrata's heavy investment in so-called \"greenfield\" sites, arguing that the returns don't match those of its own preferred \"brownfield\" extensions. Xstrata countered that the real risks come when, like Glencore, you expose yourself to the instability of countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p> <p>Xstrata's non-executive directors are also a discredited crew. Chairman Sir John Bond and senior independent director David Rough proposed a retention package that was so generous to Davis and his top colleagues that it provoked fury among shareholders and delayed the vote on the deal. If Xstrata survives as an independent company, the pair would probably have to be replaced to clear the air.</p> <p>Qatar, when it surveys this mess, may decide that its best interests lie in backing clarity \u2013 meaning Glencore. It can, after all, boast that it forced Glasenberg to improve his offer.</p> <p>But, in truth, there are no real winners. Xstrata's board should have held out for better terms in the first place and the executives should not have claimed those absurd payments. Glencore may end up with an empty victory \u2013 the assets, but not the necessary management. In which case, Qatar may regret stirring the hornet's nest.</p> <h2>Who would be King?</h2> <p>Start polishing up your CV: George Osborne is putting the finishing touches to the job ad for the governorship of the Bank of England.</p> <p>Sir Mervyn King's term ends next summer, after an extraordinary tenure in which the Bank has faced the very real prospect of a complete collapse of the banking system, cut interest rates to the lowest level since it was founded in 1694, and undertaken \u00a3375bn worth of quantitative easing.</p> <p>His successor will need to be both a top-drawer economist, able to hold their own in the intellectually rigorous environment of the Bank; and a City-savvy regulator, ready to take on the role of overseeing the banking sector that is being handed back to Threadneedle Street. He (or, perish the thought, she) will also need to be a formidable manager, who can oversee a radical expansion in the Bank, and shrug off the reputation it gained under Sir Mervyn for being slow off the mark when the crisis hit.</p> <p>Six months ago, there was a crowded field of impressive candidates; but a series of scandals and investigations has placed a question mark over many.</p> <p>Paul Tucker, one of King's deputies, faced a tough grilling by MPs at the Treasury select committee over his role in policing the way the Libor rate was set. Tucker held his own and shouldn't be written off, but he is no longer the heir apparent. Peter Sands of Standard Chartered, John Varley, ex-Barclays, and (Lord) Stephen Green, ex-HSBC, have all been tarred by scandals at their respective banks in recent months.</p> <p>Still very much in the running are the FSA's thoughtful boss (Lord) Adair Turner, and (Lord) Gus O'Donnell, the consummate civil servant. But with Spencer Dale, the Bank's own chief economist, delivering a sharp warning in a speech today[Sat]about the risks of keeping interest rates too low for too long, and saying that \"a widening gap may develop between what is expected of central banks and what they can realistically deliver\", both could be forgiven for deciding against submitting their CVs.</p> <h2>Executive pay heads for a fall</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395840534\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/8/1347096701817/David-Simonds-shareholder-010.jpg\" alt=\"David Simonds shareholder autumn 09.09.12\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cartoon by David Simonds</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With major companies still licking their wounds from the bruising \"shareholder spring\", executives are now experiencing the beginning of what could well be dubbed the shareholder autumn.</p> <p>Last week, nearly a third of investors voted against the remuneration report of packaging maker DS Smith over the size of bonuses for the chief executive and chairman. At Dixons Retail, a fifth of investors voted against pay policies that included a one-off share award for chief executive Sebastian James.</p> <p>The icing on the cake, though, was the rejection of a share scheme for Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, who stood to receive a \u00a326m award of shares. The resolution never even got to a vote, which required 75%&#xa0;approval.</p> <p>Expect more from emboldened shareholders this week. Troubled electrical retailer Darty looks to be next in the firing line after what could be described (if you're feeling charitable) as an error over the pay of chief executive Thierry Falque-Pierrotin in 2009. Then the company had said there were performance targets attached to an award of more than 750,000 shares for the new boss. It turns out there were not: the only condition was that he stayed three years. Ammunition, surely, for a big no vote.</p>",
  "<p>Desmond Tutu's point about the morality of leadership is understandable, but flawed. He seems to imply that a sophisticated leadership should always \"bring the global family together\". (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/02/desmond-tutu-tony-blair-iraq?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"Why I had no choice but to spurn Tony Blair\"</a>, Comment). The point is that the global family may not want to have as a member those who defile and persecute others or their own.</p> <p>I am a Christian and I believe in Christian values; I also don't think that the Iraq war was acted out in the best way possible, but I do see that for evil to be ridded we sometimes need to act a little harshly. Now, if Tutu had addressed what some might see as the real underlying issue \u2013 the control of natural resources (ask yourself which companies with leadership/ownership from where are now controlling those resources) \u2013 then he might have a stronger chance of rousing the \"hearts and minds\" of those listening.</p> <p>His argument is based solely on morals relating to the basis of going to war and not on morals of obtaining the spoils of that war (which themselves are the reason for going to war: whatever one argues you always think of the outcomes of something before doing it, at least on the international stage).</p> <p>As such, Tutu has missed a key point in the rhetorical scenario he is trying to bring about and, as such, his argument will be forgotten in time, as it ignores the endgame towards which the war was pointed.</p> <p><strong>Euan Clark</strong></p> <p>London E3</p> <p>There have been many deaths in conflict in post-colonial Africa. The logic of Archbishop Tutu's argument is that we should send those who ended imperialism to the International Criminal Court on the grounds they are responsible for these deaths.</p> <p>Syria right now is showing us that it does not need western intervention for the overthrow of a brutal dictator to unleash bitter sectarian conflict.</p> <p>Tony Blair was foolish to suppose the overthrow of Saddam Hussein would lead to a peaceful government springing up, but he did not personally order the warfare between gangs attached to rival branches of Islam or the expulsion of most of Iraq's Christians.</p> <p>Blaming Blair for the thousands of Iraqis killed by fellow Iraqis since the invasion is against the Christian principle that we are individually responsible for our actions and has undertones of racism with its implication that only white men are mature enough to be at fault for the many individual decisions to commit acts of violence.</p> <p><strong>Matthew Huntbach</strong></p> <p>London SW9</p> <p>It was disappointing to see Archbishop Tutu take such a crude and simplistic stance on Blair and Iraq. At the least, the debate within Africa over how to control Robert Mugabe should have given him pause.</p> <p>He might also have considered whether Saddam Hussein could or should have been considered a war criminal and guilty of genocide.</p> <p>If so, what then? Ironically, he appears to assert that the war in Iraq created the groundwork for recent uprisings in the Middle East, without realising that many regard these events as justifiable resistance to dictatorship.</p> <p>Others see great confusion and ambiguity. A man of Tutu's experience ought to be aware that moral choices in the real world are rarely as clear cut as he implies and that doing nothing also brings responsibilities in its wake.</p> <p><strong>Margaret Pelling</strong></p> <p>Oxford</p> <p>I wholly applaud Desmond Tutu's reasons not to share a platform with Tony Blair.</p> <p>The Iraq war was indeed immoral and unjustified and led to a devastating loss of lives and livelihoods. It is a pity, though, that Tutu did not choose to attend the event and then attempt to effect a citizen's arrest on Blair as a war criminal.</p> <p>It would have been much more difficult for the authorities to ignore an ageing man of God in such circumstances than the many others who have tried a similar tactic.</p> <p><strong>Tim Matthews</strong></p> <p>Luton</p>",
  "<p>More than three-quarters of MPs believe the UK's drug policies are not working, according to a poll for a respected commission poised to deliver a landmark report assessing the evidence for continued prohibition.</p> <p>The poll's publication comes ahead of the release of several major reports into the future of UK drug policy that will ensure the debate about reforming the country's laws becomes a key issue for MPs for the rest of the year.</p> <p>The poll, conducted by ComRes for the <a href=\"http://www.ukdpc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Drug Policy Commission</a> (UKDPC), found that 77% of MPs believed the UK's current policies were ineffective in tackling the problems caused by illegal drugs.</p> <p>The poll of 150 MPs, weighted to reflect the composition of the Commons, found no significant difference between coalition and Labour MPs, with only 18% of MPs from coalition parties agreeing that current policies are working.</p> <p>It also revealed that MPs had deep concerns about how drug policy is formulated. Two-thirds of those polled said a change in how policy was made was needed to tackle the UK's drug problems effectively. More than three-quarters of the MPs said that drug policy needed to draw much more on evidence and research.</p> <p>\"We knew that the public think that drug policy isn't working well enough,\" said Roger Howard, chief executive of the UKDPC. \"Clearly, many MPs now also think the same. Drug policy in the UK has had some good achievements, like keeping HIV rates low among drug users and getting more people into treatment. But it's now clear to many people that we need some fresh thinking.\"</p> <p>The UKDPC, an independent body launched in April 2007, aims to provide independent and objective analysis of drug policy. It will be wound up in the autumn, when it will produce a comprehensive report examining the effects of current policy and make recommendations for the future.</p> <p>But while there is widespread agreement that existing laws are not working, the UKDPC poll suggests there is little consensus on what needs to be done. It found that most MPs would resist a change in the drug laws. According to the poll, only 31% believe that they should consider relaxing the law so that possession of small quantities of controlled drugs would not be treated as a criminal offence.</p> <p>Confusion about drugs policy has been reflected in ministerial appointments. Last week's reshuffle saw the government appoint its fourth drugs minister \u2013 Lord Taylor of Holbeach \u2013 in two years.</p> <p>Drugs experts said the poll highlighted the challenge now facing politicians. \"Transform is delighted to see that almost four out of five parliamentarians know that drug policy is failing,\" said Danny Kushlick of Transform, an anti-prohibition group. \"However, given that so few appear to know what to do about it, conducting a review of all options, including decriminalisation and legal regulation, would provide the evidence for parliament to pursue an effective approach.\"</p> <p>Growing disquiet among politicians about the UK's drugs laws reflects wider global unease about blanket prohibition. In February, 12 Latin American countries signed a declaration calling for world leaders to explore legal regulation.</p> <p>Earlier this year Guatemala's Otto P\u00e9rez Molina became the first serving Latin American president to push for drug legalisation. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/07/latin-america-drugs-nightmare\" title=\"\">Drug abuse, alcoholism and tobacco should be treated as public health problems, not criminal justice issues</a>,\" Molina said, writing in the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>The imminent publication of the UKDPC report and one by the Commons home affairs committee suggests a similar debate is now heading for the UK. The British Medical Association is also expected to publish a report on drug dependency.</p> <p>\"UKDPC will look at how we can tackle drug problems and get better value for public money when we publish our report next month on the future of drug policy,\" Howard pledged.</p> <p>The last home affairs committee report into drugs, published in 2002, called for a major shakeup of the government's policy, concentrating on education and harm reduction for users, rather than criminal sanctions. \"Drugs policy in this country has been failing for decades,\" David Cameron, who was then a committee member, declared at the time. \"Drug abuse has increased massively, the number of drug-related deaths has risen substantially and drug-related crime accounts for up to half of all acquisitive crime. I hope our report will encourage fresh thinking and a new approach.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two weeks before he was due to exchange contracts and move into a new home, Peter Gingell received a call from his estate agent saying the whole thing was off. His buyers had pulled out, his chain had collapsed and his dream home was just that. The reason? A 3cm-high weed in his back garden.</p> <p>\"When I was told, I thought it was a joke,\" says Gingell.</p> <p>However, this wasn't just any old weed; it was Japanese knotweed, described by the Environment Agency as \"indisputably the UK's most aggressive, destructive and invasive plant\".</p> <p>It can grow to 3-4m in just 10 weeks \u2013 the equivalent of two grown adults. Underground, its roots \u2013 or rhizomes \u2013 can spread 7m horizontally and compromise the structure of buildings.</p> <p>Jonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, acknowledges that the problem of securing mortgages on properties affected by the plant has escalated in recent years, despite the fact that it has been around in the UK since the 19th century.</p> <p>\"If a bank's valuer finds evidence of it, or there is a history of it in the area, a specialist survey will be required. Lenders can get quite hysterical and over-react. The bank may not lend, or may retain part of the loan.\"</p> <p>Mark Harris, chief executive of broker SPF Private Clients, says: \"It's a mixed bag. Woolwich, Santander and Leeds Building Society will decline mortgage applications on properties where Japanese knotweed is present, while others will consider it, with guarantees or an indemnity in place, and be guided by a surveyor, such as Northern Rock, Clydesdale and Nationwide.\"</p> <p>Yet, according to Richard Sexton, business development director of <a href=\"http://www.esurv.co.uk/\" title=\"\">e.surv</a>: \"No house in the UK has fallen down because of knotweed. Yes, it grows like billio and can exploit holes and cracks but there's an element of scare stories that has made the banks panic over the past two to three years. It's not that it's suddenly spreading more, but as awareness has risen, valuers report it more.\"</p> <p>He acknowledges a \"lack of clarity\", with some lenders wanting to know not just whether it's in the garden, but whether it's in the street or even the town. Lenders, he says, have panicked and, coupled with the economic climate, \"gone into risk-averse mode\".</p> <p>Soon after his buyer pulled out, Gingell carried out his own research and soon realised there are varying degrees of severity, in particular its proximity to properties. Although it's not easy, it can be treated. \"It seems so unfair that a lender has a blanket policy of saying 'no'. It's treatable, but they have rendered my property worthless overnight.\"</p> <p>He called in a specialist (it took both of them 20 minutes, on their hands and knees, to even locate the specimen) who reported: \"In my opinion, the knotweed offers no threat to the building or its foundations and, provided it is treated before it has a chance to spread further, it should be eradicated within two years.\"</p> <p>Gingell has been quoted \u00a3300 per treatment, carried out twice a year for the next two years. He warns against what was his initial temptation \u2013 ripping it out and binning it: \"You can face a massive fine or even imprisonment if it isn't disposed of at a landfill site, or incinerated. And if you don't do it properly, it will definitely come back.\" A fingernail-sized fragment is enough to grow into a whole new plant.</p> <p>Having lost his savings and, faced with a currently un-mortgageable flat, Gingell is keen to raise awareness of the issue, given estimates show at least one infestation in every 10 sq kms in the UK. He has launched a campaign on his website <a href=\"http://www.knotaware.com\">knotaware.com</a> urging banks to change their lending policy and adopt a grading system rather than simply saying no.</p> <p>The future looks more positive after a working party, including lenders, surveyors and knotweed treatment companies produced an information paper for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). It has the backing of the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Building Societies Association.</p> <p>\"It's the first step towards proper guidance for the market,\" says Philip Santo, director of Philip Santo and Company, which produced the paper on behalf of the RCIS in a bid \"to make properties mortgageable again\".</p> <p>Importantly, it sets out to distinguish myth from reality and addresses the need for surveyors to have a tier system to indicate the level of risk. It also looks at how the growing number of treatment companies could agree on the best methods of working.</p> <p>The Property Care Association now audits these firms and provides training.</p> <p>Mortgage advisers and surveyors admit it will probably take at least until the end of the year before the guidelines become more widely adopted. Santo says: \"It is early days in terms of all the banks coming on board, but if a lender declines an application, I strongly recommend people challenge them to see if the policy reflects the changes and recognised treatment regime set out in the RICS paper. I know of two cases where people have gone back and had the decision modified.\"</p> <h2>The lowdown on knotweed law</h2> <p>The Environment Agency describes Japanese knotweed as the most invasive species of plant in Britain. Landowners are under a statutory duty to be proactive in the control and eradication of it. All parts of the plant and any soil contaminated with it are classified as controlled waste and must be removed and disposed of by a licensed waste control operator. Here, Chris Alexander, a property litigation lawyer at SA Law outlines your legal rights:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 If you have Japanese knotweed on your land:</strong></p> <p>It is not an offence to have Japanese knotweed on your land and it is not a notifiable weed. However, under Section 14(1) and (2), of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is a criminal offence to plant Japanese knotweed or otherwise cause it to grow in the wild.</p> <p>It is a defence to a prosecution to prove that all reasonable steps were taken and all due diligence was exercised by the landowner.</p> <p>The removal, eradication and disposal of the weed may be expensive but given that the presence of it can impede the sale of your property and/or affect the value, a least-risk approach would be to have it removed by licensed contractors and properly disposed of.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 If your neighbour has Japanese knotweed on their land:</strong></p> <p>Again, it is not an offence for Japanese knotweed to be present on your neighbour's land but allowing it to encroach onto your property may constitute a private nuisance under common law.</p> <p>A landowner affected by knotweed growth from a neighbouring property may therefore be able to apply to court for an injunction requiring the neighbouring owner to abate the nuisance. Such a claim can also include a sum of money in damages to reflect the cost of any physical damage to the property and/or the diminution in value of the landowner's property as a result of the nuisance.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For information on the RICS Japanese knotweed and Residential Property paper go to <a href=\"http://www.rics.org.uk\">rics.org.uk</a>.

Their actions ranged from the transgressive \u2013 they had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/16/cia-website-lulzsec-hackers\" title=\"\">taken down</a> the CIA's website and hacked into Sony's database and released more than a million user names and passwords \u2013 to the absurd: after the American network PBS aired a critical documentary about Julian Assange, LulzSec hacked into their website and replaced the homepage with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/31/pbs-victim-hackers-wikileaks\" title=\"\">an article</a> about Tupac Shakur, the (very much dead) rapper, which bore the headline \"Tupac Still Alive in New Zealand\". During the Arab spring, members of the group hacked and defaced Tunisian and Egyptian government sites. One hacker, <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/uk/2011/07/20/16-year-old-leading-member-of-lulzsec-reportedly-in-custody-after-sting/\" title=\"\">Tflow</a> (later discovered to be a 16-year-old London schoolboy), allegedly wrote a webscript that enabled activists to circumvent government snooping.</p> <p>LulzSec had also hacked into the website of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/21/soca-website-hacking-lulzsec\" title=\"\">Soca</a>, the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency, and replaced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/18/sun-website-hacked-lulzsec\" title=\"\">front page of the <em>Sun</em></a> online with a \"report\" that Rupert Murdoch had been found dead (with a helpful hint for the FBI in the closing paragraph: he'd been found, it said, \"in his famous topiary garden\").</p> <p>For a time, LulzSec demanded and caught the world's attention. Their tweets made headlines. Their jokes were retweeted by thousands. And there, waiting for me at Spalding station, is LulzSec's PR guru. \"Look out for the pale kid that needs a haircut,\" he'd texted me. And he's not wrong. He is quite pale and could do with a haircut. And he's impossibly young: just 19. A skinny teenager with a soft Scottish accent who \u2013 for a period of time last year, during \"the 50 days of Lulz\" \u2013 ran rings around law enforcement agencies on several continents.</p> <p>Of course, I already know what Jake Davis looks like, because in July last year, Davis, then 18, was arrested at his home in the Shetland Isles. And after being charged with five hacking-related crimes and released on bail, he emerged into the sun outside Westminster magistrates court for the world to see. Anonymous suddenly had a face: and the face was of a furtive, greasy-haired youth, wearing a pair of dark glasses and carrying a book called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/15/science-culture-books-review\" title=\"\"><em>Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science</em></a>. If you had to imagine what a teenage computer hacker would look like, this was it.</p> <p>The episode was front-page news on websites across the world, as a string of arrests were made: 19-year-old Ryan Cleary from Essex; 16-year-old Tflow from London; 27-year-old Jeremy Hammond from Chicago; a 25-year-old former soldier, Ryan Ackroyd, from Doncaster; 19-year-old Darren Martyn (or PwnSauce), from Galway, and Donncha O'Cearrbhail (or Palladium), also 19 and from Offaly, Ireland. The most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/29/lulzsec-hacker-arrest-sony-attack\" title=\"\">recent arrest</a>, 12 days ago, was of another American, 20-year-old Raynaldo Rivera of Arizona.</p> <p>In March this year came the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/06/lulzsec-sabu-working-for-us-fbi\" title=\"\">news of how it happened</a>: the FBI had turned a LulzSec member in New York, a 28-year-old Puerto Rican father of two called Hector Xavier Monsegur, known online as \"Sabu\", and used him as their informant. It was like <em>The Sopranos</em>, but instead of organised crime and Italian hitmen it involved teenagers sitting at computer screens. And perhaps most confusing of all, the vast majority of the main players seemed to be living in Britain or Ireland.</p> <p>Gabriella Coleman, professor of scientific and technological literacy at McGill University, in Montreal, probably knows more about Anonymous than anybody on the planet. She has studied them from the moment they first emerged as a new political force in 2008, and says that it's no coincidence that so many of the arrests were of British and Irish nationals. Anonymous is a vast, new, poorly understood global force who specialise in \"ultra-co-ordinated motherfuckery\", as one of Coleman's contacts puts it. And it attracts a huge British following.</p> <p>In the chatrooms where Anons gather, Parmy Olson, a London-based journalist with <em>Forbes</em> magazine, found the British connection blindingly obvious. Her book, <em>We Are Anonymous: Inside the Hacker World of LulzSec, Anonymous, and the Global Cyber Insurgency</em>, published in America this June, offers a brilliant insight into the hacktivists' world. Almost by accident, Olson charted the emergence and domination of LulzSec, following the twists and turns of the story as it happened. \"And,\" she says, \"you could just see a lot of people talking about British things, British television shows, they were speaking with English spellings. You could tell they were British.\"</p> <p>Olson met Jake Davis before he reverted to Jake Davis \u2013 when he was still Topiary \u2013 in the Shetlands. \"It took a day and a half just to get there,\" she says. \"And it was embarrassing really. He was one of the most wanted hackers on the planet, and he just seemed so young.\"</p> <p>A year is a long time, though, when you're 18. I'd been expecting a socially awkward geek, but Davis turns out to be open-faced, chatty, good at eye contact and not geeky at all, though this may have something to do with the fact that he hasn't been allowed access to the internet for more than 12 months. He's pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer misuse under the Computer Misuse Act and is back in court in April next year. He's also waiting to see if he'll stand trial on another charge: conspiracy to commit fraud (the CPS is currently assessing whether a trial is in the public interest, given that he's already pleaded guilty to the first charge). He's currently at liberty on condition that he wears an electronic tag, is home by 10pm, and lives with his mum (who moved to Spalding shortly before his arrest).</p> <p>And that he goes nowhere near the internet. His only means of communicating with the outside world is a mobile phone that looks like it was a recent model circa 1995. And the greatest surprise \u2013 not just to me, but to him \u2013 is that he's barely missing the internet at all. \"I actually feel a lot better within myself. My life was the internet, pretty much. It was chatting on the internet and amassing groups of friends. And I had no life outside it. A year ago I would just be head-down kind of walking along, mumbling monosyllabically.\"</p> <p>It's that lack of contact with the outside world that has led Jake Davis to me. He helped Parmy Olson with her book, and he seems keen to have some form of communication with the outside world. Because communicating was both his speciality and what got him into this mess in the first place.</p> <p>\"Living in the Shetlands, I didn't understand the impact of what we were doing,\" he says. \"I didn't understand the impact on the real world. And now that I'm here in Spalding, and I've been a lot in London, I kind of see that the world does go round and it's not about hiding in a bedroom.\"</p> <p>What seems incredible, even now (and maybe, especially, to Jake), is how a slightly troubled teenager living on the two-sheep island of Yell, in the Shetland Isles \u2013 a place as isolated and remote as anywhere on Earth \u2013 came to find himself at the heart of a radical global political movement.</p> <p>But then, maybe that's the point. When I met Gabriella Coleman in Edinburgh she'd spent the previous evening meeting one of her contacts, who lived in a remote croft in the Scottish countryside. \"He cooked me pheasant,\" she said. Olson, too, found that a disproportionate number of contacts she met \"lived in out-of-the-way places\".</p> <p>For Jake, living in the Shetlands, the internet became his everything. It was where he made friends and socialised. \"It's where I learned almost everything I now know. The thing I miss the most is Wikipedia. I mean, at school I learned to knit. I'm actually a pretty good knitter now.\" Jake had a somewhat difficult childhood, and that (combined with the knitting lessons) led him to drop out of school at 13, shortly after his stepfather was killed in an accident.</p> <p>What's surprising, at first, is that he's not unhappy that he was caught, or that he faces the prospect of several years in prison. \"People say that prison is bad, but I lived in my bedroom with a computer for years. It's not going to be as bad as that. I just want to go and do my sentence and get my education in there. I want to get a really good education and just read loads of books.\"</p> <p>That's if he doesn't get extradited \u2013 because he's been charged in America, too, where his fellow hackers are facing up to 20 years inside. By contrast, in Ireland no charges have been brought against the arrested hackers. Anonymous may be an international phenomenon but there's no consensus (yet) on how to police the internet.</p> <p>What's immediately apparent about Jake Davis (and about a lot of the people involved with Anonymous) is just how bright and intelligent he is. And how the internet is where they find an outlet for their intellect \u2013 an outlet that somehow seems to have eluded them in real life. \"These weren't just normal individuals who found themselves in extraordinary circumstances,\" says Parmy Olson. \"They really were extraordinary individuals in extraordinary circumstances.\"</p> <p>What I find so interesting about Davis is how completely he seems to have been let down by the education system. It entirely failed to uncover or nurture his talents. \"I literally have not a single qualification to my name,\" he tells me at one point, and looks rather sheepish. Davis rose to prominence in Anonymous and then LulzSec not because he was some expert hacker \u2013 he wasn't; his technical skills were limited \u2013 but because he is a naturally gifted writer and communicator. Among other things, he controlled the LulzSec Twitter account, from which issued forth a stream of jokey pronouncements, the last of which had the feeling of prophecy to it: \"You cannot arrest an idea,\" he said. Which may be true, but almost exactly a month later a team of police officers burst into his living room, and then flew him by specially chartered plane to London, a place he'd never been to before. \"It was like going to the future or something,\" he says.</p> <p>You can't arrest an idea, though. And although Anonymous's impact may have been exaggerated (not least by itself), at its heart is a radical idea: that the internet can enable mass, participatory, possibly illegal action in a way the world has never seen before. Actions that can be controlled by neither governments nor international agencies, and which are decided by the horde, enacted by the horde, and policed by the horde.</p> <p>According to Parmy Olson, the \"hivemind\", or getting people to \"believe in the power\" of the hivemind, is probably Anonymous's greatest achievement. There is no central organisation (though there are organisers) and no official membership. In some ways it resembles that other recent un-organisation, al-Qaida. If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are Anonymous.</p> <p>And in 2008, it seemingly came out of nowhere. At the time, Gabriella Coleman was studying the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TuhOiwGzeg\" title=\"\">Open Source community</a> (the network of programmers who believe in, and develop, free software open to all) and was based at the University of Alberta, which happened to have the largest Scientology archive in the world. And she couldn't help but notice what happened when a video of Tom Cruise being interviewed about Scientology appeared on the internet. A group of online hackers began \"trolling\" (mocking; trying to get a rise out of) the Church of Scientology. For a lot of people, the video \u2013 meant for internal PR purposes only within the church \u2013 was provocation enough: Cruise appears as a genuine, bona fide, swivel-eyed religious nutcase. Then things escalated. The church began <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-10/mf_chanology?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">issuing legal threats</a> against the sites hosting the video, and it was this attempt to police the internet that prompted certain people to rise up and try to defend it.</p> <p>\"What I realised,\" says Coleman, \"is that the Church of Scientology was like the perfect nemesis. It was the geeks' worst nightmare, because it is a religion of science and technology, but the technology doesn't work and the science is pseudoscience. And it's an extremely proprietary religion: they have very aggressive control over trademarks and copyright, so in every way it seemed like the hackers saw how the church was like them, but their evil twin.\"</p> <p>And in doing so, they also realised that they possessed a hitherto unrealised power: strength in numbers. Instead of merely staging online protests, a day of global protest was organised. And on 10 February 2008, 7,000 people <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SraUpcJfqw\" title=\"\">showed up</a> in 127 cities around the world. They didn't know it then but a new political movement was born. \"We are Anonymous,\" read one of the flyers. \"We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.\"</p> <p>Talking to Coleman and Olson, I think I'm getting a handle on Anonymous, and what it is and what it has done. And then I start going into Anonymous chatrooms, on IRC (internet relay chat), on the so-called \"deep web\", a place unsearchable by Google. And I realise I don't understand a thing. People just seem to be talking about random crap in acronyms I don't understand. It's confusingly chaotic. There are people entering the room every five seconds, people leaving, people changing their nicknames. And then there's the slang. Everyone is a fag: there are newfags (newcomers) and oldfags (old-timers) and fagfags (homosexuals) and moralfags (those perceived as taking the moral high ground). I realise that I am a newsfag. But I can't spot the plans to conquer the universe between the casual misogynism and the Aids jokes.</p> <p>It's only on the reporter channel that I find people who can type in sentences and speak a language that I recognise as English. It's where self-selected Anons interact with the press and explain Anonymous's objectives. A 17-year-old called The_Poet, who tells me he's of Iranian parentage, says he became involved because of <a href=\"http://memeburn.com/2011/05/operation-iran-anonymous-does-not-forgive/\" title=\"\">Operation Iran</a> (or OpIran as it's known, Anonymous's campaign to help activists in Iran following the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009). He wanted to feel that he was doing something to help activists there. He's at school, he says, and he was about as computer-savvy as I am when he found the forum (ie, not very) but now he spends up to five or more hours a day on it. We chat away, and he tells me that having helped draft press releases and the like, and having become interested in world affairs, he's now considering diplomacy as a career. Though saying you're in Anonymous is possibly not the most obvious CV-building step, I venture.</p> <p>It's late when we chat, around 1am UK time, and it's obvious he's in Europe somewhere, and it's school the next day. \"Go to bed,\" I keep telling him. And I can't help but feel relieved when he tells me that he hasn't done anything illegal. Because via the encrypted chat protocol, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2002/aug/31/outwithaolin\" title=\"\">Jabber</a> (the first step to communicating with anyone in Anon world), I have chatted to another teenage Anon who was arrested, but never charged. He was lucky. \"I was immature and stupid and reckless,\" he says. \"I caused a lot of damage. Hurt a <em>lot</em> of innocent people. I put millions of people at risk of identity theft by leaking their passwords. It is never justified. Never.\"</p> <p>But you did it because\u2026?</p> <p>\"At the time, it seemed great fun.\"</p> <p>Because fun is the bedrock of it all. \"Trolling\". Agitating. Taking the piss. Lying to, manipulating and taking in fellow internet users. Making a joke of everything. Jake suspects it's why it's so big in Britain. \"Anon humour is quite dark and ironic and is pretty similiar to British humour,\" he says. The origin of \"lulz\" is a corruption of LOLs, meaning \"laugh out loud\" (and not \"lots of love\", as David Cameron thought when he put LOL at the end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/11/rebekah-brooks-david-cameron-texts-lol\" title=\"\">a text to Rebekah Brooks</a>).</p> <p>It's all about the lulz. On 4chan, the \"image board\" (like a chat board, but where people came initially to share images, and whose /b/ \u2013 or \"random\" \u2013 board spawned the idea of Anonymous), anything goes. Just so long as it's not taken seriously. In fact, 4chan is the originator of hundreds of internet memes and viral videos, many of which have found their way into mainstream media.</p> <p>It's easy to grow paranoid researching an article on Anonymous. Some terrible things have happened to people who have tangled with them. LulzSec's first collective action was against Aaron Barr, the CEO of an internet security firm, HBGary Inc, who claimed to have penetrated Anonymous and worked out who the central players were. To cut a long story short, he hadn't. LulzSec cracked his email password, downloaded 40,000 of his emails and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/writer/parmy_olson/\" title=\"\">released them</a> in a torrent online for anyone to read.</p> <p>Soon after I start hanging out in Anonymous chatrooms, my computer starts running slowly. My phone starts glitching. I start waking in the night with paranoid dreams. Quinn Norton, a reporter for <em>Wired</em> magazine, tells me that there is a strong culture within the group of not attacking the press. Even so, she suspects there may be a \"cache of [my] documents somewhere, but they're not doing anything bad with them\". The main thing to bear in mind if writing about them, she says, is \"not to be an asshole\".</p> <p>I tell Jake about my paranoia. \"I had that every day,\" he says. \"Every morning I spent an hour doing searches and running certain scripts to make me feel better.\" But in his case, at least, it comes down to the old truism that just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean that there isn't someone following you.</p> <p>When Sabu, the Anonymous turncoat, was intercepted by the FBI, he disappeared offline for 24 hours, and when he came back his story didn't quite hang together. \"I was completely suspicious of him,\" says Jake. \"I was just too stupid to do anything about it. The idea that there was a group of Feds out to get me is the kind of stuff that happens in films. And I'm from the Shetland Islands. The FBI aren't going to be using one of my friends to spy on me. That happens in American action films, it is not real life. And it turns out that this is exactly what happened.\"</p> <p>It was even stranger in some ways for Gabriella Coleman. She met Sabu in New York before any of the arrests, and immediately became suspicious of his status and motives. \"I just knew,\" she says. \"There was no way while he was still the world's most wanted hacker that he'd be wanting to meet me unless he'd been arrested. I knew he'd been arrested. But of course, I couldn't tell anyone. And that was really hard.\"</p> <p>As an anthropologist studying Anonymous, at times, she says, she felt like a cross between \"a detective and a priest\". She watched the group take shape from the time of the Scientology uprising, and was online, in the chatrooms, at the moment it hit the big time: WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Julian Assange had just released the US <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-us-embassy-cables\" title=\"\">diplomatic cables</a>, PayPal had announced that it would no longer accept donations on Wikileaks' behalf, and the internet was in uproar. \"There were 7,000 people a time logging into the channels [chat rooms] when, usually, at the very most there would be 1,000,\" says Coleman. \"More than 35,000 people downloaded the software.\"</p> <p>\"The software\" was something called low orbit ion cannon (LOIC), and it meant that anyone with a few clicks of a mouse could become a \"hacker\", or at least a website attacker. Computers all over the world started sending packets of information to the PayPal and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/08/operation-payback-mastercard-website-wikileaks\" title=\"\">Visa</a> websites, flooding its servers with a DDoS attack (distributed denial of service). In her book, Parmy Olson explains what actually happened. The PayPal and Visa websites were attacked successfully, but the main perpetrators weren't the \"hive\": the real firepower came from a couple of individuals with \"botnets\", illegal networks of compromised computers. Olson suggests the hive was a PR myth.</p> <p>Still, it's a dangerous PR myth. A few months after the attacks, the FBI began to arrest people: people who had been drawn into Anonymous by the rhetoric, and either didn't realise that what they were doing was illegal, didn't have enough technical nous to cover their tracks, or simply didn't care. There were students, middle-class professionals\u2026 Anonymous wasn't just \"the stereotypical kids living in their mum's basement\", as Coleman puts it. \"You'll probably find at least a couple in your IT department.\"</p> <p>But when you look, for example, at the stunning visual nature of some of Anonymous's designs, that shouldn't come as too great a shock. Nor the brilliance of its operations in <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/01/26/egypt-versus-the-internet-anonymous-hackers-launch-ddos-attack/\" title=\"\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/01/03/pro-wikileaks-hackers-tunisian-government-websites/\" title=\"\">Tunisia</a>, and recently in <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/327979\" title=\"\">Syria</a>. At its most powerful and compelling, it has leaped to the defence of the internet itself. It was only when Anonymous started highlighting what was happening in Tunisia, for example, after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/17/arab-governments-silenced-wikileaks\" title=\"\">government banned Wikileaks</a> in late 2010, that the rest of the world's press started paying attention to what became the Arab spring.</p> <p>It is \"political art as spectacle\", according to Coleman. And it stands in opposition to almost everything mainstream society holds dear. Individual fame is neither sought nor welcomed. Anons who draw attention to themselves or claim to speak for Anonymous are ostracised. \"It's almost like the polar opposite of everything that social media stands for,\" says Coleman. \"They dramatise the importance of anonymity and privacy in an era when both are rapidly eroding. They are the anti-Facebook.\"</p> <p>Being anonymous was the source of Jake's power: no one knew he was a kid. That, and the idea of the hive. \"Everyone secretly knows that everyone else [in Anonymous] is kind of a lonely, geeky guy,\" says Jake. \"But we all ignore it, and we all play this Anon game where we are all these invincible Anons.\"</p> <p>And they were mostly guys. Anonymous is very male. In the <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rules-of-the-internet\" title=\"\">Rules of the Internet</a>, which came out of the 4chan site, Rule 30 states \"there are no girls on the internet\". The previous rule states that \"all girls are men and all kids are undercover FBI agents\", which contains a grain of truth.</p> <p>At times it seems like Anonymous is a nest of slightly naive teenagers who are going to get into trouble. Teenagers have always acted out. Now they get to act out on a global stage, where just a few clicks of a mouse could lead to them spending the next 20 years behind bars. It's impossible to generalise, however. One figure behind one of the most popular Anonymous Twitter feeds told Coleman that he is a \"member of the 1 per cent\". \"He's always in Paris on vacation,\" she tells me. \"He's a very, very wealthy engineer and he's extremely careful in concealing his identity.\"</p> <p>And on the #reporter channel, I chat for a while to an Anon called \"nsh\", who tells me that what we're witnessing is \"the emergence of a new kind of identity, and with it a new form of identity politics. Traditional politics caters to fixed demographics, requires that participants have continuity of identity, can be located in geography. These are things that can be dispensed [with] online, and have been, with great effect.\"</p> <p>He's a bit fond of his long words, nsh, and he likes his historical analogies. The random attacks on websites are really the contemporary version of writing a political slogan on a wall, he says. It's like online vandalism. \"But the Vandals,\" he writes, \"got the short stick, historically, didn't they?\" He won't tell me anything about himself, but my guess is he's British and studying at one of our better universities. It's probably not a coincidence that both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/29/assange-supporters-claim-hacked-cambridge\" title=\"\">Cambridge</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/oxford-university-security-anonymous-hack-90815\" title=\"\">Oxford</a> universities have been targeted in the past two weeks, as part of Anonymous's ongoing Operation Free Assange. If you're going to spray-paint a wall, you might as well do it somewhere your mates will see it. I like joshing with nsh, but I do feel the generational difference. When he makes a joke, he signals it with an emoticon. When I make a joke, he says \"lol\". I have to say, \"Ha, ha!\" because otherwise, I tell him, \"I'll sound like Ali G. It'd be embarrassing. Like hearing your gran try to rap.\"</p> <p>There is \"no clear-cut moral assessment\" of Anonymous that can be made, says Gabriella Coleman. \"But if you hurt the internet, be careful, because the internet may well hurt you back.\"</p> <p>In Spalding, Jake Davis can make even less sense of it, even though, for a time, he was it. His lawyers have made him read<strong> </strong>hundreds of pages of his chat logs as part of his case. \"And I just think 'Who is this Topiary guy?'\" he says. \"He is just full of crap. We tried to do something funny, something political, something ideological, and it ended up just being a mess.\"</p> <p>I'm possibly more confused about Anonymous now than when I started researching this article. When I look at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17544311\" title=\"\">pastebin.com</a>, which is where hackers put up the latest data dumps, the results of their latest hacking and defacement operations, the targets seem random, perverse.</p> <p>\"Cadwal, there is always mad shit going on in Anonymous,\" an Anon called KnowledgeUS tells me. \"It is even hard for an Anon to know all that's going on with Anonymous.\"</p> <p>It makes me feel a little better. \"Ha, ha!\" I say. Because Anonymous is something that belongs to a new generation. It's their internet. Their Anonymous. And at my age, I'm just too old for the lulz.</p> <p><em>This piece was edited on 2/10/12 to clarify a contributor's quote</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Dear Owen</strong></p> <p>Welcome to your new job as secretary of state for the environment. I predict an interesting spell in office \u2013 for you certainly come with unusual credentials. You have virtually no record of making environmental pronouncements of any consequence or for showing concerns about ecological or climatic issues. You say you loathe wind turbines, a source of renewable energy on which Britain was supposed to be becoming reliant, while it is also said that you are a proponent of fracking, the extraction of shale gas, a process that would cause major increases in UK carbon emissions.</p> <p>For good measure you arrive at your new post with the strong endorsement of Britain's chief climate change denier, Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor who now believes his legacy of laissez-faire economics is being undermined by unnecessary curbs to carbon emissions and who has committed himself to the obstruction of such reforms.</p> <p>It is quite a CV, and you can appreciate why those concerned with scientific issues might be worried. Apart from your own dubious record, several other individuals given cabinet posts last week have also voiced startling, unorthodox views.</p> <p>The new transport minister, Patrick McLoughlin, has revealed he has a morbid fear of flying, for example, while the new health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, turns out to be a supporter of homeopathy, a widely discredited, ineffective form of treatment derided by the medical establishment. Putting such individuals in office is the equivalent of putting <em>Twilight</em>'s Cullen clan of vampires in charge of a blood bank. Certainly the chance of rational, evidence-based debate in cabinet looks a remote prospect these days.</p> <p>Hence my letter to you, Mr Paterson. In taking charge of UK environmental affairs, you have been handed a task that has never been more important. It needs to be directed with pressing urgency: ice sheets are melting, sea levels rising and farmland is turning to desert across the globe as temperatures rise.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of people are destined to lose their homes in the next few decades unless we take action now. Britain, which gave birth to the industrial revolution and which became the first country to pump significant excesses of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, has a special responsibility to the world. If nothing else, we need to set an example and end our reliance on the burning of fossil fuels to generate power.</p> <p>And that is what worries me about your appointment. By all accounts you are a charming, pro-foxhunting, country gentleman who has an intense love of his North Shropshire constituency but who has yet to demonstrate any recognition of the global nature of the environmental crisis we face (though I acknowledge your 2010 green paper on fisheries management reveals an appreciation of the current crises affecting the oceans). Humanity is now going through the latter stages of an experiment far greater than the hunt for the Higgs boson or the decoding of the human genome. As we pump more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, thereby melting ice caps, destroying precious ecosystems and eradicating species in their thousands, we are creating a future for ourselves that becomes less and less certain and more and more hostile.</p> <p>Now it is true that Britain may avoid some of the very worst direct impacts of this grand experiment when \u2013 later this century \u2013 global average temperatures rise by at least 3C to 6C, but we will not escape the secondary consequences. As central Europe and much of Asia scorches, millions of starving people will reach our shores. Our country will be turned into a military outpost dedicated to keeping them out, a point recently raised by Professor Stephen Emmott, who has observed that senior army officers have recently become a common sight at climate conferences. If nothing else, this suggests that the military sees the dangers we face, even if politicians like you do not.</p> <p>In short, you need to see the big picture. My fear is that you were picked because that is the last thing you do. Your appointment is part of George Osborne's bid to bring short-term boosts to the economy at the expense of long-term environmental gain and in the face of opposition from government climate advisers. Let us bring back fossil fuels, in particular gas, as our main power source and curtail renewable energy sources, argues the chancellor, who has succeeded in persuading the prime minister to pack the cabinet with environmental sceptics, utterly undermining David Cameron's declared hope his government would be the greenest ever seen in Britain.</p> <p>I hope you have the courage to confound those expectations and to realise that we face a catastrophic future if we do not halt our dependence on fossil fuels. Fracking is not an answer to our problems, nor is the new dash for gas, backed by Osborne. The latter would leave us dependent on natural gas producers such as Qatar and at the mercy of major price rises that would be introduced in later years.</p> <p>By contrast, creating an indigenous renewable power industry in Britain \u2013 for wind, wave and tidal turbines \u2013 will give us energy independence and wean us off our fossil fuel habits. That is the longer-term, bigger picture. I hope you see it, but I doubt you do.</p> <p>My unease is only deepened by the knowledge that you are the brother-in-law of the environmental sceptic Matt Ridley, whose stewardship at Northern Rock saw the first run on a British bank for 150 years but who has never tired of telling us that climatewise we have nothing to fear.</p> <p>Nor have your actions since taking office done anything to soothe jangled nerves. Pressed last week by journalists to deny or admit you are a climate change sceptic, you hid behind a feeble Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs press release that merely acknowledged that you were responsible for exploring issues such as climate change.</p> <p>It was an unimpressive start. I would like to think that things can only get better. Given a pause for reflection about the wider issues, that could happen. I hope you do get the bigger picture. If you do not, then the nation will have wasted further precious time when it could be taking decisive action to counter climate change. And time is a commodity that is already in dangerously short supply.</p> <p><strong>Yours, Robin</strong></p>",
  "<p>George Osborne's attempt to backtrack on green policies by supporting a new \"dash for gas\" ran into trouble after the incoming head of the government's climate change committee said future economic growth would be impossible without more renewable energy.</p> <p>The comments from John Gummer, who has been chosen to chair the independent climate change committee, came amid growing signs that the chancellor is leading a headlong government retreat from David Cameron's much-vaunted commitment to lead \"the greenest government ever\".</p> <p>Suspicions were raised last week that the prime minister had accepted the need to downgrade green policies, which many Tory MPs see as too expensive in a recession, when he promoted climate sceptics in his reshuffle. He switched Owen Paterson, who has made clear that he is opposed to windfarms, to environment secretary, and made another green sceptic, John Hayes, energy minister.</p> <p>Speaking to the <em>Observer</em> days before taking up his appointment at the head of a committee that includes many of the country's top climate scientists, Gummer (now Lord Deben) said he was convinced that current government policy, which backs the increased use of renewable energy was the only way forward.</p> <p>\"I think there can be no growth unless there is green growth,\" he said, stressing that population growth would put increasing pressure on finite resources such as gas, while renewable energy was a natural limitless resource. \"If we want to grow in this world, we can only grow in a green way,\" said Gummer, a Tory environment secretary in the 1990s.</p> <p>\"We led the way with the Climate Change Act. The current government started on its route with the Green Deal and other things. But let us not kid ourselves. Round the world other countries are seeing that this is the only future. The Chinese are moving fast. Even countries like South Africa, South Korea and Australia are doing so.\"</p> <p>While he would not be drawn into criticising individual ministers, he said anyone who believed gas would remain cheap was making a dangerous mistake. \"You have actually got to go for renewables,\" he said. \"The facts are absolutely clear. We have to go down the line we said we would, and we have to do it at the speed we said, because this is the most cost-effective speed.</p> <p>\"You don't need to believe in climate change to want to do all these things. All you need to realise is the fact that soon we are going to be 9 billion people. Our resources are going to be constrained.\"</p> <p>Osborne's support for a new dash for gas was revealed in a letter he wrote to Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary, in July at a time when many Tory MPs were unhappy about the level of government subsidies for wind farms. The chancellor targeted a figure of \u00a3500m he wanted to see cut from the government's support for the generation of power from new renewable sources by 2014. Instead he backed a new generation of gas power stations, fuelled by supplies from the Middle East, saying these would provide electricity more efficiently.</p> <p>\"We need a statement which gives a clear, strong signal that we regard unabated gas as able to play a core part of our electricity generation to at least 2030 \u2013 not just providing backup for wind plant or peaking capacity,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"This will provide context for the gas strategy and will help reassure investors, enabling investment in new gas power stations and the infrastructure that supports them such as pipelines between Norway and the UK which could enable us to become a gas hub.</p> <p>\"We should commit publicly to ensuring that British consumers will be able to get the benefits if the price of gas falls.\"</p> <p>However, the prospects of gas prices falling are questioned by many politicians who argue that prices are more likely to rise as developing nations such as India and China build their own energy plants and seek gas to burn in them. A sellers' market will evolve, they argue, one that will benefit suppliers such as Qatar but which could leave Britain seriously exposed to rising gas prices.</p> <p>\"Gas has a role to play in energy generation in the UK, but its unabated use cannot be the main part of our energy policy,\" said Tim Yeo, the Tory MP who chairs the Commons select committee on energy and climate change. \"That is something that our committee would completely reject.\"</p> <p>Similarly David Kennedy, chief executive of the climate change committee, which advises the government on global warming and other issues, told BBC News: \"This would all lead to a second dash for gas. This would be incompatible with the government's climate change goals.\"</p> <p>Reliance on gas would also leave the UK dependent on foreign imports to run the nation's power stations and mean that the renewable energy industry, including wave and tidal generation, would contribute less to the economy as demand fell, it has been argued. Similarly work on carbon capture and storage \u2013 which would take carbon emissions and bury them in underground stores \u2013 would be halted.</p> <p>Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Tory party was guilty of a great betrayal on the environment. He said: \"Promising to care about the environment was once supposed to symbolise how the Tory party had changed. Betraying those promises now symbolises how the Tory party has not changed.</p> <p>\"We need new thinking and new green industries if we are to protect our environment. There is no contradiction between having that and a growing economy \u2013 it is in fact one of the best ways of getting growth back into our economy.\"</p> <p>Greenpeace's senior political adviser, Joss Garman, said: \"This looks like a headlong rush towards the sort of toxic, nasty party politics that David Cameron said was history when he told voters to go green, vote blue.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney took their respective blueprints for America to key electoral battlegrounds Saturday with polls suggesting that the White House race remains neck-and-neck.</p> <p>\"I'm fired up. I'm ready to go forward,\" the president told supporters in Florida, just days after he gave a solid speech to delegates in North Carolina \u2013 but one that failed to deliver a clear polling bounce to elevate him above his Republican challenger.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney attempted to capitalise on a Democratic party spat over the wording of its policy platform at the Charlotte meet during his turn on the stump.</p> <p>Referring to a self-inflicted wound caused by the original dropping of any mention to \"God\" in the document, Romney said: \"I will not take God out of the name of our platform. I will not take God off our coins and I will not take God out of my heart.\"</p> <p>The stump speech, delivered in the bible-belt state of Virginia, received cheers, and chants of \"U-S-A, U-S-A\".</p> <p>Warming to the patriotic theme, Romney went on to promise to maintain spending on defence so that the US army was so powerful no other nation would \"dare test it\".</p> <p>In Florida, Obama lambasted the Republican party for not coming up with anything other than \"the same prescription they have had for 30 years\".</p> <p>He summed Romney's platform up as: \"Tax cuts, tax cuts: gut a few regulations, some more tax cuts.\"</p> <p>To growing laughter from supporters, the president continued: \"Tax cuts when times are good, tax cuts when times are bad. Tax cuts to help you lose a few extra pounds, tax cuts to help your love life.\"</p> <p>Both men will be hoping that by hammering their key messages home in battleground states, they may open up a discernible lead \u2013 something both men have failed to do so far in the race.</p> <p>In the latest rash of polls to come out after the Democrats wrapped up a mainly well-reviewed convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama appears to have earned a small \"bounce\".</p> <p>But the lead it gives him is razor-thin. The Rasmussen tracking poll puts him two points ahead of Romney, while a Gallup tracking poll has the Democrat three points up.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, Obama's lead was just one or two points, and a CNN poll had the race in a dead heat.</p> <p>However, those polls are national surveys, and most experts believe that the election will be decided in about nine \"battleground\" states where narrow margins and swing voters are the focus of intense attention.</p> <p>Already, those states have been subject to a barrage of political adverts, and the picture there has generally been more positive for Obama as he usually holds leads in key states like Ohio, Iowa and Florida.</p> <p>The influential political blogger Nate Silver, who tracks polls for the New York Times, currently predicts Obama to have a 78% chance of winning the election, based on his ability to win votes in those vital areas.</p> <p>However, there is little likelihood that the Obama campaign is going to rest easy, despite a convention season which failed to produce any breakthrough for Romney.</p> <p>Just a day after the Charlotte gathering dispersed, the latest monthly US job figures were released, revealing an American economy still failing to produce many jobs.</p> <p>The survey showed that just 96,000 jobs had been created in August, and revised down numbers for previous months.</p> <p>It showed the jobless rate dipped from 8.3% to 8.1%, but that was partly due to many job seekers simply dropping out of the market and giving up the hunt for employment.</p> <p>Economic matters lie at the heart of the campaign, and Romney has placed criticism of Obama for failing to adequately reduce unemployment at the centre of his strategy.</p> <p>Romney called the data a \"hangover\" after Charlotte.</p> <p>\"I don't think the American people want four more years of the last four years. I think they want to see more jobs, they want to see their kids coming out of college able to get jobs, they want to see rising incomes again,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>With the race as close as it is, both candidates are now likely to spend little time outside the battleground states in the remaining eight weeks of the campaign.</p>",
  "<h2>THE LEGACY <br>COLIN MOYNIHAN </h2> <p>The promise to deliver a genuine and lasting sports legacy is just as important as the successful hosting of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The extraordinary public enthusiasm and momentum has created an unprecedented opportunity to fulfil that promise beyond all expectations \u2013 if it can be harnessed effectively. But there is no magic bullet. We need a strategic approach that addresses the following five priorities.</p> <p>Physical education has a vital role to play in the school curriculum. The root to encouraging young people to participate in sport lies in the quality of the teaching they receive at the beginning of their school lives. If Ofsted inspected and reported both on curriculum-time physical education and on \"out of hours\" sport, this would ensure that school leaders treated physical education as a core subject.</p> <p>There should be a central role for sport in policy-making. It would make sense to bring the minister for sport to occupy a central co-ordinating role.</p> <p>Improve coaching. You cannot deliver a gold-medal athlete without a gold-medal coach. We need many, many more coaches at all levels.</p> <p>Stem the flow of local authority closures. There should be a statutory requirement to ensure adequate local government provision of facilities for community sport and recreation, backed by a planning policy to support the retention of playing fields. &#xa0;</p> <p>Restructure delivery mechanisms in government. Empowering governing bodies, clubs, communities, the enthusiasm and willingness of volunteers and families with the lightest of touches from Whitehall is the way forward and the basis for ensuring that today's national Olympic inspiration is permanently converted to tomorrow's lasting nationwide participation.</p> <p><em>Lord Moynihan is outgoing chairman of the British Olympic Association</em></p> <h2>MULTICULTURALISM <br>JACKIE KAY<br></h2> <p>Mo Farah may have changed my opinion of the Union flag: when it was draped round his shoulders I was shocked by how attractive it looked. I noticed the stunning design as if for the first time. It's not the flag's fault, the way it has frightened me for years. Well, it seems the tide of the river of blood may be turning. Farah's got the flag back.</p> <p>That Hurrah Farah photograph will become one of the iconic images of Britishness. In the world of sport, at least, Britain is positively Whitmanesque, confidently asserting: \"We are large, we contain multitudes.\"</p> <p>Sheffield's own Jessica Ennis running through the finishing line changed the colour of the finish on what is British. We have much to learn from the world of sport. In that multi-coloured world black is surely beautiful and there is no questioning who belongs. (Which is just as well; imagine the diminishing golds!)</p> <p>Will it reduce the number of innocent black guys who get stopped by the police? Was the sight of Doreen Lawrence bearing the flag into the stadium healing? Will that prevent the racist murders of the future? Dream on. But wouldn't you like to think so? It seems we have lived through an almost utopian summer. I know, though, that the world of sport is far ahead; how long will it take the rest of society to catch up? Winter comes suddenly and all too quickly the nights draw in.</p> <p><em>Jackie Kay is a writer born to a Scottish mother and Nigerian father who was adopted by a white Scottish couple </em></p> <h2>CULTURE <br>LUCY PREBBLE<br></h2> <p>The arts will always envy sport its simplicity and objectivity. Art, in turn, has lent sport our love of character and narrative, making it more than a set of results on a board, from Bolt's awesome heroics to Martine Wright's journey as 7/7 survivor and Paralympic athlete.</p> <p>In these Games, youth reclaimed its rightful place as a force of creativity and change. No more were the young just the destroyers of shop fronts and challengers to ever-rising house prices. In joy-filled motion in the Olympic stadium the young were reinstated as those who have always made the best records. They then went on to break some too.</p> <p>Art has had its place in defining our Britishness alongside the sport. From the brilliant <em>Twenty Twelve</em> to Boyle's glorious showmanship, we remembered that we can both love something and mock it. This British peculiarity is something of which we should be proud. It brought us the excellent <em>The Last Leg</em> on Channel 4, finding the comedy in the Paralympics, and allowed Rowan Atkinson to affectionately joke to Vangelis's music without disrespect.</p> <p>If this creaking, powdered government takes anything from these Games, other than the credit, I hope it is the idea that work is not defined by money and power but by effort and love. Anything built from these things, from sport to art, is the cause and effect of our being. In the Games, as in art, we are not watching something other, but glimpsing our true selves hurling, racing, flying through the air; humanity in motion.</p> <p><em>Lucy Prebble is a playwright whose works include of The Sugar Syndrome and Enron. Her new play, The Effect, opens in November </em></p> <h2>HOW TO BUILD SUCCESS <br>WILL HUTTON </h2> <p>For decades, Britain has been starved of success. Instead, it has been a long pattern of underachievement, retreat and decline. The credit booms that defined the Thatcher and Blair years, bringing apparent economic success, felt ephemeral and built on sand. So it proved.</p> <p>The Olympic and Paralympic Games allowed the British to be proud and patriotic again. To be in the top three in both medal league tables is unambiguous success. The excellence of the sporting infrastructure showed that Britain can be a world leader. Failure can be challenged.</p> <p>The lesson is a vast reproach to our dominant centre-right political and media culture, unerringly wrong on almost everything \u2013 whether economics, Europe or the predicted failure of the Games. Public investment, picking and coaching winners and a sense of patriotic purpose combined to deliver an astonishing success.</p> <p>The Olympic Park was built on time, with an eye to its legacy impact and within budget. The spillover effects have been enormous. Money has been carefully channelled to sports organisations to develop their athletes. All the common sense of the last 30 years that Britain cannot pull off grand projects has been challenged. The result has been stunning.</p> <p><em>Will Hutton is an Observer columnist, economist and author</em></p> <h2>VOLUNTEERING <br>MAURICE GLASMAN </h2> <p>One of the least acknowledged facts about London 2012 is that it was the first living wage Olympics. When it came to the cooks, cleaners, security guards and shop workers, there was 98% compliance throughout the building of the stadiums and then during the Games. This is a tremendous success for London citizens. This was a genuinely ethical Games.</p> <p>The spirit of that spread. Workers were paid properly and honoured in the opening ceremony, which meant that the volunteers were not there to replace workers but to add to the sense of civil virtue.</p> <p>Participating in an event that was ethical, that was based on hospitality, honesty and civility, tempered the threat of corporate domination. Ordinary people were moved to give of their time in helping people with directions, welcoming them. It gave a meaning to the \"big society\" that the government has been incapable of grasping.</p> <p>Then there was the recognition of excellence. The sight of a craft being improved \u2013 in this case track and field craft \u2013 and of a tradition of excellence that was constantly renewing itself indicates how far we have to go in honouring and developing a sense of vocation in the economy.</p> <p>When negotiating the legacy, it is important to recognise that the vocational college for local people and the commitment to local employment was not honoured. There is also the issue of land and housing and the Community Land Trust for local housing that is yet to be finalised.</p> <p>It was the combination of living wage, civic engagement and craft excellence that gave a real meaning to the patriotism that rightly clings to London and these Games. The important thing is to ensure the institutional legacy in terms of vocation, housing, wages and civic pride are sustained as the enduring meaning of London 2012.</p> <p><em>Lord Glasman of Stoke Newington is a Labour peer </em></p> <h2>BRAND BRITAIN <br>GRAHAM HALES </h2> <p>The Olympics certainly helped to brand Britain. The opening ceremony really helped to capture that British eccentricity that is difficult to explain, but is one of the most interesting things about us. Speaking to international business people over the past few weeks, it's clear that it has changed people's views.</p> <p>My beef is that Britain has great creative industries and a great financial services sector and they don't always trust each other, but the opening ceremony showed we're at our best when we combine left brain and right brain.</p> <p>It has created huge expectations \u2013 it's as if we grew up a little. The closing ceremony was going really well until the handover to Rio, which just seemed so predictable: it's as if samba dancing just won't do it for us any more. Britain still has as many problems as there were before, but it's as though the grey clouds have parted \u2013 and it's our job to keep them parted.</p> <p><em>Graham Hales is UK boss of the global branding agency Interbrand</em></p> <h2>DISABILITY <br>HANNAH COCKROFT</h2> <p>I can already see a change in people's attitudes towards disabled people. We have a young team \u2013 the average age is 20. I hope young people see us and see that they can do something in life, even if they're disabled. People are starting to accept us for who we are. Which is cool. It's what the Paralympics is all about.</p> <p>The fact that we've filled stadiums every night is the biggest show of acceptance. That's never been done before. It's like people went: \"You are athletes. You do work hard. We'll come and watch you.\" We've stepped out of the Olympics shadow.</p> <p>It's, like, make the most of it because it's never going to happen again. There's never going to be 80,000 \u2013 or 70,000 because not everyone comes to support us \u2013 people just there, supporting us. I hope the Games have inspired a lot more people to join the sport.</p> <p><em>Hannah Cockroft, a wheelchair sprinter, is a BT ambassador</em> </p> <h2>THE EAST END <br>ROBIN WALES </h2> <p>London 2012 exceeded expectations. It wasn't just GB's outstanding medal haul; there was genuine warmth as we welcomed the world. Newham's volunteers took to the streets to inform and guide the athletes, officials and fans, while our residents, in the most multicultural place in the world for its size, embraced the Games. More than 270,000 people welcomed the Olympic torch and Paralympic flame into Stratford. Every Newham school sent children to experience the Games and more than 1,000 people, including 230 children, took part in the ceremonies.</p> <p>The Games' legacy will be measured against the promises in London's original bid. First, to inspire a generation. In 2005, children from Newham travelled to Singapore with Tony Blair and Seb Coe to help win the bid. We want future generations to take part in sport. We have ensured massive expansion of local sports clubs and with the University of East London will give every child the chance to try 20 sports to find the perfect fit.</p> <p>Second, to transform the East End. Employment is the key as Newham needs 20,000 more people in work just to match the London average. Workplace, our jobs brokerage service, helped 5,000 people into jobs this year.</p> <p>We've made a strong start but against a backdrop of savage government cuts to London's host boroughs, securing the legacy of London 2012 will remain a challenge for generations.</p> <p><em>Sir Robin Wales is the Labour mayor of Newham</em></p> <h2>LEADERSHIP <br>PHILIP GREEN </h2> <p>You have to say \"bravo\" to all those who delivered this great experience. And there are lessons to be learned from the Olympics, not least the advantages of a positive attitude and getting the right people in place doing the right job.</p> <p>Starting with the opening ceremony, Danny Boyle and his team showed what can be achieved when creative people who know their audience put on a great show. Similarly with Lord Coe and his team. Coe was someone who had competed himself. He knew what athletes needed and he gave it to them with an acute sense of detail.</p> <p>But first we really need to step back and scrutinise exactly how all the buildings were put up, visitors accommodated and thousands of media people dealt with. You need to study all the planning, how people on the ground were selected, what size of teams were used and how they worked with each other. It is hard to say which industries could immediately benefit from a fresh approach but clearly one is tourism. We need to remove the queuing at the airport and give visitors the kind of warm welcome given by the Olympic volunteers. Happy tourists might be likely to go shopping too.</p> <p>But if there is a lesson for UK plc, it's that you need people in top positions who wake up in the morning and love what they do. We need that positive attitude and to be excited about the future.</p> <p><em>Sir Philip Green is owner of Topshop and Bhs</em></p> <h2>'CAN-DO' SPIRIT <br>SAM RODDICK </h2> <p>Before it started I was a Debbie Downer about the whole thing. I even wanted to leave the country. This was until my friend, who was volunteering, invited me to the technical rehearsal for the opening ceremony and I was blown away. Danny Boyle touched on the issues that make England a truly great country, such as the NHS, CND and the suffragettes, and I was overwhelmed when he even celebrated homosexuality with a lesbian kiss. I was proud to be British for the first time in my life and I think this will have a lasting effect. Shockingly, I also became a royalist; I believe the ceremony did more for the royal family than the jubilee.</p> <p>I have an active dislike for sport but the Paralympics has changed that. It is inspirational. Above all, I found the volunteers around London so moving, they were always kind and enthusiastic. They gave us an insight into how England rose to the occasion and this strong sense of generosity provided an opportunity to see that part of who we are. From an emotional perspective, it has done a lot for London.</p> <p><em>Sam Roddick is a feminist activist</em></p>",

  "<p>If the Obama campaign hopes the Democratic convention will renew America's love affair with the president, Dinesh D'Souza has some unwelcome news: his film attacking Obama will reach more than 2,000 cinemas this weekend, putting it on track to be the second most successful documentary of all time.</p> <p>\"The product is selling because people sense there is real information here,\" D'Souza told the Guardian. \"Not allegations, not assertions, but real information that is valuable in assessing the future of the country.\"</p> <p>Democrats leaving Charlotte on Friday fired up for the November 6 election would choke on that claim, and try to dismiss D'Souza as a crank. The trouble is, his film, 2016: Obama's America, is spreading across ever more cinema screens and proving a remarkable box office hit.</p> <p>While party faithful hailed Obama's nomination acceptance speech as an outline for a progressive second term, D'Souza called it part of a covert strategy. \"It's a smoke-and-mirrors performance, because the bottom line is that Obama has a completely different agenda to what he's letting on.\"</p> <p>The president, he said, was pretending to be a tax-cutter and friend of the middle classes and Israel. \"Obama has an ideology that wants to downsize America \u2026 He subscribes to the belief that in terms of wealth and power it would be good for America to have less, and for the rest of the world to have more.\"</p> <p>The president, he said, had duped his own party into thinking he wished to redistribute wealth domestically, when his real goal was redistributing it globally by exporting jobs and wealth. \"He can't afford to let that cat so far out of the bag. He can't afford to come across as the global guy that he obviously is. He wants to pretend to be an all-American guy.\"</p> <p>Democrats who rolled their eyes when D'Souza's film first came out have been stunned by its success. From just a few hundred screens a few weeks ago it jumped to 1,750 last week and is now at more than 2,000. It has earned about $22m, and is set to overtake Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, coming second only to Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 as the highest-grossing documentary ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395844852\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/7/1347056247562/A-promotional-poster-is-s-004.jpg\" alt=\"A promotional poster is seen at the Rave\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2016: Obama's America.

I think he thinks there is a limited supply of energy in the world and that America and the west use too much \u2026 others need to have more, otherwise how can they grow?</p> <p>\"Similarly, I think he thinks America has been lording it over the Middle East, and that it's better for America to have a smaller footprint, because it's been stepping on the world.\"</p> <p>That is news to critics on the left who say Obama's occasionally pluralist rhetoric is a sham for continued hawkish foreign policy, such as ramping up the war in Afghanistan and raining drone strikes on terrorist targets in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.</p> <p>D'Souza sees it completely differently: Obama believes America is part of the global 1%, and wants to share its wealth and power with \"hungry, circling nations\".</p> <p>It was easy to conceal this agenda in 2008 before Obama took office. \"Now, after four years, he can't come across as the unknown man. He has to actually camouflage what he has done and claim the opposite.\"</p> <p>Thus, the killing of Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders masked a cossetting of other jihadis whom the president secretly regarded as freedom fighters, he says. \"Obama is weirdly and almost unacceptably solicitous towards those guys,\" D'Souza said, adding that White House rhetoric on winning Afghanistan was hollow.</p> <p>\"Obama seems to have reconciled himself to at least a partial Taliban takeover. In other words: an American defeat.\"</p> <p>Obama, said D'Souza, had turned his back on Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's fallen dictator and US ally, as well as opposition movements in Syria and Iran, while letting Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood take power \u2013 in a democratic election \u2013 and project its influence across the Middle East.</p> <p>\"America's position in the world can hardly be seen as stronger, except in some delusional mode as a result of what Obama has done. America has lost its strong hand in the Middle East.</p> <p>\"And if Saudi Arabia falls during Obama's second term, then we can see the restoration of Islam as a global power. Which we haven't seen in 200 years.\"</p> <p>D'Souza interpreted Obama's remark to the Russian leader Dimitri Medvedev that he would have more flexibility in a second term as admission of a hidden agenda. \"We'll see an even more radical Obama, because he won't be tethered to public opinion as much.\"</p> <p>Left-wing Democrats shared the president's belief that the US was a rogue nation needing taming, D'Souza said. \"They kind of know that Obama is pursuing decline. And they want decline \u2026 that's why they like him.\" Mainstream Democrats, he said, turned a blind eye out of opportunism.</p> <p>Asked if he wanted Obama to win so he could proved right, D'Souza laughed. \"I am neither predicting nor advocating an election outcome.\"</p> <p>Hollywood, he said, had been shocked by the success of the film, which he co-directed with John Sullivan. It was shot on a shoestring budget, edited in Oklahoma City and distributed independently. \"They're a little unnerved because we kind of came out of nowhere. It shows that Hollywood has no monopoly on the making and distribution of good films.\" He shrugged off criticism that it was funded by rich conservatives. \"My answer is: well, we tried to be funded by poor conservatives, but that failed, so we had to turn to the rich ones. Big deal. Who cares?\"</p> <p>D'Souza laughed at being called a right-wing Michael Moore, but said he was inspired by the panache and commercial splash of Fahrenheit 9/11's assault on a sitting president.</p> <p>\"That being said, in my opinion Fahrenheit 9/11 is an intellectual nullity. It's factually slippery, based on conspiracy theories, and it's fast and loose with data. Our film is not that way.\" Many critics disagree, though stylistically D'Souza's scholarly, understated demeanour contrasts with Moore's megaphone stunts.</p> <p>In a tight race, Democrats can only hope that for all the fuss Obama's America will not tilt key states Mitt Romney's way.</p> <p>D'Souza's kindest words about Obama still have potential to fire up Republican voters. \"He doesn't hate America. He's not a Manchurian candidate. He's not even anti-American. It's just that he subscribes to the belief that in terms of wealth and power it would be good for America to have less and for the rest of the world to have more.\"</p>",
  "<p>Half a century ago this week \u2013 taking a last walk with my father before school began and autumn closed in \u2013 I made the most stubbornly enduring decision of my life. I asked my father what happened to the sheep we contemplated through the descending dusk. \"Well, er \u2013 roast lamb, I'm afraid,\" replied Dad.</p> <p>I think it was the weirdness rather than the cruelty of the idea that made eight-year-old me decide never to eat meat again. We returned to the cottage we had borrowed for summer, which had neither gas nor electricity, and told Mum the news. I ate beans for supper and have been vegetarian ever since.</p> <p>\"You're a <em>what</em>?\" they asked, when I sat down for school lunch with the cheese sandwich and dried banana Mum had prepared, as she would do every morning thereafter, though I never got to eat it: this was long before fashionable abstention from chewing animal flesh and every day boys would kick my packed lunch across the floor until it was inedible. I think the bullying made me stick with it, as much as anything to do with animals.</p> <p>The vile headmaster, a Mr Cooper, wrote to Mum urging help to purge \"these nonconformist tendencies\". She told him to get lost. My relationship to society, thus forged, has not changed \u2013 nor has my diet.</p> <p>Now we learn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/26/food-shortages-world-vegetarianism\" title=\"\">from leading water scientists in Stockholm </a>that unless the planet's population turns vegetarian by 2050 then it will face catastrophic food shortages. For a number of reasons: climate change, land use, water supply and the fact that the middle class in China and other developing countries, fleetingly enriched by globalised turbo-capitalism, want, bizarrely, to eat like Americans. They think those 36oz steaks gorged until 18oz of them must be thrown away will make them virile, rich and, well, American (while America goes down the pan).</p> <p>So someone celebrating five meat-free decades might feel tempted to indulge in a moment of \"told you so\". But no, it's been a less decisive trajectory than that.</p> <p>It took another five years for the 1960s to become themselves in London's Notting Hill (when it <em>was </em>Notting Hill) and for other vegetarians to emerge \u2013 mostly hippies heeding the call of nature and mantras of India, later ital Rastafari. At last, justification and company! When people asked what kind of \"\u2013ist\" I was, I could reply \"pantheist\" without shame. I took nature and animals extremely seriously. I stared at romantic paintings by Samuel Palmer, read Goethe, devoured \u2013 as it were \u2013 Coleridge, wore canvas shoes, listened to (vegetarian) Hawkwind.</p> <p>And yet: how can you be vegetarian and get arrested at a football match? It was a case to answer, after my detention for trying to climb into the 1971 FA Cup Final, and a later conviction for criminal damage against a small local record shop called Virgin owned by a \"sellout hippie\" called Branson. Vegetarians weren't supposed to throw ammonia at the National Front and riot police, but I did.</p> <p>I couldn't abide the evangelical vegetarians, nor was I interested in food. I couldn't meditate my way out of a paper bag and never ate at the pioneering Cranks restaurant; I described myself as a beer and chips vegetarian with sag aloo for the odd health kick. I did, however, join the veggie food co-op, secretly ate soya protein and loved Mum's special nut loaf at Christmas, long before Linda McCartney procured either. One's dichotomous identity as a vegetarian rebel wearing leather boots to study philosophy at Oxford needs to ebb and flow rather than make sense.</p> <p>When the 1980s brought Greenpeace, German Greens and Julie Christie's <em>The Animals Film</em>, I figured that, if being vegetarian was \"in\", I'd be in too, for once in my life. The school bullies' backlash mutated but remained among both yuppies and rednecks: vegetarians were impotent, granola-munching, Quaker queers, etc, etc. Then, in the 1990s, when working life took me to places such as Bosnia, compassionate farming seemed less of a priority and I certainly approved of people eating pigeons while starving under siege in Sarajevo, though not myself, and do not begrudge people their freely farmed lamb roast, though it's not for me.</p> <p>I'm no foodie, but vegetarian life on the road is more interesting than difficult. People presumed the Balkans to be hard, but they had not tried the wild mushrooms, spinach zeljanica or Vlasicki cheese. It helped to be an Italophile: I never envied anyone their veal while eating carciofi alla Giudia; vegetarians can live in Italy for months before anyone notices \u2013 I did.</p> <p>The American midwest (unless there are Mexicans around) and France were always a nightmare: I lived on grilled sliced-cheese sandwiches for three months across the Dakotas and Iowa in 1988, and often had \"vegetarian\" dishes kindly served in Languedoc into which they'd put \"a bit of chicken instead of the beef, specially pour vous, monsieur \u2013 donc, v\u00e9g\u00e9tarien\". Then there's this macho look you get in Texas, Russia and Arab countries (for all the latter's delicious mezze) that says: \"How can you be a vegetarian father? Surely \u2026 er \u2026 a real man \u2026?\"</p> <p>Now, however, the gastronomic descendants of food that got people derided as impotent hippies constitute the mainstream diet of those hedge-fund wives in now ruined Notting Hill \u2013 soya, five-a-day organic veg, spelt loaf. Yesterday's alternative cafe is today's ghastly Jamie Oliver shop where WH Smith used to be: similar rough idea but stripped of its politics and tarted up, at a price. For sure, this isn't vegetarianism like it is in Glastonbury: their decadent celebrity cooks gush on about scientifically cooked cod's tongues and boiled bull's bollocks, or whatever. But fried chicken is now for rioting hoodies, BBQ ribs for the plebs, and Olympic Big Macs are for shopaholic inmates of Westfield.</p> <p>However, the husbands of those healthily almost-vegetarian, personally trained wives are directly or indirectly ravaging the planet with corporate lust to such a degree that everyone but them must reportedly turn vegetarian or starve. This is a stark reflection on \u2013 and indictment of \u2013 what supposedly carnivorous <em>homo sapiens </em>has done to his surroundings and fellow creatures aboard Noah's ark. Flesh-eating has become an expression and part of the wider and catastrophic dysfunction in mankind's relationship to nature.</p> <p>I read two books back to back recently: one was <em>The Goldilocks Enigma</em> by Paul Davies, about how mankind has built \u2013 during the 50 years since that walk with my dad \u2013 machines enabling him to see the edge of the universe, ergo the beginning of time. The other was <em>The Ages of Gaia</em> by James Lovelock, about how, during those same 50 years, humankind has terminally trashed the only cranny of that universe the telescopes have found so far that is actually alive \u2013 the one we live in. Supposedly at the top of the food chain, we are the only species that utterly fails to understand \u2013 and is at war with \u2013 its habitat.</p> <p>Man doesn't understand what a wolf does when it dummy-runs a herd of deer, so that the weak get caught behind by the real attack, while the strong escape to reproduce food for future wolves. Postmodern capitalist man is not like these hunters with a sense of longterm survival; no, humankind is a self-destructive, Tesco-shelf, couch-carnivore.</p> <p>So, pushing 60, I return to that teenaged pantheism, to time with animals and challenging the basis of man's relationship with them specifically and nature generally, to which being vegetarian is integral, though not the entirety.</p> <p>I found out the other day that some birds migrate by reference to the stars, others to magnetic fields in the earth. Divine, in a way, and how unlike h<em>omo capitalistus</em>, supposedly <em>sapiens</em>, gorging on meat from factory-fed lots of tethered cattle or warehouses full of tortured pigs, both pumped with alien hormones.</p> <p>Some god \u2013 and atheist humanism for that matter \u2013 gave us dominion over the birds and beasts, did he? In order to battery-farm, vivisect, extinguish, cull and kill \u2013 in pursuit of this fantasy we call \"progress\"?</p> <p>A corner of my eight-year-old brain asked a childish version of that question half a century ago. Now, if our claim to be the highest form of life is seriously undermined, on what authority do we put the others into our mouths, chew and swallow them?</p>",
  "<h2>Dr Richard Wellings is deputy editorial director of the <a href=\"http://www.iea.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Economic Affairs</a></h2> <p><strong>Liberalise planning:</strong> It's clear that housing has the potential to make a major contribution to economic recovery and that the best way to achieve this would be to liberalise the planning system and abolish costly building regulations</p> <p><strong>People should be free to provide their own housing:</strong> Self-build has the potential to empower people economically without making them dependent on handouts from the government or massive mortgages from the banks. Frankly it's appalling that the state actively prohibits people from providing basic needs for themselves. Housing is a telling example of how special interests (both private and public) collude to rip off the general public.</p> <p><strong>Local authorities should not be involved in the construction of new housing:</strong> They will prioritise social housing which is likely to increase welfare dependency and limit labour mobility. At the same time, such housing is likely to be gold-plated, providing higher quality accommodation than nearby private housing with further counterproductive effects on work incentives. The focus should be on allowing private firms to build more housing for the productive working people that drive the economy forward.</p> <p><strong>Encourage private finance:</strong> If private finance cannot deliver, it may be because the development is now poor value for money and returns are likely to be lower than initially expected. Taxpayers should not be forced to guarantee the risks under such circumstances. A better solution is to encourage private investment back in by lowering costs, for example by rescinding expensive green building regulations.</p> <h2>Professor Kenneth Gibb is professor of housing economics at the <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">University of Glasgow</a></h2> <p><strong>Is housebuilding important to the economic recovery?</strong> In principle yes, through multipliers and if it is built where demand and need are most plentiful; it should do something to help the labour market adjust. But in practice it needs to progress alongside (appropriately) easier mortgage credit and rising second hand transactions, otherwise the private developer will find it very hard going and sites will not be built out. This is one very good reason for focusing new build delivery, especially early on, on social and affordable housing (but where local housing assessments suggest the social return is greatest).</p> <p><strong>Be creative: </strong>There are lots of creative examples of local partrnerships for development, using land creatively and securing long term investment that deliver the same or more for slightly less.</p> <h2>Steven Howell is a senior policy officer at <a href=\"http://www.localis.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Localis</a></h2> <p><strong>Local authority new build is what's missing:</strong> The government is missing a trick here in not giving local authorities the freedom to be able to return to the heyday of the 1950s, where they were building 150,000 homes a year.</p> <p><strong>Housing should absolutely be a key part of the growth strategy:</strong> We would argue that there should be a bottom-up push, both from local authorities (if given the freedom to build new stock) and communities through self-build and proactive neighbourhood planning.</p> <h2>Jim Bennett is head of corporate strategy at the <a href=\"http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Homes and Communities Agency</a></h2> <p><strong>Investing in infrastructure: </strong>As well as providing a economic stimulus in its own right, targeted additional infrastructure investment could help to unlock a number of large sites around the country that have already been earmarked for housing and where there is a high demand for housing but need new infrastructure to unlock them.</p> <p><strong>Get Britain Building offers \u00a3570m in funding:</strong> The programme will unlock stalled sites with planning permission to restart construction activity and deliver more than 15,000 new homes. A recoverable investment, the programme is intended to address difficulties in accessing development finance faced by some housebuilders, and to help bring forward marginal sites by sharing risk.</p> <h2>Tim Morgan is head of global research at <a href=\"http://www.tullettprebon.com/\" title=\"\">Tullett Prebon</a></h2> <p><strong>Personal debt has escalated from \u00a3740bn to \u00a31,450bn over 10 years:</strong> Individuals are understandably reluctant to take on any further debt, which includes mortgages. They may also believe that house prices still look high by historic standards. We are in a deleveraging recession, not a destocking one. We shouldn't place too much reliance on a private sector solution which requires people to go even further into debt. This is why I favour a state investment solution \u2013 with the proviso that we can always privatise houses later through right-to-buy.</p> <p><strong>Housing starts have declined by 100,000 since the banking crisis:</strong> This is clear evidence of spare capacity, which makes a compelling case for ramping up house-building.</p> <p><strong>State funding:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tullettprebon.com/announcements/strategyinsights/notes/2010/SIN20120824.pdf\" title=\"\">My report</a> advocated a total annual investment of \u00a310bn. Policy Exchange demonstrated that we can realise \u00a34.5bn annually from selling the highest-value social housing when it falls vacant. We can raise further funds by allowing local authorities and/or housing associations to borrow against future rental streams. So we may need no more than \u00a34bn of annual state borrowing. This is pretty small when set against existing borrowing requirements.</p> <p><strong>Building council houses is the nearest thing to a viable policy:</strong> The only downside is that [ministers will] have to risk upsetting the \"not in my back yard\" brigade.</p> <h2>Kevin Matlon is director of consultancy at <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprisewm.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise West Midlands</a> and is a Labour councillor in Coventry</h2> <p><strong>Borrowing restrictions:</strong> I know of a housing association with an asset base that would allow it to borrow tens of millions for new housing investment, but the restrictions placed on its borrowings by the bank which is responsible for its existing serviceable mortgage is making it very difficult to borrow to invest. Banks are exploiting their position to force associations to renegotiate their existing debt structure in a way that is beneficial to the banks profits and detrimental to the associations and their customers.</p> <p><em>To view the full discussion, </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/aug/31/live-discussion-housing-economy-growth?commentpage=all#start-of-comments\" title=\"\"><em>click here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for debate, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka are unwittingly, perhaps, damaging women's tennis with their dreadful, premeditated caterwauling. This is hardly an original thought but it needs repeating, like their screeching, over and over again.</p> <p>To listen to them in yesterday's first semi-final at Flushing Meadows was to survive the tennis equivalent of water-boarding. Sooner or later (or maybe already) people will stop coming to watch this peculiar self-indulgence. Some already have. A few fans here left their expensive seats early, and those who stayed were noticeably mute, mesmerised by the noise rather than the tennis, which resulted in a weird atmosphere of ear-bashing on court and stupified silence in the stands.</p> <p>Azarenka even screamed after losing a point. I wonder if they practise this? Do they do it at home? Have they ever sat through someone else's screaming? Would they like it if we did it to them? Do they give a flying monkey's?</p> <p>Sharapova won the first set 115 grunts to 94, and six games to three. It was unbearable. On both counts.</p> <p>It probably doesn't do to get a fixation about this, but the aural assault in women's tennis is impossible to ignore \u2013 especially when someone working for the host broadcaster goes to the trouble of counting the shrieks of two such high-profile offenders. Revealingly, CBS showed tape of both women warming up \u2013 and there wasn't a peep out of either of them. So, if they can hit the ball without screaming, why do they do it?</p> <p>One theory is they have been conditioned to do so from a young age so they give full expression to their shot-making.</p> <p>The Women's Tennis Association have asked juniors to try to control their grunting and screaming, but have made no such effort to do so where most of us can hear it, on the Tour. Who would dare ask the darling of the game, Sharapova, to tone it down when she generates such big numbers for TV, sponsors and tournament organisers?</p> <p>Anyway, she might not even be listening...</p> <h2>Another set please?</h2> <p>If ever there was a counter-argument to John McEnroe's call for women to play five sets if they want to earn the same prizemoney as the men in slams, it was played out on Arthur Ashe Court yesterday.</p> <p>The first semi-final went two hours and 42 minutes. The second semi-final went 64 minutes. Had Serena Williams been asked to continue her slaughter of Sara Errani, the embarrassment would have been excruciating.</p> <p>There are still way too many bagels and 6-1 scores deep into major tournaments and it is often only the best players who can give each other a proper fight.</p> <p>While it would have been intriguing to see Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka carry on to decide it over five sets, I'm pretty sure Errani wanted to get out of there when she did.</p>"
