  "<p>The UK's banking system faces tough challenges in the next 18 months, the ratings agency Moody's has said, as it maintained a negative outlook on the sector.</p> <p>In an annual review of the banking industry, Moody's said the operating environment for banks would be affected by \"weak economic growth prospects\". After three consecutive quarters of contracting GDP, it expects economic growth will be \"marginally positive\" during the next 18 months, with high levels of household indebtedness and the government's austerity measures affecting growth.</p> <p>The sector also faces pressure from potentially rising bad debts from property loans, as well as the cost of putting right past mistakes in mis-selling financial products. UK banks' involvement in the Libor scandal \u2013 for which Barclays has received a \u00a3290m fine \u2013 could result in tough penalties for market manipulation as well as a revamp of banks' risk controls.</p> <p>Moody's said new regulations for banks, including plans to require ringfences between their high street and investment banking businesses, would put further pressure on the system. For now, however, the agency believes that the government will continue to bail out banks in trouble, which is helping to support their individual ratings.</p> <p>Moody's expects credit growth from banks to remain weak, calculating that the domestic lending portfolio of the five largest UK banks was \u00a31.4tn at the end of 2011, down 3.6% from a year earlier, and that government schemes to bolster lending will having only a limited effect on credit growth.</p>",
  "<p>Julian Baggini (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/04/why-fallen-out-organic-food\" title=\"\">Is it all over for organics?</a>, 5 September) questions whether organic standards mean higher welfare. There are good reasons to believe they do.</p> <p>Firstly, the welfare requirements are higher. The rules of the <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/\" title=\"\">Soil Association</a>, a leading organic standards setter in the UK, require pasture access for cows. Laying hens are kept free range throughout their lives. Soil Association eggs come from hens that haven't been beak trimmed. Britain's organic pigs are not subject to mutilations such as tail docking or teeth clipping. EU organic rules require piglets to stay with their mothers longer, reducing health problems and the need for antibiotics.</p> <p>A healthy animal should need few if any antibiotics. In the UK, antibiotics are used by organic farmers only to treat sick animals. In intensive farming they are routinely used to prop up a fundamentally unhealthy system aimed at controlling disease in animals whose immune systems are weakened by stress.</p> <p>In addition to good welfare rules, the Soil Association, the RSPCA and leading researchers are pioneering practical ways to measure welfare outcomes such as lameness in cows and feather pecking in chickens. This will help give further assurance that higher welfare systems are actually delivering better lives for the animals in practice too.</p> <p>For all of these reasons, Soil Association organic standards recently came out top in Compassion in World Farming's analysis of welfare standards. Of course there are non-organic schemes and systems with good welfare \u2013 conventional free range or Freedom Food for example. Shoppers looking for higher welfare food choices should certainly consider organic to be among them.<br><strong>Philip Lymbery</strong><br><em>Chief executive, </em><a href=\"http://www.ciwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Compassion in World Farming</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 The conclusions offered by your article will come as no surprise to many current and former certified organic producers. When I first gained organic certification in 1985, I was not primarily motivated by maintaining healthy soil (that was a given) but by the need to avoid the unhealthy effects of using products that had been banned by Geneva convention for use in warfare \u2013 but which could still be sprayed on your dinner.</p> <p>As the Soil Association tried to widen the appeal of organic food in the 1990s it embraced the supermarkets, which would not appreciate one of their niche suppliers telling the world that 95% of what it sold would give you cancer in middle age, or dementia later in life, so the SA quietly self-censored its campaigning on the ill-effects of \"conventional\" food. Unless the Soil Association reignites this campaign, it will continue to oversee the decline of our movement.</p> <p>And if the SA wishes to understand why it is losing its licensees at such an alarming rate, consider this\u2026 The cost of a three-hour annual inspection of my two hectares is \u00a3450 plus VAT. The cost of the same inspection for the largest organic farmer in the UK is \u00a3750 plus VAT. The richer you are, the less you pay \u2013 even the poll tax wasn't that bad.<br><strong>Ian Mason</strong><br><em>Shrewsbury, Shropshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Organic food versus non-organic is about much more than vitamin counts. Organic farming occurs in harmony with wildlife, using crop rotations to build up soil fertility. Conventional farming is reliant on agrochemicals and artificial inputs which negate soil fertility and pollute land, rivers and streams. I was once told by a conventional apple producer they sprayed their apples up to 40 times with various pesticides, fungicides etc. I&#xa0;know what sort of apple I'd rather eat.<br><strong>Izzy Lane</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It's irritating when bright people choose to ignore the difficult bits while embracing the dumb bits of an argument. The goat farmer and science blogger \"Susan\" quoted in your article is misled by her daft US organic farming rules, which can militate against good organic animal welfare. And the presumably British farmer Roger has been selectively bred to say the sort of things that, as an organic farmer, I simply do not recognise. He appears not to understand animal welfare rules in his own country.</p> <p>Organic farming has had a civilising influence. Had it not been for those who stood up to the blanket use of chemicals in food production, who decided slicing bits off live pigs and chickens wasn't essential to get a good bacon sandwich or chicken nugget, and who thought it would be nice if cows could stay out in grassy fields rather than mucky sheds (and not eat each others' boiled-up proteins), I guess we'd be wallowing in more mad cow disease, wading even dirtier rivers, and keeping nanotechnology pigs in triple-decked fattening hothouses. The organic influence has forced other sectors of this sometimes grubby industry to raise their game.<br><strong>Tim Finney</strong><br><em>Swindon, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Julian Baggini's article on organic food overlooks one key reason why people buy it: we think organic tastes better.<br><strong>Mike Frost</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p>",
  "<p>For the last six weeks, disabled people in London have enjoyed unprecedented access to the tube. Extra staff at stations have provided assistance and advice. The use of manual ramps for the first time on the Underground has opened up parts of London previously out of bounds to wheelchair users.

But that target has been cut and cut again. While in the UK as a whole funding for accessible stations has more than doubled, London Underground's current budget has zero investment in step-free access over the next three years.

  "<p>Slashing red tape including health and safety inspections for smaller companies is not a \"silver bullet\" for restoring economic growth, according to the organisation representing more than 100,000 British businesses.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) called for a wider range of measures to kickstart the economy after the business secretary, Vince Cable, announced that hundreds of thousands of firms including shops and pubs would be exempted from health and safety inspections.</p> <p>\"Cutting back forms of red tape that do not serve the public interest is a very positive move for the business environment. However, it is not going to be the silver bullet that delivers growth,\" said Adam Marshall, director of policy at the BCC. \"It has to go alongside access to financing, improvements in infrastructure and making a skills system that works for companies.\"</p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry, another business lobby group, was more positive, saying deregulation would bring immediate benefits by freeing up time and money, allowing companies to concentrate on expanding.</p> <p>Guy Bailey, head of employment policy at the CBI, said: \"A growing number of regulations can stifle innovation and economic growth. Reducing the regulatory burden will benefit businesses and the economy.\"</p> <p>The announcement was met with alarm at the annual TUC conference in Brighton, however, where the Prospect union questioned the government's reference to 3,000 regulations when there were only 200 health and safety regulations in the UK.</p> <p>\"Where the government gets its figures from is anyone's guess,\" said Mike Clancy, general secretary designate of Prospect, which represents more than 1,600 staff at the Health and Safety Executive.</p> <p>Clancy added that companies had a \"commercial and moral\" imperative to have a strong health and safety culture: \"If you do not have coherent legislation, the alternative is that employers will develop business models where they take liberties with peoples' safety. You will not have good customer service and products in that environment.\"</p> <p>Two manufacturers contacted by the Guardian said industrial companies took health and safety issues seriously.</p> <p>Naylor Industries, a family-owned maker of drainage pipes based in Barnsley, said complying with health and safety regulations generated paperwork but was a necessity for the business.</p> <p>Edward Naylor, chief executive of the firm that employs 250 people, said: \"The last thing we want is a lack of focus on health and safety.</p> <p>\"It is one of those areas where there are a lot of documentary requirements but, on balance, we would say that it is in the best interests of the business.\"</p> <p>However, Naylor said there was a \"large amount\" of red tape attached to energy use and quarrying activity that was time-consuming, even if the company agreed in principle with environmental legislation. \"We would be happy if there was half the amount of red tape flying around.\" Naylor's chief operating officer, Bridie Warner-Adsetts, said a reduction in \"vexatious\" employment tribunal claims would also benefit businesses. \"It has been an unfair system,\" she said.</p> <p>Amtico, a Coventry-based maker of industrial flooring, said it supported existing rules.</p> <p>\"I am all for health and safety legislation because it makes sure that the workplace is safe,\" said Jonathan Duck, Amtico's chief executive, adding that health and safety \"takes primacy over everything\" at his company.</p> <p>Duck said his problem was not with red tape but with issues such as employment tax. \"The regulatory framework is fine. For me that's not where the issues lie,\" he said.</p> <p>He pointed to the starting rate of employment tax. \"It prevents you from hiring and makes your costs more expensive.\"</p> <p>Duck said a worker starting on \u00a38,000 a year would draw an employment tax rate, including income tax and national insurance, of 46%.</p> <p>\"We should be looking at some of the more fundamental things,\" said Duck, whose firm employs 600 people.</p>",
  "<p>Last November the New York Times' media reporter, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/business/media/paton-prepares-his-newspapers-for-a-world-without-print.html?pagewanted=all\">David Carr, wrote an enormously laudatory profile of John Paton</a> (\"a bearded man with a friendly face\"), a financial executive who had just taken the reins at the second largest newspaper chain in the country, MediaNews (with more than 60 papers, including San Jose Mercury News, Denver Post, and Los Angeles Daily News). Paton had gotten this job, said Carr, because of the great work he had done at another newspaper chain, the Journal Register \u2013 not least of all by implementing an aggressive digital strategy.</p> <p>Actually, Paton wasn't even giving up the first job, but, in an unexplained convolution, taking responsibility for both groups under an umbrella management company called Digital First \u2013 for the \"digital first\" imperative he was proselytizing about in his newsrooms and at conferences all over the country. He was, according to Carr, a white knight for the newspaper business.</p> <p>Bankers in the industry found this a curious article \u2013 a reality-trouncing one. From the financial view, MediaNews and the Journal Register, along with various other besieged US newspaper companies, represented a failed gamble on the part of two distress debt firms: Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co (\"specialists in non-traditional investments,\" as they describe themselves) and Alden Global Capital (run by a reclusive investor, Randy Smith, who nobody seems to know much about).</p> <p>Over the last several years, the firms had played aggressively in the debt of many of the nation's newspaper companies, including the Tribune Co, Philadelphia Media Network, Star Tribune Media company, and Freedom Communications, as well as MediaNews and Journal Register \u2013 all of which had been restructured in bankruptcy proceedings. To no one's surprise but, apparently, their own, both firms had fared poorly in these investments. (The executive at Angelo, Gordon responsible for the newspapers deals, Brad Patelli, was forced out of the company.)</p> <p>Last week, the Journal Register \u2013 the same company whose success after it emerged from its first bankruptcy had, according to Carr, propelled Paton into his new responsibilities at MediaNews \u2013 went into bankruptcy, again. Alden Global Capital, its controlling stakeholder, announced that its corpus was for sale. </p> <p>In addition to getting the Times' Carr to endorse his management approach, Paton had also recruited an advisory board of luminary digital journalists, including Jeff Jarvis, a vocal gadfly and a professor at Cuny's Graduate School of Journalism, Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia's Journalism School (and formerly the Guardian's director of digital content), and Jay Rosen, a media critic and professor of journalism at New York University. \"Advisory board\" is a non-official status often used by digital companies to associate themselves with industry worthies; companies that are themselves worthy do not usually have advisory boards.</p> <p>Carr, in his article, took respectful note of Jarvis, Bell, and Rosen's involvement. It may have been their presence that helped Carr overlook the more obvious point that Paton's track-record \u2013 limited to brief time running a Hispanic chain \u2013 hardly suggested he was the man with the chops to restructure the US newspaper business. </p> <p>Indeed, the \"bearded man with the friendly face\" seems to be convincing enough, or charming enough, even with the Journal Register in bankruptcy again, <a href=\"http://buzzmachine.com/2012/09/06/the-news-we-can-afford/\">to have had Jarvis take to his blog</a> the other day to explain that this latest bankruptcy was really just an effort to appropriately shrink the cost basis of the company. \"CEO John Paton said that legacy costs undertaken under different circumstances are now unsustainable. Bankruptcy presents an opportunity to renegotiate many of those costs, including leases, contracts, and pensions,\" said Jarvis, seeming, none too sheepishly, to concur. He continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I do believe that newspapers, rethought, can be sustainable \u2013 that is, profitable. The first step is to make hard financial decisions such as the ones discussed here. The next is to make the transition to digital, to put digital first, to become sustainable <em>digital</em> enterprises.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jarvis also pointed out that Rick Edmonds at the Poynter Institute and Josh Benton at the Nieman Journalism Lab were saying much the same thing: Paton was on the right track. The bankruptcy was, in Benton's words, \"a reboot\". Payton just need the pressure taken off of him so that he could use the resources he had to continue to transform his papers into digital enterprises. </p> <p>The problem, however, was that, so far, the digital strategy had, from a revenue standpoint, not become all that significant to the company \u2013 you'd be hard-pressed to find much value there. Or even the prospect of value.</p> <p>Except, perhaps, PR value. With the bearded, friendly Paton's umbrella company, Digital First, out front, defended by so many worthies, the notably less friendly distressed-debt guys were tending to the real business, trying mightily to improve the bad deal they had initially made when taking on so much newspaper debt at the twilight of the newspaper business.</p> <p>It was a classic disparity between the way journalists wishfully see their business and the way the people they work for see it.</p> <p>Distressed-debt investing is \u2013 to the surprise, it seems, of earnest journalists \u2013 not about building business, or even saving them. It's about jockeying for position and improving your deal. It's about exerting leverage on companies that don't have the cash to pay you back (whether they make widgets or report the news). Now, when you buy debt and restructure \u2013 the rejiggering you force a company to do when it can't pay what it owes \u2013 you end up with equity: indeed, Alden owns pretty much all of the Journal Register's equity by now. In other words, the only way the company can pay you off is by giving you a part of itself, or all of itself, which introduces another perplexing and shifty element: as equity owner and debt holder, you are both borrower and lender \u2013 maximizing your leverage and ability to self-deal. (When there are multiple debt holders in a distress deal, as there often are, things get really interesting: suffice it to say, nobody trusts anybody.)</p> <p>All of which has little to do with figuring out how to build a sustainable newspaper business \u2013 even though Paton and his advisory board continue to say that's what the result will be. What it has to do with is making good deals, or making bad deals into better deals. So, while the journalists covering this story, or recruited to be part of it, keep talking about the prospects of growth in the digital future, the financial guys have seen the more immediate and darker issue: neither the print nor the digital operations are going to pay them back \u2013 meaning: if the customer won't pay, they have to turn somewhere else.</p> <p>So, the Journal Register has been put into bankruptcy again. Its big debt holder, Alden Capital, will now make a bid to buy it. This is a bid that will be high enough so that if someone else comes along and is willing to pay more, great \u2013 and good riddance. But if no one comes along, this enables the dominant debt holder to extract ever-more concessions from other remaining stakeholders (employees, pensions, management, and lesser debt holders). First and foremost, it's a haircut all around. As is always so.</p> <p>If it's digital at all, it's digital last.</p>",

It's a huge loss.\"</p> <p>Mountaintop removal was largely unheard-of and unseen when Gibson moved back home to West Virginia in the 1980s, after being forced into early retirement from a job at General Motors in Ohio.</p> <p>Mining companies were just beginning to buy up locals' small plots \u2013 like the 60 acres Gibson and his cousins jointly owned on Kayford Mountain \u2013 to dynamite the peaks and dig for coal.</p> <p>Thirty years later, 500 mountains across West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky have been stripped of trees and flattened, reduced to dry flat plateau. Some 1,200 mountain streams have been buried beneath rock and debris, according to campaigners.</p> <p>But Gibson stubbornly refused to sell out \u2013 despite being offered millions by the mining companies. He built a two-room cabin on the mountain, living there on and off without plumbing and electricity while his wife stayed in town. He persuaded his cousins to put up rough-hewn shacks too.</p> <p>He began using the area to offer a rare up-close view of mountaintop mining, bringing up reporters, celebrities, activists and local people to watch giant earth moving equipment gouge out the earth of adjacent peaks.</p> <p>Campaigners estimate tens of thousands of visitors stopped by Gibson's land over the years.</p> <p>He alternated between statistics about mining's destructive force, and folky charm. \"My family was here before coal even got here,\" he told me when I visited three years ago.</p> <p>Gibson's very public opposition took courage in an area dominated by coal mining. He himself was the son and grandson of coal miners; many of his relatives had worked in the mines.</p> <p>But that did not stop him. \"I tell you what I'm not collateral damage. I am not a victim,\" he said during our meeting. \"I am somebody. I am just as good as anyone. I deserve the same quality of air and health that everyone does that lives away from the coal fields.\"</p> <p>His public stand brought him isolation \u2013 and worse.</p> <p>Gibson, who was barely 5ft tall, had stories of attempts to intimidate him \u2013 showing off bullet holes in the wood of his cabin.</p> <p>He was careful to monitor the CB radio in his truck for movement of the security firms working for mining companies. But he didn't back down.</p> <p>Over the last few years, however, his often lonely struggle began to gain broader attention, and Gibson gained a large personal following. In his blinding lime green t-shirts, he became a regular figure at hearings on mountaintop removal at the West Virginia state capitol and at protests in the area.</p> <p>The campaign to end mountaintop removal has been elevated to a national concern. The White House also moved to crackdown on mountaintop removal, after years of inaction. Early last year, the environmental protection agency put out new rules for protecting mountain streams that would have limited mining companies.</p> <p>Those rules are now being challenged in the courts.</p>",
  "<p>It's a modern morality tale: the story of the hipsters, the counterculture phenomenon that ate itself.

His production company, Holiday Road, headed by former Daily Show boss Josh Lieb, is working on a sitcom about a decidedly unhip anthropology student who ends up living with the hipsters of Brooklyn, New York. This \"fish-out-of-water\" scenario is a classic sitcom set-up but it's interesting that this particular fish is being sent to the capital of asymmetrical fringes and angular upper-lip piercings.</p> <p>The Brooklyn setting has currency now in US TV circles, after the first series of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/girls\" title=\"\">Girls</a>. HBO's series parlayed Lena Dunham's ponderous first film, Tiny Furniture, into an awkward and addictive series about four twentysomethings. In truth, the questions sparked by the series (about race, privilege and responsibility in art) were bigger than the show itself, although perhaps the one most frequently asked was: \"OMG, are hipsters, like, the least likable people in the world?\"</p> <p>Although hipster culture is awash with potential funnies (skinny jeans and ironic facial hair are the stuff of comedy gold), a hipster sitcom has been a long time coming. Despite the fact that \"adorkable\" show New Girl has many alternative leanings (and Zooey Deschanel as its star) you'd have to look back to the UK's own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/sep/20/box-set-club-nathan-barley\" title=\"\">Nathan Barley</a> to locate a sitcom that plunged into the heart of hipster-dom. Fallon's Untitled Hipster Project indicates that hipsters are now mainstream enough for a big studio (NBC) to take a punt on them.</p> <p>\"Everyone is a hipster now, it's gone global,\" says Jill Offman, MD at Comedy Central. \"So in all likelihood people will connect with the idea of a 'hipster comedy'.\" But much is bound to be lost in translation; part of the creative freedom afforded to the surreal, hipster-baiting sketch-show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/may/12/portlandia-carrie-brownstein-fred-armisen\" title=\"\">Portlandia</a> is due to the fact it's on a small network, so it doesn't matter if they make a joke and the punchline is \u2026 Aimee Mann.</p> <p>The best hope is that the show takes a leaf out of the most intelligent US sitcoms (30 Rock, Community, Parks and Recreation) and goes for subtle, knowing banter over broad laughs. If so, it could do for the hipster what The Big Bang Theory and The IT Crowd did for the nerd; make them likable again.</p>",
  "<p>Universities have been forced to lower their offer grades in the frantic rush to fill places this summer, and now many vice-chancellors say this was the most \"chaotic\" and \"uncertain\" admissions round they have ever experienced.</p> <p>Elite institutions are slamming the government for failing to predict what looks like a dramatic fall in the numbers of top students in the system. Many universities \u2013 old and new \u2013 have struggled to meet their recruitment targets, and experts warn that some less popular subjects could face the axe.</p> <p>This year, two key policies came on stream at the same time: fees of up to \u00a39,000, and a free market for the very best students, with universities able to recruit as many applicants with grades of AAB upwards as they could attract. Institutions were vying to win more of these students in order to make up for government cuts to their numbers earlier this year. However, early signs are that only a tiny handful of elite institutions have managed to expand.</p> <p>At the top end of the sector, where universities usually have more trouble choosing between students than finding enough of them, institutions, including some of the big northern civic universities, have been hit especially hard. And last week the University of Southampton, a member of the elite Russell Group, revealed that it was 600 students down on last year, having failed to recruit enough AAB students. In an email to all staff, the vice-chancellor, Don Nutbeam, described this as \"a wake-up call for the entire university community\".</p> <p>The vice-chancellor of another top research university tells a story that is echoed by many similar institutions: \"All of our standard offers were AAB or higher, but we had to drop one grade for some subjects and two for others.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, there are reports that some newer universities have reduced grades to as low as two Ds to boost recruitment.</p> <p>Data confirming the number of students enrolled at different universities is not usually released by Ucas until December, but an update released a week after results day reveals total accepted applicants down by almost 30,000 on last year.</p> <p>One exasperated university head says: \"This new admissions environment is not stable, it is not linear, it is, in the real sense of chaos theory, a chaotic environment with all sorts of unintended consequences.\"</p> <p>Privately, many VCs report that applicants seem to have underperformed on their predicted grades more than in previous years. And, crucially, selective universities say that the number of students with AAB upwards was noticeably lower. This has come as a real shock.</p> <p>A Westminster source says the data the government was working with was seriously misjudged. \"Hefce were asked by the department to predict how many AABs there would be in the system. They looked historically and predicted a 5,000 increase. The reality was more like a 5,000 decrease, which then becomes an effective deficit of 10,000 anticipated AAB students.\"</p> <p>One reason for this is that for the first time in two decades the number of students gaining the top grades at A-level did not rise this August. In total, 26.6% were awarded A or A*, a fall of 0.4 points compared with last year.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, leading universities are accusing the government of failing to see the writing on the wall. The head of one top university says: \"What this shows is a lack of coordination in government. There were a smaller number of A grades at A-level this year, but the really big question is, did the schools department know this was going to happen and did they tell the universities department?\"</p> <p>Yet the small percentage drop in top grades does not explain everything. Another vice-chancellor of a selective university says: \"There is a general mystification among admissions professionals about where all these AABs have gone. They seem to have evaporated into thin air.\"</p> <p>One theory doing the rounds is that predicted grades for many students were wrong. Experts say this could have been because marking has changed, or because teachers nudged up predictions for borderline cases, knowing that many universities were desperate for extra AAB students for policy reasons this year.</p> <p>The head of one research institution where lots of students with offers didn't get predicted grades says: \"Long before results day, our admissions people said they'd got the impression that teachers were over-predicting grades this year. You can see why. Once you predict an AAB you put a student in a position where any university they apply for might give them an offer.\"</p> <p>But Matthew Andrews, registrar at Oxford Brookes University and chair of the admissions practitioners group at the Academic Registrars Council, refuses to believe teachers would play games with grades. He says: \"When applications were being written I'm not sure that many people outside the HE sector were aware of the intricacies of the AAB market.\"</p> <p>Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the modern universities group million+, which has opposed the AAB policy from the outset, argues that introducing two big recruitment policy changes at once was never going to be a success. \"We warned the BIS select committee that the first year of higher fees would be challenging for everyone, and that ministers should pause their ambitions to incentivise the market in student numbers. MPs agreed with us, but by ignoring their advice, the government added an extra layer of unpredictability to the difficulties which already exist in making admissions stack up into a sensible equation.\"</p> <p>This year even elite research-intensive universities, including Warwick, Leeds and Durham, were forced into clearing to find extra students. However, Andrews says that a lot of the students counted by Ucas as eligible for clearing haven't materialised. He explains: \"There are some views that this year students applied and it was only afterwards that they really understood the cost and whether they wanted to go to university.\"</p> <p>Even universities that have fared reasonably well overall say some subjects have seriously underperformed, notably the humanities, social sciences and modern languages. Some vice-chancellors admit they are thinking hard about whether they can continue to prop up their ailing language courses.</p> <p>Paul Webley, director of the School for Oriental and African Studies, says: \"Nationally there has been a huge drop in non-European languages. The difference for us is that these languages are at the core of what we do, so unlike other universities we can't simply decide to stop doing these things because the numbers are low.\"</p> <p>Mike Kelly, professor of French at the University of Southampton and director of the UK Subject Centre for Languages, is pessimistic about what this means for the future. \"Some of the universities that have been struggling with languages will be tipped over the edge,\" he says. \"The real worry is the availability of courses for people who study close to home. There are already very few post-92 universities offering language degrees. If you take Cambridge out of the equation, the east of England is now a total desert.\"</p> <p>Most universities can afford to take a knock on numbers this year, with revenue streams such as international students to cushion them and funds in reserve, but they are looking at the next few years with trepidation. Understandably, some say that after the unpredictability of this recruitment round, making calculations about next year will be even harder. One vice-chancellor says: \"No one will trust predicted grades. No one will trust anything any longer.\"</p> <p>Another concludes: \"It is hard to say whether all this pain will be worthwhile, because we don't yet know whether we'll be coming out into a future where everything is better.</p> <p>\"What I do know is that this is the worst level of uncertainty that I have seen in my 30 years in education.\"</p>",
  "<p>Antony Jenkins, the new boss of Barclays, has made it clear that he would not break up the bank by carving off the investment banking business from its high street operations.</p> <p>Jenkins, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/30/barclays-new-chief-executive-antony-jenkins\" title=\"\">who replaced Bob Diamond when he quit in the wake of the Libor scandal</a>, will assess the risk that each of the embattled bank's operations might have on its already bruised reputation as he undertakes a commercial review of the business. It will be published in the first quarter of next year.</p> <p>He said that a \"premier investment banking franchise\" was necessary and stressed that \"I have been, and continue to be, a supporter of Barclays' universal banking model\" which unites high street and investment banking.</p> <p>However, the review is likely to signal a pull-back from the tax planning operations that have caused controversy for Barclays in the past as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/29/interest-rate-swaps-caps-collars\" title=\"\">the sale of interest rates swaps to small businesses</a> that are now the subject of a review by the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>In a presentation to analysts from New York, Jenkins said the review of businesses would assess their financial returns but also to consider whether \"they pass the level of external scrutiny and reputational impact\".</p> <p>\"My expectation is that we will identify sources of inefficiency and under-performance that we will need to change,\" he said. \"No businesses will be out of scope; we will move quickly and be bold.</p> <p>\"However you should not expect me to announce the breakup of the bank or the exit from whole business lines,\" he stressed.</p> <p>He is ditching the return-on-equity targets \u2013 a measure of shareholder return \u2013 set by Diamond and will publish a flexible target for how much he hopes to beat the bank's cost of capital \u2013 a measure of running the business \u2013 next year.</p> <p>Starting only his second week at the helm after running both Barclaycard and the high street bank, Jenkins described the last few months as \"difficult ones for Barclays\".</p> <p>\"It is clear we have made some serious mistakes in recent years and clearly failed to keep pace with our stakeholders' expectations.\"</p> <p>As he pledged to make Barclays a \"'go to\" bank in the eyes of clients, Jenkins was asked whether the FSA had required Barclays to consider the potential hit to its reputation from some of its business operations. Jenkins insisted this was not the case, although he admitted the regulator was \"very interested in what we are doing here\".</p> <p>Rich Ricci, head of the investment banking business once known as Barclays Capital, gave examples of businesses that were scrutinised, even if they were generating profits. \"For example, elements of our tax advisory business have generated negative media and political attention, as has the sale of structured products to SMEs,\" he said.</p> <p>Ricci set out the case for Barclays' continued involvement in investment banking, saying that \"a small group of global players\" would continue to survive and that the bank had \"earned our place in that group\".</p>",
  "<p>What are we to make of a show that calls itself <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/sep/09/art-change-china-hayward-review\" title=\"\">Art of Change: New Directions from China</a>? I don't think it's worth discussing new directions in the context of Chinese art \u2013 there were no old directions, either. Chinese art has never had any clear orientation. Yes, the artists in this exhibition, which opened at the Hayward gallery in London last week, have struggled against the limitations imposed by the Chinese state more stridently than others. But that doesn't change the fact that this is just another attempt to introduce western audiences to so-called \"contemporary Chinese art\". How can you have a show of \"contemporary Chinese art\" that doesn't address a single one of the country's most pressing contemporary issues?</p> <p>I am very familiar with the work of most of the artists in the show. Their work is certainly Chinese but, overall, the show casts no critical eye. It is like a restaurant in Chinatown that sells all the standard dishes, such as kung pao chicken and sweet and sour pork. People will eat it and say it is Chinese, but it is simply a consumerist offering, providing little in the way of a genuine experience of life in China today.</p> <p>Widespread state control over art and culture has left no room for freedom of expression in the country. For more than 60 years, anyone with a dissenting opinion has been suppressed. Chinese art is merely a product: it avoids any meaningful engagement. There is no larger context. Its only purpose is to charm viewers with its ambiguity.</p> <p>The Chinese art world does not exist. In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights, anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence. It is impossible for a totalitarian society to create anything with passion and imagination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396171487\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347298808375/Peng-Yu-008.jpg\" alt=\"Peng Yu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from Peng Yu and Sun Yuan's I Didn't Notice What I am Doing (2012) at Art of Change: New Directions from China.

Its booming economy has triggered an appetite and a curiosity around the world for its art and culture, one that continues to grow. I can, however, tell people that it is a show with no actor. The Chinese government is spending billions on \"soft power\" initiatives, desperately promoting cultural exchanges with the west, with the goal of presenting itself as a civilised nation. These are superficial gestures, no different from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/10/china.usa\" title=\"\">the ping-pong diplomacy practised in the 1970s by Chairman Mao</a>: American table-tennis players were invited into the country to play fun matches and thereby facilitate some sort of political relationship. In a similar vein, giant pandas were given as gifts to various countries to strengthen diplomatic ties.</p> <p>Last year, we saw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/17/china-celebrity-ad-campaign-hu-jintao\" title=\"\">China bringing its propaganda right into New York's Times Square</a>. In an advertising push that the state news agency Xinhua described as a \"public diplomacy campaign\", billboard-size screens played videos that featured martial-arts movie star <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jackie-chan\" title=\"\">Jackie Chan</a>, basketball player <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/picture/2012/aug/15/yao-ming-africa-poaching-crisis-big-picture\" title=\"\">Yao Ming</a>, astronaut <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/06/china-stage-managing-news\" title=\"\">Yang Liwei</a>, and pianists <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/lang-lang\" title=\"\">Lang Lang</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/18/yundi-chopin-review\" title=\"\">Li Yundi</a>. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/nov/06/highereducation.internationaleducationnews\" title=\"\">Confucius Institutes, promoting Chinese culture, are spreading all over the world</a>, as are Chinese travelling acrobatic troupes. To me, these are an insult to human intelligence and a ridicule of the concept of culture \u2013 vehicles of propaganda that showcase skills with no substance, and crafts with&#xa0;no meaning.</p> <p>Although Chinese art is heavily influenced by contemporary western culture, it rejects the essential human values that underpin it. The Chinese Communist party claims to deliver socialism with Chinese characteristics, but nobody understands what this means \u2013 including the people of China. Given this, and their lack of self-identity, there is no reason to expect a show of Chinese art created in the west to critique the system effectively. But any show curated without respect for the people's struggle, without concern for an artist's need for honest self-expression, will inevitably lead to the wrong conclusion. Anything that calls itself a cultural exchange is artificial when it lacks any critical content. What's needed is open discussion, a platform for argument. Art needs to stand for something.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Art of Change: New Directions from China is at the Hayward Gallery, London SE1, until 7 December.</em></p>",
  "<p>Every profile of Felicity Jones&nbsp;tends to breathlessly announce that the actor is&nbsp;on the brink of superstardom, though since <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-560366/Archers-star-Felicity-Jones-target-make-big-splash.html\" title=\"\">these interviews go back to 2008</a>,&nbsp;you wonder how long this can continue. \"I understand it,\" she says. \"It's a way of selling something. I think you have to zone a lot of those things out, and people will take notice when you do something interesting.\"</p> <p>Of course, judging success by fame is too blunt a measure for an actor who insists she picks her jobs according to how interesting she finds them, not on whether they will catapult her on to magazine covers: she turned down the lead in the big-budget <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgbH05rQx1s\" title=\"\">Mirror Mirror</a>, with Julia Roberts as the evil queen, to be in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/jun/13/luise-miller-review\" title=\"\">Michael Grandage's production of Friedrich Schiller's Luise Miller</a> at the Donmar in London. I get the feeling, moments after meeting her in a cafe around the corner from where she lives (a hipsterish bit of east London), that attention is not what drives her. She is self-contained, quiet. At first glance girl-next-door pretty, she is more interesting-looking than that: large, green-gold eyes and bone structure delicate as a sparrow.</p> <p>In her latest film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1435513/\" title=\"\">Hysteria</a>, Jones plays Emily, the dutiful daughter of a doctor who specialises in treating women with \"hysteria\" \u2013 a condition that covered everything from anxiety and depression to reckless behaviour. This could only be treated by a doctor reaching under the petticoats and applying manual stimulation until a paroxysm ensued (female orgasms were never spoken about). When a young doctor, played by Hugh Dancy, finds the work a strain, he comes up with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/07/how-the-vibrator-caused-buzz\" title=\"\">the electric vibrator</a>. \"It was funny and I liked the idea of it \u2013 that an Englishman would have invented the vibrator in the Victorian period,\" she says. \"The idea that hysteria was this catch-all term to describe any sort of psychological condition in a woman \u2026 \" She smiles. \"I felt like I wanted to play someone a little bit silly.\"</p> <p>And Jones, 28, looks very at home in a bonnet. She has done several period dramas: in 2007, she played <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM0SGTJCaKU\" title=\"\">Catherine Morland in the television adaptation of Northanger Abbey</a>, and in her next film \u2013 The Invisible Woman, based on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/25/claire-tomalin-biographer-charles-dickens\" title=\"\">Claire Tomalin</a>'s book about Charles Dickens's mistress Nelly Ternan \u2013 she plays opposite Ralph Fiennes (who also directs). \"I enjoyed watching those kinds of films when I was growing up \u2013 Room with a View, Howards End,\" she says. \"I guess I'm a bit of a romantic. I&nbsp;feel the period has to become irrelevant and you're just dealing with people. I don't think characters have changed, it's the forces that work on them that have.\"</p> <p>There have been more contemporary roles, too. She was the lead in the romantic comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pn4Kqy06dw\" title=\"\">Chalet Girl</a>, and was&nbsp;in Ricky Gervais's film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6mWBdTelT8\" title=\"\">Cemetery Junction</a>. Before that, there were a number of low-budget British films that got middling reviews and then seemed to disappear, including <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1541149/\" title=\"\">Albatross</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_6NS_lLgis\" title=\"\">Soul Boy</a>. Then, last year, Jones seemed to step up a level when she won a special jury prize at the Sundance film festival for her role in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2035886/\" title=\"\">Drake Doremus</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/26/like-crazy-review\" title=\"\">Like Crazy</a>, the largely improvised indie film (which also took the best film prize) about a long-distance relationship. The reception, she says, \"was phenomenal, especially because it wasn't expected in any way\". She is in the director's next film, too. Is this going to be a lifelong actor-director partnership? \"I would love to. I think probably we need a bit of a break from each other, but definitely, in the future.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xvU4uHwQEg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xvU4uHwQEg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xvU4uHwQEg\">Reading this on mobile? Click here</a></p> <p>Her name has recently been linked with the film adaptation of 50 Shades of Grey \u2013 if only by fans of the book who have posted several YouTube tributes featuring Jones as their dream heroine. She laughs. \"I have been told,\" she says. Would she do it? \"It would depend on the script. I wouldn't dismiss it. I&nbsp;love this idea of YouTube casting, or casting through Twitter. I think that's going to become more powerful.\" The internet is exciting for&nbsp;film-makers, she says. \"It was fascinating to experience something like Like Crazy, which was made completely independently, just a group of people deciding they wanted to make a film. Increasingly, that will happen and there needs to be a platform, like an online cinema where you can watch these microbudget films.\" She has just finished working on a short film with a friend. \"It's a time when the cost of making a film is so low it means you can make really fascinating, weird and amusing stories. There has been a shift. It's exciting.\"</p> <p>Jones was brought up in Bournville in Birmingham by her mother, who worked in the advertising department of the local paper; her parents divorced when she was very young. She remembers being taken to see plays regularly as a child, and when she joined a drama club at the age of 11, \"I&nbsp;found I enjoyed it more than school. There was an amazing man, Colin Edwards, who was a real mentor and still is, and he wasn't afraid to introduce us to work like Harold Pinter at a young age. I just remember thinking, 'I like this world.' It felt right.\"</p> <p>She was 12 when she got her first job in a television film, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ymLugZat8\" title=\"\">Treasure Seekers</a>, which also starred a young Keira Knightley, and other roles soon followed: Jones was in the children's series The Worst Witch, and she played Emma Grundy in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/series/a-month-in-ambridge\" title=\"\">The Archers</a> for several years. Still, she decided not to go to drama school and chose to study English literature at university instead, Oxford as it happens, \"where I felt I could do both, be in the drama world and study at the same time. I think the benefit is I now have friends in different fields. It can be very intense being an actor, it can be quite a small world. Then you speak to your friend who is a&nbsp;scientist and they have a completely different perspective. It's good to feel [acting is] not the be-all and end-all. Is it David Mamet who says you have to&nbsp;enrich your life and that will make you a better actor? I agree with that.\"</p> <p>Were her parents worried about her becoming an actor? \"They weren't worried at all. They should have been more worried, but they were both very encouraging. I&nbsp;don't know \u2013 now there's no job&nbsp;that's stable, and that was starting to be the case when we were growing up.\"</p> <p>She says she looks at the career of Tilda Swinton as one she would like to emulate. \"I think she always does things she cares about. I&nbsp;like that she has experimented in other&nbsp;areas, like art installations. She's always exciting.\" I ask if, as a young female actor, she has felt a pressure to&nbsp;conform to an ideal, and she shakes her head and says, no, she's been lucky.&nbsp;\"But for everyone, I think, there is always a pressure to conform, and I&nbsp;guess as you get older you realise it's less interesting to do that. It starts with&nbsp;you, though, saying, 'I know what&nbsp;I like doing and that's what I'm going to do.'\"</p> <p>In the whirlwind that followed Like Crazy, Jones was feted by designers \u2013 she <a href=\"http://www.look.co.uk/fashion/meet-burberry%E2%80%99s-latest-campaign-star\" title=\"\">modelled for Burberry</a> \u2013 and directors, including Woody Allen, asked to meet her. The traditional next&nbsp;step is to move to Hollywood, which she says she would consider temporarily, \"but London will always be my home. It's nice to have some continuity you can come back to. I feel that in coming home, coming back to London.\" She lives with her long-term boyfriend, Ed Fornieles, an artist, and 20 tortoises in the garden. \"It's a shared building,\" she explains; the tortoises belong to everyone and no one. \"They're going to outlive us. They&nbsp;all get very hungry and they have to be fed, so I go and check on them in the&nbsp;morning.\"</p> <p>She isn't at a point, she says, where she can pick and choose all her roles. \"Some things come to me and other things I really have to go and fight for. It's a competitive world. You have to deal with being rejected constantly. It's like being dumped all the time.\" She laughs. \"It's horrible. I wouldn't think of myself as being a particularly strong person, but in order to stick it out you have to be.\"</p> <p>Does she watch her own films? \"I&nbsp;sometimes like to watch things just to see how I can get better, and also I just like to watch it \u2013 if you've spent two months of your life doing something it's nice to see what it became. It's useful to see what went wrong there, why didn't that work, how can I not do&nbsp;that again?\" Is she very self-critical? \"Yes, absolutely,\" she says with a smile. \"Perfectionism. It's good to do things properly, otherwise there's no point.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Hysteria is released on 21 September.</p>",

  "<p>In 2010 to 2011, the UK <a href=\"http://www.hesa.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Higher Education Statistics Agency</a> reported that for the first time more international students were studying UK courses outside the UK than within it. While the exportation of higher education programmes delivered across borders to remote learners in numerous and growing forms is not a new phenomenon, interest has been heightened by the UK government's promise to cut net migration from hundreds to tens of thousands.</p> <p>Complicate this picture further for UK institutions with the increase in UK domestic student fees and substantial cuts in universities' government funding, and it has never been more evident than now that UK higher education institutions need to get creative, innovate, capitalise on, and think outside the tradition of its four walls.</p> <p>The operating environment in the UK for institutions wanting to internationalise is witnessing governmental, economic and political impact that are forcing them to think beyond their traditional and experiment with the possibilities before them in delivering <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/.../D/DIUS_RR_08_07\" title=\"\">Transnational Education (TNE) programmes</a>.</p> <p>The delivery of these programmes has led to a new type of higher education consumer who seeks an unconventional, flexible format that allows them to continue their own pursuits (be that career, family or other) outside regular residential bricks and mortar study. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jun/21/opportunities-in-transnational-education\" title=\"\">TNE students have been described as 'glocal' students</a>, in other words local students with global aspirations. Whilst this observation is an accurate description \u2013 indeed, students are studying for globally administered programmes in a local setting \u2013 these students display far more sophisticated and nuanced characteristics than this assessment implies.</p> <p>Perhaps a better term might be 'career alumni.' This new wave of learners that has emerged seek quality programmes that will lead to career enhancement like their traditional internationally mobile counterparts. But they are also making measured and often multi-layered choices that allow them to advance in many cases a prosperous career without leaving their job, over the chance to experience studying within a campus environment. The 'career alumni' tag resonates due to their focus on their own professional development, and the importance they place on the creation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network\" title=\"\">professional networks</a> gained during their period of study.</p> <p>So why isn't everyone jumping on this band wagon? For both the delivering institution and the participating student, TNE programmes present the assessment of a measured risk. The challenge for both student and institution is mitigating that risk and achieving end goals of development and sustainability.</p> <p>Trends in international student mobility traditionally show students seeking higher quality education than immediately available to them at home, often in a country renowned for its world class institutions, academics and opportunities. A better quality of education and fulfilling the ultimate goal of improving career prospects have always been among the most important factors for students choosing to study overseas.</p> <p>Indisputably, students also want the cultural experience of living abroad. This wider experiential dimension, outside education and employment, is often capitalised on by institution's marketing strategies and national branding campaigns that exploit creative, scientific and artistic innovations, in the hopes of inspiring a new generation of imported home-cultivated alumni.</p> <p>Setting aside the potentially negative spin that could be applied to findings that TNE students are not treated equally by awarding institutions and are not offered the same quality of experience as those based on campus, there is an opportunity here to be grasped.

  "<p>Like former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, the bosses of Glencore and Xstrata are a breed apart. These mining and commodities trading giants, which are in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/10/glencore-xstrata-final-offer\" title=\"\">midst of a \u00a337bn merger</a>, have ridden an extraordinary boom in demand over the last 10 years and creamed off much of the profits for themselves and their shareholders.</p> <p>Based offshore and paying little tax, Glencore orchestrates a business that few people would understand, least of all politicians who must judge whether the merger creates a monopolistic industry. Exotic derivatives and super-fast computer systems are deployed to maximise profits. Like the bankers, commodities traders argue their sophisticated systems enhance the smooth working of market capitalism. For those not in the habit of reading business pages, here are five reasons why you should care about this merger.</p> <h2>1. Pay and wealth</h2> <p>Bankers once enjoyed the salaries and bonuses commanded by mining company bosses. Mick Davis, the Xstrata chief executive, is already the best paid boss in FTSE 100, taking home \u00a318.5m last year. Until last week, when the merger was still friendly, he was due to receive a \u00a330m golden handcuff to keep him at his desk. Now Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg, who owns a \u00a35bn stake in his company, has performed an extraordinary U-turn. He has upped his offer for Xstrata and made Davis's exit a condition of the deal, though Davis will likely leave with \u00a38m in cash and \u00a338m in shares.</p> <p>The two men are well known to each other. Davis and Glasenberg <a href=\"http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/63345/whos-who-90b-mega-merger\" title=\"\">met at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa</a> and decided to cement their already strong business relationship into a merger of the two companies over a dinner in London last December.</p> <h2>2. Food</h2> <p>Droughts and floods have damaged this year's food harvest, though conflicting reports of the overall effect on global stocks often make it difficult to fathom the shortfall.</p> <p>Nevertheless, foodstuff prices are already up more than 20% since the spring and trading is frantic as a glut of panicky stories flood the media. Soybean prices are above the peak reached in the last food crisis in 2008.</p> <p>Glencore has grown over 20 years to be one the biggest food traders in the world, dominating the trade in wheat, maize and barley, edible oils and sugar. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business\" title=\"\">The head of Glencore's food trading business created a storm when he said last month</a> that the chronic drought affecting the US midwest would be \"good for Glencore\" because it would be able to exploit soaring prices.</p> <p>Chris Mahoney, the trader's director of agricultural products, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, the environment is a good one. High prices, lots of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage opportunities [the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from price differences in different markets].\"</p> <h2>3. Metals and Minerals</h2> <p>A merged company would be the No 1 producer of coal and zinc and the biggest independent producer of copper within four years. The European Union is understood to be concerned the company could become so powerful that its trading policies will influence the price of basic metals. Xstrata has a huge investment policy, with plans to open new mines from Peru to Namibia, increasing production by 50%, though the global economic slowdown has forced the company to mothball iron ore mines in Australia.</p> <h2>4. Corporate governance </h2> <p>Xstrata is based in Zug, Switzerland, for tax purposes while keeping a corporate office in London. It's the \"best of both worlds\" favoured by hedge funds and a growing number of global businesses. Glencore follows a similar model, keeping most of its business in Switzerland's Baar canton, while being registered in Jersey with some 50 offices in 40 countries. Glencore was a 400-strong partnership until it became a stock market listed firm a couple of years ago. As such it paid no corporation tax. Under new arrangements for companies with large operations overseas, it is expected to continue paying virtually no UK corporation tax. It is also accused by aid charities of avoiding tax in Zambia and other countries where it operates, which it denies.</p> <h2>5. Corruption</h2> <p>Mining ranks as one of the most corrupt industries, according to corruption watchdog Transparency International. Most minerals are found in developing world countries and poverty tends to influence the demands of local politicians and offials for bribes to gain planning permission an export licences.</p> <p>The merged company would be the fourth largest miner in the world and as such would be in the frontline in combating corruption. Both companies say in their annual reports they will not tolerate bribery or corruption of any kind. But <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-27/glencore-fined-500-000-euros-over-corruption-case-belga-says.html\" title=\"\">Glencore was fined \u20ac500,000</a> by a Belgian court earlier this summer after a European commission official was found providing confidential information on agriculture markets to the company. Global Witness, the campaigning charity, has asked Glencore to explain potentially corrupt deals in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The allegations, which were the subject of a BBC Panorama film, include the use of child labour. The charity asked for details of the company's relationship with an Israeli businessman who is key to its substantial mining investments in the country.</p> <p>Xstrata is not immune from controversy. Protesters in the Peruvian city of Cuzco have accused the company of contaminating local water supplies and sickening farm animals, which the company denies.</p>",
  "<p>Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond is set to clash with shareholders if he recommends the \"final\" $36bn (\u00a322.5bn) all-share bid made for the miner by commodities trader Glencore.</p> <p>Even though Glencore, Xstrata's largest shareholder with a 34% stake, warned it would not improve the terms again after making concessions to recalcitrant shareholders, several investors have publicly opposed the new offer, saying it is still too low. Talks brokered by Tony Blair last week between Glencore and the miner's second-largest shareholder, the Qatar sovereign wealth fund, led to the fresh proposal being tabled on Monday.</p> <p>But Qatar Holding is still believed to harbour reservations because of Glencore's stipulation that Xstrata boss Mick Davis should leave after six months. Bond would stay on as chairman of the merged group.</p> <p>Xstrata said its independent directors were considering the fresh bid and would respond by 24 September after consulting with major shareholders. Several City analysts said it would be hard for the miner's board not to recommend the improved offer to shareholders, as it had backed the previous deal.</p> <p>In the latest twist in the long-running saga \u2013 which began as a friendly merger of equals in February but has since turned sour \u2013 Glencore is now offering 3.05 new shares for every Xstrata share held, up from 2.8.</p> <p>\"Glencore confirms that it is an all-share merger and it will not increase the merger ratio further,\" the firm said.</p> <p>It now proposes that Davis, who would have become chief executive of the merged group under the original plan, will only stay on for six months before passing the reins to Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's chief executive. Retention bonuses worth \u00a3173m for 70 senior Xstrata executives requested by the miner remain, although Glencore asked the board to consider what changes could be made to ensure they are acceptable to shareholders. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/25/xstrata-glencore-tie-up-in-jeopardy\" title=\"\">The retention package provoked fury among investors and delayed the vote on the deal.</a> Davis would have received just under \u00a330m over three years \u2013 but the board will now have to decide what, if anything, he should get for six months.</p> <p>\"The interesting dilemma is going to be that the Xstrata board, having supported the offer at 2.8 and now being presented with an offer at 3.05, is going to find it pretty hard to refuse it,\" said John Robinson, chairman of Global Mining Investments, a fund managed by BlackRock, Glencore's biggest investment management shareholder. \"It now comes down to personalities.\"</p> <p>Some shareholders are still holding out for more. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/09/knight-vinke-xstrata-glencore-offer?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Activist investor Knight Vinke, which owns just under 0.7% of Xstrata, rejected the improved offer</a> on Sunday night as too low, arguing that Glencore's offer had changed from a merger to a takeover and therefore commanded a higher premium. Richard Buxton at fund management group Schroders, another Xstrata shareholder, also rejected the revised terms, saying \"the price is absolutely still too low\".</p> <p>However, Standard Life, which holds 1.4% of Xstrata and 0.8% of Glencore, backed both the improved terms and the changes to the executive governance arrangements.</p> <p>Qatar Holding, which upped its Xstrata stake to 12% from 3% over the summer, is understood to be happy with the new ratio of 3.05, even though it had originally pushed for 3.25. But it has historically supported the Xstrata management and was surprised by Glencore's new insistence that Davis should leave. Qatar will wait for the Xstrata board to consider the fresh proposal before deciding how to vote. Described as a kingmaker, it could block a deal \u2013 but is expected to go along with whatever the Xstrata board recommends.</p> <p>Former prime minister Blair intervened in the talks between Glencore and Qatar last week, after it emerged that Qatar would lead other Xstrata shareholders in blocking the merger. The Qataris softened their stance after Blair mediated late-night discussions between Glasenberg, the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani and their advisers. Blair works for JP Morgan, Xstrata's main adviser on the deal, and knows the sheikh through his work as Middle East envoy.</p> <p>Liberum Capital analyst Ash Lazenby expects the revised offer to get the Xstrata board's recommendation. Alain William at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said the \"3.05 ratio has a greater chance of winning approval from 'unhappy' shareholders, including Qatar\".</p> <p>John Meyer at Fairfax said: \"It will be difficult for shareholders to argue for a higher premium as the deal is still being structured as a merger rather than a takeover despite the ultimate management change and Mick Davis stepping down as CEO. Mick Davis is much better equipped to run the mining businesses than Ivan Glasenberg and shareholders who stay in the merged entity may look for assurances that most of his team remain in place.\"</p> <p>Glencore reserved the right to switch from a scheme of arrangement to a takeover offer with the consent of the Takeover Panel and Xstrata. This would only require backing from a simple majority of Xstrata shareholders, rather than the 75% of investors excluding Glencore stipulated by the scheme.</p> <p>If the scheme is not approved by shareholders, Glencore will have to walk away for 12 months under UK takeover rules.</p>",
  "<p>Sustainability in China is a complex problem, encompassing more than solar panels, hybrid cars, and green buildings. There are many reports on the country's deteriorating environment and the problems this causes - from air pollution to \"cancer villages\" near dirty factories, to the devastation caused by partially manmade droughts and floods. Yet, equally, there are also reports about the progress Beijing is making in green investments and how in some areas it is even leading the west.</p> <h2>How China defines sustainability matters</h2> <p>For generations, the notion of sustainability for most Chinese meant simply having enough to eat. For many, life is much improved. Since China started adopting free enterprise in the early 1980s, an estimated 400 million have been lifted out of absolute poverty and it now has a prosperous middle class. But unrestrained growth has brought problems of its own. These include rampant corruption, growing social unrest because of the widening gap between rich and poor, and a wide array of environmental problems.</p> <p>Looking at sustainability issues in China today, it is important for outsiders to understand the following:</p> <p>\u2022 China's issues of sustainability are not historically linked to private consumption as they are in the United States or western Europe; they are linked to the industrial processes that are supporting China's economic development model.</p> <p>\u2022 China does not see emissions as a problem that must be dealt with immediately. With millions remaining in poverty, economic growth is still the priority.</p> <p>\u2022 The largest pressure China faces to solve sustainability issues comes from within. External pressures or concerns about the planet as a whole are secondary.</p> <p>Simply put, the issues that China faces are largely tied to economic development, the problems themselves are growing in size and frequency, and China will do what it takes to fix those problems in a way that considers the needs of its people first.</p> <p>As we have seen in recent years, China's ability to manage stable growth and create a balance between economy, environment, and society has proven limited; nearly every day there are reports of another problem. This has the effect of creating a wider public awareness. In China, it is more personal, more tangible. Environmental and safety disasters are occurring in individuals' own backyards, and this is moving people to demand more from their leaders.</p> <p>For some, it is a strong central government that provides hope that China will make changes. Yet at times it is the system itself that hinders the process of identifying and solving problems.</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/25/chinese-rail-crash-cover-up-claims?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">high-speed train accident in July 2011</a>, where a strong central government plan to improve the efficiency of its rail network ultimately created a process whereby a number of safety procedures were overlooked to complete the project quickly.</p> <p>In addressing its sustainability challenges, China will employ a number of tools to help make the necessary adjustments. It is a process that has already begun, primarily in areas where economic development is the most advanced, and has involved policies, technological solutions, and awareness and engagement campaigns.</p> <h2>Policies</h2> <p>This is where many believe that the biggest changes will occur, as Beijing looks to tighten regulations and enforcement in critical areas of the economy to drive change. The most widely used tools to date have fallen into several categories:</p> <p><strong>Technology </strong></p> <p>With the dynamics and complexity of the issues that China faces, the role of technology (or cleantech) will play two prominent roles.</p> <p><strong>Awareness and engagement campaigns</strong></p> <p>One of the big questions is what the role of NGOs will be, particularly as agents of awareness. With a history of poor ties to central government, which often views NGOs with suspicion, only a few NGOs have been able to gain enough traction to stabilise their operations in more than one city, and fewer still have been able to do so with the full blessing of the government.</p> <h2>Getting rid of the bad</h2> <p>With so many environmental failures leading to social instability, China's leaders have begun to understand that changes need to be made to the old economy. This was made clear in 2007 when China's second largest fresh water lake experienced a massive algae bloom, which ruined a popular tourist destination and resulted in a water shortage for three million people for nearly two weeks. It was an \"AHA\" moment for many, particularly those nearest the lake, and it was one of the first tipping points where China's planners began connecting the dots between economy and ecology.</p> <p>China's problems are complex and growing. As a result of economic hyper-expansion and ignoring the damage that was being done, China's economic, environmental, and social resilience has diminished. While historically the costs of fixing the problems may have been seen as too great, the country is running out of options.</p> <p>This dynamic will lead to China investing large sums of money and time into solutions - some of which will be successful and some not - that are ultimately seen as social investments. Private investments in cleantech will have their place, but the pressure on firms to deliver their products and services with a lower profit margin attached is likely to continue.</p> <p>For China the next 25-50 years will be crucial. While the global discussions of sustainability are focussed around carbon emissions and the need to save energy, for most Chinese these are intangible issues. The Chinese people will continue working on problems that are tangible for them, such as health and safety. It will be a process that is largely driven by pragmatism and will at times occur off-plan, but the goal of developing a harmonious society will continue to drive them forward.</p> <p><em>Richard Brubaker is founder of <a href=\"http://www.collectiveresponsibility.org/\" title=\"\">Collective Responsibility</a> and tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChinaCSR\">@ChinaCSR.</a></em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><strong>Marks and Spencer</strong> was among the leading risers in an uncertain market, responding to bid speculation which refuses to die down.</p> <p>A number of reports over the past few weeks have suggested the retailer could be in the sights of private equity groups, and late on Friday there were further suggestions that bankers were working on debt packages to help fund such a deal. Most analysts remain sceptical, but nevertheless the retailer's shares rose 9.9p to 371.1p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> fell 26p to \u00a312.80 as its trading update came in below expectations, with another strong performance from Primark outweighed by a \u00a3100m write-off relating to its Australian meat business.</p> <p>Overall the market was fairly calm ahead of what promises to be another busy week for the global economy. Wednesday sees a key Germany decision on the European fiscal treaty and bailout fund, as well as elections in the Netherlands. The following day will see the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve, with many investors hoping Fed chairman Ben Bernanke will turn on the quantitative easing taps again.</p> <p>In the end the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished virtually unchanged, down just 1.6 points at 5793.2. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> The lack of any pressure to the downside indicates that buyers remain in control for the time being but the two major risk events this week, the German legal ruling and the Federal Reserve meeting, could change all that. </blockquote> <p>Mining shares were among the leading risers, with hopes that any Fed move would help boost global demand for commodities. Weak trade data from China also prompted talk that the country might take further measures to stimulate its flagging economy.</p> <p><strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 29p to 686.5p, helped by UBS ugrading its recommendation from sell to buy, while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> rose 27.5p to \u00a310.03.</p> <p><strong>Xstrata</strong> added 12.5p to 1026.5p as <strong>Glencore</strong>, down 8.05p at 370p, unveiled its final terms for its proposed merger.</p> <p><strong>BP </strong>was 3.1p better at 437.8p<strong> </strong>after it<strong> </strong>continued its divestment programme by selling $5.55bn worth of Gulf of Mexico assets to US group Plains Exploration.</p> <p>Back with retailers, <strong>Debenhams</strong> dipped 0.4p to 100p after news of another Sale and despite presentations to the City at the end of last week. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> Our heart usually sinks when we see yet another Sale brochure from Debenhams drop out of the Sunday supplements and this time Debs are promoting their \"New Season Event\" that kicks off on Tuesday with \"up to 25% off every department\" for 6 days. To be fair, this is actually a week later than last year's similar planed event, but it is noteworthy that analysts were taken around the revamped Milton Keynes store on Friday afternoon before all the Sale posters went up...However, to be ultra-fair again, Debs did give a surprisingly good presentation on Friday on space planning by Mike Goring, the operations veteran, who was clearly a good capture from Arcadia. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>UK Coal</strong> added 2.45p to 6.575p after the company said it expected to complete its restructuring by the end of December.</p> <p><strong>Ceres Power</strong> climbed 48% to 11.375p on hopes of a refinancing. The company has said it needs to raise an additional tranche of funding before end of third quarter - that is, the end of September - to continue to meet its planned expenditure. In August - in response to movement in its share price - it said it was continuing to explore its options.</p> <p>A second disappointing well result sent <strong>Chariot Oil &amp; Gas</strong> plunging by 66% to 33p. In May Chariot admitted its first well, at Tapir South, was dry, already raising questions about whether oil would be found at all in the Namibia block.</p> <p>Stuart Joyner at Investec slashed his price target from 318p to just 31p.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Falkland Oil &amp; Gas</strong> fell 23.5p to 67.25p after it revealed drilling operations at its Loligo prospect were five days behind schedule.</p>",
  "<p>The children's laureate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/julia-donaldson\" title=\"\">Julia Donaldson</a>, author of The Gruffalo, has begged the new secretary of state for culture, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/maria-miller-culture-secretary-dcms\" title=\"\">Maria Miller</a>, to step in and protect the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/libraries\" title=\"\">UK's embattled public libraries</a>.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/an-open-letter-from-the-childrens-laureate-julia-donaldson-to-the-new-secretary-of-state-for-culture-8119989.html\" title=\"\">an open letter</a>, published yesterday in the Independent on Sunday, Donaldson pleaded with Miller to take a different course on libraries from her predecessor Jeremy Hunt. About to embark on a six-week tour of the UK's libraries, Donaldson wants to \"draw attention to the erosion of the library service which is happening in so many local authorities, and to the current government's utter refusal to intervene or to provide any leadership\".</p> <p>Donaldson said that nearly 250 libraries are currently either under threat of closure or else have been closed or left council control since April this year, while 2,159 library staff posts, out of a total of 20,924, are set to be cut. Despite this, and despite pleas from campaigners fighting to keep their local branches open, Hunt and the libraries minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/05/library-closures-ed-vaizey\" title=\"\">Ed Vaizey have refused to act</a>, said Donaldson. \"When I met with Ed Vaizey in February and asked him why he had not intervened his reply was, 'Because my advisers didn't advise me to.' Could you, in your new post, please give him some guidance from above?\" she asked Miller.</p> <p>\"Mr Vaizey also told me that he 'did not accept' that there was any problem in the library service. This may be because he is happy with the idea (now a reality in some areas) of libraries being run entirely by volunteers. I am shocked that he could consider this anything more than a short-term measure,\" Donaldson said. \"Of course volunteers have a role to play, and of course it is preferable to have a volunteer-run library than no library, but what I object to is the tendency to dress this trend up as 'vibrant 21st-century thinking', instead of being honest enough to admit that it is a reluctant response to cuts.\"</p> <p>Donaldson asked Miller to consider ring-fencing council spending on children's library services, and to look into the possibility of using some of the education budget for this purpose. \"Above all, will you (unlike your predecessor) respond to concerns and complaints, and show some leadership for our young readers?\" she said. \"If children don't discover what books they like, they are unlikely to become life-long readers, and we are therefore heading for a less literate society. Illiteracy leads to lower skills, greater social problems, higher crime rates, and a country less able to prosper in the global jobs market. So cutting libraries is a false economy. They are the best literacy resource that we have.\"</p> <p>The award-winning children's author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/alan-gibbons\" title=\"\">Alan Gibbons</a>, another vocal libraries campaigner, has also written to Miller since her appointment last week. \"I&#xa0;note that you have said it is ' \u2026 so important to ensure that books and reading play an important part in children's lives.' I assume that means you will end the damaging actions of your predecessor whose tenure saw library closures and their removal from local authority control, cuts to book funds, reduced opening hours and the sacking of librarians,\" wrote Gibbons. \"I also assume that you will convene at the earliest opportunity a meeting of library users, professional bodies, literacy organisations, authors, librarians' trade unions and other interested bodies to draw up a national plan to promote reading for pleasure. Anything else would surely make those words meaningless.\"</p> <p>On Monday, Miller told BBC Radio 4 that libraries had always been funded by local authorities, not central government.</p>",

  "<p>This blog, and thousands like it, is part of the IT revolution that's changing the world of books beyond recognition. I've said it before, but it bears repetition: not since the late 15th century, specifically the Gutenberg-Caxton innovations of the 1560s and 70s, has there been such a wholesale transformation of our literary environment.</p> <p>Yet, although the literary community \u2013 in the broadest sense \u2013 is part of this paradigm shift, it is odd, and slightly baffling, how little reference is made to it in poetry, drama or fiction. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/jeanette-winterson\" title=\"\">Jeanette Winterson </a>published The Powerbook in 2000, exploiting emails as a genre.

Otherwise, I cannot think (perhaps readers can help out here) of a contemporary scene or character whose narrative or development owes much, if anything, to the new technology.</p> <p>Well, why should it, you will say, and fair enough. Electronic media is/are a delivery system, a means to an end. The creative act of putting black on white remains unchanged, even if you use a screen to do it. A hundred years ago, writers weren't writing novels about typewriters and linotype presses. Mark Twain lost a fortune on <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/b-w-mark-twain-s-printing-press/772033\" title=\"\">a new printing press</a>, but that's another story ...</p> <p>So I was interested to read <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9522845/Shutting-out-a-world-of-digital-distraction.html\" title=\"\">Carl Wilkinson in the Telegraph</a> exploring the theme of writers who acknowledge the distractions of social media, Wikipedia etc. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author//zadie-smith\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith </a>\u2013 always at the cutting edge \u2013 has a note in NW, apparently, in which she makes a wry reference to the distractions of the worldwide web.</p> <p>Wilkinson develops this point to explore the impact of the new technology on our brains. As he puts it, \"the internet is not just a distraction \u2013 it's actually changing our brains, too.\" He goes on, \"In his Pulitzer prize-nominated book The Shallows: How the Internet is Changing the Way We Think, Read and Remember (2010), Nicholas Carr highlighted the shift that is occurring from the calm, focused 'linear mind' of the past to one that demands information in 'short, disjointed, often overlapping bursts \u2013 the faster, the better'.</p> <p>\"For the last five centuries, ever since Gutenberg's printing press made book reading a populist pursuit,\" he writes, \"the linear, literary mind has been at the centre of art, science and society. As supple as it is subtle, it's been the imaginative mind of the Renaissance, the rational mind of the Enlightenment, the inventive mind of the industrial revolution, even the subversive mind of modernism. It may soon be yesterday's mind.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson continues: \"Our working lives are ever more dominated by computer screens, and thanks to the demanding, fragmentary and distracting nature of the internet, we are finding it harder to both focus at work and switch off afterwards. 'How can people not think this is changing your brain?' asks the neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University. 'How can you seriously think that people who work like this are the same as people 20 or 30 years ago? Whether it's better or worse is another issue, but clearly there is a sea change going on and one that we need to think about and evaluate.'\"</p> <p>Quite so.</p> <p>After a week in which the impact of computers on books has been confined to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/04/sock-puppetry-publish-be-damned\" title=\"\">news about \"sock puppetry\"</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/09/an-open-letter-to-wikipedia.html#ixzz25q0FlTTA\" title=\"\">Philip Roth whingeing about his Wikipedia entry</a>, it's time to consider the questions Wilkinson raises more carefully. After all, didn't Shakespeare have a character, Holofernes, in Love's Labours Lost who<a href=\"http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/LLL_4_2.html\" title=\"\"> \"eats paper\" and \"drinks ink\"</a> (a clear reference to booming literacy and the consumption of books an pamphlets)? Is it not high time we began to integrate the IT revolution into the creative process? Where, for instance, is the creative dividend of the new IT? A contemporary Holofernes might be expected to \"eat e-media\" , \"inhale tweets\" and \"drink at the Cloud\". In due course, if he can tear himself away from Flickr or his Facebook page, he might find inspiration for the first genuine e-novel, something of more significance and durability than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fifty-shades-of-grey?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades of Grey.</a></p>",
  "<p>BP has agreed to sell some of its Gulf of Mexico oil fields for $5.6bn as it builds up cash reserves ahead of potentially huge fines for 2010's Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p> <p>The British oil giant is selling its interests in older smaller fields in the gulf to Plains Exploration &amp; Production of Houston. BP will remain a major operator in the area.</p> <p>\"While these assets no longer fit our business strategy, the Gulf of Mexico remains a key part of BP's global exploration and production portfolio, and we intend to continue investing at least $4bn there annually over the next decade,\" chief executive Bob Dudley said in a statement.</p> <p>\"This sale, as with previous divestments, is consistent with our strategy of playing to our strengths as a company and positioning us for long-term growth. In the Gulf of Mexico, that means focusing future investments on our strong set of producing assets and promising exploration prospects.\"</p> <p>On completion of the transaction, BP will continue to operate four large production platforms in the region \u2013 Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Mad Dog and Na Kika \u2013 and hold interests in three non-operated hubs \u2013 Mars, Ursa and Great White.</p> <p>Analysts calculate that BP faces a fine of up to $20bn under the clean water act for the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The blowout killed 11 workers and pumped about 4.9m barrels of oil into the Gulf.</p> <p>Transocean, the company that owned Deepwater Horizon, said Monday that it was in discussions with the justice department to pay $1.5bn to resolve civil and criminal claims related to the US's worst offshore oil spill.</p> <p>Last week the US department of justice launched a withering attack on BP over its handling of the disaster. In court papers government lawyers said BP had made \"plainly misleading representations\" in its settlement proposals.</p> <p>\"The behaviour, words and actions of these BP executives would not be tolerated in a middling size company manufacturing dry goods for sale in a suburban mall,\" wrote government lawyers.</p> <p>The Gulf sale comes as BP looks to raise $38bn from asset sales by the end of 2013. The company said the divestment was in line with its global strategy \"of playing to its strengths, including the development of giant fields and deepwater exploration\". BP intends to focus on \"producing more high-margin barrels from fewer, larger assets,\" said the company.</p> <p>The sale brings the value of BP's disposals since the 2010 spill to more than $32bn. BP is also looking to sell its Texas City refinery \u2013 the site of fatal explosion in 2005 that left 15 dead and 170 injured.</p>",
  "<h2>Jo Debens, geography teacher, Priory School, Portsmouth</h2> <p>The geography department at my school has been leading the use of mobile device in learning. Throughout last year the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/geogrocks/mobile-at-priory-update#btnNext\">mobile@priory</a> charter was created and led by head of department David Rogers and co-constructed by students to enable them to use mobile devices in learning. This was trialled through the geography department and found great success with students becoming more actively engaged with their learning.</p> <p>Some of the examples of where we use mobile devices range from simply taking photos and videos to share in class or recording homework, to creating revision podcasts or animations. The point often is student choice, encouraging independent learning and allowing students to choose what approach will suit them. We have found that encouraging mobile device use has enabled our students to access resources that we cannot provide otherwise. For example, students access the internet for research (such as the internet or our department blogs/Facebook support page).</p> <p>On fieldwork, students can record images, video, sound, take notes, use GPS technology and mapping software to record information essential to their coursework. In school we have used mobiles to record work, for example the students used chalk around school to leave messages or symbols regarding social spaces and guerilla messages and then used mobiles to take images or record video or sound interviews of them discussing their work which could then be shared with the class. The focus is on the learning, the discussion on what they gained from the activity not on the device.</p> <p>One activity sees students investigating secret places in school - they have to find a space, and find evidence or clues about that space to share with others. Many use their mobiles to record sound or image clues to share. We also introduced a <a href=\"http://www.geocaching.com/\">geocaching</a> project where students hid Olympic themed geocaches at Box Hill and used mobile devices with GPS to use the geocaching.com website and online research before hiding their geocaches and then seeing them go live and have real people from the public able to find their work.</p> <p>The benefit for us as teachers is the personalisation, and the freedom for students to access resources. Often the lower ability children find mobile devices enable them to interact more freely and use tools to learn. We find that it encourages student voices and increases engagement.</p> <p>Originally some were concerned about potential cyber-bullying or disruptive behaviour but what we've actually noticed is that behaviour concerns have decreased since the policy was introduced, and that students are now being taught how to use the internet and mobile devices safely. It has never been about the devices, it is always about the learning. The devices are just the tool that enable young people.</p> <h2>Patrick Taylor - ICT and computer science teacher - Barnsley Academy, Barnsley</h2> <p>At the beginning of the summer we began a collaboration with Microsoft. We were already incorporating products from Dreamspark into the new curriculum at key stage 3 but introduced year 8 to Kodu. They welcomed such a new interesting tool which encouraged us considerably, as we had initially been hesitant about how learners would relate to Kodu, Gamemaker and Scratch.</p> <p>Microsoft and HTC provided us with handsets which opened up opportunities to support the curriculum. With this in mind I created an Introduction to Computer Science taster session covering mobile app design with resources extracted from the MTA and Microsoft school resources. This spanned over five lessons and allowed learners to decide if they would like to head down the computer science route or the ICT route. Learners will complete their MTA exams over the next academic year with some doing so at the end of this term.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.touchdevelop.com/\">Touch Develop</a> has been written into the scheme of work and is due to commence this week. This will be done with year 10 and span over five weeks. We are looking forward to the task with the first priority being to build colleagues' understanding of the possibilities this opens up as a teaching resource.</p> <p>One of the great things about working at Barnsley Academy is that colleagues are open to trying new technology and by being part of a national group, <a href=\"http://unitedlearning.org.uk/\">United Learning</a>, we are able to work with colleagues across the country in different schools and academies to pilot initiatives and develop best practice.</p> <h2>Nasim Jahangir, business and economics teacher, Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College, Leicester</h2> <p>I teach A-level business studies and economics and mobiles can be invaluable, I allow students to use them all the time. I set strict guidelines, phones only come out when I say, usually for group work when students need to research. If we have the access, why not use them? I appreciate I work in the post-16 sector so have less behaviour issues and students can be trusted if you set parameters from the beginning. To be honest, the students are pretty good; if someone is looking at something they shouldn't be the others tell them to get off it and get back to the task. I have a zero tolerance for any misbehaviour.</p> <p>Recently I have been looking at the business strategies of Marks and Spencer, so the students would use their mobiles to do research about what their competitors have done. It stops me from having to photocopy loads of stuff to take to the class. We can look at things that have happened immediately and then I can set them off on their own research. I don't always have access to computers so allowing them to use their phones gets round this issue.</p> <p>I am trying hard to get away from teaching from the front and putting the onus on the student. Students have their phones and in fact if you allow some use and take away the 'bogeyman' attitude they are generally quite mature about it.</p> <h2>Carol Rainbow, retired ICT teacher/ICT adviser</h2> <p>I used mobile phones with a group of seven to eight year old reluctant readers. The idea was for them to focus on reading and replying to text messages - the children's attitude to reading and writing improved and the children really enjoyed it. Mobiles engaged them in a way that books did not.</p> <p>From the teacher's point of view it took a lot of time preparing messages in 160 characters that pupils could respond to. I spent hours devising treasure hunts, splitting stories into very short lines, finding short riddles, curricular questions, sequencing exercises and more. 160 characters is not a lot to get useful information which requires a response in. As with so many things in the teaching profession it took time but if it helped the children it was worth it.</p> <p>I believe that Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is going to be a huge part of the future of education. Many students already have their own trusted devices, which they are comfortable using, it makes sense to use them in education rather than a machine that belongs to school which they leave behind at the end of the day. It is crucial though, before anyone gets hands on their own mobile device in school is that the infrastructure is made secure, that policies regarding e-safety are in place and the teachers are trained and confident about how the mobile devices can be used to enhance their curriculum.</p> <p>Once that is in place an exciting world of creativity opens up, mobile devices may enable wonderful, creative pieces of art, videos, presentations, audio recordings, research on any topic, various games to motivate learning and worldwide communication for those studying a language. They are available 24/7 so always and anywhere, learning becomes viable.</p> <h2>Eddie Falshaw, deputy head, Leighton Park School, Reading</h2> <p>Here at Leighton Park we have just updated our wireless network and have a new internet connection up and running too (akin to Terminal 5 I am told).</p> <p>Consequently, I am keen to use this for the best academic purpose I can. As a school we are not endowed with the latest hardware, but the majority of our pupils are. That is, they carry the latest smartphone or they have a laptop for use in the classroom. At present we have a 'ban' on mobile phones (unworkable), but we are now discussing how best to roll out the use of phones for educational purposes. We would like to start with the sixth form, encouraging them all to plan and organise themselves using our virtualisation programme, where they can access their school home page from any device. This way, homework, assignments etc can all be logged electronically, their timetables can be stored and teachers can communicate with them more readily. Then, we would like them to be used in the classroom in more practical ways, to enhance their education.</p> <p>The worry for us, is that the phones will be used more for social purposes, but that is where the education comes in. We want to teach our pupils to use them for educational purposes and not abuse it. While they will have access to their phones, it is only by showing them the potential, that we can begin to make tech work for us. Should our system be abused we will then revoke the privilege. E-safety will be a key concern, but our policy here is also under review. We are also keen to use it as a marketing tool \u2013 that we embrace and use tech - hopefully, as we roll this out, across the whole school.</p> <h2>Graham Barker, deputy head and head of e-learning, St Julian's School, Newport</h2> <p>We lifted the ban on mobile phones last term because we realised that the students (some 1600) of them had all got powerful computers in their pockets and we just wouldn't be able to afford to provide all of them with that level of technology. We needed to take advantage of the fact they all had mobiles.</p> <p>Obviously, the use of the mobiles is up to each teacher but we use a cloud based environment and so the children need to access that. They can do that with their mobile phones at the bus stop, at home or if they are waiting at school for something. With our move to the cloud we have got rid of paper-based diaries and so for their home learning they use their mobile phones. They have an app they use for their timetable. Many of the teachers are also using Twitter to give instructions to students and we are finding that has proved to be very popular.</p> <h2>Jos\u00e9 Picardo, head of modern foreign languages, Nottingham High School, Nottingham</h2> <p>Students use mobile phones regularly in our lessons to access current foreign language news and other authentic materials from the web that can be used immediately to inform group discussions and written expression. Other valuable language learning resources, such as online dictionaries, are also only a few taps away.</p> <p>Pictures and videos taken with mobile phones in our classroom are shared immediately with students using blogs, social media or tools such as <a href=\"http://evernote.com\">Evernote </a>for later access. In addition, a huge selection of foreign language podcasts and other resources are available for students to download and access at a convenient time and place.</p> <p>These few examples are just the tip of a large iceberg of new teaching and learning possibilities afforded to us by mobile devices. Their potential becomes apparent when you think of them less as phones and more as powerful handheld computers, complete with camera, speakers and a whole host of educational apps.</p> <p>A final thought on mobile phones' potential for engagement: have you ever wondered why students often forget their textbooks but never forget their phones?</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Jahangarpuri is the end of the line, the shiny new metro in India's capital city stops here. Beyond are the ragged edges of the city and dusty farmland.</p> <p>Satish has been coming to Jahangarpuri for two years. Every morning the 28-year-old squats in the stinking patch of wasteland used by local slum-dwellers as a toilet and injects himself with a needle picked up from among the filth. He says his family in an exclusive suburb on the other side of the city have disowned him but the drugs coursing through his veins render him incoherent before he can say much more. Satish recently switched from heroin to a cocktail of pharmaceutical substitutes.</p> <p>According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's recently released <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/26/global-drug-users-rise-un\" title=\"\">World Drug Report 2011</a>, stable or downward trends for heroin and cocaine use in major regions of consumption worldwide are being offset by increases in the use of synthetic and prescription drugs. The use of prescription drugs such as the synthetic opioids and sedatives used by Satish is one of the fastest growing \u2013 and least reported \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2011/August/death-for-50-rupees-misuse-of-prescription-drugs-in-south-asia.html\" title=\"\">problems in India and other developing countries</a>.</p> <p>\"There are more and more. We have a thousand or more users registered with us,\" said Rajeev Gill, an NGO worker in Jahangirpur. \"Almost all now use pharmaceuticals.\"</p> <p>Experts report similar situations across India, from Manipur in the far north-east to Bangalore, the heart of the booming information technology industry, in the south. The reason is simple, Gill says, being nothing more than \"a question of supply and demand\".</p> <p>Heroin costs more than 10 times as much as the cocktail of pharmaceutical drugs used by people like Satish. The pharmaceutical drugs are also cleaner, more reliable and more easily available. In Jahangirpur chemists sell a set of three drugs along with two syringes and needles for 50 rupees (65p). It is illegal to sell such products over the counter without prescription in India but is usual practice almost everywhere. Just to make sure, the chemists pay off the local police, NGO workers say.</p> <p>The addicts are thus drawn to the neighbourhood from across Delhi and further afield. Along with those like Satish, from wealthier backgrounds, there are men like Ramesh Kumar Sharma, who pedals a rickshaw in the city to earn around 400 rupees a day with which he tries to both feed his family and pay for his addiction, or 17-year-old Dhipender, a runaway from the poverty-stricken state of Bihar who was fatally beaten by fellow users last year.</p> <p>Such deaths are not rare. Of the 1,000-plus on the books of Gill's NGO, Sahara, 70 have died in the last six months. Many users are locals. Most of the young men in Jahangarpuri, a warren of rubbish-choked alleys largely without sanitation or a proper electricity supply, are jobless. Homes are crowded, money is tight, domestic violence and other crime is rife. With cheap readily available drugs on offer, addiction levels are high.</p> <p>\"It is a very big problem here. All my friends from when I was a teenager are users or dead,\" said Faqir, 32, who used to run a snack shop until his own drug habit forced him to stop. After years of use, Faqir has just been through a month of rehabilitation. There are no state facilities available so Faqir's family sent him to one of the dozens of private centres that have sprung up, unlicensed and unregulated. Run by former addicts without any training, treatment usually consists of effective imprisonment with dozens of other users in a single room and frequent beatings.</p> <p>Desperate wives and parents pay up to 5,000 rupees (\u00a365) to have a user picked up against their will in the hope that their habit will be broken. \"It doesn't work because if you are treated badly you are angry when you leave. You go back to drugs just to make a point,\" Faqir said.</p> <p>During his most recent period of detox he was not beaten, Faqir said, but he was not allowed to leave nor see his wife or two young children for 40 days. Now he hopes to stay away from drugs. \"The difference is that I have kids now. And I look at them and want to give them a future. But it is very difficult,\" he said.</p> <p>With the drug use has come disease. UNODC estimates the number of injecting drug users in India at 160,000, of whom more than a third are HIV positive. Jahangarpuri, which lies beside a national highway, is also a centre of prostitution for truck drivers, another key vector of HIV.</p> <p>Last week, as commuters rushed past on their way to take the metro into the city, 45-year-old Ramesh Kumar made his way down the alley behind the chemists to the wasteland to join other users among the faeces, the syringes and the discarded phials. He has been using heroin \u2013 and latterly pharmaceutical drugs \u2013 for 20 years. His family know all about his addiction. \"Every day there is a fight. Only my wife looks after my children. We have no money. I think first of the drugs and then only I think of them, but I can't stop,\" Kumar said.</p>",
  "<p>The world's only global system of carbon trading, designed to give poor countries access to new green technologies, has \"essentially collapsed\", jeopardising future flows of finance to the developing world.</p> <p>Billions of dollars have been raised in the past seven years through the United Nations' system to set up greenhouse gas-cutting projects, such as windfarms and solar panels, in poor nations. But the failure of governments to provide firm guarantees to continue with the system beyond this year has raised serious concerns over whether it can survive.</p> <p>A panel convened by the <a href=\"http://unfccc4.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/cdm69/templ/play.php?id_kongresssession=5255\" title=\"\">UN reported on Monday</a> at a meeting in Bangkok that the system, known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/26/clean-development-mechanism\" title=\"\">the clean development mechanism</a> (CDM), was in dire need of rescue. The panel warned that allowing the CDM to collapse would make it harder in future to raise finance to help developing countries cut carbon.</p> <p>Joan MacNaughton, a former top UK civil servant and vice chair of the high level panel, told the Guardian: \"The carbon market is profoundly weak, and the CDM has essentially collapsed. It's extremely worrying that governments are not taking this seriously.\"</p> <p>The panel said that governments needed to reassure investors, who have poured tens of billions into the market, by pledging a continuation of the system, and propping up the market by toughening their targets on cutting emissions, and perhaps buying carbon credits themselves.</p> <p>Governments have a last chance to restore confidence in the system when they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/29/qatar-bid-2012-climate-talks\" title=\"\">meet in Qatar this December to discuss climate change</a>. But few participants hold out any hope that they will agree to toughen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/02/55-countries-greenhouse-emissions-pledge\" title=\"\">their 2020 emissions targets</a>, which are scarcely even on the agenda. Instead, governments are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/11/durban-questions-and-answers\" title=\"\">focusing on drawing up a new climate change treaty by the end of 2015</a>, which would stipulate emissions cuts for the period after 2020.</p> <p>Under the CDM, developers of projects to cut carbon emissions in developing countries receive a UN-issued carbon credit for every tonne of carbon dioxide the project avoids. This applies to a wide range of activities, from building new windfarms and solar panels, and distributing more efficient cook stoves and lights, to the installation of technology on factories to prevent the release of certain industrial gases.</p> <p>The system was set up under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\" title=\"\">1997 Kyoto protocol</a>, after years of debate, but no credits could be issued until that treaty finally came into force in 2005. Since then, just over 1bn CDM credits have been issued.</p> <p>These carbon credits can in theory be bought by the governments which are obliged by the Kyoto protocol to cut their emissions, to count against their targets. In practice, however, with the US refusing to ratify Kyoto and big emerging economies such as China, India and Mexico carrying no emissions-cutting obligations under the treaty, Europe is the only market of any size. The EU <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/07/ets-emissions-trading\" title=\"\">has its own cap-and-trade emissions scheme</a>, under which heavy industries are awarded a quota of carbon they can emit, which they can top up by buying the UN credits.</p> <p>But the recession and Eurozone crisis have whipped the rug from under this market. As industrial activity has declined, and the after effects of too-generous carbon quotas early on work themselves through, few EU companies now need to top up their carbon quotas. To make matters worse, the current phase of the Kyoto protocol ends this year, and of the world's major economies only the EU has pledged to continue it.</p> <p>All of this has combined to bring about a collapse in the price of UN credits, from highs topping $20 (\u00a312.50) before the financial crisis to less than $3 each today. At such rates, many potential projects are not commercially viable. Financiers and project developers have abandoned the market in droves.</p> <p>MacNaughton warned that critics of the market, who argue it does not do enough to cut emissions, could end up regretting its demise, because the years of work it took to set up the market could not easily be replicated. \"This is a stable framework, with functioning mechanisms and standards and legal [procedures], and all the things you need for a market. People are assuming this will all still be there in a few years when they want it again, but I don't think it will [unless they act],\" she said. Even if countries decided on reform, no new system could start functioning before 2020, so the CDM could \"play a bridging role\".</p> <p>Mitchell Feierstein, chief executive of Glacier Environmental Funds, said the CDM had long been overshadowed by bigger opportunities for green investors. \"Carbon markets will exist [in future] but certainly not as they exist today,\" he said. \"Investment capital will continue flowing into the innovative technologies which increase energy efficiency while reducing global dependence on fossil fuels. Private capital is now more easily deployed in other investment opportunities without the bureaucratic hassles of the current CDM.\"</p> <p>But the CDM still has its optimists. Flora Yu, of the carbon specialist IdeaCarbon, said the market was likely to continue, as some countries \u2013 including Australia, China and South Korea \u2013 have been developing their own cap-and-trade carbon markets, which they will want to link to a global system. \"There is still a potential opportunity for the CDM, to further develop the amount of money and resources that have already been invested in it. We think it is not going to go away.\"</p>",

  "<p>The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games was not only the end of the competition; for many it was the finale of a summer of endeavour and achievement from competitors, volunteers and spectators alike.</p> <p>During almost six weeks of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London, our readers have shared their experiences and views of the sporting spectacle and of its impact on communities in London and beyond. We've heard from volunteers and those watching the events, to torchbearers and international viewers following the action from afar.</p> <p>At the end of what <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/09/britain-paralympics\">Jonathan Freedland has described as a \"golden summer\"</a>, you told us what your highlights of the Games and this summer have been and why:</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18172187\">shugsy</a></strong> reviews the opening ceremony of the Olympics and Nicola Adams' boxing victory:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overused sentiment yes, but certain moments reminded me that I am proud to be British.<br>For all the nonsense and negativity we ain't 'alf bad.<br>The highlight in sporting terms for me as a Leeds native, was Nicola Adam's victory. Heartburstingly proud. Danny Boyle's Opening Ceremony was the artistic highlight; the moment the forged Olympics rings came together: stunning, Queenie rolling with Bond, Isambard Brunel and Dizzee Rascal in the same ceremony: nowhere else in the world could or would produce beautiful nonsense like that. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/09/britain-paralympics?commentpage=3#comment-18174520\">FuadAlSakkaf</a></strong> adds a personal experience:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thank you London.<br>I have a hemiplegic son.

  "<p>Scottish fish farmers have been forced to use record amounts of highly toxic pesticides to combat underwater parasites that prey on salmon, raising fears of significant damage to the marine environment.</p> <p>Data released by the <a href=\"http://www.sepa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Scottish Environment Protection Agency</a> (Sepa) shows a 110% increase in the use of chemicals to treat sea lice in the past four years, mainly because the parasite is becoming resistant to treatment. During that same period, however, salmon production has increased only by 22%, to 158,000 tonnes.</p> <p>The agency said it was not carrying out any studies into the impact of the chemicals on the marine environment, but added that there was no evidence of any cumulative damage from increasing use of pesticides.</p> <p>Richard Dixon, director of the environment group WWF Scotland and a Sepa board member, said the figures were worrying. The Scottish government and salmon industry plan to <a href=\"http://www.scottishsalmon.co.uk/facts_figures/index.aspx\" title=\"\">increase output by 50% by 2020</a>, suggesting that there will be even greater use of toxic treatments against sea lice in&#xa0;future.</p> <p>Urging the industry to cut chemical use, Dixon said: \"News that the use of some pesticides has jumped in recent years is a worry and urgently needs addressing. It is doubly concerning as the industry is still in the process of expanding. Expansion of the industry should be predicated on the reduction in chemicals released.\"</p> <p>Don Staniford, a campaigner who was given the data by Sepa, and who has previously been deported from Canada for his activities against its fish farming industry, said he believed the increase breached the UK's legal duties to protect the marine environment. \"Instead of reducing chemical use, Sepa has shamefully sanctioned a doubling in the use of toxic chemicals which are known to kill lobsters and other shellfish,\" he said.</p> <p>The chemicals used are highly toxic to many marine species, especially crustaceans. The treatments use organophosphates, which attack the nervous system of sea lice and<a href=\"http://apps.sepa.org.uk/spripa/Pages/SubstanceInformation.aspx?pid=173\" title=\"\"> teflubenzuron</a>, which interferes with their ability to grow shells. Marine scientists have shown the chemical is extremely threatening to young lobsters, crabs and prawns, Staniford said.</p> <p>The salmon industry is expected to keep use of the toxins under strict control but has seen significant problems in Norway with the emergence of \"superlice\" resistant to normal treatments.</p> <p>Ecologists and campaigners argue there is compelling evidence that some fish farms are failing to use chemicals safely. Sepa disclosed last week that while a large majority were satisfactory or excellent, <a href=\"http://www.sepa.org.uk/about_us/what_we_do/compliance_assessment/2010_assessment_reports.aspx\" title=\"\">54 fish farms were rated as \"poor\" in 2011</a> \u2013 mostly for having too high chemical residues on the seabed, an increase on the <a href=\"http://www.sepa.org.uk/about_us/what_we_do/compliance_assessment/2011_assessment_reports.aspx\" title=\"\">51 found to be poor or very poor in 2010</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.salmon-trout.org/fish_farming.asp\" title=\"\">Salmon and Trout Association</a>, which represents anglers, said last week that its analysis of Sepa's seabed monitoring reports identified 137 cases since 2009 where salmon farms' environmental impact had been \"unsatisfactory\", with 64 rated as \"borderline\". It said other freedom of information requests had uncovered numerous cases where chemicals were used illegally.</p> <p>The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO), the main industry body, has <a href=\"http://www.scottishsalmon.co.uk/science/sea_lice/regional_reports%281%29.aspx\" title=\"\">disclosed consistent reports of significant sea lice problems</a>. In west Shetland last February, sea lice infestation rates are 584% higher than the recommended levels and on average more than 250% higher.</p> <p>While areas such as Orkney reported very low rates, in east Shetland, they were 222% above the threshold last spring. In northern Scotland, they were 150% higher both in mid-winter and in spring. In south western, Scotland, they were on average 79% higher last spring.Professor Phil Thomas, chairman of the SSPO, said the industry's critics were guilty of making simplistic \"tabloid statements\".</p> <p>He added: \"Are sea lice a problem? Yes. Because every salmon farmer in the world, indeed any farmer of any species, is always sensitive about the need to maintain low levels of parasites on their stock. It's exactly the same issue as ticks on cattle and sheep. The buildup of resistance as a general issue is a problem for all interests.\"</p> <p>Sepa confirmed it had done no studies into the overall impact of these chemicals on the wider marine environment, or investigated whether the sharp increase was justified.</p> <p>It insisted, however, that any adverse impacts from these chemicals were very localised and were very quickly dispersed in the sea. Sepa said it had a \"robust\" system of monitoring and enforcement to ensure breaches were minimal.</p> <p>\"Assessing medicinal use on a site specific basis is the most effective way of Sepa carrying out its duties, ensuring environmental protection and managing any impacts of the fish farming industry on Scotland's coastal ecosystems. In this way, we can ensure that each licensed fish farm is operating within the limits prescribed,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>\"The effects of sea louse medicine residues on the environment are localised and relatively short lived.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's Friday evening and you are starting to think about a relaxing weekend ahead when suddenly the challenges you are facing as a leader come to mind: achieving growth in economically difficult times, continuously innovating to stay ahead of the competition, embracing change in an increasingly complex environment, being a visionary and engaging leader.</p> <p>While all of these represent big challenges, there is another challenge that runs through them all and is bigger than any of them. This is that leaders need to do things simultaneously that are commonly considered to be contradictions. Therefore, the biggest challenge facing those who want to succeed in the complex and fast-moving world, is learning to embrace paradoxes.</p> <h2>Paradox 1: growth versus sustainability</h2> <p>In the past, when asked about their ambition for their organisation, a successful CEO would have responded with grow, grow, grow. Year-on-year growth remains the measure of worth and value of an organisation. Growth as it is currently defined tends to result in an unquestioned and unchecked consumption of resources. Sustainability considerations are generally considered to put a major strain on growth ambitions. The way forward is innovation, but another paradox is inherent within this.</p> <h2>Paradox 2: innovating versus operating</h2> <p>Is innovation one of the top values or priorities in your organisation? If it is not then it should be. It is not all about the big, radical innovations, it is also about small, incremental changes; it is certainly not all about products but increasingly about service , process , business model and social innovation.</p> <p>However, focusing on innovation does not mean ignoring operations. Effectiveness and efficiency, cost reductions and streamlining remain critical aspects of doing business. The tricky bit is that the skills, structures, measures and processes that allow operations to thrive can seriously get in the way of innovation and vice versa.</p> <h2>Paradox 3: change versus continuity</h2> <p>If you are setting your organisation on course for innovation, what you are fundamentally doing is seeking change. The questions become innovation and change where? How much? In what areas of the business and why? What kind of innovation (product, process, service, business model) and what level of innovation (incremental, radical, transformational) should you be aspiring to? What should stay the same? If you try to innovate too many things at once you will end up with chaos, if you do not change at all your organisation will decline. What is the right balance?</p> <h2>Paradox 4: collaboration versus competition</h2> <p>Business is inherently competitive, competing for customers, market share, employees, finances and other resources. However, today collaboration is common, with most companies having collaborated with their suppliers and their customers. Beyond this, leading companies are going a step further and promoting collaboration through crowdsourcing or with competitors.</p> <h2>Paradox 5: complexity versus simplicity</h2> <p>Collaborate, compete. Change, remain stable. Innovation excellence, operational excellence. Growth and sustainability. All of these demands on leaders result in increasing levels of complexity, arising less from the number of options and possibilities, but rather from the number of possible, unpredictable interactions between these. Leaders must find ways to deal with this complexity and embrace and manage it to achieve simplicity.</p> <h2>Paradox 6: heart versus mind</h2> <p>On one hand there is the hard-nosed business world where decisions are based on facts and figures. On the other, there is complexity, change and innovation where predictability is hard to come by. Decisions need to be made in the face of incomplete analysis, unpredictable outcomes and changing circumstances. Gaining buy-in cannot be achieved using facts and figures that are truly reliable. People must be brought on board through other means such as vision, inspiration, engagement. The foundations for analysis and factual arguments differ from emotional and visionary engagement; people who excel at one are not necessarily particularly good at the other and yet both are needed.</p> <p>In the next article I will explore these challenges in more detail, propose questions to be asked and assumptions to be challenged and share some examples and insights on how these paradoxes might be reconciled.</p> <p><em>Dr Bettina von Stamm is director and catalyst at the </em><a href=\"http://www.innovationleadershipforum.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Innovation Leadership Forum</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Sometimes a film takes your breath away by dint of its brilliance. Sometimes it's on account of its ineptitude. And just occasionally, it's for its shamelessness.</p> <p>Hyde Park on Hudson, for all its captivating shots of cornfields and estimable performances, is the latter. This is a quite audaciously pragmatic product, which exists because someone has calculated that if you multiply <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137858/king-s-speech\" title=\"\">The King's Speech</a> to the power of Roosevelt and then add Bill Murray, the tills that rang out (to the tune of $250m) for Tom Hooper's film are going to be Liberty bell loud this time around.</p> <p>So: no-brainer maths, acted upon in lightning-quick turnaround time. It's just two years since The King's Speech premiered in Toronto, beginning its triumphal world tour conquering the global box office and being crowned victorious at the Oscars. Given its vaguely mockbuster origins, (it's adapted from a radio play) and its shotgun speed, that Roger Michell's film is also quite the charmer feels like a miracle.</p> <p>Hyde Park on Hudson unfolds just as Lionel Logan and Bertie's speech therapy would have been in full swing. It's June 1939 and George VI and his wife have travelled to the US to beg the prez to lend a hand in the impending conflict with Germany (that this didn't happen quite immediately is skated over in the closing credits). They're staying in the president's mother's upstate New York rural retreat, where Roosevelt is surrounded by clucking women (Olivia Williams is a good, gamey Eleanor).</p> <p>Samuel West gives us his best Bertie, which damps down the glamour of both Colin Firth's and Laurence Fox's (from Madonna's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142869/w.e\" title=\"\">WE</a>) while Olivia Colman is a less sympathetic and more realistic Queen Mum, semi-retching at the very idea of hotdogs, blinking with smiling scandal when Eleanor asks if she can call her \"Elizabeth\".</p> <p>So, Hyde Park on Hudson allows us a familiar peephole on world politics. We go behind the scenes on a radio broadcast in which a powerful yet disabled premier addresses his subjects. There are expository recaps on the abdication, plus contemporary chat about how to maintain a work/life balance. And, to show that the little people can inform as well as gawp, it gives the great leader a real-life crutch. While Hooper's film had Logue, so Roger Michell's has Daisy (Laura Linney), demure fifth cousin of Roosevelt, called on in the opening scene to distract him from world events. He shows her his stamp collection, then, soon afterwards, other treasures from the personal collection.</p> <p>This strand of the plot, which intersects with the summit in convenient tandem, is both Hyde Park's masterstroke and its undoing. Linney is terrific, and Murray, too, but he doesn't shy in showing that, in some respects, Roosevelt was as much the product of an earlier age as his buttoned-up house guests. Although we witness the fallout from his actions in both public and personal life, we end the film almost as in the dark about his emotions as we began. The King's Speech's killer blow was in making us feel like a monarch. Roosevelt \u2013 voted in, outgoing \u2013 remains remote.</p>",
  "<p>At the end of July, India experienced the worst blackout in modern history. At least 20 states lost power in three huge grid failures covering an area home to more than 700 million people.</p> <p>In one tiny village in very rural Rajasthan, the lights stayed on. Buttermilk machines churned, televisions blared and fans whirred, providing respite from the drenching humidity of the post-monsoon heat.</p> <p>\"We were sitting in the dark in our head office in Jaipur waiting for the power to come back on and yet in Khareda, where very recently they had no power at all, there was an unbroken supply of electricity,\" said Yashraj Khaitan, one of two 22-year-olds who made it happen.</p> <p>Khaitan, who is Indian, with Jacob Dickinson, who was born in San Diego, has a big plan: to bring cheap, sustainable electricity to at least one million Indians within five years through their start-up, <a href=\"http://www.grampower.com/blog/about-us/\" title=\"\">Gram Power</a>.</p> <p>Three months ago the engineering graduates from the University of California, Berkeley, chose the hamlet of Khareda Lakshmipura to test a simple solar-power microgrid which has the potential to change the lives of many of the 400 million or so Indians who are not connected to the national grid \u2013 not to mention the hundreds of millions of others in the world's biggest democracy whose electricity supply is erratic at best.</p> <p>Gram Power has already turned some influential heads. The two young men are mentored by Eric Brewer, vice-president of infrastructure at Google and a professor at Berkeley. Last year Nasa selected Gram Power's technology among the top 10 cleantech innovations from around the world.</p> <p>Reaching Khareda during the rainy season is something of a mission.</p> <p>From the princely city of Jaipur in western India it is normally a bumpy three-hour drive south dodging cows and potholes before dipping down to cross a barren riverbed.</p> <p>Yet when the Guardian visited earlier this month, the river was anything but barren. Getting to the other side involved very wet trousers and a ride in a somewhat rudimentary boat pulled by a man in a loin cloth. He swam at the front with a rope while cheerful passengers recreated the scene from Titanic at the back. However entertaining, it was a stark reminder of the very real challenges faced in providing essential services to rural communities.</p> <p>When we finally reached the village, locals were happy to show off the TV sets they had bought since Gram Power arrived. But the novelty of having electricity had already worn off. \"Now, they want <em>more</em> power,\" said Dickinson, who normally runs Gram Power's US operation. \"At the start, most of them wanted the cheapest connection, which provides enough to power a couple of light bulbs and charge cell phones. Now, almost all of them have upgraded so that they can run their coolers, fans, their buttermilk machines and, in some cases, their new TVs and DVD players.\"</p> <p>The microgrid requires a source of power generation (in this case a bank of solar panels), which is connected to a makeshift brick substation containing a bank of inverters (batteries which store power during the night or on overcast days) and a computer which transmits data back to the Jaipur HQ. Wires on wooden poles carry the electricity from the substation to each house in the grid, each of which is fitted with its own smart meter, which tells the user how much power they are using and what it is costing.</p> <p>Gram Power sells electricity in units of rupees (Rs) an hour. Prices compare favourably with the government supply, said Kaitan. \"A household with a two light and cell phone connection will spend roughly Rs75-100 a month as compared to Rs80-100 a month with the government connection that comes without a guarantee of the number of hours of supply.\"</p> <p>The pre-paid smart meters have caught the Delhi government's eye, particularly for their potential to curb power theft. About a third of the 174 gigawatts of electricity generated in India annually is either <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-31/world-s-greatest-power-thieves-keep-400-million-indians-in-dark.html\" title=\"\">stolen or dissipates</a> in the conductors and transmission equipment that form the country's distribution grid.</p> <p>Losses hamper work to bring grid electricity to those without it and contribute to what the Central Electricity Authority says is a 10% shortfall in meeting peak power demand.</p> <p>Gram Power's business plan is to make money selling electricity and by becoming a technology provider to the state. At the end of August the firm was hammering out a one-year deal with the Indian government to reach 120 villages, bringing power to at least 100,000 households, said Khaitan.</p> <p>The company is heavily reliant on government subsidies: next year a new law should give companies Rs150 for each watt of power they generate. There is competition for the grants: Gram Power is not the only company in India <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/16/india-solar-power-system\" title=\"\">investing in micro grids</a>.</p> <p>Its unique selling point is giving customers a standard 240VAC connection, rather than just a few LED lights. \"Our consumers can operate any and every household appliance depending on the connection type they choose. None of the competing alternatives, to my knowledge, are providing such a holistic solution on the electricity distribution side,\" said Kaitan, adding that his firm's \"core innovation\" is in grid monitoring, theft detection and a prepayment model that ensures payment recovery.</p> <p>Administering the scheme relies on recruitment and training of a local entrepreneur whom Gram Power entrusts with a dongle to top up the credit on each household's smart meter. He or she buys power direct from Gram Power and sells the units on for a small profit.</p> <p>In Khareda it's a 16-year-old called Banty, who lives with his parents and brother in a two room-house newly furnished with a TV and DVD player.</p> <p>Banty's mother, Lali Devimeena, said having power has changed the family's life. \"Now the children can study at night,\" she said. \"Before, living here was like being in the jungle. Now we feel as though we are actually part of society.\"</p> <p>Despite the challenges, Khaitan and Dickinson are thinking big. \"By the end of this year, I think we can very easily reach 500 households with our pilot grids. After that, the sky is the limit,\" said Khaitan, stressing that his technology was not just tied to solar power but could just as easily apply to biomass, geothermal, or any other generation source. \"Considering the strong response we have received so far and the magnitude of need in India and abroad, we expect to be catering to the order of one million homes in five years.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2012 to remove incorrect details about equity funding raised by Gram Power.</p>",
  "<p>Investors have \u00a310bn in Scottish Widows funds that have drastically underperformed in each of the last three years, according to a leading investment adviser.</p> <p>Darius McDermott, managing director of independent financial adviser Chelsea Financial Services (CFS), said that Scottish Widows' managed funds dominated his firm's survey of poorly performing funds, representing the highest number managed by one company \u2013 seven \u2013 on its list.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.chelseafs.co.uk/redzone\" title=\"\">CFS Red Zone survey</a> identifies the worst-performing funds over the last three discrete years, while the Drop Zone highlights the worst of the worst: those that have underperformed their sector averages over the cumulative three-year period to 1 August 2012.</p> <p>Among Scottish Widows' seven funds are three Halifax-branded investments: the UK FTSE 100 Index Tracking, UK FTSE All Share Index Tracker and UK Growth funds.</p> <p>Not all of the funds have lost investors money but they could have had better returns had they chosen different fund managers. Standard Life and JP Morgan came joint second with six funds on the list of worst performers.</p> <p>McDermott said: \"These companies run a large number of funds so you would possibly expect them to have a few more underperforming funds lurking around. It doesn't mean this performance shouldn't be addressed though, and perhaps begs the question whether these companies should concentrate on areas where they excel, rather than trying to be all things to all men.\"</p> <p>McDermott said that Scottish Widows was trying to tackle some of its performance problems by adopting an \"enhanced index strategy\" for some of its actively managed funds. \"Hopefully this will pay off, but the funds on our list are so far not included in these plans,\" he said. \"\u00a310bn represents a huge number of investors who should expect a lot better from those to whom they entrust their savings.\"</p> <p>The worst performing fund was <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=5MG&amp;univ=U\" title=\"\">Manek Growth</a>, which underperformed its sector average by 68% during the past three years. The fund is managed by Jayesh Manek, who after winning the Sunday Times Fantasy Fund Manager competition in 1994 and 1995 started a unit trust with \u00a310m seed money.</p> <p>By 2000, the fund was worth nearly \u00a3300m, but collapsed when the dotcom bubble burst and has performed poorly ever since.</p> <p>CFS said that Manek Growth has managed to lose its investors more than 34% in the last three years, compared with an average positive return of 33%. It is followed by UBS Smaller Companies and Allianz Global Eco Trends, which have underperformed their respective sector averages by 49% and 41% respectively.</p> <p>However, the most notable inclusion in the list of poor performers is the \u00a32.3bn <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=FISS&amp;univ=U\" title=\"\">Fidelity Special Situations</a> fund, managed for the last four years by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/20/business.fundsbondstrusts\" title=\"\">Sanjeev Shah</a> after its previous manager Anthony Bolton moved to Hong Kong to concentrate on the Chinese market.</p> <p>Shah initially struggled to maintain the fund's stellar track record and it dropped into bottom quarter of the UK All Companies sector, but performance has improved in the last 12 months and it has moved into the first quartile, growing by 20.7% compared with an average of 14% for the UK All Companies fund sector.</p> <p>McDermott said: \"Our analysis, frankly, makes for pretty depressing reading and I can only urge anyone invested in these funds to consider whether they want to remain invested or switch as quickly as possible to a better fund.</p> <p>\"The only exception I would make is Fidelity Special Situations. I've been a long-term fan of this fund and I'm pleased to see that shorter-term performance year to date has been good and hopefully signals the beginning of a turnaround.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for Scottish Widows Investment Partnership said: \"These funds are managed against a bespoke benchmark, not against the wider IMA peer group. Measurement of the success of these funds should therefore take into consideration the funds' actual objectives rather than a 'simple' peer comparison, as the sector is a broad sector with many types of funds with different objectives.\"</p>",
  "<p>The company exploring for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/shale-gas\" title=\"\">shale gas</a> in Lancashire broke the conditions of their planning permission by drilling beyond an agreed time limit and beyond a cut-off date put in place to protect wintering birds, it emerged on Monday.</p> <p>The revelation of the breaches by <a href=\"http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/\" title=\"\">Cuadrilla</a> \u2013 which came to light during evidence given by Lancashire county council's head of planning in a trial of anti-fracking protesters \u2013 come as concern over the regulation of gas fracking led three of the UK's biggest environmental groups to write a <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/media/releases/324050-take-foot-off-the-pedal-on-shale-gas-charities-warn-government-\" title=\"\">warning letter to the climate and energy secretary, Ed Davey</a>.</p> <p>\"It's appalling that Cuadrilla is unwilling to respect even the most basic safeguards in the earliest stages of exploration,\" said Caroline Lucas, Green party MP. \"Instead of cosying up to the shale gas industry, the government should impose an immediate moratorium on fracking, following in the footsteps of France and Czech Republic.\"</p> <p>The regulation of possible future shale gas production is controversial because the government has argued that existing rules protecting the environment are sufficient to ensure safe operation of the new technology. Opponents of fracking claim the blasting of gas from rock deep underground with water and chemicals endangers local water supplies and that the gas produced will drive further climate change. Supporters claim it can be produced safely, providing a low cost fuel which is cleaner than coal.</p> <p>Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, who has written to Davey with his counterparts at WWF-UK and Friends of the Earth, said: \"We're concerned that government is pushing ahead with shale gas extraction without clear safeguards in place to protect wildlife and people. The disturbance to wildlife and habitats has not been properly explored and neither has the risk of water contamination.\"</p> <p>The trial ended on Thursday with the conviction of Zoe Smith for trespassing on Cuadrilla's site during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/dec/01/fracking-lancashire-hesketh-bank-cuadrilla\" title=\"\">a protest in December 2011</a> when activists occupied a drilling rig.</p> <p>\"The regulatory authorities are hopelessly inadequate at their job and don't have the protection of the environment as a priority. Companies like Cuadrilla are allowed to flout their obligations with impunity, while concerned citizens are criminalised,\" said Smith, who was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/17/anti-fracking-activists-trespass\" title=\"\">third person to be convicted</a> after protesting at the site and was fined \u00a3250. Lancashire council has no current plans to pursue the breaches by Cuadrilla.</p> <p>Stuart Perigo, Lancashire's planning chief, told the court that Cuadrilla had drilled beyond the permitted 90-day limit. He also said the company had failed to meet a planning condition aimed at protecting wintering birds at a nearby sanctuary, by drilling beyond 30 September 2011.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/\" title=\"\">Cuadrilla</a> declined to comment until it had discussed the matter with the county council.</p> <p>Once the drilling had passed the 30 September, the company commissioned an ecologist to monitor the birds. He reported there was no evidence to show any specific impact of the rig on wintering birds.</p> <p>\"The company appear to have decided it was worth the risk of breaching the conditions as they have satisfied themselves that they could have proved that no harm was done to the birds if needed,\" said a source at Lancashire council.</p> <p>The ecologist, Pat Waring, declined to comment on his work for Cuadrilla. He also declined to comment on the suggestion by anti-fracking group <a href=\"http://www.risingtide.org.uk\" title=\"\">Rising Tide</a> that he had refused to give evidence on behalf of the prosecution.</p> <p>Cuadrilla's spokesman said: \"Waring's decision whether or not to appear is a matter for him alone.\" He added: \"We respect the fact that protesters have the right to represent their point of view but are pleased that the trespass and in particular the assault of our staff has been recognised and punished.\"</p> <p>Lucas said: \"Cuadrilla's flagrant disregard for the potential risks that shale gas exploration poses to local communities and the environment shows clearly that Cuadrilla's only interest is profit at any cost.\"</p> <p>In June, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/29/shale-gas-fracking-expanded-regulated\" title=\"\">report from the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society</a> concluded the UK's current regulatory systems were sufficient for shale gas fracking if they were adequately enforced.</p>",
  "<p>People often ask if regulators and legislators have fixed the flaws in the financial system that took the world to the brink of a second Great Depression. The short answer is no.</p> <p>Yes, the chances of an immediate repeat of the acute financial meltdown of 2008 are much reduced by the fact that most investors, regulators, consumers, and even politicians will remember their financial near-death experience for quite some time. As a result, it could take a while for recklessness to hit full throttle again.</p> <p>But, otherwise, little has fundamentally changed. Legislation and regulation produced in the wake of the crisis have mostly served as a patch to preserve the status quo. Politicians and regulators have neither the political courage nor the intellectual conviction needed to return to a much clearer and more straightforward system.</p> <p>In his recent speech to the annual, elite central-banking conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/31/eurozone-crisis-live-jackson-hole?INTCMP=SRCH#block-5040bfdfc0e3d642e636f0b4\" title=\"\">the Bank of England's Andy Haldane made a forceful plea for a return to simplicity in banking regulation</a>. Haldane rightly complained that banking regulation has evolved from a small number of very specific guidelines to mind-numbingly complicated statistical algorithms for measuring risk and capital adequacy.</p> <p>Legislative complexity is growing exponentially in parallel. In the United States, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was just 37 pages and helped to produce financial stability for the greater part of seven decades. The recent Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is 848 pages, and requires regulatory agencies to produce several hundred additional documents giving even more detailed rules. Combined, the legislation appears on track to run 30,000 pages.</p> <p>As Haldane notes, even the celebrated \"Volcker rule,\" intended to build a better wall between more mundane commercial banking and riskier proprietary bank trading, has been hugely watered down as it grinds through the legislative process. The former Federal Reserve chairman's simple idea has been co-opted and diluted through hundreds of pages of legalese.</p> <p>The problem, at least, is simple: as finance has become more complicated, regulators have tried to keep up by adopting ever more complicated rules. It is an arms race that underfunded government agencies have no chance to win.</p> <p>Even back in the 1990s, regulators would privately complain of the difficulty of retaining any staff capable of understanding the rapidly evolving derivatives market. Research assistants with one year of experience working on derivatives issues would get bid away by the private sector at salaries five times what the government could pay.</p> <p>Around the same time, in the mid-1990s, academics began to publish papers suggesting that the only effective way to regulate modern banks was a form of self-regulation. Let banks design their own risk management systems, audit them to the limited extent possible, and then severely punish them if they produce a loss outside agreed parameters.</p> <p>Many economists argued that these clever models were flawed, because the punishment threat was not credible, particularly in the case of a systemic meltdown affecting a large part of the financial system. But the papers were published anyway, and the ideas were implemented. It is not necessary to recount the consequences.</p> <p>The clearest and most effective way to simplify regulation has been advanced in a series of important papers by Anat Admati of Stanford (with co-authors including Peter DeMarzo, Martin Hellwig, and Paul Pfleiderer). Their basic point is that financial firms should be forced to fund themselves in a more balanced fashion, and not to rely so heavily on debt finance.</p> <p>Admati and her colleagues recommend requirements that force financial firms to generate equity funding either through retained earnings or, in the case of publicly traded firms, through stock issuance. The status quo allows banks instead to leverage taxpayer assistance by holding razor-thin equity margins, relying on debt to a far greater extent than typical large non-financial firms do. Some large firms, such as Apple, hold virtually no debt at all. Greater reliance on equity would give banks a much larger cushion to absorb losses.</p> <p>The financial industry complains that efforts to force greater equity funding would curtail lending, but this is just nonsense in a general equilibrium setting. Nevertheless, governments have been very timid in advancing on this front, with the new Basel III rules taking only a baby step toward real change.</p> <p>Of course, it is not easy to legislate financial reform in a stagnant global economy, for fear of impeding credit and turning a sluggish recovery into a full-blown recession. And, surely, academics are also to blame for the inertia, with many of them still defending elegant but deeply flawed models of perfect markets that create an illusion of safety for a system that is in fact highly risk-prone.</p> <p>The fashionable idea of allowing banks to issue \"contingent capital\" (debt that becomes equity in a systemic crisis) is no more credible than the idea of committing to punish banks severely in the event of a crisis. A simpler and more transparent system would ultimately lead to more lending and greater stability, not less. It is high time to restore sanity to financial-market regulation.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the IMF, is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012.</p>",
  "<p>When I start university this October, you may be surprised to know that the thing I am most looking forward to is meeting the international students. This is one of the reasons why I made the London School of Economics my first choice \u2013 I knew it was very multicultural, the complete opposite of the town in which I live.</p> <p>As the London Met visa scandal continues, it is clear many people have a perception of international students as immigration-rule dodgers at worst, or extremely lucky beneficiaries of a UK university education at best.</p> <p>But few people think about the extent to which students from abroad can improve the education experience for all those involved. International students bring much more than their money to the institutions that teach them.</p> <p>Of course, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2011/apr/13/overseas-students-degrees-uk-universities\" title=\"\">as Dr Tamson Pietsch writes</a>: \"Overseas students have been a welcome source of income for British universities.\" When it comes to tuition fees, international students pay far more than home students.</p> <p>This alone is a strong incentive for UK universities to recruit from abroad. The money they bring in can be used to provide new facilities or improve old ones to the benefit of all students.</p> <p>There are further advantages: international students help sustain the UK's academic research, particularly when it comes to subjects like science, engineering and maths. With <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq73qj3QslDedEtHdlk5T29Ea2FrMTVMMHRHam1mbEE 11:53\" title=\"\">international students accounting for around 45%</a> of the UK's postgraduate students, some research may not even be possible without international students wanting to undertake their studies in the UK.</p> <p>International students also have a significant impact on both national and regional economies, with a <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/e/11-980-estimating-value-of-education-exports.pdf\" title=\"\">Department for Business, Innovation and Skills research paper</a> estimating that they account for a contribution of around \u00a38bn to the UK economy. This includes off-campus expenditure as well as their tuition fee contribution. <a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/internationalexeter/pdfs/Oxford_report.pdf\" title=\"\">A report by Oxford Economics</a> estimated that the GDP generated by international students at the University of Exeter directly supported 2,480 jobs in the city.</p> <p>However, one of the most important benefits of international students is the way they diversify campus. Home students get a broader experience of life by learning alongside students from every corner of the globe.</p> <p>Personally, I feel meeting people with different values and beliefs will help me widen my cultural awareness, gain new perspectives and improve my social skills. I will be coming across people I probably wouldn't have met at all if I hadn't gone to university.</p> <p>LSE has a diverse range of societies that really reflect its multiculturalism, from the Czech and Slovak society to the Chile society. Many host events throughout the year, showcasing dance, music and drama. By attending, local students develop an interest in the culture and politics of other countries.</p> <p>In today's world, international students are good for UK universities and, more importantly, good for a multicultural Britain. It is essential that our universities offer them a supportive environment \u2013 for the sake of their home students as much as those from abroad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395914479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/5/22/1337679637344/Guardian-students-sign-up-001.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian students sign up banner\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian students sign up banner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

It argues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Disabled people are not just potential employees. While working at Merrill Lynch, Rich Donovan, who has cerebral palsy, looked at disabled people as an emerging market and found it much bigger than he expected: \"1.1 billion people, that's the size of China.\" He noted two trends. A generation of people who had benefited from disability laws is coming out of education and into work; second, as the babyboomers age, disabilities are spreading rapidly. That means rising demand for products and services for this unprecedentedly wealthy and consumerist generation.<br>Yet when he analysed companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, Mr Donovan\u2014who now runs his own firm\u2014found that only a quarter had a strategy aimed at these markets and only 6% were doing serious business in them. He has devised a \"Return on Disability\" index, which tracks the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. Over the past five years it has outperformed the broader stockmarket. Later this month Bloomberg will include this on its financial-information terminals.<br>Such approaches contrast with the way businesses usually look at disabled people: as charity cases, or as needing lots of box-ticking compliance rules and as the source of annoying lawsuits. Good treatment can make business sense, too.</p> </blockquote> <p>But perhaps the key test will be whether ministers' attitudes to disability have changed. Two families' distressing stories highlight the impact of the government's welfare reforms. </p> <p>Lucy Glennon has compiled a <a href=\"http://storify.com/LucyTweeting/welfare-reform-is-causing-hell?utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_content=storify-pingback&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;awesm=sfy.co_k8Me\">storify of tweets</a> in which Simon, whose fiance has a disability and son is autistic, describes his family's circumstances as they face a benefit cap and his fiance has been placed on a return to work scheme. </p> <p>And Sue Marsh has <a href=\"http://diaryofabenefitscrounger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/welfare-warnings-become-reality.html\">published a post by a mother of four whose husband suffered a brain injury almost a year ago</a>, in which she describes how she is fighting for rehousing as well as the rehabilitation and re-education her husband needs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I fight daily battles, not just on an emotional level facing the fact that my soul mate, my whirlwind romance, my everything, is not the man he was, and all the grief that leaves me to deal with, but surmounting this, then further battles with the benefits system, a car which is on its last legs and not having any idea how I would ever replace it\u2026<br>The system clearly does not work for people who genuinely need it. And I genuinely do!</p> </blockquote> <p>She adds that when she contacted her MP about her situation, she was told to approach the local council. Introducing the guest post, Marsh writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... we spent two years or so warning what the Welfare Reform Bill 2010-11 would do. We were accused of scaremongering, of hyperbole. But we knew what was coming. We knew what this so dreadful piece of legislation was going to do. Though the Government refused to conduct an overall impact assessment, we knew what the overall impact would be. Why? Because the bill, now an act, was referring to our lives.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19539090\">TUC says 'manage economy like the Olympics'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074577/youth-leaders-dedicated-minister-represent-sector\">Youth work leaders call for a dedicated minister to represent the sector</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/07/09/2012/118506/council-pays-out-50000-for-not-meeting-disabled-mans-needs.htm\">Council pays out \u00a350,000 for not meeting disabled man's needs</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-plans-to-cut-thousands-of-health-and-safety-inspections-8120984.html\">Government plans to cut thousands of health and safety inspections</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/care/labour-promises-to-improve-housing-for-elderly/6523662.article\">Labour promises to improve housing for elderly</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106867\">Olympics legacy begins with travel investigation</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/tax-freeze-timing-questioned/\">Tax freeze timing questioned</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9531622/Iain-Duncan-Smith-told-millions-will-struggle-to-claim-universal-credit.html\">Iain Duncan Smith told millions will struggle to claim universal credit</a><br>\u2022 Wales Online: <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/09/08/welsh-secretary-david-jones-cornered-by-teenager-over-housing-benefit-cuts-91466-31795418/#.UEtyLXcNOXI.twitter\">Welsh secretary David Jones cornered by teenager over housing benefit cuts</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian weekly section</h2> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<h2>What is the farm bill?</h2> <p>The US farm bill is a multi-billion dollar piece of legislation that controls the federal government's spending on farm subsidies, food for the domestic poor, agriculture conservation programmes, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/interactive/2012/jul/20/business-us-food-aid-interactive\" title=\"\">overseas food aid</a>, among other things. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the first farm bill into law in 1933, and subsequent versions have been enacted at roughly five-year intervals ever since. The latest iteration will expire on 30 September 2012. Congress, which is back in session this week, has spent several months hammering out a new bill, which would control farm spending until 2017, but progress on the legislation stalled in July.</p> <h2>Has the new farm bill already been written?</h2> <p>Sort of. There are two draft versions of the bill: one created by lawmakers in the House of Representatives and another drafted \u2013 and passed \u2013 by the members of the Senate. The bills are broadly similar but differ in the range and depth of their budget cuts, as well as their policies on food-aid reform. Legislators will need to reconcile the two versions before a new farm bill can become law.</p> <h2>How will the new farm bill affect overseas food aid?</h2> <p>The US is one of the few major donors that still \"ties\" the vast majority of its food aid, meaning that the food it distributes overseas has to come from US farms and be delivered on US-flagged ships. The 2008 farm bill included funding for a pilot programme that allowed a modest amount of food aid to be purchased locally \u2013 that is, in the region where it would be distributed. A <a href=\"http://dyson.cornell.edu/faculty_sites/cbb2/Papers/Lentz%20et%20al%20LRP%20time%20and%20cost%20Feb%202012.pdf\" title=\"\">recent study by Cornell University</a> showed that the pilot project cut the cost of food aid by nearly 50% and significantly shortened delivery time. The Senate version of the new farm bill would make that pilot programme permanent and slightly expand its funding. The House version makes no mention of it.</p> <h2>Any other food aid changes?</h2> <p>The Senate version of the farm bill makes it harder for NGOs and recipient governments to sell their food aid as a means of funding other development projects. The practice \u2013 known as monetisation \u2013 has proven to be enormously inefficient, as many NGOs have been selling the food that they receive from the government for much less than the food is worth. A US government report from 2011 concluded that monetisation resulted in the waste of $219m (\u00a3139m) over three years. The Senate version of the new bill would require that NGOs recover at least 70% of the actual cost of the food (and its shipment) if they decide to sell it overseas; the House bill fails to address this issue as well.</p> <h2>Why those differences between the House and Senate?</h2> <p>Members of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives were less swayed by the lobbyists pushing for food-aid reforms than their colleagues in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Interest groups arguing against potential reforms to the procurement and monetisation policies include shipping companies, agribusiness and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/30/us-food-aid-lost-waste-profit\" title=\"\">even some NGOs</a> that receive food aid from the government, fearful of the loss of the income from sales of that food aid.</p> <h2>Will the new bill change domestic farm subsidies?</h2> <p>Both the House and Senate versions of the new farm bill would terminate direct payments to farmers \u2013 money that's doled out regardless of whether a farmer does any planting \u2013 as well as countercyclical payments, which offer farmers income support when crop prices fall below a given level. At the same time, both versions of the bill would strengthen crop insurance programmes to help protect farmers from small drops in income. The draft bills also propose structural changes to the dairy and cotton programmes. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/19/us-cotton-subsidies-farm-bill-brazil\" title=\"\">Officials in Brazil and other cotton-producing nations will be closely watching the latter</a>, given that the World Trade Organisation has ruled that US cotton subsidies violate world trade rules. If the US fails to reform the subsidies, it could be left open to trade attacks on its intellectual property by Brazil, as ruled by the World Trade Organisation.</p> <h2>What happens after 30 September?</h2> <p>If a new farm bill has not been enacted by the time the current version expires, then what's known as \"permanent law\" \u2013 mothballed, out-of-date farm rules from the 1930s \u2013 will take effect. Nobody wants that to happen, so the most likely scenario is that Congress will pass a short-term extension of the current legislation, then take up the farm bill again in early 2013. But not everybody is happy about that. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/20/us-drought-inflation-food-prices\" title=\"\">US farmers are in the middle of the worst drought they've faced in half a century</a>, and pressure is growing from Democrats, farm lobbies, and deficit hawks for Congress to enact the new law.</p> <h2>Why do they not just vote on it now?</h2> <p>Politics. When the farm bill eventually comes to a vote, it will probably split Republicans, which could embarrass the party, politically. Republican John Boehner, Speaker of the House, controls the voting schedule of the House of Representatives. Observers say that Boehner is loth to put his fellow Republicans into an awkward political situation this late in an election year.</p>",
  "<p>After <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\" title=\"\">setting out from northern Norway last week</a> to witness <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">this year's record sea melt in the Arctic</a>, we reached the edge of the Arctic polar ice cap this morning. It's far further north than expected, at around 82 deg N, but the annual sea ice retreat here has been nowhere near as great as on the Alaskan side of the ice cap, where it has dramatically pulled back hundreds of miles further than usual.</p> <p>The plan was to send our Danish ice pilot and a photographer up in a helicopter to examine the ice scape, but it was far too foggy and the Norwegian chopper pilot wasn't going up for anyone.</p> <p>There has been much to see, though. Like two polar bears hunting just 150 yards from the boat. We sounded a respectful warning horn as we passed them on our port side but they barely registered us.</p> <p>More remarkably, we saw distinct human footprints on another ice floe. We are possibly 500 miles from any habitation, so whose footprints were they? Where had they come from? How old were they? Had the polar bears got whoever it was? The consensus view is that they could be a year old on a floe that has circulated hundreds of miles and travelled perhaps from as far as Greenland or Svalbard. They could be those of a seal hunter or a fisherman.</p> <p>We are now less than 500 miles from the north pole and the temperature is dropping fast. The plan is to press deeper into the ice to find a good-sized floe where the three scientists, based in Cambridge, Scotland and the US, can set up their instruments to measure ice thickness, wave action and how the waves change as they penetrate the ice.</p> <p>Nick Toberg from the University of Cambridge is working with Ettiore Pedretti, an engineer from the Scottish Marine Institute in Oban, to see how waves get under the pack ice and break it up. The impact of the waves on the rapid acceleration of ice loss in the Arctic is a little understood area and they have brought a buoy full of instruments which they will test. Next year they want to return with 25 more buoys to monitor wave action over many kilometres. The data could be vital to understanding how waves expose more water to solar radiation and allow the ice to melt from below.</p> <p>Julienne Stroeve, from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado, is here to track and \"characterise\" the ice we pass though. She mostly works from satellite data, but they can't tell the quality or age of the ice or the way it is moving.</p> <p>Greenpeace has its own plans, which I can't divulge, but what ice pilot Arne Sorensen is looking for is a stable ice floe at least two metres thick, 100 yards long and a little less wide. The Arctic Sunrise will then attempt to moor up against it. Then, polar bears, fog, time, weather, ice and much else permitting, we will descend on to the ice for much of the week.</p>",
  "<p>With homeowners struggling to sell in many parts of the country, it's a buyer's market out there. Vendors therefore need to make sure they do everything they can to secure a sale.</p> <p>We asked industry experts to give us the current top turn-offs for would-be buyers, and what sellers could do to avoid deterring people.</p> <p>While some were fairly specific \u2013 one estate agent mentioned a room full of dolls and doll heads at one property, while another talked about \"arty nude pictures of the owners on display\" \u2013 other complaints cropped up again and again:</p> <h2>Transport noise</h2> <p>\"One of the most common instructions from my clients is that they don't want to be able to hear any noise from aeroplanes or trains,\" says <a href=\"http://www.gabbyadler.co.uk/\" title=\"Gabby Adler website\">Gabby Adler</a>, a buying agent for clients around London. \"If your home is blighted by noise pollution, the obvious and hugely effective solution is double or even triple glazing.\"</p> <p>This, of course, does not come cheap \u2013 reckon on spending between \u00a3700 and \u00a3900 for each window \u2013 and it doesn't solve the problem of noise outside the property.</p> <h2>Dirty bathrooms and kitchens</h2> <p>Research by Rightmove among 4,000 buyers found that dirty kitchens and bathrooms were the biggest turn-offs, with more than half of respondents selecting these from a list of gripes which included dated decor and unkempt gardens.</p> <p>\"Kitchens and bathrooms are two of the most personal and well-used areas of the home,\" says Rightmove's Miles Shipside. \"Many potential buyers will try to imagine themselves living in the property during a viewing, and having their senses offended by a lack of cleanliness or hygiene can be a real barrier.\"</p> <p>As Shipside points out, this is pretty easy to remedy \u2013 get the Mr Muscle out before every viewing.</p> <h2>Odd looking plants in the garden</h2> <p>\"Although buyers pay more attention to the condition of the house than the garden, strange looking plants can send warning signals,\" says Robert Lazarus, sales director at north London estate agents Paramount Properties. \"If a buyer can't recognise a plant they fear it could be Japanese knotweed.\"</p> <p>This is described by the Environment Agency as \"indisputably the UK's most aggressive, destructive and invasive plant\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/08/japanese-knotweed-house-sale\" title=\"\">and can destroy the foundations of buildings</a>.</p> <h2>Sellers who show you round</h2> <p>\"There is nothing more off-putting than the vendor doing the viewings with the potential buyer,\" Adler reckons. She says this is happening increasingly as sellers attempt to save money by using online estate agents.</p> <p>\"It makes the buyer uncomfortable so they can't view the property properly. It's hard to say how much this would 'cost' you, but it will certainly take longer to sell your home: it could take six to nine months, for example, as opposed to three months. At the very least, ask a trusted friend to show potential buyers round to take some of the pressure off.\"</p> <h2>Clutter</h2> <p>\"Clutter is a killer,\" says David Newnes, director of LSL Property Services, which owns estate agency chains Your Move and Reeds Rains. As well as proving a distraction for buyers, having too much stuff around could give them the impression that there is a lack of adequate storage.</p> <p>If you can't bring yourself to throw things out, consider putting things in storage. Don't just store the big things; your home will look more modern if you pack away any ornaments and trinkets that usually sit on shelves, and would-be buyers will find it easier to imagine their own things in situ.</p> <p>Storage costs from \u00a315 a week for 250 cubic feet (roughly the size of four fridge freezers). Safestore's site includes a <a href=\"http://www.safestore.co.uk/size_estimator/default.aspx\" title=\"Safestore Size Estimator\">useful tool to help you estimate how much storage space you need</a>.</p> <h2>Coloured bathroom suites</h2> <p>\"Wildly coloured bathroom suites were regarded as the ultimate in taste in the 1980s, but can look pretty hideous to modern eyes,\" Newnes says. He claims such a fitting could knock up to \u00a38,000 off the value of your property.</p> <p>But it's relatively cheap to sort it out yourself: a white suite can be bought for less than \u00a3300, and if you use it simply to replace the existing fittings rather than reconfiguring the room you can get it fitted for a few hundred pounds.</p> <h2>Bad smells</h2> <p>Property finder Sophia Mose-van Woensel thinks a house that smells bad triggers the strongest negative reaction in buyers.</p> <p>\"They might not even notice it all that much at the time of viewing, while they're concentrating on the layout and state of the house, but the thing with bad odours is that they create a subconscious bad impression that lingers. It gives them an overall 'bad feeling' about the house,\" she says. \"That is disastrous, as you can't reason with that kind of sentiment.\"</p> <p>Make sure you put your bins out before any viewing and perhaps banish any old trainers to the shed.</p> <h2>Untidy communal areas in flats</h2> <p>Uncared for and messy communal areas both inside and outside a property put a question mark over how actively the freeholder manages it, according to Simon Bray, sales director at estate agents Hudsons Property.</p> <p>These are also often the first parts of the property buyers will see, and according to Rightmove <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/23/finding-right-property-instant-attraction\" title=\"Finding the right property  a case of instant attraction?\">people often make a decision to buy in the hallway</a>. \"Always keep them vacuumed and clear of post \u2013 sometimes it might even be worth painting it at your expense,\" Bray says.</p> <h2>Awkward layouts</h2> <p>\"With older properties, especially terraced houses, it is quite common to find the bathroom is either on the ground floor past the kitchen, or accessed via a bedroom which is not always ideal for young children or when guests come to stay,\" says Karen Seagrave of estate agents Barnes Kingsnorth. \"Other layout issues include dining rooms being set away from the kitchen so food has to be carried through another room before reaching the table.\"</p> <p>You cannot alter some of these issues easily, so instead make sure the property looks as good as possible and remember that you saw through those issues when you bought it, so someone else will probably do the same.</p> <h2>Death</h2> <p>Knowing someone has recently died in a property can immediately put some people off, as can any signs of dead animals.</p> <p>Mose-van Woensel recently viewed a property that had been empty for two years. \"I walked over to the pool and saw 12 dead pigeons floating in it, in various stages of decomposition. It was an awful sight and I couldn't imagine anyone ever wanting to swim in it. A pool can be cleaned and dead animals removed, but that kind of thing is certain to put off buyers and definitely won't give them the sensation that the house 'feels right'.\"</p> <p>Several agents also mentioned the number four, saying they had met Chinese buyers who were unprepared to look at properties with this house number because of its association with death.</p> <h2>Houses with lots of cats</h2> <p>However much a buyer likes animals, they may still recoil if you have a property full of moggies.</p> <p>\"This is especially off-putting in a family home when potential buyers worry about kids with allergies or asthma suffering due to previous feline residents,\" says David Warren, sales negotiator at Paramount Properties. \"Buyers also worry the cats might return when the owner moves away.\"</p>",
  "<p>A recent survey conducted by <a href=\"http://www.eef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">EEF</a>, the UK manufacturers' trade body, found that more than half of respondents saw red tape as a barrier to business growth. These findings are not very surprising \u2013 the easy target in all surveys of this kind is to blame lack of growth on external factors such as regulation, taxation, a sluggish economy, or inability to access finance. But how many firms with the ability to grow address the internal issues holding them back \u2013 things they can really do something about?</p> <p>Once a startup business is selling a product or service that is meeting a real customer need, it needs to recruit staff to grow further \u2013 and this is where problems often start. Many entrepreneurs go into business to be independent, but this often means they are unwilling (or unable) to share management because they are highly competitive and think that no one else cares about the business as much as they do. This creates their first real \"pain point\".</p> <p>At this stage in growth, many business leaders decide to play safe by retaining autocratic control of a lifestyle business, or sell up. To grow, businesses need to develop more structure and introduce team leaders, improve delegation and strengthen processes.</p> <p>A positive decision to grow often requires fundamental change to the way the business operates. But while reason says growth is risky, instinct says growth can be rewarding. If they are to grow in a coherent, sustainable way, businesses need training so they know how to do this. With the support of an experienced coach, they can embed knowledge and adapt it to the business's unique circumstances.</p> <p>This is where help from an expert outsider can really make a difference: it could be an entrepreneur who has been there and done that, a specialist training provider who can help identify skills gaps or simply a like-minded business that is in the same position.</p> <p>Take <a href=\"http://www.cricketerfarm.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cricketer Farm</a>, a business established more than 70 years ago in Somerset. The firm knows all about making healthy and low-fat cheeses from locally sourced milk. However, in a challenging economic environment, Greg Parsons, the managing director, wanted to introduce changes to make the business more efficient.</p> <p>It was a growing business with 60 employees and doing well, but Parsons felt there was room for improvement. He turned to specialist growth adviser Rhona Hope for support.</p> <p>Parsons's main goals for Cricketer Farm were to win business from food retailers through tendering exercises and to improve the leadership skills of managers within the business. Guided by Hope, Parsons introduced a business development manager to assess new opportunities and help strengthen the brand. This resulted in growth in export sales to countries such as China and opened up the opportunity to investigate new uses for products, such as grating, through product testing. Overall, the main outcome was that the business gained greater confidence in its core product and learned new ways to market it.</p> <p>To address his leadership challenge, Hope advised Parsons to introduce key performance indicators to share results across different areas and levels. This simple adjustment had a positive impact on morale, by making staff feeling included, working as a team and giving leaders clear parameters to develop their teams.</p> <p>Through advisers like Hope, who understand the challenges that businesses face because they've been there themselves, it is possible for training to have a significant impact on business growth.</p> <p>It is access to a network of growth orientated professionals that <a href=\"http://www.growthaccelerator.com/\" title=\"\">GrowthAccelerator</a>, a new \u00a3200m service for high growth businesses, is designed to deliver.</p> <p>A key interest point for growing businesses is access to a leadership and management grant worth up to \u00a32,000 per person (which must be matched by the business) for training members of the senior management team. This match-up funding is available to all businesses supported by GrowthAccelerator.</p> <p>Funding for this type of training can help the chief executive consider \u2013 for example \u2013 how to delegate effectively, to create a compelling vision for the business and communicate this to employees and clients, and how to plan for growth. It can also help the senior team consider how they can recruit, retain and reward talent, encourage ideas and innovation, and build stronger relationships with staff and customers.</p> <p>One thing is certain: there are many tough decisions for businesses to take. Stick or twist? Stick could lead to stagnation and steady decline; twist can be risky. Get it wrong and the business could lose everything. Get it right through taking advantage of the range of high quality support available, and the potential rewards are enormous.</p> <p><em>Stuart Walker is GrowthAccelerator's growth manager. </em><a href=\"http://www.growthaccelerator.com/\" title=\"\"><em>GrowthAccelerator</em></a><em> offers an integrated package of coaching, workshops or master-classes, access to a community of growing businesses and leadership and management support.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>When considering the future impact of technology on teaching and learning there is an element of crystal ball gazing. That being said, working for an organisation such as Microsoft offers me some unique insights into the plethora of new technologies that are becoming available, which, in turn, allows me to make the odd educated guess on this subject. We are all learning, though, and Microsoft is always keen to hear your thoughts and suggestions for how teaching and learning will be impacted as a result of emerging technologies.</p> <p>Before looking into the impact of future technologies on teaching and learning, though, I thought it would be useful to look at some examples and scenarios of how we are going to be using technology in the near future.</p> <p>Microsoft's Productivity Future Vision, shown below, does an interesting job of showing how some of the technologies we are already using, such as mobile, touch interfaces and location-based services, are going to potentially evolve and add even greater value to our lives in the future.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a6cNdhOKwi0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a6cNdhOKwi0 \" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>With some of the examples shown in the video already being realised, both in our day to day lives and in the classroom, there are also a number of trends developing that are creating the perfect environment for some significant changes in terms of teaching and learning, but also learning environments themselves.</p> <p><strong>Trends</strong></p> <p>The current economic climate - and the resulting budget cuts - is one of the most significant trends currently impacting the sector. As a result of the budget cuts, and the challenges and opportunities associated with these, schools are being required to do more with less.</p> <p>Another core trend that is impacting the sector, and society as a whole, is the concept of social connections. Through web apps such as Facebook and Twitter, the world is becoming increasingly interconnected and economies and cultures intertwine more and more. It is not uncommon, for example, for students and faculty in completely different geographic locations to connect virtually.</p> <p>Additionally, social media now dominates as a real-time feed for news, stories and world sentiment. You only need to look at the Arab Spring uprising to see the real impact of the power of social media.</p> <p>A third major trend impacting the sector, and arguably most relevant to the topic of this post, is technology itself. Recent advances in technology have created a wide range of new and exciting ways to engage with content and interact with our devices.</p> <p>Natural user interface (NUI) is a great example of this and the Kinect device has helped brought NUI to a mass audience that is extending much further than just gaming. The video below offers a great overview of this.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T_QLguHvACs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T_QLguHvACs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Touch and gesture is another major technology trend and you only need to look at how children as young as two and three can pick up a touch based device and instinctively navigate around the environment. Amazing.</p> <p>Additionally from a technology trend perspective, the cloud is a massive development and is changing the way that we consume and purchase software and services.</p> <p>The impact of many of these trends on education and learning is huge. The cloud and more ubiquitous connectivity is driving a significant increase in the blending of informal and formal learning. Driven by the digital content revolution, powered by eBooks and apps and so on, many students are studying when and where they choose and, in many cases, coming into the classroom already pre-wired with content.</p> <p>Web services such as the <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org rel=\" nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khan Academy</a>, <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm rel=\" nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\">MIT Open Course Ware</a> and a personal favourite, the <a href=\"http://www.codeyear.com rel=\" nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code Academy</a>, is helping drive this.</p> <p>We still have a long way to go, though, in terms of how we are taking advantage of technology within the classroom.</p> <p>Advances in cars, planes and even mobile phones have not been replicated in education, with some exceptions clearly. This is quite a broad brush statement, but if you look at a classroom from a 100 years ago and compare with one today, its almost like a game of spot the difference. They are almost identical.</p> <p>In some ways, our current use of technology for education is actually a way for telling us how far we haven't come. Outside of the classroom, students use a wide range of devices to stay connected. When they step into the classroom, though, in many ways it's like boarding a plane. They file in, buckle up, put their seat tables up and turn off all their devices. They are cut off from the outside world for the duration of the class and the use of social media and mobile devices, in particular, is off the table.</p> <p><strong>Back to the future</strong></p> <p>Even when we do look at how technology is being used in the classroom, much of the recent developments have been around automating/digitising traditional ways of learning. While these uses, such as eBooks, add value, I would argue that we need to go beyond just automation and digitisation to realise the full benefit of technology in education.</p> <p>Social connections and the web should play a key role in achieving this, but, if managed effectively, technology should actually be changing what we learn and how we teach.</p> <p><strong>Role of the teacher</strong></p> <p>So, if young learners are coming to class/lectures already pre-wired with content and connecting with peers all over the world, what is the future of the teacher in all this?</p> <p>With so much amazing (and not so great) content available, the role of the teacher is changing to act more like a curator or guide. The aim of which is to develop opportunities for young learners to have a more emotional connection with their learning material. With this in mind, the role of the teacher is more important than ever.</p> <p>But what about the role of the device on all this? You read headlines along the lines of \"digital devices have improved attainment in a particular school by 20%\". When I read that, I must admit, a little part of me dies inside.</p> <p>It wasn't the device that made the learner smarter. It was the teacher and student that improved attainment. The technology just serviced the journey.</p> <p>Therefore, it could be said that technology and bad teachers have no impact and little scale, whereas technology and great teachers have the ability to help the learner achieve their full potential. Food for thought.</p> <p>What's the next step?</p> <p>Creating emotional and personalised experiences using technology rather than simply digitising traditional methods is going to be key.</p> <p>There are many example of how technology is being used to create more engaging and emotional connections with learning materials - a great reflection of which is gaming in education. Gaming focuses on emotion. You can have funny games, scary games, adrenalin-inducing games, and I believe that we need to get to this same place with the use of tech in education.</p> <p>Games offer a wide range of benefits that are well suited to education, such as challenge, progression, reward and access to personalised real-time experiences. What's not to like?</p> <p>Furthermore, within traditional education, failure is seen as a negative thing. In games, however, failure is seen as a positive part of the gaming experience. With a new game, you die/fail often. With experience, you improve until you eventually become an expert and conquer the game. Why is it not the same in education?</p> <p>A radical change in the assessment process would be needed, but this would be more reflective of the workplace and would be particularly relevant in a world that needs to encourage and nurture more entrepreneurial tendencies.</p> <p>In her book, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/01/why-jane-mcgonigal-thinks-reality-is-broken-and-she-wants-to-fix-it/ rel=\" nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reality is Broken</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGonigal rel=\" nofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jane McGonical</a> talks about the need to play more games to address global challenges, including education. Jane explains this concept far better than I can in the video below. I highly recommend taking the time to watch the first three to four minutes, in particular, where she talks about the \"epic-win\" face.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dE1DuBesGYM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dE1DuBesGYM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>That's where we need to reach with education in general and technology can play a significant role.</p> <p><strong>Impact on teaching and learning</strong></p> <p>Ultimately, technology is going to have a significant impact on teaching and learning. The power of the cloud and more consumer-orientated devices are going to make anytime, anywhere learning more commonplace and accessible to all. Furthermore, with access to free, or very cost effective, learning content now becoming ubiquitous, the role of the teacher is going to evolve and become more important than ever.</p> <p>With an eye on making education more relevant to the workplace, and with a focus on Stem-based skills, building emotional and engaging connections with learning materials is going to be the key part in the next phase of development for teaching and learning and gaming in education is going to be an underlying theme throughout.</p> <p>Additionally, for further examples of creating more emotional learning experiences, our <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/11764579?rel=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Playful Learning ebook</a> is a great resource to download and review over a quick coffee.</p> <p><em>Tim Bush is UK education marketing manager at Microsoft.</em></p> <p><em>Content on this page was provided by Microsoft - supporters of the Guardian Teacher Network's Technology in Schools week.</em></p>",

  "<p>Peter Beresford's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/sep/05/policy-social-care\" title=\"\">critique of Paul Burstow's legacy as social care minister</a> pulled no punches, but history may offer a kinder assessment of the coalition government's record on social care after two years.</p> <p>To get social care name-checked in the priorities set out in the 2010 programme for government was no mean feat. An extra \u00a32bn in the spending review was far better than many expected, although undermined by 28% cuts to local government budgets (responsibility for which can hardly be laid at the door of the Department of Health).</p> <p>The coalition delivered on its pledge to establish an independent commission on long-term care funding, and while many of us have been critical of Treasury-fuelled resistance to acceptance of <a href=\"http://www.dilnotcommission.dh.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Andrew Dilnot's recommendations</a>, there is no doubting Burstow's tenacity in trying to secure commitment to change. Recent reports, indeed, suggest that the prime minister has belatedly been persuaded of the need to implement Dilnot.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportwhitepaper/\" title=\"\">white paper on care and support</a> has been published, its proposals having received a warm welcome from the sector, especially measures to improve the lot of carers in which he took a particular interest. The draft care and support bill paves the way for the most radical overhaul of social care law since 1948: a complex but long overdue consolidation that in itself is a substantial achievement and enjoys universal support.</p> <p>And amid the controversy surrounding the Health and Social Care Act, the relationship between local government and the NHS has been strengthened through the new health and wellbeing boards, which Burstow has championed assiduously. This reflects a commitment to integration which Norman Lamb, his successor, will share.</p> <p>Lamb's inheritance could have been a lot worse, and he can thank his predecessor for having done much of the heavy lifting during the worst fiscal environment in living memory.</p> <p>Taking a longer view, it is true that progress in developing a care system fit for the 21st century has been glacial, even when the economic sun was shining. A ministerial turnover of Premier League proportions hasn't helped: Norman Lamb will be the seventh care services minister in 10 years. All have been committed and hardworking \u2013 but small cogs in the vast machine of government where social care has struggled to register on the crowded radar of Whitehall politics.</p> <p>There are bigger challenges to come in the next spending review, the impact of the NHS changes \u2013 and crucially, as we highlight in a <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/case_for_change.html\" title=\"\">new King's Fund report</a> \u2013 how we transform the delivery of health and care to meet the needs of an ageing population and rapid growth in chronic illness. It is unlikely that the substantial of policy or its direction of travel will change as a result of the reshuffle. In the long journey of social care reform, it will be the big tectonic plates of politics and money \u2013 not transient ministerial merry-go-rounds \u2013 that will shape the future of our care system and the lives of people who use it.</p> <p><em>Richard Humphries is senior fellow in social care and local government at the King's Fund</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Maria Ellingham had not worked full-time for a decade after having children. She then became a single parent who had the will to work but lacked the way. She was a qualified reflexologist and wanted to set up her own business, but she needed to find the confidence and to learn the skills of self-employment.</p> <p>Yet in July, two months after taking part in a council-commissioned scheme, Ellingham launched her own reflexology business. A former account manager at a cosmetics company, she is among 54 people helped into employment or self-employment through <a href=\"http://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Central Bedfordshire</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bedford.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Bedford borough council</a>s' building enterprising communities scheme.</p> <p>The project, delivered by <a href=\"http://www.exemplas.com/\" title=\"\">Exemplas</a>, a skills organisation at the <a href=\"http://www.herts.ac.uk/home-page.cfm\" title=\"\">University of Hertfordshire</a>, which, together with the <a href=\"http://www.princes-trust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Prince's Trust</a> and the training group <a href=\"http://www.wenta.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wenta</a>, promotes enterprise within disadvantaged communities. Funded until June 2014 with \u00a3280,000 of European Social Fund money, it targets those considered hard to reach \u2013 parents returning to work, black and ethnic minority groups, former offenders, long-term unemployed \u2013 and offers them support to encourage self-employment.</p> <p>Ellingham, who heard of the project through her local jobcentre, says without it she would be on benefits. \"I wouldn't have set up by myself; I'd have given up, or still be applying for jobs.\"</p> <p><strong>Creating jobs for enterprising residents</strong></p> <p>The council scheme builds on a pilot sparked by the lack of local jobs. The 2009-11 pilot led to 15 new startups, from catering to dog grooming and children's entertainment companies, and 274 finding work either for themselves or for an employer.</p> <p>The project's aim is not to breed the next Richard Branson but to remove the barriers to work, targeting communities at the grassroots. Instead of relying on leaflets, posters and websites, staff engage participants in sessions at community venues and neighbourhood events, faith groups and children's centres, as well as more conventionally through the network of jobcentres.</p> <p>Crucially, explains Liz Wade, assistant director, economic growth, skills and regeneration at Central Bedfordshire council, the scheme is not \"anonymous\". It is not delivered by different council officials, but by business and employment experts with whom participants build a relationship. \"This is not the local authority saying 'You have to work',\" she says.</p> <p>To make it accessible to all, there are translators for those whose first language is not English, and single-sex sessions are available to honour cultural differences.</p> <p>Workshops promote enterprise as a valid employment option (one introductory session is entitled \"Can you give yourself a job?\"), while others explore coaching, business skills, local financial support and networking. Most people are supported for a few weeks or months, and there is special advice for young people from the Princes's Trust.</p> <p>Maria Ellingham's first session involved discussing a business plan and exploring email, websites and events for marketing. Ellingham had four hour-long sessions in as many weeks, learning about book-keeping and how to criticise her own work constructively.</p> <p>She still regards her adviser as a mentor, adding that a bonus to the scheme was its flexibility. Not only could she arrange sessions around her two children, but self-employment proved a practical option for a single parent. Those with caring responsibilities are also able to draw on additional EU funding. \"We can get an extension to a current care contract or get a carer [to stay with the person being cared for when someone has a workshop to go to],\" says Wade.</p> <p><strong>Lessons for all</strong></p> <p>But the councils have learned some important lessons from the scheme. The major question over its value has been long-term sustainability; the project can get people into jobs \u2013 self-employed or otherwise \u2013 but is there any guarantee they will remain in work? While there are as yet no statistics available, Wade says one emerging answer is to treat participants as a community of peer supporters: \"We're getting a group [together] which can be self-supporting \u2013 they do it informally and we arrange networking too.\"</p> <p>Another lesson for council commissioners is recognising that private or third sector partners are the real experts. They know how, and where, a contract should be delivered. Wade says councils should learn to be more strategic about the commissioning process, \"not be so constrained in contracting, offering flexibility [not choosing to] squeeze them and say 'That was not in the contract'.\"</p> <p>The ability to draw on partners' strengths and resources is key to success in council employment projects, agrees Anne Stilton, delivery manager at Exemplas. \"Flexibility and creativity are needed to ensure people's longer-term support needs can be met \u2026 Exemplas and its partners have provided match and in-kind funding to ensure the success of the project.\"</p> <p>Such is the success of the work that it has been shortlisted for awards. Exemplas is now working with others in the public sector to deliver the pioneering model elsewhere. In Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire and Essex, the organisation provides self-employment support for the <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Department of Work and Pensions</a>' disability employment project contract, managed by the <a href=\"http://www.shaw-trust.org.uk/home\" title=\"\">Shaw Trust</a>.</p> <p>Stilton claims that the success of this scheme is down to a tailor-made employment advice combined with very local engagement. \"Getting out and meeting people in their own day-to-day environment is an effective way of reaching many of the traditionally hard-to-reach groups \u2026 the scheme stands out for its results, that so many people in disadvantaged communities have been able to change their lives,\" she says.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more news, views and the latest council jobs in your area</strong></p>",
  "<p>The fire is out. The flame that lit up London for the best part of six golden weeks has flickered its last, extinguished in a closing ceremony that brought an end to the Paralympic Games and so to Britain's Olympic summer. Sunday night marked the end of a season of wonder that seemed to surprise the hosts as much as the guests, a period where we looked in the mirror and were met by an unexpected reflection \u2013 one we rather liked.</p> <p>The end came in an extravaganza of fire and light that deployed the now-familiar London 2012 combination of the surreal and the spectacular. The athletes paraded and a member of the royal family made a grand entrance \u2013 Prince Edward this time \u2013 but so too did a motorcade of steampunk vehicles that were part Terry Gilliam, part Heath Robinson, interspersed with dancers in gorgeous costumes and performers doing wild stunts, all backed by the reliable stadium-rock of Coldplay. The audience may not have divined a clear storyline, but it hardly mattered. They wanted to drink in the spirit of London 2012 while they still could, as if they were catching the last rays of a summer sun that had warmed them so well.</p> <p>And so concluded what was surely the most successful Paralympic Games since the first such competition \u2013 an archery contest among 16 disabled war veterans staged at Stoke Mandeville hospital on 28 July 1948, the opening day of the last London Olympics. This time, 64 years later, athletes competed in venues that were uniformly packed, stadiums as full as those at the Olympics a fortnight earlier thanks to a record-smashing advance sale of more than 2.4m tickets.</p> <p>The result was what the sociologists call an \"educable moment\" for the people of this country on a topic that for many has been barely visible and rarely discussed. The subject is disability, more complicated than anything thrown up by the Olympics, but revealed in a new light by the events of the past 10 days.</p> <p>The Paralympic purists would rather we didn't labour the point, preferring our focus to be on the Games as elite sport, no more and no less. The media manual from the British Paralympic Association instructed journalists: \"Anything specifically relating to, or focusing on, an elite athlete's impairment is generally considered unnecessary.\"</p> <p>Plenty of those who got hooked would agree, noting that after an initial adjustment, spectators and TV viewers did indeed start watching the Paralympics the way they watched any other sport, rooting for the home team, willing them to victory.</p> <p>Those who made the stadium roar on Thursday night for David Weir, Hannah Cockroft and Jonnie Peacock were cheering the way they had for Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford on that super Saturday night in August: for supreme athletes of strength, power and grace. But there was more to it than that, a fact acknowledged night after night by Channel 4's much-admired The Last Leg, fronted by Adam Hills, an Australian comic with a prosthetic limb.</p> <p>In his closing show he recalled how the production team had regularly downed tools to marvel at, say, a one-legged athlete doing the long jump. The fact the competitor had only one leg was central to the wonder of the feat.</p> <p>The serially decorated equestrian Lee Pearson said as much when, ahead of these Games, he called on his fellow Paralympians and Games organisers to be less reticent about their impairments. \"Let's be interested in that,\" he said. \"If I watch disabled sport, you're intrigued about who is disabled, what's wrong with them and how it affects them in their sport and in their daily lives.\"</p> <p>If the choice is between emphasis on sport or on disability, perhaps the breathtaking sights on display over the last week and a half suggest an answer: both. For integral to all sport is the notion of physical endeavour within specific constraints, either of time or under the rules: what can a gymnast do on a wooden beam only 10cm thick, how many goals can a team score in 90 minutes? In Paralympic sports there are all the usual constraints and then an extra one: how fast can a man or woman run with this or that impairment? But the principle \u2013 maximum effort within fixed parameters \u2013 is the same.</p> <p>What many millions now know is that this produces not a lesser form of sport but, in many cases, sport of a more intense kind. If part of the appeal of watching rugby is witnessing the physical courage of players ready to throw their bodies in front of danger, then how much more thrilling is wheelchair rugby, a game that relies on the aggression and recklessness of athletes ready to slam deliberately into an opponent, even though that might mean one or both of them tipping out of a wheelchair? The stakes are higher.</p> <p>When Belgium took on Sweden on Wednesday, I gasped along with the rest of the spectators as a player was sprung from his chair and left sprawling on the ground. I assumed paramedics, or at least a couple of physios, would rush on to the indoor court to help him up. But there was no rush. Two officials conferred, debating not the player's wellbeing but whether his team had earned a penalty. The issue was sport, not disability. No wonder they call it murderball.</p> <p>Similarly defining of elite sport is the display of awesome skill. No one could watch Brazil versus Argentina in the five-a-side blind football without dropping their jaw at the players' close control of the ball, precise and delicate. Such control was outstanding in itself, but in those who could not see it was little short of incredible.</p> <p>And if team sports show off the human capacity for co-operation, then that's true of the Paralympics writ large. Plenty of people loved the sight of Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins rowing in tandem to win Olympic gold.</p> <p>But it was deeply, unexpectedly moving to witness blind runners circling the track, each one linked to a guide, who matched them stride for stride; to see goalball teams, each player blind, emerging into the arena in single file, their hands touching the shoulder of the athlete in front; to see those Brazilian and Argentinian footballers, forced to resolve their deadlocked match by a penalty shootout, helped by a coach first tapping on each goalpost, the sound guiding them towards the target. This was humanity at its best, working together to achieve what would be impossible alone.</p> <p>The world records might not be the same as those of their non-disabled fellow athletes, the times they run not as fast. But if sport is often a blend of courage, skill and teamwork then the Paralympics are sport all right \u2013 only more so. The name Paralympics hardly does the event justice: they are not to the Olympics what a paralegal is to a lawyer. In some ways, they are a more extreme version: they are the ultra-Olympics. </p> <p>But they are also the antidote to that Leni Riefenstahl strain of Olympianism, the cult of the body perfect which reached its climax in the 1936 Berlin Games. How appropriate that those first Stoke Mandeville Games were invented by Dr Ludwig Guttmann, a German-Jewish refugee from Nazism and its pursuit of a world free of both Jews and disabled people. For the Paralympics are the cult of the body imperfect, an insistence that even a flawed body can be glorious.</p> <p>All of this has been an education for the host nation. Irene Oldham, 72 and using a wheelchair to get around the Olympic Park, told me she had grown used to people's embarrassment around disability. But the past 10 days had been different. \"It's been an eye-opener, even for children. They're saying 'I can't believe they're doing this. They can do better than we can'.\"</p> <p>Nearby was the Nicholl family, including 10-year-old Jake, who admitted he was \"a bit freaked out at first\" by the sight of athletes missing an arm or a leg, but who now found the sport even more exciting than the Olympics.</p> <p>The shift was noticeable in the Park. If, say, an amputee in team colours went by in a wheelchair, heads would turn. Not because they were gawping at someone with a disability, but in case they'd spotted a Paralympic celebrity. They didn't want to stare; they wanted an autograph. Disabled people have long reported being ignored, mocked or even abused in the streets, talked down to or just not seen \u2013 but for 10 days, when Cockroft or Weir raced in speed wheelchairs that gleamed like ancient chariots, 80,000 people hailed them as heroes. As Sebastian Coe said in a short, pitch-perfect speech last night: \"We will never think of disability the same way.\"</p> <p>And this has not all been reverence of the familiar, triumph-over-tragedy variety (though there has been some of that). Instead these disabled athletes have been revealed in the same multiple shades as any other group of hyper-competitive super-achievers. Whether it was cyclist Jody Cundy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/31/jody-cundy-disqualified-anger-paralympic-cycling\" title=\"\">turning the air blue with rage</a> after he was disqualified or Oscar Pistorius being a sore loser in the 200m T44 race, it confirmed that Paralympian is not a synonym for saint \u2013 that a disabled person is also capable, as the Last Leg put it, of \"being a nob.\"</p> <p>If patriotism is self-congratulation on a collective scale, then Britain has good reason to feel patriotic. For we embraced these Paralympic Games as no other nation has. The venues were packed, that 2.4m figure five times as large as the 480,000 advance tickets sold in Beijing in 2008. The difference in treatment has been visible in media coverage too. In Britain it's been wall-to-wall on Channel 4 and with big, poster-style front pages on many of the newspapers. In the US the rights-holding network NBC has not covered the Paralympics at all, save for an hour or two on a niche cable station and a planned 90-minute \"special\" to be aired next weekend.</p> <p>Campaigners will say we should not pat ourselves on the back too warmly. Discrimination against the disabled is real and has not gone away deepened by benefits cuts; access in parts of London is still awful; there is even a risk that people might judge those disabled people not capable of swimming like Ellie Simmonds or cycling like Sarah Storey even more harshly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/paralympic-spirit-insults-disabled-like-me\" title=\"\">castigating them for not pushing themselves harder</a>.</p> <p>All that is true. And yet if staging a global event such as the Olympics and Paralympics is a test for a nation, then it is one Britain can justly consider itself to have passed and passed with distinction. These Games were efficient and well-run, lifted by 70,000 dedicated, welcoming volunteers. They showed a nation ready to cherish all its citizens, black and white, male and female, born here or born elsewhere and \u2013 we now know \u2013 disabled and not. For so long, it has been said that Britain is a conservative country. Well, the last six weeks, which began with an opening ceremony celebrating Britain as a place of social revolution, say otherwise.</p> <p>Of course we're not perfect. But if the Paralympic Games have taught us anything, it is that perfect is not everything. Leonard Cohen did not perform in the ceremony, though as it happens he was in concert in London at the very same time. One of his songs would have fitted neatly as an anthem for the Paralympic ideal, for it is a hymn to imperfection. \"Forget your perfect offering,\" he sings. \"There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Technology in schools has the potential to be the greatest of equalisers. Students within individual schools and across the country, or even world, could be placed on a level playing field and given access to the same learning opportunities. Of course this is a little idealistic given the current economic climate and the seemingly never-ending cost of keeping the technology in schools up to date.</p> <p>Technology should be available to every student in this country, and by technology I mean more specifically that they should all have access to a mobile, internet-connected device. Achieving this ideal (and the only hurdle one must overcome to do so is financial) would in turn, lead to the fulfilment of another, far more significant educational goal: a system in which every student has the opportunity to access more or less the entire sum of human knowledge and the people who are contributing to creating this knowledge.</p> <p>Technology in the hands of our students means that the classroom walls become almost theoretical; no longer would each room need to contain them and their learning, they would have access to everything and everyone that could possibly help them along in their learning journey.</p> <p>The internet can make every student and every school international like never before. How this manifests itself is limited only by what students and teachers are willing to invest in terms of time; the tools with which we can connect to the rest of the world are there, ready to be used.</p> <p>What you can do is enormously varied. You could start with a beautiful offering like <a href=\"http://www.panoramas.dk/\">www.panoramas.dk</a>, which offers you 3D tours of some of the world's most iconic building's and locations ranging from the Sacre Coeur in Paris, to the surface of the moon. Students are offered an immersive experience that helps them understand the realities of a place that you want them to research or understand.</p> <p>A more overtly obvious technology to utilise would be Skype. Skype can connect your classroom with any other. It can connect you to individuals, experts or colleagues that can offer insight to your students without them having to leave their own workplace. You could take the opportunity to make connections with schools from around the world and benefit from an exciting mutual relationship. You could ask American students how they're taught about The Great Gatsby or slavery or civil rights, you could ask South African students what it's like to live day to day, post-apartheid. These first-hand cultural experiences and reflections could be invaluable to your students, and more importantly it helps reinforce the idea of global citizenship.</p> <p>Plus, open learning initiatives are making it possible to <a href=\"http://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative\">'attend' Harvard lectures</a> without ever leaving the UK.</p> <p>Never before has a generation been so connected and so mobile. I think that we have a responsibility to educate them in how to make these connections in a responsible, thoughtful and productive way.</p> <p>Social media connects us to people that we may never meet and yet lasting bonds and friendships can be forged. Twitter allows us constant snapshots of millions of people, be they celebrities, academics, experts or simply people like us. Twitter is a great tool for finding people and resources that could never have been accessed 20 years ago.</p> <p>Students no longer need to learn things second hand, they can go straight to the expert, leaving classroom teachers more time to prepare follow-up material or embellish this learning in different ways. Similarly, the internet also allows you a whole new world of peer-assessment. As you or your student may look and listen to the wise words of others, you can become those wise words in a number of different formats. YouTube for example, lets your students voice an opinion or an idea to the rest of the world, and it's just possible, that if they get it right, the rest of the world might respond. This kind of global feedback is utterly incredible and frankly inspiring, and the power of something like this as a learning tool cannot be underestimated.</p> <p>Technology also makes the things we already do, easier. Tools like online documents and office suites mean that writing a collaborative essay no longer has to be awkward and messy. True, simultaneous collaboration can happen and lead to some fascinating results. This is a great tool for homework for example, where group activities tend to fall apart. But, what if you used the same programme to allow students to write collaboratively with someone on the other side of the world? How much bigger would the stakes seem for your students? How much more engaging and exciting would it seem for everyone involved. How much more likely would they be to never forget that piece of work?</p> <p>Technology used well can be inspiring. Technology used well can break down boundaries.</p> <p><em>Adam Webster is an assistant director of learning and teaching at Caterham School and his responsibility is primarily based around enhancing the way technology is used across the school.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>As the new secretary of state for international development, Justine Greening, begins her first full week at DfID's headquarters, it's a good time to propose that the department supports a new global initiative to add transparency to government financial transactions worldwide. The idea is a simple one: governments should publish the contracts they sign with companies to deliver goods and services. And the UK is in a uniquely strong position to promote the agenda.</p> <p>Every year, governments worldwide sign contracts with private companies to provide around $9tn (\u00a35.6tn) in services \u2013 from running prisons to constructing roads to building rockets. The contracts between procuring governments and their suppliers outline who is to be paid what to deliver which services and when. But those contracts are rarely published, which is a shame, because the information they contain is incredibly useful.</p> <p>For bureaucrats, access to a number of completed contracts to provide the same kinds of goods or services (a 10km tarmac road over flat ground, or 10,000 packages of medical gauze, for example) provides models to emulate or mistakes to avoid, and can be used to build up more accurate cost and time estimates. That is a real issue in government contracting, where <a href=\"http://flyvbjerg.plan.aau.dk/COSTFREQ4.pdf\" title=\"\">planning expert Bent Flyvberg</a> has estimated that large infrastructure projects consistently come in over budget by between 20 and 45%.</p> <p>For companies, meanwhile, looking at existing contracts can help firms to decide if they want to bid when that contract is up for renewal, and provides information that will allow them to put together a cheaper, better bid. Again, that's a real plus in situations when completing a bid on a complex construction project can cost millions. And it has knock-on benefits for governments \u2013 because competitive bidding leads to lower prices. An <a href=\"http://www.eu-africa-infrastructure-tf.net/attachments/library/aicd-background-paper-11-unit-costs-summary-en.pdf\" title=\"\">analysis of World Bank-financed infrastructure contracts</a> in Africa, for example, found a strong correlation between cost overruns on contract delivery and low bidder competition for the original contract.</p> <p>Finally, for citizens, access to contracts allows people to know if they got what their taxes paid for. Was the new school built with the number of classrooms and quality of materials specified in the contract, or did contractors scrimp on quality and keep cash that should have gone on plaster and cement? Again, this can be a serious problem. An <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDOII/Resources/Roads_Paper_Final.pdf\" title=\"\">audit in 2010 of 18 Zambian road projects</a> jointly financed by the government and donors found that in all projects substandard cement had been supplied and that in half the projects the concrete was too weak. Sometimes, contractor fraud is linked to government corruption, but often bad contract outcomes are the result of incompetence, changing circumstances or simply poor procurement practices. Whatever the cause, contract transparency that makes it easier to understand when and why something went wrong can help make government procurement function better.</p> <p>And contract publication is a global issue, not just a domestic solution to a development challenge. First, poor contracting outcomes aren't limited to the developing world. In the US, for example, $745bn in federal contracts experienced significant overcharges, wasteful spending, or mismanagement over the period 2001-2006, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-26/the-u-dot-s-dot-should-open-the-books-on-private-contractors\" title=\"\">suggested a recent Congressional report</a>. Second, and especially for small economies with a limited stock of domestic contracts, being able to draw on a global collection of existing models in order to better write and price their own government's next contract will be a huge benefit. Third, contracts often cross borders as firms in one country provide services to people in another. Global contract publication will allow firms and civil society organisations to better monitor such cross-border contracts \u2013 allowing civil society groups in Ghana to hold a UK-based DfID contractor to account, as it might be.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, the cost of physically publishing contracts that can run to thousands of pages would have been prohibitive. Today, the vast majority of contracts are available electronically. Most governments haven't altered their practices to account for that, and inertia is probably the biggest factor. The most common argument against contract publication \u2013 that parts of contracts sometimes contain commercial or national secrets which would be complex and costly to redact \u2013 doesn't stand up. And we know that not least because <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/files/1426431_file_Kenny_Publish_What_You_Buy_FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">some governments</a> have started publishing the text of their contracts. They include the state government of Victoria in Australia, the US county of Miami-Dade, the federal and state governments of Colombia, and <a href=\"http://www.contractsfinder.businesslink.gov.uk/?site=1000&amp;lang=en\" title=\"\">the UK</a>.</p> <p>The UK system isn't perfect: searches on Whitehall's contracts finder frequently turn up documents with entire pages of price data blanked out. But the fact that Britain is already a leader in in contract publication is one good reason why DfID is well-placed to push the global agenda. Add to that the department's key role in transparency initiatives covering <a href=\"http://eiti.org/\" title=\"\">extractive industries</a>, <a href=\"http://www.medicinestransparency.org/\" title=\"\">medicines</a> and <a href=\"http://www.constructiontransparency.org/\" title=\"\">construction</a> that have been vital to opening up contract information in those sectors. And, finally, this year the UK is the co-chair of the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\" title=\"\">Open Government Partnership</a>, an international grouping of governments and civil society organisations that promotes commitment to greater transparency by member countries.</p> <p>A global contract publication movement is a simple idea that doesn't require a vast new international bureaucracy to oversee. It could start with a small secretariat of a few people, housed within an existing transparency organisation or the World Bank (in its role as a major international financier of government contracts, and as the sponsor of <a href=\"http://www.ipfa.org/news/15660/world-bank-institute-and-giz-first-global-open-contracting-meeting-johannesburg-october-24-26-2012\" title=\"\">open contracting</a>). The secretariat would support the development of guidance and sharing experiences in areas including publication format and commercial secrets and confidentiality.</p> <p>The bigger challenge is political \u2013 getting national leaders to sign on. This year, the UK has both the credibility and the bully pulpit to push for that.</p>",

It is also essential that specialists are available to help.</p> <p><strong>Professional support for volunteers is important: </strong>Volunteering is great but it costs money \u2013 and you simply can't afford to let willing but unskilled people loose on very vulnerable people. Both volunteers and clients need to receive the professional support that they deserve.</p> <h2>Karen Dyson, <a href=\"http://www.manchestercab.org/\" title=\"\">Manchester Citizens Advice Bureau</a></h2> <p><strong>Use a wide definition of vulnerability:</strong> Consider the various aspects of vulnerability. Make sure that staff, volunteers and trustees are trained to recognise issues and respond appropriately. Part of that involves creating an environment in which clients feel that they can disclose issues and have a say in how they are dealt with.</p> <p><strong>Think about how you explain and promote the improtance of your work:</strong> This is particularly important where complex issues need to be explained to a non-professional audience. Think about how you can monitor and evaluate your work and celebrate your successes.</p> <h2>Chloe Morton, <a href=\"http://www.beatbullying.org/\" title=\"\">Beatbullying</a></h2> <p><strong>Online safeguarding is important: </strong>We need to safeguard professionals in an online capacity as well as offline. We know that adults, for example teachers, fall victim to online abuse and often boundaries in online service provision require closer consideration than they would offline.</p> <p><strong>Engage with young people about the dangers of online services:</strong> We can teach this in the same way as we explain the dangers of talking to strangers. One of the biggest safeguards when it comes to the internet is education.</p> <h2>Jon Bird, <a href=\"http://www.napac.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NAPAC</a></h2> <p><strong>Very little resources go into supporting people who suffer in silence:</strong> The people who harm themselves in silence using drugs, alcohol, eating disorders and self harm are often overlooked. All these people could be described as vulnerable, some are a danger to others but the vast majority are not. Many don't get the support they need.</p> <p><strong>Operate with continual watchfulness:</strong> We run enhanced criminal record checks for all staff and volunteers but we know that this only identifies known perpetrators of abuse. We have to be very careful about who we allow to work with us and we therefore operate with continual watchfulness. There is no other way to keep the service safe.</p> <h2>Lyn Gavin, <a href=\"http://www.isa.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Independent Safeguarding Authority</a></h2> <p><strong>Be mindful of your duty to refer:</strong> The independent safeguarding authority does not have investigatory powers and therefore relies on the information you provide to help prevent unsuitable people working with vulnerable groups.</p> <p>A referal must be made when an employer withdraws permission for an individual to engage in regulated activity and if you think that the individual has engaged in relevant conduct, satisfied the harm test, or received a caution or conviction.</p> <h2>Molly Mattingly, <a href=\"http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Foundation for people with Learning Disabilities</a></h2> <p><strong>Values are important:</strong> One of the most important roles in safeguarding is to ensure that all staff have the right values of integrity and responsibility. They must promote physical and emotional well being, justice, fairness, equity, respect and instill confidence and self worth in those they support.</p> <p><strong>Get beneficiaries involved: </strong>Get to know people individually and look at each persons' gifts, talents and capacities. Set up fun and creative events where people get to know each other and share experiences. Another good idea is to have beneficiaries evaluate the services \u2013 we call this quality checking.</p> <h2>Smita Patel, <a href=\"http://timebank.org.uk/\" title=\"\">TimeBank</a></h2> <p><strong>Employees must be adequately trained and protected:</strong> It is essential that all our staff and volunteers are aware of and follow these policies. We have stringent procedures in place to screen potential volunteers. We talk to them over the phone, interview them face-to-face, take up references and take great care to match them with appropriate mentors.</p> <p><strong>Everyone must be aware of their role: </strong>Both beneficiaries and volunteers need to be aware of their roles and understand what they are expected to do. Our training addresses where volunteers' boundaries lie and what they should do in an unexpected or difficult situation.</p> <h2>Lea Milligan, <a href=\"http://www.livingwelltrust.org/\" title=\"\">Living Well Trust</a></h2> <p><strong>Freedom of information is essential: </strong>This comes through strong partnerships and needs to be balanced against protecting the individual. However this often means releasing more information, rather than less. The voluntary sector needs to step up its efforts to push through red tape.</p> <p><strong>Social Impact Reports are important:</strong> They are going to be more and more common place, so get on board and get advice now.</p> <h2>Giles Budd,<a href=\"http://www.lcdisability.org/\" title=\"\"> Leonard Cheshire Disability</a></h2> <p><strong>Safeguarding staff is vital:</strong> Employees have to work with people who can be challenging and create dilemmas for them. If you want to avoid situations like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/07/winterbourne-view-abuse-report-failures\" title=\"\">Winterbourne View </a>staff need to be recruited, developed and supported as part of everyday work to make sure that they are operating safely and appropriately.</p> <p><strong>Specialist staff can help:</strong> Within Leonard Cheshire Disability we have a specialist behaviour support officer, there to advise on supporting complex clients. We have customer care training for all staff to assist in developing skills and raise awareness of the customers' needs.</p> <h2>Eileen Docherty, <a href=\"http://www.collegeofsocialwork.org/\" title=\"\">The College of Social Work</a></h2> <p><strong>Values and ethics are key:</strong> I find the key challenges are making sure people have the right ethics and values, as we need to support people to live independently. It's about balancing needs, rights and risks.</p> <p><strong>There is a crucial role for social workers to play:</strong> This is particularly apparent when it comes to safeguarding vulnerable people. Evidence shows that many people still want the support of experienced social workers when they feel most vulnerable in order to manage risks and benefits and to build their self-esteem and aspirations.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The Guardian's Volunteer Week begins on 17 September: staff from the Guardian News &amp; Media will contribute their services to local charitable organisations, aiming to deliver something of real value to them.</p> <p>Last year nearly 250 staff took part. The 115 volunteers who filled out a questionnaire afterwards felt they had made a valuable contribution and developed new skills; nearly 90% of them agreed that volunteering had a positive impact on their sense of wellbeing.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cii.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chartered Insurance Institute</a> recently asked customers about future risks, such as social and environmental issues, with the aim of exploring some of the challenges and opportunities that might face us in the decades to come.</p> <p>When the institute analysed the respondents by the media they consume, Guardian readers were the most proactive in terms of charity work: 39% regularly helped others, making them far more likely to volunteer compared with the average consumer (30%.) Perhaps as a result of this, Guardian readers are also the most positive about the future of society in the UK: far fewer believe that society is deteriorating (78%) compared with the average (90%.)</p> <p>Overall, the research found that, although consumers have grave concerns about big issues \u2013 such as the environment, consumerism, and society \u2013 few are willing to take individual action to change what they see as a bleak future for the UK, through \"greener\" practices, such as recycling, or taking public transport, volunteering to enact social change, or shopping at independent stores. Perhaps consumers feel that these issues are too big to be addressed on a personal level.</p> <p>However, the correlation between positive thinking and people who volunteer shows that there is a great deal of benefit to be gathered from individual action. The mental and health benefits of volunteering are well-documented, and the recent sense of pride and engagement that volunteer Gamesmakers felt at the Olympics shows that consumers will take personal responsibility, if they are given the opportunity.</p> <p><em>David Thomson is director of policy &amp; public affairs at the </em><a href=\"http://www.cii.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Chartered Insurance Institute</em></a><em>, a professional organisation for insurance and financial services. </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Caribbean coral reefs \u2013 which make up one of the world's most colourful, vivid and productive ecosystems \u2013 are on the verge of collapse, with less than 10% of the reef area showing live coral cover.</p> <p>With so little growth left, the reefs are in danger of utter devastation unless urgent action is taken, conservationists warned. They said the drastic loss was the result of severe environmental problems, including over-exploitation, pollution from agricultural run-off and other sources, and climate change.</p> <p>The decline of the reefs has been rapid: in the 1970s, more than 50% showed live coral cover, compared with 8% in the newly completed survey. The scientists who carried it out warned there was no sign of the rate of coral death slowing.</p> <p>Coral reefs are a particularly valuable part of the marine ecosystem because they act as nurseries for younger fish, providing food sources and protection from predators until the fish have grown large enough to fend better for themselves. They are also a source of revenue from tourism and leisure.</p> <p>Carl Gustaf Lundin, director of the global marine and polar programme at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which published the research, said: \"The major causes of coral decline are well known and include overfishing, pollution, disease and bleaching caused by rising temperatures resulting from the burning of fossil fuels. Looking forward, there is an urgent need to immediately and drastically reduce all human impacts [in the area] if coral reefs and the vitally important fisheries that depend on them are to survive in the decades to come.\"</p> <p>Warnings over the poor state of the world's coral reefs have become more frequent in the past decades as pollution, increasing pressure on fish stocks, and the effects of global warming on the marine environment \u2013 in the form of higher sea temperatures and slightly elevated levels of acidity in the ocean \u2013 have taken their toll.</p> <p>Last year, scientists estimated that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/23/coral-reef-report-dying-danger?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">75% of the Caribbean's coral reefs were in danger, along with 95% of those in south-east</a> Asia. That research, from the World Resources Institute, predicted that by 2050 virtually all of the world's coral reefs would be in danger.</p> <p>This decline is likely to have severe impacts on coastal villages, particularly in developing countries, where many people depend on the reefs for fishing and tourism. Globally, about 275 million people live within 19 miles of a reef.</p> <p>IUCN, which is holding its quadrennial World Conservation Congress on Jeju island in South Korea this week, said swift action was vital. The organisation called for catch quotas to limit fishing, more marine-protected areas where fishing would be banned, and measures that would halt the run-off of fertilisers from farmland around the coast. To save reefs around the world, moves to stave off global warming would also be needed, the group said.</p> <p>On a few of the more remote Caribbean reefs, the situation is less dire. In the Netherlands Antilles, Cayman Islands and a few other places, the die-off has been slower, with up to 30% coverage of live coral still remaining. The scientists noted that these reefs were in areas less exposed to human impact from fishing and pollution, as well as to natural disasters such as hurricanes.</p> <p>The report \u2013 <a href=\"http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_report_jbcj_030912.pdf\" title=\"\">compiled by 36 scientists from 18 countries</a> \u2013 was the work of the IUCN-coordinated Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.</p>"
