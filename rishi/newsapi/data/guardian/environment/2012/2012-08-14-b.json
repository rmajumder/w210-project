  "<p>Mark Thompson, outgoing director general of the BBC, has been named the new president and chief executive of the New York Times.</p> <p>The 55-year-old replaces Janet Robinson, 62, who unexpectedly announced her retirement last December. </p> <p>In a statement Arthur Sulzberger Jr, chairman of the Times Company and the newspaper's publisher, called Thompson as \"a gifted and experienced executive with strong credentials whose leadership at the BBC helped it to extend its trusted brand identity into new digital products and services.\"</p> <p>Thompson, who has been director general of the BBC since 2004 said in March that he intended to depart the public broadcaster after the London Olympics. The Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/21/bbc-mark-thompson-new-york-times\">revealed in June that he was in talks to join the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>In a statement on Tuesday, Thompson said: \"The New York Times is one of the world's greatest news providers and a media brand of immense future potential both in the US and around the world. It is a real privilege to be asked to join the Times Company as it embarks on the next chapter in its history.\"</p> <p>Sulzberger added: \"Our board concluded that Mark's experience and his accomplishments at the BBC made him the ideal candidate to lead the Times company at this moment in time when we are highly focused on growing our business through digital and global expansion.\"</p> <p>Thompson has spent most of his career at the BBC. He joined in 1979 as a production trainee and began his career in news, working on the BBC's flagship news shows the Nine O'Clock News and Panorama. He became the BBC's director of television in 2000. </p> <p>After a two-year stint as chief executive at the commercial broadcaster Channel 4, Thompson moved back to the BBC as director general in 2004. Thompson's unexpected return came after the BBC became involved in a disastrous tussle with the government over a poorly-framed story about the Iraq war, which led to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jan/29/bbc.davidkelly1\">resignation of his predecessor</a>.</p> <p>He took over BBC at a time of deep crisis, and faced a difficult task getting the organisation back on an even keel. He concentrated hard on preserving its editorial integrity and its independence from government \u2013 a tough job for a body established by royal charter and whose level of funding, through a compulsory licence fee, is determined by ministers.</p> <p>Thompson's leadership at the BBC has been not without controversy. Thompson once said the BBC had previously had a \"massive leftwing bias\", although he believed it no longer existed. He has also faced criticism over his pay package that once topped \u00a3800,000, though the sum looks small compared to the $24m payoff Robinson received when she left the job he is now taking.</p> <p>Under Thompson's leadership the BBC has focused on digital and international expansion. He has also overseen a staff reduction plan, announcing plans to cut 2,000 jobs over five years and aiming to reduce costs by \u00a3700m a year.</p> <p>While the Times is one of the biggest names in online news it has struggled, along with its competitors, as digital ads have failed to make up for profits lost from declining print sales.</p> <p>Earlier this month the company announced it had made a net loss of $88.1m in the second quarter, as gains from paying subscribers and a small increase in revenues were wiped out by losses on About.com, a resource guide the company had bought to boost its online business.</p> <p>The BBC announced in March that Thompson would step down after the Olympics, leaving enough time to find and appoint a successor make his own plans for life after the corporation.</p> <p>Thompson held several discussions with New York Times executives in London, from the middle of May to the end of June, about joining the company.</p> <p>Sources close to the talks said the New York Times appeared to have had a coordinated plan to get Thompson into the job, and that those conversations developed as far as making practical arrangements. Others said Thompson was also considering several other jobs at the time.</p> <p>Negotiations with the New York Times accelerated in July after the appointment of George Entwistle as Thompson's successor. That left Thompson free to formalise the terms of his appointment in New York and for Entwistle to steer the BBC through its coverage of the London 2012 Olympics.</p>",
  "<p>School may be out for summer, but it's never too late for a quiz \u2013 especially when the answer could help determine the results of the next election. So, here goes. Which has gone up more in the five years since the financial crisis began: wages or food prices? The answer, as everyone who's been near a shop since the collapse of Northern Rock surely knows, is food. Food prices, as measured by <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk:80/ons/datasets-and-tables/data-selector.html?table-id=2.1&amp;dataset=mm23\" title=\"\">the Office for National Statistics's CPI measure</a>, have shot up 28.7% since August 2007. Average weekly pay on the other hand has increased by less than 10%.</p> <p>Food is not the only necessity that has become vastly more expensive in the past five years of economic turmoil. What the statisticians refer to as \"electricity, gas and other fuels\" has rocketed 45.5% in price. And transport costs have jumped by nearly 25%. For most British families, their lives during the past half-a-decade of financial turbulence has been marked less by toxic credit instruments or billowing Spanish borrowing costs, than by this drastic squeeze in living standards. The head of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, was spot on when he warned last year of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2053354/Sir-Mervyn-King-Were-living-biggest-squeeze-living-memory.html\" title=\"\">the biggest such squeeze in living memory</a>. Those huge jumps in the cost of groceries and household heating, compared to the meagre rises in pay, sadly bear out his observation.</p> <p>Think about those long-term trends while scanning this morning's coverage of <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk:80/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/july-2012/index.html\" title=\"\">the latest inflation figures</a>, because you will scarcely see much mention of them. Two sports are played every time the Office for National Statistics updates its CPI and RPI measures. The first is to pick out the items of interest: the things that rose or dropped particularly sharply on the month. On that score, the latest report did not disappoint, with the observation that airfares soared 21.7% between June and July. The second game played by economists is to work out what this means for Threadneedle Street. Ever since the Bank's last inflation report, the smart money has been on Mr King and his fellow rate-setters cutting the key interest rate further to zero by the end of this year \u2013 and introducing another round of quantitative easing. Yesterday's inflation report doesn't make that an impossibility, but it probably means that the monetary policy committee will need to argue harder for any policy designed to stoke inflation \u2013 at a time when inflation is already above target. Because it is by no means certain that inflation will naturally subside over the next few months.</p> <p>While price pressures are subdued at home, Britain has been importing its inflation over the last few years in the form of dearer food and energy prices. The latter are picking up nicely, thanks to the increased tensions in the Middle East (see the leader below for the latest instalment). But it is rocketing food prices that really threaten to throw out the calculations of Mr King and co. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/13/us-federal-aid-farmers-food-prices\" title=\"\">An incredible summer drought in the US</a> has already prompted Washington to warn this week that prices for corn and other crops (and for the livestock that feed on those grains) will soar.</p> <p>That adds another ingredient to what is already a pretty potent political cocktail. Take the row that began yesterday over rail fares, which are now set to go up another 6.2% come January. This parliament will see a \u00a31,000 rise in the price of an annual season ticket from many parts of London's commuter belt.</p> <p>The yearly ticket from King's Lynn will now costs \u00a35,325, while travelling in from Newbury in Berkshire will set you back just over \u00a35,003. An already unpopular coalition is now on course for a bloody nose from voters in commuting marginals in the south-east. There is much here for opposition parties to make mischief of. The chancellor has no problems cutting fuel duty, and is adamant that inflation is coming down. That logic makes yesterday's high RPI reading an aberration; and will surely lead calls for him to reduce the rise in train fares in the autumn statement. Either the chancellor makes a U-turn on rail fare policy soon \u2013 or he tells <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Bellingham_Henry.aspx\" title=\"\">his fellow Conservative MPs</a> just how they are to calm down commuting constituents.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/gu-kailai-china-quick-trial\" title=\"\">murder trial of Gu Kailai </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/bo-xilai-profile\" title=\"\">downfall of her husband Bo Xilai</a> has lurched from Shakespearean tragedy to Victorian melodrama. All the essential elements are there: overweening ambition, a poisoning, a sink of corruption, treachery and blackmail.</p> <p>Add in the alleged British spy Neil Heywood's rendezvous with death at the Lucky Holiday Hotel in Chongqing and Gu's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/07/gu-kailai-trial-china-bo-xilai\" title=\"\">reported comment to investigators to</a> \"write up anything they'd like\"&#xa0;she couldn't remember for her confession, and China's greatest political scandal for a generation seems like a cross between an airport thriller and a Stalinist show trial.</p> <p>There's no reason to believe we'll be any the wiser as to what actually happened when the court gives its verdict and sentence \u2013 or if Bo himself, sacked as Chongqing's Communist party secretary, is put on trial for \"serious disciplinary violations\".</p> <p>The evidence suggests at least that Bo's family, like those of other Chinese leaders, enriched themselves on the back of his position \u2013 and that Heywood was up to his neck in that. What's much clearer is that the fall of Bo, who attempted to use his left-leaning Chongqing administration to secure a commanding place in the party's Beijing leadership, has been seized on to change China's political direction.</p> <p>As the scandal erupted earlier this year, powerful forces out for full-scale privatisation made a concerted bid for decisive \"reform\". In February, a World Bank report, backed by elements in the government, demanded sweeping deregulation and a \"complete transition to a market economy\". The call was taken up at the National People's Congress. Corporate interests that had&#xa0;chafed against a system in which they claimed \"the state advances, the private sector retreats\" launched a neoliberal offensive.</p> <p>As the Chongqing crisis came to a head in April, Premier Wen Jiabao declared that the state banks' monopoly had to be \"broken\". After Bo's police chief tried to defect to the US embassy, the backlash intensified. Wen linked Chongqing with the taboo Cultural Revolution and a string of Maoist and leftist websites were banned.</p> <p>The basis for the politicisation of the scandal isn't hard to find. Bo himself was a populist politician on the make, not a Maoist. But the policies he championed gelled into a Chongqing model which appealed to China's \"new left\" and created a political pole for those looking to overcome the ballooning wealth gap and social costs of China's breakneck development.</p> <p>His \"sing red\" revival of revolutionary songs and culture and \"smash black\" campaign against organised crime grabbed the most attention, and have now been closed down. But it was the huge expansion of low-cost housing and&#xa0;welfare provision from the profits of a burgeoning state-owned economy, combined with 3m \"hukou\" urban residence permits handed out to migrant workers, which explains why Bo remains popular in Chongqing even after his disgrace.</p> <p>Chongqing's departure from government policy can be exaggerated \u2013 its private sector has expanded even faster than the public sector and foreign investment boomed. But the gap between Chongqing and the Guangdong model \u2013 where party secretary, Wang Yang, has hailed the role of private enterprise and growth rather than distribution, under the slogan \"small government, big society\" \u2013 is clear enough.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Bo's fall, the triumph of Guangdong was duly declared. But, <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/08/the_chongqing_model_worked\" title=\"\">as Kevin Lu of the World Bank's foreign investment agency argues in Foreign Policy magazine</a>, \"the&#xa0;Chongqing model worked\" \u2013 by mobilising state resources to boost collective consumption.</p> <p>And it is the decisive role of publicly owned banks and companies in China's hybrid economy that has delivered <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2012-08/03/content_26114793.htm\" title=\"\">the fastest growth per head of any major economy in history</a> over the past decade, the most rapid consumption growth and the largest-scale poverty reduction programme ever.</p> <p>In particular, the Chinese government's ability to instruct state banks and enterprises to drive up investment during the global crisis is the main reason why its economy has grown by 40% over the past four years, while the US's grew by 1%, the EU's shrank by 1.5% and Britain's by 4.3%. Within that expansion there have of course been inefficiencies and speculative bubbles \u2013 not to mention the environmental degradation, corruption and gross inequality that has disfigured China's rise.</p> <p>Nevertheless, as western economies continue to stagnate or worse, it's hardly the time to hand over the reins to the private sector \u2013 as demanded by China's corporate class and the US government (US treasury secretary <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1553.aspx\" title=\"\">Tim Geithner grumbles that Chinese state enterprises have an unfair advantage</a> because they don't pay \"market-based dividends\").</p> <p>But in the climate of \"reform\" and liberalisation earlier this year, the Chinese government held back from the kind of direct investment needed to offset stagnating global markets \u2013 and the private sector failed to respond. The result has been falling growth \u2013 and Beijing is now again having to shift back to a state-driven stimulus.</p> <p>In the next few weeks, China's highest level leaders will be chosen for the next decade. What course they take won't just be settled by what goes on behind closed doors but by what happens on the ground in a country where there are now 180,000 \"collective protest incidents\" a year.</p> <p>Resistance to neoliberal pressure is \"very strong in both society and government\", <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n09/-wanghui/the-rumour-machine\" title=\"\">Tsinghua University's professor Wang Hui</a> argues. But how the political struggle over the lessons of Chongqing and Guangdong is resolved will help to determine China's future.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Jaguars, tapirs, giant anteaters and spider monkeys have become \"virtually extinct\" in Brazil's Atlantic forest, while other species are being lost faster than previously believed due to the fragmentation and emptying of the once dense canopy by farmers and hunters, according to research published on Tuesday.</p> <p>The authors of the study say their findings have global implications for conservation because they confirm the quantity of forest cover is an unreliable indicator of biodiversity \u2013 more important is the quality of the forest and the measures taken to protect the fauna within it.</p> <p>The two-year research project, which was led by the University of East Anglia, looked for signs of 18 mammal species in 196 fragmented areas of forest. They found little more than a fifth of the 3,528 possible mammal populations. <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41778/0/print/print\" title=\"\">White-lipped peccaries</a>, a native pig species, were completely wiped out. Many others were on the brink of disappearing.</p> <p>\"We uncovered a staggering process of local extinctions of mid-sized and large mammals,\" said Gustavo Canale of the State University of Mato Grosso, which was a partner on the study which is <a href=\"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041671\" title=\"\">published in the journal Plos One</a>.</p> <p>About 90% of the original Atlantic forest, which once covered an area of about 1.5m km sq (about six times the size of Britain) has been converted to agriculture by cattle ranchers, cocoa farms and rubber plantations.</p> <p>The focus of the study was on the thousands of clumps of forest \u2013 many no bigger than a football pitch \u2013 that were left behind. Together they add up to a sizeable area, which previously prompted some scientists to assume they may provide a viable habitat for wildlife.</p> <p>However, the authors of the new research say that no matter how pristine forest fragments appear from the outside, they are quickly emptied of all but the smallest creatures due to \"edge effects\" which make fauna more vulnerable to fire and hunting.</p> <p>\"People think that if you have a good-looking forest fragment, then it will fill with wildlife. But that's not always the case as our paper shows,\" said the lead author <a href=\"http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/people/facstaff/peresc\" title=\"\">Prof Carlos Peres, of the University of East Anglia's School of Environmental Sciences</a>. \"I'm from Brazil and we have the world's sixth biggest economy, which means there are more dollars for conservation. Yet we have found that the remaining Atlantic forest fragments are in poor condition.</p> <p>Better news was that protection efforts can yield positive results. Among more than 200 sites, the researchers found the highest levels of species richness in five bio-reserves and national parks \u2013 even though those areas were not the biggest forest fragments.</p> <p>\"The size of the site was secondary to the history of protection and whether the area was cared for,\" said Peres, who stresses the need to look at forests as a whole rather than just a canopy or for their carbon sequestration potential.</p>",

  "<p>Much of the reform of the civil service is being driven by advice from businesspeople appointed to advise government departments, a leading Whitehall adviser has revealed.</p> <p>Former BP boss Lord Browne of Maddingley was appointed by the coalition government to advise them on reform, and championed the appointment of businesspeople as non-executive directors to the boards of each department.</p> <p>It is their advice, said Browne, that is helping shape the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/18/number-political-special-advisers-rises\" title=\"\">reform plan</a> published by the cabinet office minster Francis Maude, who wants more rigorous performance appraisal and for the worst-performing 10% civil servants to be made to improve or asked to leave.

  "<p>It's not entirely clear where we are. But the drab office environment and sepia tone suggest somewhere in deepest provincial west Germany. It looks like the 1970s, or perhaps the early 80s. There are booths with headphones and a teacher's console. To the side is a piano and a cascade of steps. A professor is off-stage, cursing, having lost his slippers. Seven students troop in and take their seats, and the lesson \u2013 if that's what it is \u2013 begins.</p> <p>This is the curious world of <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/fairedame\" title=\"\">Meine Faire Dame: Ein Sprachlabor</a>, a new version of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEcX9gNVg1U\" title=\"\">Lerner and Loewe's much-loved musical</a> My Fair Lady.

Translation is very much the point: as the subtitle suggests, the setting is a language lab; Professor Higgins has become Professor Karpathy, not an English phoneticist but a Hungarian one; and there are three Eliza Doolittles, each played by different actors.</p> <p>What follows is two hours of somewhat eclectic music (Bryan Adams, Wagner, Mozart, Marlene Dietrich) chopped together with fragments translated from the original musical. Frankenstein's monster makes an entrance, too, for reasons that remain a little unclear. Although this is a deliberately absurd reworking, it is nonetheless touching, melancholic and grotesque. Nothing is what is seems. Perhaps that's its message: communication in any language is impossible.</p> <p>\"It's about society and emptiness,\" says Tora Augestad, a mezzo-soprano who plays one of the students. We speak after a performance in Valence, France, on the European tour. \"And language. We are trying to question what language is, and how accurate it is.\"</p> <p>Over the past two decades, Marthaler has won just about every award going in the German-speaking musical world; his staging of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde has been performed in Bayreuth for several seasons \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.wagneropera.net/Articles/Bayreuth-2011-Berry-Marthaler-Tristan-Isolde.htm\" title=\"\">sometimes to jeers from the audience</a>. But then his productions are famous for their gentle irony, their ridiculing of theatrical and operatic conventions, and their unheroic protagonists.</p> <p>The idea for Meine Faire Dame came in 2010, when Marthaler was working as director of <a href=\"http://www.theater-basel.ch/\" title=\"\">Theatre Basel</a>. On the main stage, a traditional production of My Fair Lady was being staged, so Marthaler offered to do a response to it in the smaller space next door. He began with singing and improvisation (\"We always start from the music,\" says Graham Valentine, Scottish actor and long-term Marthaler collaborator playing Karpathy) and ended with something approaching dada.</p> <p>It premiered in 2010 to a rapturous response from audiences and critics alike, uncertain whether they were watching a play, a comedy, or a pantomime. The Frankfurter Allgemeine's critic wrote \"for a full two hours we laughed \u2026 until we cried\"; the S\u00fcddeutsche review knowingly referenced both John Cage and the French composer Erik Satie.</p> <p>One of the most amusing moments comes when Augestad does a duet of Silent Night with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7IlMTq2wQ\" title=\"\">the Swiss pop star Michael von der Heide</a>, who had the distinction of coming last in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zju0TVKRCi0\" title=\"\">2010 Eurovision song contest</a>. The singing is exquisite. But Augestad and Von der Heide are choreographed to perform a series of painfully awful dance moves \u2013 an inverted parody of those X Factor contestants who can dance well but are hopeless at singing. At the end, someone cries: \"Thank you. Next.\"</p> <p>The show has a multinational cast: Augestad is Norwegian; the Frankenstein actor Mihail Grigoriu Romanian; Valentine, although a Scot, has lived in France for 30 years; and Marthaler lives in Paris and Basel. Situated between Germany, France and Italy, Switzerland is itself a country that knows the problems of linguistic confusion \u2013 a theme that may make sense in Edinburgh, too, according to Valentine. \"Scottish people have a deeply ingrained sense of alienation from their own language,\" he says. \"Turn on TV. You are bombarded with this English shite. You never feel you have the right to be in your own language.\"</p>",

Our commitment to expand the Halewood workforce and increase production is great news for JLR, for Merseyside and for the wider UK economy.\"When the move was first announced in March, business secretary Vince Cable said it was \"further evidence of the strength of the UK automotive sector\".</p> <p>The carmaker is on course for record profits of about \u00a31.5bn this year from strong demand in emerging markets, although the UK remains its biggest single market. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/09/jaguar-land-rover-profit-boost?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">It enjoyed a 45% boom in second-quarter profits</a> worth more than \u00a3500m, on a 91% increase in sales to China, it reported last week.</p> <p>Ralf Speth, the chief executive of JLR, said at the time: \"We have a very low market share in China\u2026 therefore we are sure we can continue this growth.\"</p> <p>JLR overall sales during the second quarter were 83,452 vehicles, up 34%. That included nearly 72,000 Land Rovers \u2013 but fewer than 12,000 Jaguar saloon cars.</p> <p>Tata bought Jaguar Land Rover from the Ford Motor Company in 2008 for about \u00a31.5bn. After JLR's comeback from years of struggling the carmaker now employs 24,000 people in Britain. About 8,000 were taken on in the past two years, even before the Halewood move.</p> <p>The company also wants to build a new engine plant in south Staffordshire that could hire a further 750 workers. JLR has said it will also manufacture a new Jaguar F-type at the Castle Bromwich site in Birmingham.</p> <p>JLR is one of several automobile success stories in Britain with Japanese carmakers Toyota, Nissan and the BMW-owned Mini business also investing in their UK factories to expand production.</p>",
  "<p>The eurozone is on the brink of following Britain into a double-dip recession after its economy shrank between April and June.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/eurozone-crisis-gdp-germany-france\" title=\"\">GDP across the 17-nation bloc fell by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year</a> and economists believe the downturn is continuing. Better-than-expected figures from Germany and France were offset by sharp contractions elsewhere, with the Spanish, Italian, Finnish and Portuguese economies all shrinking. The wider European Union also suffered a 0.2% contraction.</p> <p>Europe's debt crisis is hitting exports, domestic sales and consumer confidence, adding to the pressure on European leaders. Last month eurozone consumer and business confidence fell for the fourth straight month, weakening significantly in France, Germany, Finland and Austria.</p> <p>Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said Europe's woes, including plunging business sentiment and weakening trade, are dragging the world economy down.</p> <p>\"The fall in second quarter European output adds to the world economy's downward momentum,\" Ohlenburg said.</p> <p>The US economy grew by about 0.4% during the second quarter, while Japan posted 0.3% growth. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/25/shock-gdp-fall-deepens-double-dip-recession\" title=\"\">The UK, though, shrank by 0.7%</a>, according to last month's preliminary estimate from the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said Europe's shrinking economy was a worry, but pointed out that only two members of the G20 \u2013 the UK and Italy \u2013 are in recession.</p> <p>\"These are concerning growth figures, with the eurozone economy contracting in the last quarter. But they also show that despite all the problems in the euro area, France and Germany have so far managed to avoid recession, while Britain has now been in recession for the last nine months.\"</p> <p>The eurozone has avoided entering a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, because growth was flat over the first three months of 2012. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicted that GDP will fall again during the current quarter. Archer said the eurozone was \"struggling against tight fiscal policy in many countries, high and rising unemployment, muted global economic activity and ongoing serious sovereign debt tensions that weigh down on confidence and limit investment.\"</p> <p>Stock markets, however, were cheered by the news as the contraction was smaller than expected and share prices rose across Europe. The FTSE 100 finished 32 points higher at 5864, while the DAX closed 0.8% higher.</p> <p>The European commission vice-president, Olli Rehn, told CNBC that the EU and the European Central Bank would take action \"once certain conditions are met\". Rehn added that the euro was \"irreversible\".</p> <p>In Germany, there was some relief that the economy grew by 0.3%. Analysts, though, fear that Europe's powerhouse could slide into recession soon.</p> <p>\"The German economy could contract in the summer,\" said J\u00f6rg Kramer of Commerzbank. \"It is fundamentally in good structural shape, but can't decouple from the recession in the eurozone, plus the global economy has also shifted down a gear.\"</p> <p>With no growth in the last quarter, France has now been flatlining for the last nine months. The finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, said the performance was \"not excellent\", but was encouraged that France continued to avoid a recession.</p> <p>Moscovici said President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government was determined to shrink the public sector deficit to 3% of GDP next year as promised, despite the fragile economy.</p> <p>The government needs to find \u20ac33bn in new taxes and spending cuts, even if growth meets its target of 1.2% next year, which most economists think is unlikely.</p> <p>Louise Cooper of BGC Partners warned that Hollande and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, should not be overly jubilant.</p> <p>\"This data does not change the economic outlook for the eurozone, it just gives the politicians a few weeks to breathe and holiday a little easier,\" said Cooper.</p> <p>Merkel returned from her summer break on Monday and is due to discuss the crisis with Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, on Wednesday.</p> <p>Portugal continued to be buffeted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/19/portuguese-death-rate-rise-austerity-programme\" title=\"\">the austerity programme now being implemented</a>. Its GDP tumbled by 1.2% in the latest quarter and is 3.3% smaller than a year ago, while the unemployment rate crept up to a new record of 15%.</p> <p>Greece, whose economy shrank by 6.2% over the last year, sold more than \u20ac4bn of short-term debt, easing fears that it would struggle to repay a \u20ac3.2bn bond which matures next Monday.</p> <h2>Spanish banks borrow record \u20ac402bn</h2> <p>Spanish banks borrowed a record \u20ac402bn (\u00a3316bn) from the European Central Bank in July, leaving them as far as ever from returning to capital markets, and heaping further pressure on Madrid as it tries to avert a full sovereign bailout.</p> <p>The banks borrowed 10% more than the \u20ac365bn they tapped in June, Tuesday's data from the Bank of Spain showed. Spiralling debt costs and balance sheets ravaged by a domestic property bubble that collapsed in 2008 have shut most domestic banks out of the bond markets.</p> <p>The banks' use of the ECB facility has increased sharply this year, rising from \u20ac161bn in January, and the sector was propped up in July with the promise of a European rescue package \u2013 which it has yet to tap \u2013 worth up to \u20ac100bn.</p> <p>The pattern is similar if less acute in Italy \u2013 like Spain at the sharp end of the eurozone debt crisis \u2013 where banks held \u20ac283bn in ECB funds in July compared with \u20ac281bn in June, Bank of Italy data showed last week.</p> <p>In Spain, only heavyweights with big operations abroad such as Santander and BBVA continue to have few problems raising funding from the market.</p> <p>One likely factor in the July increase was the higher charges that some clearing houses were levying on the use of Spanish bonds \u2013 which many domestic banks have invested heavily in \u2013 as collateral for raising funds, one analyst said.</p> <p>LCH.Clearnet, one of Europe's largest clearing houses, raised the cost of using Spanish debt as collateral in July following a series of ratings downgrades on the country's debt to the lower end of the investment grade spectrum.</p> <p>Many investors fear that cleaning up the banking system as well as Spain's public accounts while recession rages may prove too difficult for the government, and expect the country to seek a full-blown bailout on top of the banking aid.</p>",
  "<p>I didn't know what to expect when I visited the home of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRAWvltQVC8\" title=\"\">S\u00e3o Paulo Symphony Orchestra</a>, situated in an area of the Brazilian city known as <a href=\"http://www.discoveringsaopaulo.com/2011/12/photos-of-sao-paulos-cracolandia-past.html\" title=\"\">Cracol\u00e2ndia</a> \u2013 Crackland. It's not a place to linger: prostitutes ply their trade on the platforms of a nearby station, drug addicts sleep in the park, and I witness a mugging while passing through in a taxi one evening. But I do make a point of having a wander round Crackland before a performance in Sala&#xa0;S\u00e3o Paulo, the orchestra's beautiful, 1,500-seat concert hall. No one bothers me.</p> <p>I imagined the orchestra as a Brazilian version of <a href=\"http://www.simonbolivarorchestra.com/\" title=\"\">Venezuela's S\u00edmon B\u00f3livar Orchestra</a> \u2013 an instrument of social change in a country with a high level of deprivation. And the orchestra does tick the usual social-consciousness boxes: it runs a <a href=\"http://gobrazil.about.com/od/festivalsevents/ss/camposjordaowintfest.htm\" title=\"\">music festival in the mountain town of Campos de Jord\u00e3o</a> a couple of hours to the north; it gives 100,000 youngsters a year the chance to hear classical music; it runs its own academy for young players; and it gives free concerts in the hall (and in parks) at the&#xa0;weekend.</p> <p>But it is avowedly not the S\u00edmon B\u00f3livar Orchestra. Nor is Brazil Venezuela, since it doesn't share the latter's commitment to state-orchestrated social change. No, the S\u00e3o Paulo Symphony has a more single-minded goal: it is aiming to be one of the great orchestras of the world, which is why so much is riding on its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms\" title=\"\">Proms</a> debut tonight, under new chief conductor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/marin-alsop\" title=\"\">Marin Alsop</a>. For the first time in its 58-year history, the orchestra will command a global stage.</p> <p>\"I get very emotional thinking about the Proms,\" says its executive director Marcelo Lopes, a former trumpeter with the orchestra who still carries his mouthpiece around with him. \"I&#xa0;would love to play there, but I'm out of practice.\" He won't rule it out, though \u2013 chief exec's privilege. In the past four years, Lopes has overseen a revolution in the orchestra, chiefly by ousting <a href=\"http://www.bis.se/index.php?op=people&amp;pID=1817\" title=\"\">John Neschling</a>, the chief conductor. Neschling had raised the quality of the playing and got the new hall built, but, after 11 years in charge, was thought to have too much power. Bringing in Alsop, the US conductor who transformed the Baltimore Symphony, shows S\u00e3o Paulo's global aspirations.</p> <p>The removal of Neschling in 2008 was extremely unpleasant, but Lopes insists it had to be done. \"We needed to release a little bit of pressure from the orchestra and let them grow,\" he says. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/85371897-79e3-4dfe-865c-67ca25cca33b.html\" title=\"\">Yan Pascal Tortelier</a> joined as interim chief conductor before Alsop took charge in March this year. She has already impressed locals by her willingness to learn Portuguese and embrace life in the <a href=\"http://www.geographia.com/brazil/saopaulo/index.htm\" title=\"\">vast, traffic-choked miasma that is S\u00e3o Paulo</a>.</p> <p>I meet Alsop an hour before she gives a concert at the Sala. She admits it was not love at first sight when she came to the city to guest-conduct two years ago. \"It's an overwhelming city, the third largest in the world, and when you arrive you say, 'Oh my goodness, what have I done?' It's offputting at first \u2013 someone got a great deal on a lot of concrete.\" But the orchestra quickly convinced her it was all worthwhile. \"I was doing Mahler's Seventh and I thought they sounded good, but what I was so impressed with \u2013 besides the gorgeous concert hall \u2013 was the exponential growth in the orchestra over just a couple of days. They were hungry for hard work and have enormous potential. There's a let's-give-it-a-try optimism that I find&#xa0;lacking in North America and Europe now.\"</p> <p>In an hour's time, the orchestra will be playing most of the programme they are bringing to the Proms: Dvor\u02c7\u00e1k's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIGXC_x3zX0\" title=\"\">New World symphony</a>; <a href=\"http://www.villalobos.ca/momoprecoce\" title=\"\">Villa-Lobos's enigmatic Momopr\u00e9coce</a> for piano and orchestra, with the feted Brazilian <a href=\"http://www.deccaclassics.com/artist/biography?ART_ID=FRENE\" title=\"\">Nelson Freire</a> as soloist; and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhFpd0fDmZ4\" title=\"\">Ginastera's electrifying suite Estancia</a>. Although Estancia is the concert opener in S\u00e3o Paulo, it is the foot-tapping closer in London. Repertoire is one of the areas where Alsop finds the old musical world more conservative than the new. \"It gets very hard as an artist to always face the question, 'Will that sell?' There has to be a point where you say, 'Does that make artistic sense?' and not, 'Will it&#xa0;sell?'\"</p> <p>The S\u00e3o Paulo audience may still be learning to appreciate classical music \u2013 it only gained a foothold in the city in the 1970s, when Brazilian-born <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/nyregion/e-de-carvalho-composer-conductor-and-teacher.html\" title=\"\">Eleazar de Carvalho</a> became the orchestra's chief conductor \u2013 but they are curious. And Alsop and the orchestra's artistic director, Brazilian-born <a href=\"http://www.womex.com/virtual/babel_producoes/arthur_nestrovski\" title=\"\">Arthur Nestrovski</a>, are committed to challenging them. The current season includes works as diverse as Schnittke's viola concerto, Hindemith's&#xa0;cello concerto, Takemitsu's Requiem and Charles Ives's The Unanswered Question.</p> <p>On a Sunday morning, a bright and beautiful midwinter day that would pass for summer in the UK, I attend a free concert by the orchestra in <a href=\"http://www.cidadedesaopaulo.com/sp/en/what-to-see/212-parque-do-ibirapuera\" title=\"\">Ibirapuera park</a>, S\u00e3o Paulo's answer to Central Park in New York. About 3,000 people have pitched up (they get four times that number during the summer) and listen with great intensity, ignoring the occasional passing helicopter; because of its traffic, S\u00e3o Paulo is reckoned to have the highest concentration of choppers in the world.</p> <p>Before the concert, I talk to the orchestra's leader, Emmanuele Baldini, a 40-year-old Italian who came to S\u00e3o Paulo eight years ago. \"When I decided to come here,\" he says, \"colleagues in my former orchestra in Trieste said, 'Are you crazy? It will be the end of your career.' People said the same thing to Marin when she decided to come here. There is still a lot of ignorance about the orchestra. Brazil is famous for football, not classical music. That's why we are proud to go to the Proms \u2013 to show off the level at which we can play.\"</p> <p>Baldini originally came as guest leader (to give him a way back if his Italian colleagues' dire predictions were true), but he quickly saw the potential. He contrasts the diminishing job opportunities in Europe with the growth in Brazil, but does admit that, when he joined, the quality of playing was variable. It has greatly improved, he says now, adding loyally: \"With Marin, we are in our golden age. I have never felt so optimistic.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, he accepts that the job of moulding a world-class orchestra is only just beginning. \"We need work to create a personality. In the beginning, it was an orchestra with musicians from different schools, different traditions, and until now we haven't had someone to unify us. Now we are creating that personality. We always had a lot of energy, but it was a little anarchic. We had no one to organise all the good things, but Marin is now doing this.\"</p> <p>About two-thirds of the orchestra come from Brazil, though, because music education is relatively weak here, all spent time abroad to complete their studies. Horacio Schaefer, the principal viola, is typical. Born into a family that was originally from Germany (many of the musicians come from first or second-generation immigrant families), he learned to play in Brazil but went to Germany at 18, spending 15 years there studying, and playing with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra before returning to Brazil.</p> <p>With so many musicians trained in Europe and the US, does the notion of Brazilian-ness matter to the orchestra? \"We are a Brazilian orchestra,\" says Schaefer, \"and we're very proud of that.\" However, he says, they are not seeking a Brazilian sound. \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAl7MFWRQgY\" title=\"\">We know very well how to do Brazilian music</a> and in those pieces we look for a Brazilian sound,\" he says, \"but not when we do standard orchestral repertoire. Then, we look for our own sound, and we measure ourselves against Chicago, Berlin and New York. That is the level we want to achieve.\"</p> <p>That's quite some company they're aiming to keep. It will be fascinating to see if they can pull it off tonight.</p>",
  "<p>Helen Gurley Brown, creator of the Cosmopolitan magazine brand as we know it, died in Manhattan on Monday. To many, she is the founding mother of women's magazine publishing and the woman who first put the concept of sex and single girls into the mainstream. Decades before Sex and the City and 50 Shades of Grey, and at a time when single women couldn't even obtain a mortgage, Cosmopolitan was telling them to celebrate their unmarried status, demanding better sex, better orgasms and better men.</p> <p>Gurley Brown achieved notoriety as the editor who invented sex talk for women, but former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jan/16/pressandpublishing.observerreview\" title=\"\">UK Cosmo editor Sam Baker</a> says that wrongly overshadows her passion for careers and financial independence for women. \"Right up until I left, she would still be sending editors notes, saying: 'I love what you're doing, but more careers! Careers are so important!'\"</p> <p>Gurley Brown is credited with inventing the term \"having it all\", a sentiment that endures to this day, if only in making women feel like failures for not achieving her ultimate feminist goal. But what Gurley Brown arguably intended was for us to <em>want</em> more, to not have to choose between having a family and retaining our own identities, or between caring for our families and providing for ourselves. \"Don't use men to get what you want in life \u2013 get it for yourself,\" she often said. And she never suggested women use anything but hard graft to make it. \"Nearly every glamorous, wealthy, successful career woman you might envy now started out as some kind of schlepp.\"</p> <p>She was no exception. Gurley was born in Green Forest, Arkansas, to schoolteacher parents. Her father, Ira, went into politics soon after and moved his family to Little Rock. When Helen was 10, in 1932, he was killed in a freak elevator accent. Broke, at the tail end of the Great Depression, her mother, Cleo, took her two daughters to Los Angeles, whereupon Helen's elder sister, Mary, contracted polio and never walked again. The family was uninsured and lost what little they had to Mary's medical bills. Helen said much later: \"Why am I so driven? It seems logically to have derived from things that happened to me after my father died, but some of it must have been residual from very early.\"</p> <p>She cut short her education to go out to work to support her mother and sister (she remained obsessed with money management throughout her career). She became an advertising copywriter at a New York agency <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/mar/26/mad-men-about-women-now\" title=\"\">in the time of Mad Men</a> and, within five years, was one of Manhattan's most celebrated ad execs. She pitched a new magazine to Hearst publications and instead was offered the job of relaunching Cosmopolitan, where she remained for the next 32&#xa0;years as editor.</p> <p>According to everyone who knew her, \"Gurley was girly\". In stark contrast with the \"dour feminist anger\" she banned from Cosmopolitan when she successfully overhauled the ailing literary magazine in 1965, she revelled in her femininity. Her existing Manhattan corner office on the top floor of the state-of-the-art Hearst building designed by Norman Foster was pink, full of flowers and heavily accented with animal print (it featured a large stuffed tiger at one point), into which the painfully slight and leopard-print-clad Gurley Brown could almost disappear. She described herself as neurotic, as plain (she saw herself as a champion of the unexceptional-looking woman, and an example of what they could achieve). She remained young at heart and obsessed with maintaining an appearance to match. Gurley Brown was still exercising for 45 minutes beside her desk at 85 years old, and was from a young age rarely without her custom-cut wigs and false eyelashes \u2013 though as former employee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron-feminism-plenty-shes-having\" title=\"\">Nora Ephron</a> observed: \"It never quite comes together properly. An earring keeps falling off. A wig is askew. A perfect matched stocking has run.\" A relentless self-critic, Gurley Brown was a big fan of plastic surgery and claimed the only sick days of her 60-year career in order to undergo facelifts, a nose job, injections and various other nips and tucks, none of which she denied (she once even wrote a Cosmo feature on how to have great sex while wearing a hairpiece). She was known to weep at criticism or disagreements, and was regarded by some as emotionally incontinent (\"Whether it was group therapy or what, there's nothing left inside Helen. It all comes out,\" her husband told Ephron). She believed in love and being sexually available to one's partner (and enjoying oneself in the process, of course). Through it all, her girlish sense of fun never left her.</p> <p>\"She was a giggler,\" says <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/19/interview-louise-court-editor-cosmopolitan\" title=\"\">UK Cosmo editor-in-chief Louise Court</a> of her Manhattan meetings with Gurley Brown. \"She was very complimentary when it was deserved. She loved any picture of a handsome man. She was extremely tough but very warm \u2013 never scary or intimidating, and was terrific fun. And she always called me \"Pussycat\", which to my surprise I&#xa0;found&#xa0;fabulous.\"</p> <p>Gurley's marriage (at 37) to film producer David Brown marked the beginning of her most important personal and professional relationship, and continued until his death in 2010. She called him \"Lambchop\" and kept a photograph of him on her pinboard, next to flatplans, ideas and tearsheets. She used him as a sounding board for her work (\"David loves your coverlines!\" she wrote in one note to Baker). \"She and David were a real team,\" says Baker, now editor-in-chief at Red. \"Even greater than the sum of their parts \u2013 and she was always very proud of that, which I found very admirable.\"</p> <p>\"She could never understand why my partner and I aren't married,\" laughs Court. \"I think she just wanted every woman to have what she had in her marriage. Where Helen changed things was how she felt single women should absolutely enjoy themselves along the way.\" As a colleague and friend, she was kind and supportive. Baker says: \"She was always sending notes, written on a typewriter and amended by hand. She was one of the last great letter writers.\"</p> <p>\"Before she came along, women's magazines were edited by men and ignored the single readership altogether,\" says Court. Baker agrees: \"In 1965, when Helen took over, women's magazines were about homemaking. Helen made them about life, love, work, sex, money, friends. Society has moved on and I truly think Helen Gurley Brown gave it a push.\"</p> <p>While magazines have moved on a great deal since the 60s, Gurley Brown's legacy is indelibly marked on Cosmo's glossy pages (she was still writing for some international editions when she died). \"What Helen did was make feminism populist, accessible and relevant to normal women's lives,\" says Court. \"She showed women what they could be at a time when everyone else told them women were absolutely nothing until they married a man.\"</p> <h2>Helen Gurley Brown's words of wisdom</h2> <p>\u25b6 \"Theoretically, a 'nice' single woman has no sex life. What nonsense! She has a better sex life than most of her married friends.\"</p> <p>\u25b6 \"Sex is one of the three best things there are, and I don't know what the other two are. You have to keep reciting to yourself: I'm a sexual person; I want sex in my life; I deserve it, and I'm not gonna let it disappear.\"</p> <p>\u25b6 \"Women want what men want \u2013 to be treated equitably, to be cherished, respected, adored, and encouraged in their work.\"</p> <p>\u25b6 \"Men are not the enemy; a woman is not a 'victim'. Only laziness, fear, and not getting started with goals can keep you grounded.\"</p> <p>\u25b6 \"There is no substitute for brains plus charm and hard work.\"</p> <p><em>Compiled by Katy Stoddard</em></p>",
  "<p>The world's third-biggest platinum producer has shut down its South African operations after violent clashes left at least nine people dead at its principal mine.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.lonmin.com\" title=\"\">Lonmin's</a> shares dropped almost 5% in London and 4% in Johannesburg as production ceased due to a turf war between rival trade unions.</p> <p>Protests at the Marikana mine, 60 miles north-west of Johannesburg, began last week when workers walked out seeking a pay increase to 12,500 rand (\u00a3976) a month. <a href=\"http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-08-14-lonmins-killing-fields\" title=\"\">The trouble intensified over the weekend</a>, driven by a wider feud between two unions.</p> <p>Two policemen died in a machete attack by a mob near the mine; two security guards were hacked to death and a union said one of its members was killed while trying to report for duty. The body of a middle-aged man who had been bludgeoned to death could be seen in the area on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, as several thousand miners held another protest over working conditions.</p> <p>Lonmin executives said all its shafts across the South African platinum belt, which account for 12% of global supply, were closed to all but essential services, such as ventilation. <a href=\"http://www.kitco.com/charts/liveplatinum.html\" title=\"\">Although the price of platinum has fallen steeply in the past six months</a>, the spot price rose 2% on Tuesday in the wake of the violence.</p> <p>Barnard Mokwena, Lonmin's executive vice-president, said: \"Until the place is safe we don't want to talk about production.\"</p> <p>South Africa accounts for about three-quarters of the world's platinum, which is used to make catalytic converters in cars. It has one of the most unionised workforces in the world and has recently seen a rise in inter-union violence at mines.</p> <p>The flare-up at Lonmin, the deadliest so far, pitches the well-established National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) against the upstart militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU).</p> <p>On Tuesday, hundreds of police officers, including mounted units and armoured vehicles, descended on Marikana. Police helicopters flew overhead as officers set up control checkpoints and laid down barbed wire. Some miners attacked journalists, hitting their cars with sticks and pipes.</p> <p>London-based Lonmin says 96% of its production comes from Marikana. The platinum sector is grappling with declining world prices for the precious metal and a surge in union militancy in South Africa.</p> <p>Complaints that the NUM, which remains a crucial supporter of the governing African National Congress (ANC), is not defending the interests of its rank and file have left it exposed to a challenge.</p> <p>The AMCU denies allegations of bullying tactics and claims the NUM is no longer effectively representing the interests of miners. Lonmin executives said AMCU now had 21% of the company's 28,000 South African workforce as members.</p> <p>At least three people were killed in a similar round of labour violence in January that led to a six-week closure of the world's biggest platinum mine, run by Impala Platinum. Aquarius Platinum briefly shut one of its shafts recently after an attack by unidentified assailants that left three dead and at least 20 injured.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cosatu.org.za\" title=\"\">Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)</a>, which supports the NUM, claimed miners were victims of divide-and-rule tactics.

  "<p>In the blink of an eye the London 2012 Olympic Games are over, leaving us with fantastic memories, amazing athletic performances and a legacy to inspire a generation through sport. For the global anti-doping community this means a legacy of clean sport, where tomorrow's athletes believe in striving to be the best they can without the use of performance-enhancing substances.</p> <p>London 2012 has taught us many things, not least confirming the public's suspicions that some athletes dope. The World Anti-Doping Agency reported that more than 100 potential Olympians were stopped from competing at the Games because of doping, and the International Olympic Committee announced a number of positive tests during the course of the Games. This is good news for clean athletes around the world.</p> <p>However, the pressure on today's athletes, coaches and indeed nations continues to increase and the whole sporting community needs to understand this and manage the need to \"win at all costs\". Working closely with law enforcement agencies, we are well aware of the availability of performance enhancing substances to athletes. Combine this with the weakness of human nature and it is easy to see how people are tempted to risk everything for the sake of success.</p> <p>Proactive education programmes and strong deterrence messaging, rolled out on a global scale, have played an important part in preventing dopers from reaching the podium at these Games. Equally we have seen a much more focused testing effort to make our tests really count. Using intelligence has proved successful in sharpening our collective focus and should be recognised as the way in which we all must work in the future. But tackling doping in sport starts with prevention, not tests, and we are extremely fortunate in the UK to have had the support of government, Locog, GlaxoSmithKline and King's College London, who have all contributed in ensuring every athlete understood that doping would not be tolerated at these Games.</p> <p>However, performance enhancement is not a problem exclusive to elite sport. The growth of online steroid sales corresponds to a worrying increase in the number of young people seeking to enhance their image through the use of such substances. By working closely with the police and UK Border Agency, we have a better grasp on the scale of this problem and it is clear this needs addressing from beyond the realms of just sport.</p> <p>Collaboration is essential to our success in tackling doping and it has been a huge achievement for our own athletes and sports to have shown such commitment to clean sport. Their success in the medal table mirrors their dedication to our anti-doping programmes. The challenge is to ensure that our next generation of champions continues to have the same attitude.</p> <p><em>Andy Parkinson is chief executive of UK Anti-Doping</em></p>",
  "<p>Sometimes, it's not what you do, but how you do it that counts. For proof of this, one need look no further than Sleeping Dogs, United Front's love-letter to Hong Kong action movies' late 1980s heyday. Here is a game that sounds like a cocktail of movie tropes and game mechanics that have been reheated and refried so many times that you can practically smell grease on them. But if you're able to stop picking at its component parts and just appreciate Sleeping Dogs as a whole, you'll most likely find that it's one of the most thrilling and consistently enjoyable games of 2012.</p> <p>Sleeping Dogs tells the story of Wei Shen, a Hong Kong bruiser who has just returned to his hometown after a lengthy stint in the US. Things kick off with Wei being thrown in a holding cell for selling narcotics and while there, he bumps into Jackie, a childhood mate who is languishing down the bottom end of the food chain in the local Triads. Wei asks if Jackie can get him some work, and before you know it, Wei's collecting protection money from market stall owners, stealing and selling cars and beating up rival gang members with a tyre iron. What Wei's new Triad mates don't know is that their newfound muscleman is an undercover cop, tasked with bringing down their criminal organisation from within.</p> <p>If the plot set-up in Sleeping Dogs sounds a little tried and tested, then the gaming structure that houses it will strike readers as even more so. To put it bluntly, Sleeping Dogs owes a huge debt of influence to the Grand Theft Auto series. It's set in a huge urban sandbox that the player navigates on foot and in vehicles, it tells a crime story through a series of fetch-quests and, yes, there are a ton of mini-games, side missions, car chases, gun battles and fist fights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731256\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954462813/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while United Front is working with an established gaming rubric and plot elements that are older than the game's age certificate, it infuses the proceedings with an enticing freshness that allows players to ignore their cliched origins.</p> <p>Take, for example, Wei's loyalties and how they're split between his Triad comrades and the police commanders to whom he reports. Sure, this is a plot device that's one part City on Fire and two parts Infernal Affairs, but United Front uses it as a springboard and dives straight to its murky depths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731257\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954780836/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Wei works his way up the Triad ranks, he becomes more valuable as a police asset, but he also becomes attached to the criminals he's essentially trying to bring down. His Triad brethren may be a pack of violent thugs and psychopaths, but they have strong codes about loyalty and family, and they care far more about Wei's well-being than his police commanders. They, for their part, are more concerned with building a case against the Triad bosses, and if that means Wei has to break the law, or put himself in harm's way, so be it. In a way, the taskforce commanders are as callous and calculating as the Triad overlords they're trying to bust.</p> <p>So on the surface, Sleeping Dogs is about a man with divided allegiances, but as the player progresses through the game, United Front digs deeper with its narrative. The taskforce authorities show a disturbing willingness to blur the lines of legality; the regular police find themselves having to use Wei's Triad connections to solve crimes that their commanders aren't concerned with. As Wei advances through the ranks, his former friends become liabilities he has to protect. And the Triad's code of honour is revealed to be little more than a set of manners that the gang leaders are expected to observe as they engage in bloody turf wars, which are later revealed to be part of a more insidious power play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731258\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954697130/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every time the player thinks they have the story clocked, United Front peels away another layer that both changes their expectations and ups the dramatic stakes. It's not completely original, but it's effective nonetheless. The fact that all the characters in the game are very well written and superbly voiced doesn't hurt, either. In short, United Front works hard to pull the player into the game's narrative, and it's easy to become invested in Wei's story even before the action starts. It's easily one of game's strongest assets.</p> <p>The game's second trump card is the in-game map of Hong Kong, represented here as a neon-encrusted metropolis where majestic skyscrapers tower over a sprawling hive of illicit activity. Flea markets and illegal fight clubs rub shoulders with chop shops and gang hangouts. Every main road and highway begs to be raced along, and the city's street grid is intercut by a ton of back alleys and side streets.</p> <p>The map is also bursting with activities, mini-games and side-quests for the player to get stuck into; they can bet money on mahjong or cock fights, compete in street brawls for money and test their mettle on the street racing circuit. In one particularly challenging mini-game, players can attack gang members in their hangouts, hack the nearest CCTV camera and then use it to bust local drug dealers. They can also hunt for lock boxes containing cash, shrines that offer health upgrades and a collection of statues they can trade at the local dojo to open up new combat moves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731259\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954633802/Sleeping-Dogs-009.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Story missions and side quests inevitably lead to gun battles, car chases or fist fights and United Front have done a lot of work to make Wei feel and handle like an action movie hero. The hand-to-hand combat system is a two-button affair that owes a debt of inspiration to Batman: Arkham Asylum, but it's loads of fun to use and surprisingly deep. Not only do players have a lengthy list of combos to unlock, they can also use items in Wei's environment to dispatch foes in decidedly grisly fashion \u2013 like wall fans into which they can shove faces or meat hooks on which they can impale torsos.</p> <p>Gun fights handle like they would in a cover-based third-person-shooter, but there's an element of bullet-time tossed in for good measure; when Wei vaults cover, the action slows down and players are able to easily draw a bead on opponents. Driving sections remain fun and fresh due to the fact that the game doesn't penalise players too much for collisions. Players are also able to ram other cars off the road using the X button, or hijack other vehicles by having Wei leap out of his car and onto the roof of a target in a move that'll prompt a knowing smile in anyone who ever played Midway's Wheelman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731260\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954508143/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearly everything the player does feeds XP into three meters: Face, Police and Triad. The latter two unlock abilities on two skill trees, such as the ability to hotwire a car without setting off an alarm, or the power to disarm an opponent in one swift combat move. High Face rating allows players to wear sharp suits and drive flash cars, but it also bestows gifts such as a car valet who'll deliver a vehicle for Wei anytime and any place he needs it.</p> <p>So while Sleeping Dogs works from an established palette, it's an absolute blast to play. Like the Uncharted series, the focus here isn't to break new ground for the medium through innovation. Instead, the aim here is to make the player feel like an action hero in a piece of blockbuster entertainment, while remaining fun to play throughout. Sleeping Dogs is not the most original game you'll play all year, but it's easily one of the most enjoyable and it's arguably one of the best.</p>",

In contrast, few books can be as hostile to the Christian faith as Atlas Shrugged. For Rand, the good Samaritan was not simply a chump: he was in fact doing something wicked. We are saved only by selfishness.

In short, there is no <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Racial-Identities-Genetic-Ancestry-America/dp/0230110614/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344889543&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sahra+gibbons\" title=\"\">genetic basis for race</a>.</p> <p>The project, led by <a href=\"http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/sergio_pena.php\" title=\"\">Brazilian geneticist professor S\u00e9rgio Pena</a>, hopes to DNA test all footballers taking part in the 2014 World Cup, and potentially all Olympians in 2016. The Brazilian embassy in London is currently piloting the scheme, offering free DNA tests to the public. Brazil's minister of sport \u2013 Aldo Rebeldo \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.esporte.gov.br/ascom/noticiaDetalhe.jsp?idnoticia=9052\" title=\"\">was first in line</a> to take the test.</p> <p>In Brazil, the campaign has won high-level political support because of both internal and external factors. Within Brazil, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21543494\" title=\"\">pernicious socioeconomic inequalities</a> are visibly marked by skin colour differences. Meanwhile, in the global sports arenas, racist incidents at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/07/euro-2012-holland-racist-abuse?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Euro 2012</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/08/london-2012-olympic-racism-basketball\" title=\"\">Olympics</a> reveal that old habits die hard.</p> <p>The Brazilian vision looks set to reinvigorate debates over race on an international scale. First, it challenges the idea that racial differences exist, other than as a social construct. Second, it questions whether self-identifying by race might be harmful and hold minority groups back. Denying the scientific existence of race does not deny the existence of race as a social construct, and does not deny the very real impacts of racism. Instead, it seeks an alternative way to combat racism by deconstructing the foundations that support racist claims \u2013 the assumption of difference.</p> <p>This is a contentious position amid various highly politicised and historic debates. Brazil, Europe and the US all recognise racial identity through government policy, and contain large numbers of people who passionately self-identify according to race. In the US, famed novelist <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/may/24/big-changes-black-america/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">Tour\u00e9</a> criticises the post-racial position in favour of a post-black position:</p> <blockquote> \"Post-black does not mean 'post-racial'. Post-racial posits that race does not exist or that we're somehow beyond race and suggests colourblindness: It's a bankrupt concept that reflects a naive understanding of race in America.\" </blockquote> <p>However, in the UK, leading thinkers are beginning to question the impacts of racial categorisation in various fields (including education and mental health), and suggest a <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/issue/175/\" title=\"\">rethinking of race</a>. Crucially, each national debate is very much shaped by its own unique history. So, while one vision may make sense in one country, it may not in another. Brazilian slavery was brutal and lasted officially until 1888. However, there were high levels of mixing between the main three founding continental groups \u2013 Amerindians, Europeans and Africans \u2013 producing a multi-coloured society and a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Racial-Identities-Genetic-Ancestry-America/dp/0230110614/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344889543&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sahra+gibbons\" title=\"\">weak correlation between colour and ancestry</a>.</p> <p>On Sunday, the UK passed the Olympic baton to Brazil, a symbolic moment to reflect on the Games that have been, and the Games that will come. Now one of the world's strongest economies, Brazil's influence on global culture can only grow. Could Brazil's vision inspire a cultural shift in the way we view race in the UK? In the globalised 21st century, will the very idea of race become an anachronism?</p>",
  "<p>Zoologist, film-maker and explorer Lucy Cooke is leading a one-woman war on the tyranny of cute. Not for her the heart-squeezingly charismatic mega fauna of pandas, penguins and baby polar bears, not when there are natural wonders such as flying snakes and bats that use a carnivorous pitcher plant for a toilet. Indeed, while most people visit Borneo to respectfully stroke an orangutan, Cooke prefers that country's proboscis monkey with its giant bulbous nose, soft pot belly, Donald Trump hair and permanent erection that looks like the world's least appealing chilli pepper.</p> <p>\"I'm trying to bring a bit of positive PR to the ugly, the unloved, the freaks,\" she says. To that end, Cooke has a show called Freaks and Creeps airing on National Geographic Wild this summer. Her journey began when she spent six months travelling around South America and writing her widely read <a href=\"http://pinktreefrog.typepad.com/\" title=\"\">Amphibian Avenger blog</a>. Later Cooke tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to get a film commissioned about the desperate plight of the planet's amphibians; a third of which are threatened with extinction, a situation she likens to the wiping out of the dinosaurs.</p> <p>While in China researching a panda documentary she discovered the huge amounts of donated money to support panda-breeding factories that simply pump out bumper crops of doe-eyed babies every year while doing little to protect the animal's environment. Meanwhile, the giant Chinese salamander - the world's largest amphibian - is critically endangered, but struggles to get any conservation funding at all.</p> <p>\"You know why that is,\" Cooke asks? \"Because it looks like a 6ft penis with feet. But nature is like a game of Jenga; you never know which brick you pull out will cause the whole stack to collapse.\"</p> <p>When National Geographic asked Cooke if she'd like to film her own show she said yes, as long as she could focus on the odd, the ugly and the unloved. \"If the show has a message,\" Cooke insists, \"it's that it's not just the cute guys that need saving. So, stuff the panda, save the salamander!\"</p>",
  "<h2>MERSEY PARADISE</h2> <p>There must be something in the water in Liverpool. And no, we don't mean <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/09/01/we-ve-caught-a-shark-in-the-mersey-100252-21647403/\" title=\"\">sharks</a> or the odd <a href=\"http://www.merseybasin.org.uk/galleries/63.html\" title=\"\">discarded shopping trolley</a>. The city could be twinned with Hogwarts, such is its ability to cast spells on people. Certain football folk, in particular, seem bewitched by the place, unable to leave even after the club has made like an office prankster and severed all ties. From Jan Molby to Didi Hamann and Rafa Benitez, former Reds eschew the charms of more sunny or fashionable destinations to remain on Merseyside and become honorary Scousers, even, in the case of Benitez, going so far as to regularly bivouac outside the Anfield employment office in the hope of one day being readmitted.</p> <p>The latest player to get hooked like a pair of car keys at the end of a wily crook's fishing rod is Daniel Agger, who has declared his eagerness to pick his own pocket by turning down a potential move to Manchester City in order to carry on at Liverpool. \"I'd rather stay,\" pleaded Agger as he prepared to tattoo the head of Jay Spearing on his heart. \"I can't imagine playing for any other club in England,\" Agger is reported to have told Danish website politiken.dk before adding with a tear: \"But that decision is not up to me. Liverpool can do a deal even though I have two years left on my contract, but I haven't changed my mind on the subject.\"</p> <p>Agger is exactly the sort of ball-playing centre-back that Brendan Rodgers needs for his preferred style of play to flourish but the club may not be able to resist a bid in excess of \u00a320m, some of which they could use to pay the wages of Nuri Sahin, the Real Madrid midfielder whom Liverpool hope to land on loan and who is reported to be close to rejecting Arsenal on the advice of Xabi Alonso, a reluctant departed Red who seems to want to continue living in Liverpool vicariously.</p> <p>Inspired by Alonso's advocacy, Arsenal and Man City are understood to be trying to call on players to convince Sahin and Agger, respectively, to move elsewhere. They have had to rule out asking Mario Balotelli after it emerged that the Italian was instrumental in persuading Fabio Borini to join Liverpool by claiming they had the best fans in England. Arsenal and City, then, could soon find themselves in a position in which they never imagined they would be: looking for a phone number for Paul Konchesky.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Like me or not, I am the only one who won the world's three most important leagues. So, maybe instead of the 'Special One', people should start calling me the 'Only One'\" \u2013 don't ever change, Jose.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\"Given their record on appointments so far, if Venky's were to turn to a universal adviser to advise Blackeye Rovers global adviser Sheppy Singh (yesterday's Fiver), they'd inevitably get it wrong. They would then be obliged to bring in someone to advise the universal director, but since the universe is infinite you can't trump a universal director and they'd have to turn to the creator of the universe commonly known as God. Thus the prayer of the faithful; 'may God help us' will come to pass\" \u2013 John Myles.</p> <p>\"Those of us who have had the pleasure of listening to Shebby Singh punditating on ESPN Asia over the years, have long understood that he is a plum.

  "<p>While Glasgow's Commonwealth games team has been<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/13/london-olympics-boost-glasgow-commonwealth\"> soaking up the euphoria</a> from the Olympics, it seems they have been absorbing the London games' experiences on security and transport. </p> <p>So much so, that David Grevemberg, the Glasgow 2014 chief executive, is not only planning to have exclusive \"Zil lanes\" for athletes and officials on the city's roads and motorways, he's also pondering whether the armed forces could provide security.</p> <p>The military presence at the Olympic venues \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/24/london-2012-olympics-g4s-military\">a last minute fix</a> forced on the organisers by the calamitious failure by private security firm G4S to train enough staff - particularly impressed, Grevemberg said.</p> <blockquote> <p>One of the things which has been so powerful is that the presence of the armed forces has instilled a real sense of confidence, comfort, professionalism, discipline and this welcoming environment that I think has impressed everyone. </p> <p>And everyone I have talked to who has gone into the Olympics park and has passed through that security checkpoint, that has been welcomed by the British armed forces, has really just 'wow'.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/13/london-olympics-boost-glasgow-commonwealth\">an interview with the Guardian</a> last week, the day after returning from again visiting the London games, Grevemberg indicated that asking the military to help provide security at Glasgow 2014 was being considered: </p> <blockquote> <p>I think that has to be determined post-London 2012 but certainly we've been very impressed with them. It does cost money. There is a price for that discipline. But all the way up to my chairman, Lord Smith, the experience we had just going through those checkpoints was world class.</p> </blockquote> <p>Grevemberg added that the post-Olympics inquests into G4S's failures and other security issues would continue to influence Glasgow 2014 planning, but the armed forces and MoD too might well have their issues. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/13/army-olympic-games-recovery-two-years\">the Guardian disclosed</a> on Monday, senior military figures have warned it will take the armed forces up to two years to recover from the impact of suddenly deploying 18,000 military personnel to the Olympics \u2013 in other words, until July 2014. So even if Grevemberg did have the cash to pay for khaki and blue at the gates, he might not get it.</p> <p>One thing Grevemberg is planning to introduce are exclusive Games' lanes on roads reserved solely for competitors and the \"Commonwealth family\" which will affect many major arterial routes around the main \"clusters\" of venues in the east end and west end, and around Hampden.</p> <p>Branded \"Zil lanes\" in London after the former Soviet Union habit of reserving lanes for senior officials, that will include taking over lanes on the new M74 extension and the M8. It will mean lane closures and traffic diversions for the two weeks of the games, from 23 July to 4 August 2014.</p> <p>They will be needed, he said, to guarantee that athletes, officials (and games sponsors) and the media can travel to competitions and training as fast and efficiently as possible. At the Atlanta Olympics, he said, traffic chaos meant some athletes failed to arrive at venues in time to compete. In London, errant motorists were hit by automatic fines of up to \u00a3130 per offence.</p> <p>Glasgow 2014 is now building a traffic management and lane closure plan \"which allows us to divert traffic to enable us to meet the needs of the Games while keeping the city running as easily as possible\", he said. Grevemberg added: </p> <blockquote> <p>It's part of our project. One of things which is important to realise about Olympic lanes is that first and foremost, they're there to get athletes and team officials, in the case of the Olympics that's about 17,000 people, as quickly as possible too and from the venues to ensure that athletes get an adequate amount of rest, to ensure they get that sanctuary where they need to rest and relax but also get as quickly to training and competition as possible. That's the primary reason, and that they're not late for competition.</p> </blockquote> <p>Happily for Grevemberg, the Olympics lanes were far less controversial in London than many had feared but for those drivers who were caught out, hefty fines ensued: according to the Independent, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/london-2012-nearly-2500-drivers-slapped-with-olympic-games-lanes-fines-8022681.html\">there were 2,400 fines</a> for illegally using them \u2013 worth \u00a3320,000 in total. For some Glaswegians, Glasgow 2014 may just be a little less the \"friendly games\" than they like.</p>",
  "<p>Jo Confino raised the lid on a fundamental issue when he questioned whether Barclays had brought corporate responsibility (CR) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/barclays-corporate-responsibility-reporting-disrepute\">into disrepute</a>. As he points out, there is a vast gap between the company's behaviour and its corporate sustainability aspirations.</p> <p>In addition to the fallout from the ongoing financial crisis, we have also witnessed the recent Libor and mis-selling scandals, but there are also questions about how Barclays, and indeed other banks, generate legitimate wealth. The bank allegedly makes up to \u00a3340m each year from agricultural commodity price speculation; an activity that has the impact of <a href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/833156/ barclays_making_up_to_340_million_on_food_price_speculation.html\" title=\"\">driving up food prices and exacerbating poverty worldwide</a>.</p> <p>Even looking behind the headlines, and digging deeper into the <a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/stop-bankers-betting-food/food-speculation-resources\">source report</a>, it is clear that short-term speculation is a significant activity in which Barclays, and other major banks, make substantial profits.</p> <p>Given the true impact of such business activities, it begs the question: can this ever be considered a legitimate source of revenue, within the framework of a genuinely sustainable business? I'm also unsure how we square this approach to business with the bank's gold status in <a href=\"http://www.bitc.org.uk/cr_index/results_and_ranking/index.html\" title=\"\">the latest BITC Corporate Responsibility Index</a>.</p> <p>The real point is that it really does take more than a bit of eco-efficiency and volunteering to develop a truly sustainable business. The ways in which companies make their money has a huge impact on society, and the planet.</p> <p>But Barclays is certainly not the only culprit when it comes to misalignment between CR aspirations and business strategy. There are plenty of other examples of corporate schizophrenia out there, and you don't have to dig too deeply to find them.</p> <p>BMW was recently accused of hypocrisy for its lobbying activities, aimed at watering down EU plans to further improve fuel efficiency of cars, while simultaneously trumpeting its green credentials as an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/09/bmw-hypocrisy-european-car-targets\">official sponsor of the Olympic Games</a>.</p> <p>Of course, no business is perfect. So why is this strategic misalignment an important issue and is there a more fundamental issue at stake?</p> <p>While there are pockets of good practice out there, there can be no room for complacency, otherwise our businesses will fail, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/food-water-energy-resource-efficiency1\" title=\"\">ultimately so will our planet</a>.</p> <p>Eco-efficiency only gets us so far; it slows down the impact of some issues, and buys more time <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/feb/22/rebound-effect-climate-change\">(subject to the rebound effect)</a>, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problems we face.</p> <p>The circular economy, in theory, has the huge potential to maximise resources in use, and alleviate pressure on earth's precious and declining reserves. A worthy strategy for all, but on its own it will not solve some of our socioeconomic challenges.</p> <p>The sustainable business movement will remain partial until it exerts real pressure on the business model and corporate strategy.</p> <h2>What is driving the gap between CR aspirations and the reality of corporate behaviour?</h2> <p>Is the problem one of businesses simply attempting to hijack the CR/sustainability agenda, in order to gain a perceived, short-term reputational advantage? Or perhaps intentions are good, but there is a genuine lack of understanding on what is required to become fully sustainable, with sustainability treated as an adjunct to the main purpose of making money. It is possible that many companies intuitively get the idea of eco-efficiency, without questioning the more fundamental aspects of the business, its strategy, and its true impact.</p> <p>Business leaders and their CR advisors may truly believe that by adopting an incremental change agenda, slowly pushing the organisation in the right direction, they are doing well. After all, one has to start somewhere and some of the key, underlying business challenges may be considered too difficult to solve today. Short-term pragmatism is fine, so long as it doesn't become an excuse for dealing with the fundamental issues.</p> <p>There can also be a problem with definitions and scope. More or less everyone claims to be green or sustainable these days. Whether it's the greenest government ever, the greenest Olympics, or the greenest product manufacturer; there are lots of CR reports out there, lots of fine words and a plethora of awards and rankings. But clearly, in reality, not all we see today will be fully sustainable.</p> <p>Perhaps there is a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/michael- townsend/green-skills-time-for-som_b_1591268.html\" title=\"\">skills gap at play</a>? There are many good CR people out there, with a great many skills in technical and sustainability matters, but they may not have a rigorous grounding in business, to provide the confidence and insights that enable them to challenge the business strategy, and drive through a new integrated agenda.</p> <p>Equally, the majority of business leaders may still lack a sufficient understanding of the real challenges they face, and how sustainability principles can provide them with an enlightened approach to modern business strategy, resilience, profitability and success. There really does need to be one agenda \u2013 integrating all aspects of business and sustainability.</p> <p>There may be darker forces at work in some corporations, holding back those who would progress the sustainability agenda from making meaningful inroads into the hallowed core of the business and its strategy \"\u2026do not go there, 'tis more than your job is worth!\"</p> <p>A recent survey of Wall Street executives found that a quarter of participants believe that <a href=\"http://www.epmchannel.com/2012/07/20/survey-results-bankers-say-wrong-doing-is-necessary/\">wrongdoing is a key to success</a>. It is worrying that so many business executives should see the world this way, but one also wonders how many participants felt able to be candid \u2013 the real proportion of those prepared to accept wrongdoing may, in reality, be much higher.</p> <p>But there is another important barrier \u2013 the difficulties that incumbents face when meeting the ultimate business challenge: should they be the one to kill the golden goose? It can be hard for any organisation to turn its back on the revenue stream that may well have generated the company's wealth and status to this time, in order to deliver a more sustainable business model.</p> <p>Even if the directors have the vision and foresight to see how the business model could and should be changed, there is still the real fear of failure that would go with such a bold move.</p> <p>Now we're really getting to the root cause \u2013 the human condition \u2013 and this is perhaps where we need to do most work; taking away that fear of failure, and freeing people up to try, experiment, learn, and improve \u2013 to be bold.</p> <p>After all, we cannot hide from the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:2CNeRi8eOUAJ:www.earthshinesolutions.com/docs/Surviving%2520Creative%2520Destruction%2520SB%2520Oct%25202011.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiUC6QT5iFQmMufesS4kCfXp4vrFT46dllA6IjPDvk7bcX6NxO8aU0tJhXem0rWWSKJFRh4xEjaH-ZJUo9934xrOl8Z7HPvkN0FrytFAaxI3zpyHQGFMOkudW4giQtyEUR7Sdg6&amp;sig=AHIEtbRNeMeB9GlYHCROi6vsCLAR7HHpQg&amp;pli=1\">strategic icebergs out there</a>, and shouldn't the real focus of our fears be of staying as we are now, as we will all surely fail on our current course?</p> <p><em>Michael Townsend is the founder and CEO of </em><a href=\"http://www.earthshinesolutions.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Earthshine Solutions</em></a><em> and is passionate about promoting the benefits of sustainable business.

  "<h2>Comedy news from Edinburgh</h2> <p>It's week two of the fringe, and unease about low audience figures continues to thrum beneath the surface jollity. Richard Herring broke cover at the end of last week, <a href=\"http://www.richardherring.com/warmingup/?id=3575\" title=\"\">writing on his blog</a> about his own experience of low sales for his Underbelly show Talking Cock. \"It's a shame that I have taken the chance on a bigger venue,\" he writes, \"in the year when the Olympics/the recession/the dissatisfaction with high prices of everything in Edinburgh (delete or add as applicable \u2013 there's no definitive answer) has sucked out all the punters as if someone opened the door on a spacecraft.\"</p> <p>In a thoughtful rumination on the subject, Herring predicts that the Edinburgh comedy bubble is about to burst. \"It's open to the same market forces as the rest of life and it can't expand indefinitely and things can't keep getting more expensive without something breaking.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere in town, the kooky US double-act <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/kristen-schaal\" title=\"\">Kristen Schaal</a> and Kurt Braunohler (Edinburgh comedy award-nominated in 2009 for their show Double Down Hearts) are to pilot their <a href=\"http://www.avalonuk.com/pressRelease/332\" title=\"\">new spoof chat show</a> for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc3\" title=\"\">BBC3</a>.

Hill, who recently quit his hit ITV show TV Burp after 11 years, described the big-screen outing as \"partly a road trip, with a sick hamster and some badgers involved, plus some songs and guest appearances \u2013 the kind of thing I always do, but a bit longer and wider. I saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/88052/pee-wee.s.big.adventure\" title=\"\">Pee-Wee's Big Adventure</a> recently, and I thought, yes, there's something to aspire to.\" Of the X Factor spectacular, which reportedly has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/simoncowell\" title=\"\">Simon Cowell</a>'s approval, Hill says: \"It's like a TV Burp treatment, a celebration/piss-take, to get the lovers and haters in.

The gag was widely quoted at last year's festival, and was <a href=\"http://uktv.co.uk/dave/article/aid/646402\" title=\"\">shortlisted for the Joke of the Fringe</a> by TV station Dave. \"It was featured heavily,\" he is quoted as saying, \"since it was on Dave's roundup, complete with widespread press release, then the Telegraph listed it in its jokes of the year, and finally it was nominated for best joke in the Loaded Laftas.\"</p> <p>The joke in question goes as follows: \"I was playing chess with my friend and he said, 'Let's make this interesting.'

  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>If you happen to have an affinity for 19th-century military tales of derring-do, modern pentathlon might be worth a closer look. To most, this sport seems like a random collection of activities, but to the Mills &amp; Boon enthusiast it encapsulates a romantic legend in which, years ago, a young (and undoubtedly handsome) French cavalry officer ventured behind enemy lines on horseback to deliver a message. To complete his mission, he had to ride, fence, shoot, swim, run and snog a swooning mademoiselle with tongues. For the modern pentathlon, they dropped the last one.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>So there are five separate sports to get involved in here: horse riding, fencing, swimming (200m freestyle), shooting laser guns (YES!) and running 3km. These last two are combined in a thrilling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89034/battle.royale\">Battle Royale</a>-style climax to the day. No \u2013 that's a lie. There's no killing or maiming involved. </p> <p>The best way to begin is with one event, then by signing up for small combined events, working your way up to all five \u2013 for example you could start with a biathlon (run and swim), move on to modern triathlon (swim, run, shoot) or tetrathlon (fence, swim, run, shoot) before tackling your first pentathlon.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>If ever there was an all-rounder of an event, the modern pentathlon is it: there's no muscle group you won't work. Survival is no longer the main point.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>This is not an event for the small-budgeted among you. The running and swimming aspects are inexpensive, but the cost of fencing, shooting and riding can be considerable. Pentathlon in the UK is run regionally \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.pentathlongb.org/pentathlongb/ukstructure.php\">go to this page to locate contacts for yours</a>. Each region organises development training sessions under qualified coaches. At these training sessions you should be able to borrow equipment, with a small charge for maintenance. </p> <p>Most competitors learn to shoot using air pistols. These can be purchased secondhand for around \u00a3100, and to do so you need to be aware of the legislation on carrying and using air weapons. A new air pistol can cost up to \u00a3900. Fencing equipment will cost around \u00a3350. Check with your local club to see if they loan or sell secondhand kit. You don't need your own horse, but you do need to have a riding competency certificate in order to enter competitions.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 7/10</h2> <p>It's basically superhero training.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Jon Austin, chief executive of Pentathlon GB:</strong> \"Modern pentathlon is unique, with athletes tackling a combination of different sports in one day. You don't have to take them all up at once though. Many athletes start by enjoying swimming and running and then add one sport at a time until they can do all five. Thousands of young people take part in our schools biathlon championships each year, where we offer the opportunity to also have a go at shooting and fencing in a safe and fun environment.\"</p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.pentathlongb.org/performance/olympics.php\">pentathlongb.org</a> \u2013 Pentathlon GB (national governing body).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pentathlon-scotland.org/\">pentathlon-scotland.org/</a> \u2013 Pentathlon Scotland.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pentathlon.org/\">pentathlon.org/</a> \u2013 the homepage for the Union International de Pentathlon Moderne.</p> <h2>You may also like</h2> <p>James Bond films, triathlon.</p> <h2>You might hate</h2> <p>BMX, basketball.</p> <h2>Over to you</h2> <p>Are you a pentathlete?

  "<p>Diego Marani was responsible for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/26/finnish-grammar-diego-marani-review\" title=\"\">the novel <em>New Finnish Grammar</em></a>, which I raved about so much in these pages that it stayed on top of the Guardian bookshop bestseller list for weeks. (And I still get accosted by people who thank me for putting them on to the book.) Still, I wondered whether lightning could strike twice in the same&#xa0;general place, and hesitated a bit&#xa0;before turning to this.</p> <p>Lightning has not, I can now say, hit&#xa0;the same spot; but it has certainly struck. It is, in a way, a very different book from <em>NFG</em> (an unfortunate and misleading acronym, I now see; in future I shall stick to calling it <em>Grammar</em>). Whereas <em>Grammar</em>, with its mute&#xa0;and damaged hero relearning, or&#xa0;learning, a language out of silence, with its wartime setting, recalled Ondaatje's <em>The English Patient</em>, here we have a crime story, a murder mystery (although this is more a will-he-get-away-with-it-I-hope-not story than an actual <em>mystery</em>), within a modern, recognisable Helsinki.</p> <p>On the other hand, it is very much like <em>Grammar</em>, in that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Marani\" title=\"\">the Italian Marani </a>has let the bee that he has in his&#xa0;bonnet about Finnish language and culture buzz about in a different environment. It is about language and silence, and the silencing of language.</p> <p>The beginning of the book is severely disorienting, and deliberately so, as we see the world reduced to an experience of mystery and pain through the eyes of one Ivan, who escapes a Russian prison camp in the frozen north. His father died in his arms, and since then Ivan has never spoken a word. But he is, as the title informs us, the last of an ancient, shamanic tribe: the Vostyachs, and he is the last speaker of their language on earth.</p> <p>Ivan is stumbled across by a linguist doing field research, and as she learns his language, she realises that the language he is speaking is not only of incredible antiquity, but also related to&#xa0;Finnish. (And, as all readers of <em>Grammar</em> should know by now, Finnish is unrelated to any other languages except Hungarian and Estonian. It is not Indo-European.) And not only that:&#xa0;\"I could hardly believe my ears. They're all there, the consonants which mark the transition between the Finnic languages and the Eskimo-Aleut ones.&#xa0;Even the fricative lateral with the&#xa0;labiovelar appendix!\" (In other words: it's a bridge between Finland and pre-Columbian North America.And I love that&#xa0;exclamation mark.) Vostyach is also understood by animals, which becomes rather crucial later on, but I won't spoil the surprise except to say that this is no Dolittle-like communication, but something that Mariani has depicted with deep and stirring plausibility.</p> <p>The linguist, Olga, communicates her discovery to a one-time fellow student who is now a professor at the University of Helsinki, Director of the Institute of Finno-Ugric languages. Unfortunately, he is also a terrible human being, a vain, unprincipled egomaniac, a serial seducer, patriotic to the point of lunatic xenophobia, and extremely jealous of his own theories, which, were Olga's discoveries about Vostyach to become public, would be utterly overturned. This man, Jaarmo Aurtova,&#xa0;is one of fiction's great shits, a&#xa0;nasty piece of work whose nastiness&#xa0;makes one gasp and stretch one's&#xa0;eyes.</p> <p>So, we have: 1. An intellectual puzzle. 2. A wild man of nature adrift in a big city. 3. A <em>policier</em> set near the Arctic Circle. (If that alone doesn't make you put down your copies of <em>Fifty Shades of&#xa0;Whatever</em> then I despair. It has that&#xa0;<em>Killing</em>esque atmosphere.) 4.&#xa0;Magic, and a sense of the immensity of the primeval universe. 5. An unmistakable dash of humour, even when your nerves are being shredded. 6. Wolves, and a Siberian tiger, let loose from a zoo. 7. A happy ending against all odds. And 8. All hanging together. When I reviewed <em>Grammar</em>, I edged towards using the word \"genius\" to describe Marani. I'm doing so again now. And if you buy enough copies, Dedalus will be able to afford a proofreader for the second edition.</p>",
  "<p>I was particularly struck by Clive Stafford Smith's comment about the madness of the justice system <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/08/clive-stafford-smith-jury-system-insanity\" title=\"\">(Implacable foe of the death penalty, 3 August)</a>. It is something I have pondered, and was brought home to me recently when I was burgled. I came home to a ransacked house and various things stolen, and in no time two detectives and a fingerprint man were busy in my house.</p> <p>Next day a uniformed policeman gave me a number for my insurance company, which in due course replaced the stolen items. Later I was filled in on the identification of the suspect, who will almost certainly get a custodial sentence. I was a little shaky for a few nights afterwards, and a little inconvenienced while waiting for replacements.</p> <p>Consider in comparison the plight of the many children whose parents, including a vast army of absent fathers, have abandoned them for various reasons. These children, almost without exception, grow up feeling unwanted, deserted and maligned, usually at a very young age. And carry, at the very least, what some may call a chip on their shoulders for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Where is the justice and lawful support for these children? How is it possible that the law works unceasingly to find the cat burglar, but ignores the deserting parents who are, after all, very easy to identify? Why is it not unlawful to abandon your child?</p> <p><strong>Gaynor McGrath</strong><br>Armidale, NSW, Australia</p> <p><strong>More than some can bear</strong></p> <p>Amelia Gentleman's expos\u00e9 of what goes on at a strip club is, for most of us men, not much of a revelation at all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/20/lap-dancing-club-behind-scenes\" title=\"\">(Too much to bare, 3 August)</a>. If you want to get to the real truth, just ask a man that frequents these places.</p> <p>Strip clubs are for men who either can't get sex on their own, have been married for a long time and miss the contact with a different woman or recluses that can't get near a woman. The ugly truth of these clubs is that if the girls want to make money, they have to be willing to prostitute themselves. There is the off-chance that a rookie (a man) will go in and a girl will empty his wallet because he never bothered to ask how much a lap dance is and he keeps asking for another one. Other than that, most clubs are full-service places and the fee is usually $160 for 30 minutes for full service, half that for half-service.</p> <p>It's the ugly truth. A club gets busted, it opens under a new name in a different place \u2013 ad nauseam.</p> <p><strong>Maximo Pichardo</strong><br>New York City, US</p> <p>\u2022 The 3 August edition of Guardian Weekly runs to 48 pages, of which a full four, including photographs, are devoted to Amelia Gentleman's article about one of London's oldest lap-dancing clubs. Is this some sort of joke on the part of editor Abby Deveney or is the Guardian doing its best to become \"trendy\" in an effort to get away from its starchy image of a serious medium for the intelligentsia? If so, please desist, lest we revolt against having the piss taken out of us even more.</p> <p>Perhaps you have already planned a follow-up article on pole-dancing or massage parlours. The mind boggles.</p> <p><strong>John Orton</strong><br>Lindfield, NSW, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Congratulations on Amelia Gentleman's piece on the London lap-dancing club. It's useful to be reminded that such things \u2013 which, as we read it, make high claim to present themselves as respectable \u2013 exist. Certainly it is not a unique or even exceptional case of exploitation of women with poor prospects, but it is one case that has <em>pignon sur rue</em> in the centre of London (or western Europe, should you prefer).</p> <p><strong>Marc Jachym</strong><br>Paris, France</p> <p><strong>Threat to peace process</strong></p> <p>Your leader comment is right: having come so far restoring peace after decades of brutal and often atrocious armed struggle on all sides, there is indeed a risk that an \"alienated and dispossessed youth\" in Northern Ireland could \"too easily become a recruiting ground for terror\" in a climate of recession and spending cuts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/editorial-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">(Keep focused, 3 August)</a>.</p> <p>The trouble is that these economic hardships are hitting hard just as the healing process is getting into its stride there. A decade back hopes were high that a better state was at last being created for young people in the north and the mood on this was buoyant.</p> <p>Certainly that was how Martin McGuinness, then education minister in the new power-sharing arrangement, put it to me in Adelaide in 2000. \"Young people,\" he said, had \"come through 30 very bitter years of conflict and this [was] bound to take its toll on them\". He continued: \"Undoubtedly that leads to a sense of insecurity about the political situation and nervousness about it, which is bound to have a detrimental effect in every aspect of their lives. The question now is how we can make politics work and show young people that politics can work for them so that they can place some faith in the democratic process.\"</p> <p>\"These young people,\" McGuinness said, \"have been given hope [by the peace process] and they've never had that before.\"</p> <p>It is this generational recovery \u2013 one that has continued strongly throughout the last decade or so \u2013 that is now being menaced by recession and cutbacks. While this threat remains, a peace process that is progressing well is being undermined and its ultimate success cannot be taken for granted.</p> <p><strong>Terry Hewton</strong><br>Adelaide, South Australia</p> <p><strong>Clientelismo in Sicily</strong></p> <p>Reading Tom Kington's report on Sicily's economic reality was a depressing experience <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/21/sicily-bankruptcy-mafia-new-greece?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Fears grow for Sicily as bankruptcy looms, 27&#xa0;July)</a>. Kington compares Sicily's bloated civil service (one full-time office staff for every 239 inhabitants) to Lombardy's more reasonable one to 2,500 ratio and points to clientelismo politics as the root cause.</p> <p>Two decades ago, following a 20-year study of Italy's regional government institutions, Robert D Putnam published Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Putnam found that, in the north, for \"at least 10 centuries\" a multitude of societies, guilds, mutual aid societies, co-operatives and unions fostered \"norms of reciprocity and networks of civic engagement\" resulting in horizontal political relationships. By contrast, Italy's southern regions evolved in the opposite direction, entrenching vertical political relationships.</p> <p>Putnam defines horizontal to mean \"I'll do this for you now, knowing that somewhere down the road you'll do something for me\" and vertical to mean \"I'll do this for you now, if you do that for me now\" \u2013 Kington's clientelismo.</p> <p>Vertical politics, clientelismo, is today's dominant ideology. It is more likely that those who would fix Sicily's problems will achieve little more than to install new clientelismo beneficiaries.</p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Carrel</strong><br>Terrace, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p><strong>Caught in drugs crossfire</strong></p> <p>What steps is the US government taking to reduce the number of drug users in the US? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/15/honduras-human-rights-war-drugs?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Ordinary Hondurans get caught up in the crossfire of US war on drugs, 27 July)</a>. Logic suggests that a reduction in the demand would eliminate some suppliers. When a supplier is eliminated, but demand remains constant, the price of the narcotic rises and makes it more profitable for the remaining suppliers.</p> <p>Eliminating the demand would eliminate the employment of those tracking down suppliers, which provides a lifetime occupation for the tracker. Is that the purpose of their actions? Because the demand is not reduced.</p> <p>Of course, eliminating US demand might save the lives of innocent citizens of Honduras, and maybe even some in Mexico.</p> <p><strong>David Cowan</strong><br>Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</p> <p><strong>Advertising as comment</strong></p> <p>I read The classics: with hot bits <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/17/missing-sex-scenes-charlotte-bronte?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(27 July)</a> with dismay. Not because someone has written erotic additions for the classics \u2013 that is predictable in today's oversexualised society \u2013 but because the Guardian printed what amounts to an advertisement for the publisher as \"comment\".

  "<p>It didn't take long for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/12/paul-ryan-hailed-donations-romney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney's Republican running-mate, Paul Ryan</a>, to make the kind of impact on us foreigners which will delight his admirers and confirm the bookies' hunch that Barack Obama may well win his second term in November despite an ailing US economy. Just two days on the job and some bright spark has just unearthed Ryan's attack on the NHS.</p> <p>It confirms the impression I got from reading the Fleet St Tory press on Sunday after Romney's introduction of him as \"the next president of the United States\" (whoops). \"Who says Romney is always risk-averse, eh?\" and, \"this will set the contest alight\". It sounded like whistling in the dark to keep conservative spirits up, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/oliver-burkemans-blog/2012/aug/13/conservative-elation-mitt-romney-pick-paul-ryan\" title=\"\">knowing that the choice may well prove a Palin-esque mistake</a>.</p> <p>We can shrug and say that Congressman Ryan doesn't know much about the NHS, either its strengths or weaknesses, so we needn't waste much time on his views. That's true as far as it goes. Very bright (so we keep being told) and charismatic (Mitt needs help in that department), Ryan is an ideologue who would look at a taxpayer-funded healthcare system and condemn it out of hand.</p> <p>That's what he did in the Wall St Journal (proprietor: R Murdoch) in 2009 when he warned that the Obama health plan would put the US on \"a glide path towards European-style socialism\" in which voters would become dependent on government, reluctant to embrace spending cuts which might hit their healthcare.</p> <p>\"We need only look to Great Britain and elsewhere to see the effects of socialised healthcare on the broader economy. Once a large number of citizens get their heathcare from the State (it's always with a capital 'S' among the Ryan crowd), it dramatically alters their attachment to government,\" he wrote.</p> <p>OK, we can follow that and agree with it \u2013 or not.</p> <p>What we do know is that the UK still spends less than 10% of its GDP on healthcare, as do most advanced EU healthcare systems, more or less, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States\" title=\"\">while the US spends at least 15%, and probably nearer 17%</a>, a US health executive (private sector) told me recently.</p> <p>Which system its both fairer and more efficient in terms of health outcomes? We all know the answer. Despite the brilliance of its hi-tech medicine and its restless quest for innovation, it's not the US.</p> <p>That's what the great battle over Obama healthcare was all about: to create a system underpinned by compulsory insurance \u2013 nearly 50 million Americans, one in six, are uninsured \u2013 greater efficiency as well as fairness and bear down on costs which benefit doctors, insurance firms and pharmaceuticals, but not US business overall. Health costs are a weighty burden on both employers and staff, the largest single cause of personal bankruptcy.</p> <p>We know all this, don't we? That's where critics of Andrew Lansley's marketisation plan for the NHS \u2013 a bit more competition between the NHS, private and voluntary providers - often get it wrong.</p> <p>Lansley knows what a mess the US system is and doesn't want to copy it. No one does and even pro-market campaigners like <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Reform</a> now cite the low-cost health care innovations being pioneered in places like Mexico and Brazil as examples we might usefully explore.</p> <p>For all his vaunted cleverness I doubt if Paul Ryan knows much about this. Americans are surprisingly insular in many ways, that's why they call their local baseball competition the World Series (although the Toronto Blue Jays are allowed to play). Example? Two from yesterday's FT will do. Columnist Gillian Tett explained that many major American corporations earn most revenue abroad now - 90% of sales are overseas even for Tupperware now \u2013 which helps in a recession, but is bad for US politics. Most CEOs can no longer be bothered with it.</p> <p>And on the same page Kishmore Mahbubani, an academic policy analyst in Singapore, patiently explained why the New York state regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, was wrong to beat up on <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/14/us-standardcharted-probe-idUSBRE87C04O20120814\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered Bank the way he did</a>. Right or wrong (probably wrong?) he acted unilaterally (probably for local political reasons) in a world where <em>co-ordinated</em> action between global bank regulators is more vital than ever. It wouldn't occur to Benny that Asian regulators might be unimpressed \u2013 and that their views now count for a lot, his for less.</p> <p>But Paul Ryan is a familiar type in so many ways. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan\" title=\"\">Check out his CV here</a>. Being born in heartland Wisconsin doesn't automatically make him insular. The region's industries have bled badly during globalisation. But he's also a professional politician of the kind conservatives usually like to deplore \u2013 Barack Obama didn't have much of a CV before politics either.</p> <p>Ryan's father died young of heart trouble (there's a family history) which has made him a fitness fanatic, something American health policymakers need to take more seriously than most. He worked his way through college, but also used his late father's state benefits to help out. There ought to be an irony check here, but \u2013 as Obama is already pointing out - Ryan advocates a small state solution while still voting for expensive government programmes. We know the type.</p> <p>Professional politician? Yes, After college in Ohio, where he first encountered Hayek, Friedman, Von Mises and the intoxicating works of Ayn Rand (Alan Greenspan, who presided over the great boom and bust at the Federal Reserve was also a Rand fan), Ryan went straight to work for Wisconsin senator Bob Kasten at just 22.</p> <p>When Kasten lost his seat the same year (1992) Ryan stayed on in Washington \u2013 the wicked capital to Tea Party types \u2013 so he's not the \"Washington outsider\" they claim he is. Within six years \u2013 at 28 \u2013 he was back home (1997) and elected to Congress. He will face his eighth re-election (the law allows it) while running for Veep this autumn. Though he always did part-time jobs, there's a sniff of privilege in that CV, the long-established Ryan family construction business and some political jobs which may have helped him up the ladder. Meritocracy and nepotism are close cousins, as we know.</p> <p>As you've probably read in the past two days Ryan is now chairman of the House of Representatives budget committee, author of the Ryan Plan to shrink the federal government by such devices as a cap on healthcare spending (ironically Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, are government programmes that outspend the NHS), a 10% cut in government jobs and a simplified income tax system, 10% and 25% bands to replace the current six.</p> <p>That's a $6tn cut in federal spending over 10 years and would trim everything from roads and airports to student loans, environmental protection and food stamps for the poor \u2013 everything except social security (which is basically benefits and pensions) and defence. Ryan's proposed \"block grant\" system of payment to states running Medicaid would on some estimates cut the numbers entitled to it from 41 million to 27 million.</p> <p>It has prompted the wits to say that Romney, who has flip-flopped on so many issues in his quest for the presidency, has now outsourced his brain. Whatever the candidate says to reassure Middle America that he's not as radical as Ryan, the running mate is the more dynamic figure, the man who brought vast cheering crowds of loyalists out to cheer an astonished Romney in Waukesha, Wisconsin, yesterday.</p> <p>Plenty of Americans see government as the enemy \u2013 and only this year big money funded <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/after-wisconsin-recall-el_n_1579319.html\" title=\"\">a successful referendum result</a> in Wisconsin to endorse the governor's plans to curb trade union rights, this in a state once famous for progressive welfare reform. There was a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/wisconsin-shooting\" title=\"\">mass shooting at a Sikh temple</a> there only last week. Many people are under pressure and come up with some crazy solutions.</p> <p>One of the more interesting articles on Ryan that I have read claims that he is more of a principled conviction politician than many critics \u2013 or this article \u2013 might suggest.</p> <p>Jacob Weisberg, chairman of the Slate website, has been telling his readers that Ryan's arrival on the ticket will force Americans to consider basic issues they might otherwise be tempted to duck.</p> <p>Thus he would pay for some of his promised tax cuts \u2013 Americans love tax cuts, even when it leads straight to added debts for their children - by eliminating tax deductions. He doesn't say which ones, but that is a recipe for getting more taxes from the rich.</p> <p>Other commentators say that Ryan's arrival allows Obama to switch the election's spotlight from his record, patchy in hard Bush-created times, to what a Romney-Ryan administration might do. Scary stuff.</p> <p>Weisberg's sombre conclusion is that Ryan knows about the hard choices ahead for the US as it seeks to improve its performance in the face of the Chinese ascendancy, that he has a coherent policy which finally starts to make have-it-both-ways conservatives honest as the Democrats are not yet in the quest to make government more affordably efficient.</p> <p>Brutal honesty in election year is a bold option. For that reason Ryan on the ticket probably means a Republican defeat in November. Rupert Murdoch, who likes winners, is backing him. But, as we know, Rupe is fast losing his grip. David Cameron should watch from a safe distance and learn from the Romney-Ryan train crash.</p>",

  "<p>Like many Kenyans, Eko Dydda's tribal origins used to be obvious from his name. But after witnessing the ethnic violence that followed the country's last election, the gospel rapper decided to change his name to remove any reference to his tribe.</p> <p>The 26-year-old, who was named best male artist at Kenya's 2012 Groove awards, says many young Kenyans support his battle against tribalism. He warns that time is running out ahead of the country's next election in March.</p> <p>\"I tell (my fans) 'let's not be tribal, but let's be Tribe-All because we are the Tribe-All generation,\" he says.</p> <p>Dydda, who grew up in the Mathare slum in Nairobi, was nearly a casualty of the violence that broke out after President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\" title=\"\">declared the winner of the 2007 election</a> and the prime minister Raila Odinga, a Luo, cried foul.</p> <p>\"Things were crazy \u2026 I saw the ugly of the ugly,\" Dydda said. A gang from his tribe, armed with a panga (machete), stopped him in Mathare and demanded he speak their language to prove that he was one of them. But Dydda only spoke Sheng, the mixture of Swahili and English, which is the language of the ghettos.</p> <p>Luckily, an older man appeared and told the gang that Dydda was one of them. \"It was a wake-up call,\" Dydda said.</p> <p>The rapper, known for his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN3_fUlrKj0\" title=\"\">stammer-and-stagger style</a>, now preaches tolerance at his concerts and hosts a conversation under the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%23GHETTO_PARLIAMENT&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">#Ghetto_Parliament</a> on Twitter. \"(I changed my name) because I wanted to belong to the country Kenya and not a specific tribe,\" he said.</p> <p>Four Kenyans, including presidential candidate Uhuru Kenyatta, are<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/23/court-kenyans-trial-election-violence\" title=\"\"> facing trial at the international criminal court</a> for their alleged role in the poll violence. About 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced.</p> <p>Many young Kenyans, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/21/kenya-graffiti-artists-politicians-vultures\" title=\"\">from graffiti artists</a>, to singers and civil society activists, say they are tired of a political system built on tribal loyalties and endemic corruption. But already, analysts says, some politicians are using the divisive rhetoric of \"us against them\" on the campaign trail.</p> <p>\"[Political] mobilisation is still \u2026 being done around individuals and these individuals are talking to their ethnic base first,\" said Ndung'u Wainaina, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.icpcafrica.org/\" title=\"\">International Centre for Policy and Conflict</a>.</p> <p>In July Kenya's <a href=\"http://www.cohesion.or.ke/\" title=\"\">National Cohesion and Integration Commission</a>, brought a case against three Kikuyu musicians, charging them with inciting violence against people of the Luo tribe in political songs. The singers denied the charges.</p> <p>Joy Mdivo, the head of a Christian NGO, the <a href=\"http://eaclj.org/\" title=\"\">East African Centre for Law and Justice</a>, believes Kenyans do not want to fight again but the tensions are still there. \"We are a new generation. Yes, your tribe is important to you because that is your heritage \u2026 but it doesn't define you,\" she said.</p> <p>While calls for change resonate in Nairobi, it is hard to gauge the hunger for a new political dynamic outside the cosmopolitan capital.</p> <p>Wainaina said rural communities would support change if they thought it would improve their access to jobs, services and political representation, but warned that the ethnically based divisions were easily manipulated.</p> <p>\"Issues of resource allocation and accessibility, representation, accountability and participation are at the heart of these communities but (the lack of) an enabling environment, including access to critical information, remains a major hindrance,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Two interns who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/29/black-swan-interns-sue-studio\" title=\"\">last year sued Fox Searchlight over unpaid work</a> on the Oscar-winning film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137726/black-swan\" title=\"\">Black Swan</a> are now expanding their legal action to include all internships at parent company Twentieth Century Fox, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/fox-black-swan-internship-program-lawsuit-361424\" title=\"\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p> <p>Alex Footman and Eric Glatt's latest suit could have a major impact on working practices in Hollywood, where unpaid internships have risen in recent years. Fox itself says it changed its guidelines in July 2010 to ensure that all interns are paid at least $8 an hour. But the plaintiffs remain angry, claiming that they were made to undertake menial work with little or no educational value that ought to have been carried out by paid employees. The financial success of Black Swan, filmed in New York in 2009 prior to Fox's rule change, has also caused anger. Darren Aronofsky's intense psychological thriller earned more than $300m (\u00a3191m) at the global box office and won the best actress Oscar for its star Natalie Portman.</p> <p>The interns' motion, which will be considered next week at a federal court in Manhattan, asks a judge to \"broaden the scope of the case to include all interns who participated in Fox Entertainment Group's internship program\", citing evidence that \"the same hiring, personnel and company policies that applied to Searchlight interns applied to all interns who participated in FEG's internship program\". They seek compensation in the form of back payment for work done and a legal ruling that similar internships should not be offered in future.</p> <p>The motion also seeks to expand the suit to cover production interns, who worked on films that Fox Searchlight co-produced, as well as more than 100 \"corporate interns\", who worked through Fox's intern program. Two new plaintiffs, Eden Antalik and Kanene Gratts, are hoping to add their names to the legal action. The former worked through the intern programme and the latter worked on 2009's (500) Days of Summer, which was co-produced by Fox Searchlight.</p> <p>US law makes it clear that unpaid interns must gain educational benefit from their work experience and cannot be used to replace regular paid employees. Speaking to the New York Times in September, Footman said he spent his time on the Black Swan set making coffee, handling lunch orders, taking out rubbish and cleaning the production office. \"The only thing I learned on this internship was to be more picky in choosing employment opportunities,\" he complained. \"Black Swan had more than $300m in revenues. If they paid us, it wouldn't make a big difference to them, but it would make a huge difference to us.\"</p> <p>Glatt says he was employed as an unpaid accounting intern, which involved creating documents for purchase orders and petty cash, going to the set for signatures and making spreadsheets to track missing information in personnel files. \"When I started looking for opportunities in the industry, I saw that most people accept an ugly trade-off,\" he said. \"If you want to get your foot in the door on a studio picture, you have to suck it up and do an unpaid internship.\"</p> <p>Twentieth Century Fox has so far made no public comment on the new motion. In September the studio argued that interns were working for Aronofsky's production company, rather than directly for the studio \u2013 a point which the new legal motion seems designed to bypass. \"These are completely meritless claims aimed solely at getting press coverage for the litigants and their attorneys,\" said a spokesperson at the time of the original legal action.</p>",
  "<p>Four years after Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns became the largest casualties of the financial meltdown, the banking crisis is far from over. Public trust in banks \"too big to fail\" such as Goldman Sachs, Barclays and HSBC has been shaken by huge trading losses, price-fixing scandals and money laundering allegations.</p> <p>Of the 481 US banks that have failed since 2000, 454 have collapsed since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, according to the <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/\" title=\"\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a>.</p> <p>Against these odds, survival of small banks with a social and environmental mission is even more impressive. Their mission and distinction from the conventional banking sector could also be their salvation.</p> <p>As Wall Street struggles to restore credibility over adding value to the economy on Main Street, a cluster of mission-oriented financial institutions have banked on their green and ethical credentials to survive the financial crisis.</p> <p>America's unique regulatory structure has given rise to around 7,000 banks, which gives small banks a chance to focus on financing to create communities, rather just generating profits for shareholders, said Vincent Siciliano, president and chief executive officer of <a href=\"https://www.newresourcebank.com/\" title=\"\">New Resource Bank</a> (NRB) in San Francisco.</p> <p>\"Our mission is social,\" he said. \"We want to work with organisations and businesses that are seeking not only a financial but also an environmental and social return \u2013 the triple bottom line.\"</p> <p>NRB has weathered the economic storms over the past four years and recently reached a landmark achievement with three straight profitable quarters. It opened in 2006 with around $20m invested by shareholders, including Triodos Bank, the pioneer of sustainable banking, which recently increased its equity share to 21%.</p> <p>Despite NRB's small size relative to Wall Street behemoths, it is a member of the <a href=\"http://www.gabv.org/\" title=\"\">Global Alliance for Banking on Values</a>, a network of sustainable banks that aims to finance sustainable businesses that will impact 1 billion people by 2020.</p> <p>NRB has 400 clients across four broad market sectors: cleantech, organic produce, energy efficiency and non-profits.</p> <p>Many of San Francisco Bay Area's well-loved brands have been funded by NRB loans such as <a href=\"http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/\" title=\"\">Bluebottle Coffee</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cowgirlcreamery.com/\" title=\"\">Cowgirl Creamery</a> and <a href=\"http://strausfamilycreamery.com/\" title=\"\">Strauss Dairy</a>.</p> <p>NRB often grants credit lines of between $1m and $3m to companies that may struggle to meet stricter lending requirements at conventional banks such as Wells Fargo or Bank of America, preferring instead to identify \"learners, achievers, winners and champions\" of sustainable business values.</p> <p>\"These are the four stages of the sustainability journey. We want all of our borrowers to be on that journey,\" said Siciliano. \"The credit analysis is based on a number of factors including the ability of the borrower to generate cash flow to repay a loan.</p> <p>\"Growth and profitability are essential, but they are means goals, not ends goals. The end goal is building a more sustainable community.</p> <p>\"We are building a community of interest and values that's quite different from Wells Fargo and Bank of America. They are profit maximising global institutions.\"</p> <p>Like many other banks, NRB ran into trouble when the housing market collapsed. The bank underwent an executive management restructuring and drafted in Siciliano who had previously worked for another San Francisco Bay Area sustainable bank, 1st Pacific Bank of California.</p> <p>NRB was also held to account for mission creep by its original shareholders who thought they had invested in a pure-play sustainable bank, said Siciliano.</p> <p>NRB recently recorded a net operating income of $205,000 for the quarter ending in June this year, an enormous improvement compared with a net operating loss of $942,000 for the same quarter last year.</p> <p>\"We've done it, we're profitable, we're growing and we articulate a different kind of vision for what banking can be,\" he said. \"It's not a home run yet, we're not 50 years old doing this, but it's definitely an accomplishment.\"</p> <p>NRB has also benefited from a backlash against the traditional banking sector as it has seen the number of depositors grow since the financial crisis to 3,000 personal accounts; a figure that rose sharply in October last year when the Occupy Wall Street protests began.</p> <p>Triodos Bank has also benefited from a similar trend, as its balance sheet has almost doubled and depositor numbers have swelled from 11,797 in 2008, to 21,638 in 2011.</p> <p>\"Personal accountability matters,\" said Siciliano. \"You can vote for the kind of economy you want with your bank account. You're voting with your little sphere of economic activities.\"</p> <p>NRB's profits and lending powers may still be small compared to other banks, such as <a href=\"http://www.svb.com/\" title=\"\">Silicon Valley Bank</a> (SVB), which has $20bn in total assets and $7bn in loans.</p> <p>But Quentin Falconer from SVB's cleantech division, said: \"A lot of the people at the bank and folks that are involved in our cleantech effort really have a strong feeling that what we're doing is helping companies that are helping make the world a better place.\"</p> <p>SVB opened a full-blown commercial branch in London in June, which will be the European hub in its strategy to help companies reach global markets, and also plans to lend $100m to technology companies in Ireland over five years.</p> <p>\"Being green is not about being in the red,\" he said. \"Being green is about making green \u2013 doing great things and making money.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>She was a tearful, older woman holding a bulging bin liner. Community pharmacies are collection points for society's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/03/prescription-medicine-unused\" title=\"\">redundant medicines</a>, and the bin liner \u2013 her late husband's medical legacy and stark testament to over-prescribing \u2013 was dispatched for disposal. I&#xa0;listened as she reflected on how empty, her life had suddenly become. She needed help sleeping. I gave her maximum bedtime doses of an antihistamine known to cause drowsiness.</p> <p>The funeral was a month since, and her continued grieving would seem normal and necessary. But, in fact, a&#xa0;major reappraisal is under way.</p> <p>The revised <a href=\"http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </a>(DSM-5), scheduled for publication in May 2013 by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/09/us-mental-health-manual\" title=\"\">proposes</a> that grief reactions of more than two weeks may be diagnosed as depression. And where DSM leads, the rest follow. The World Health Organisation's international classification of diseases group is debating the creation of a new illness \u2013 prolonged grief disorder.</p> <p>Crucially, once a behaviour has been labelled as an illness, it becomes a legitimate target for treatment by Big&#xa0;Pharma. The transformation of bereavement into a mental disorder will create a new global market for antidepressant therapy. And a recent <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960248-7/fulltext\" title=\"\">critical Lancet editorial</a> describing such transformation as diagnostically simplistic and therapeutically flawed, will present little obstacle.</p> <p>Grief can affect us all; depressive illness only those who are cursed with it. So while grief must be allowed to run its course, any associated major depression must not be normalised. Superficially, symptoms may be similar, and diagnoses can slip and slide. It is in boundary issues such as this where medicalisation preys on normality, and DSM-5 has many such planning applications.</p> <p>They include the proposal that the term dementia be dropped, adding a new disease entitled neurocognitive disorder, and that Alzheimer's disease be reclassified into biochemical sub-groups. By transforming facets of ageing, such as confusion and memory loss, into apparently treatable biological disorders, not only does an ever-increasing number of older people become legitimate targets for drug treatment but the entire issue of the ageing population is reframed in a medicobiological context. Needless to say, the financial reward for the medicalisation of old age is the stuff of dreams for giant pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>Also under scrutiny by DSM-5 is children's mental health. The boundaries defining attention deficit hyperactive disorder are to be redrawn, and a new disorder \u2013 disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, characterised by disproportional recurrent temper tantrums \u2013 is to be created. When the boundaries of illness classification are redrawn they are inevitably broadened. So more children will be labelled as mentally ill, with the lifelong harm that can do to child and family, and the market for drug treatment \u2013 amphetamines and methylphenidate \u2013 will expand accordingly.</p> <p>The continued association of increased drug company sales with DSM-5 revisions has inevitably led to accusations of undue corporate influence within APA. According to a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3302834/pdf/pmed.1001190.pdf\" title=\"\">study</a> by Lisa Cosgrove and colleagues from the ethics centre at Harvard University, 69% of the DSM-5 taskforce members have financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry, and the panels with members on them that have the most conflicts of interest are those for which drug treatment is the first-line intervention, to the extent that 11&#xa0;of the 12 panel members for psychotic disorders, and all of the panel for restless legs syndrome, have ties to the drug companies that manufacture the respective treatments.</p> <p>The promotion of drugs in relation to normal human behaviour has been innovatively investigated highlighted in the satirical work of Justine Cooper, on a <a href=\"http://havidol.com\" title=\"\">spoof website</a> that markets the drug, Avafynetyme.</p> <p>The opening statement of Ivan Illich's 1975 publication Medical Nemesis was: \"The medical establishment has become a major threat to health.\" Today, medicalisation of normal behaviour is a globally important contributor to over-prescribing and iatrogenic harm. But to gauge its local impact, you need only ask your pharmacist how many bin liners they've accepted this week.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Dawson is a locum pharmacist in West Yorkshire</p>",
  "<p>Rising house prices in London continued to drive the annual rate of property inflation in June, with the capital recording a 6.5% increase over 12 months, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/house-price-index/june-2012/stb-jun-2012.html\" title=\"ONS: House Price Index, June 2012\">latest official figures show</a>.</p> <p>Across the UK the annual rate of price growth was 2.3%, unchanged from the 12 months to May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Over the month, prices rose by 0.5% to an average of \u00a3231,000.</p> <p>However, the headline growth masks falls in much of the UK. Growth of 2.8% in England was offset by declines of 1% in Scotland and 11.9% in Northern Ireland. In Wales, prices were back at their June 2011 level.</p> <p>According to the ONS index, the average price of a property in London is now \u00a3392,000 \u2013 more than \u00a3100,000 higher than the rest of the south-east and three times the average price in Northern Ireland. The average price paid by first-time buyers was up by 3.1% over the year, at \u00a3173,000, while movers paid an average of \u00a3266,00 \u2013 2.1% more than in June 2011.</p> <p>The figures, which are based on mortgage completions data from the <a href=\"http://www.cml.org.uk/cml/home\" title=\"CML website\">Council of Mortgage Lenders</a>, come as research by property website <a href=\"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/\" title=\"Zoopla homepage\">Zoopla</a> suggests sellers and estate agents are still being unrealistic about the prices they can fetch for properties.</p> <p>Zoopla found 37% of the homes listed on its site had been reduced in price at least once since going on the market, with the average price cut coming in at \u00a319,000.</p> <p>The biggest discounts were found in Newcastle upon Tyne where sellers have knocked an average of 9.6% (\u00a318,888) off their original asking prices, and in Liverpool where the average reduction is 9.1% (\u00a313,643).</p> <p>Wakefield tops the list of places with the highest proportion of price-reduced properties on the market (51%), followed by Rotherham (45.6%) and Barnsley (44.7%).</p> <p>Nigel Lewis of Zoopla said activity had been knocked by the weather and the extended jubilee bank holiday. \"Once the distractions of summer holidays and the Olympics are gone, buyers will once again be able to focus attention on their property search and this should bolster confidence among sellers,\" he said.</p> <p>However, Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said he believed prices were still set to fall further. Archer pointed out that the ONS figures lagged those of Nationwide and Halifax, which are based on prices at the point a property is valued, rather than on completion, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/06/house-prices-fall-halifax\" title=\"House prices fall 0.6%, says Halifax\">both showed falls in July</a>.</p> <p>\"Housing market activity is persistently low compared with long-term norms, and while it may eventually be lifted by more mortgages being granted at decent interest rates under the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2012/067.aspx\" title=\"\">Funding for Lending</a> scheme launched by the Bank of England, this is unlikely to be a major factor in the near term at least,\" he said.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>12.00pm: Good afternoon. The Guardian's Olympic editor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owengibson\">Owen Gibson</a> will be online <strong>from 2pm BST</strong> to take part in a live webchat. </p> <p>Owen took the job as Olympics editor in December 2008 and will continue in the role through for Paralympics, which begin in two weeks' time. If you have any questions for a man who has lived London 2012 for the past three and a half years, drop them into the <strong>comments section below</strong>. </p> <p>In the meantime, here is Owen writing on the unexpected success of the Games: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/olympics-success-story\">From tiptop venues to friendly volunteers \u2013 where did it all go right?</a>\"</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It began with fears that venues were sinking into the mud following weeks of rain, serious concerns over whether there would be enough security guards to keep the public safe and the biggest call on the army outside wartime.</p> <p>The reaction to the Olympic torch as it toured the nation had raised the hopes of organisers, but the last-ditch security crisis dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the \u00a39.3bn cost to the public purse grew louder.</p> <p>Just over a fortnight later, London's Games ended bathed in sunshine as the country giddily rose to acclaim a host of new sporting heroes amid hopes that it would lead to a new sense of ourselves and \u2014 in the words of a Locog slogan that once seemed cloying but now feels appropriate \u2014 \"inspire a generation\". </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>1.57pm: Owen will be along to answer questions soon, but while you're waiting here is his pick of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/13/london-2012-guardian-highlights-golden-games\">the best moments of the Games</a>: </p> <p><strong>Mo Farah's 10,000m triumph</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The first time I entered the Park to be greeted by witty, smiling volunteers and professional, charming soldiers was a big moment \u2013 you realised this was going to work after all. But amid a ludicrously crowded field, the first half of Mo Farah's historic double edges it as a standout sporting memory. You can ladle all the meaning on to it you like \u2013 and the sight and sound of middle England collectively losing its marbles for a Somali-born, west London-raised man of the people was something to behold \u2013 but at its core this was simply an imperious sporting feat. No British man had won the event and there had not been a non-African winner since 1984. Farah tore up the rulebook, working with his American training partner, Galen Rupp, to deal with each surge as it came, refusing to panic and striking for home with supreme confidence at 600m as the noise reached wild levels. The wall of sound in that intimate yet imposing bowl contained a note of disbelief, as if a crowd who had only just seen Jessica Ennis cross the line and Greg Rutherford jump to an unlikely gold could not believe what they were seeing. By the time Farah crossed the line to cap 47 minutes that will go down in British sporting history, there was barely a dry eye in the Olympic Stadium. Unfinished Sympathy, the Massive Attack song that was playing as Farah charged round his final lap, will never sound the same again.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>2.11pm: Owen is now in the comments sections answering questions. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17679272\"><strong>peteC58</strong></a> starts us off with a question about the lack of Olympic spirit, to which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680335\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hello all. Hope you're not feeling too bereft. There's still the Paralympics to look forward to. In answer to @peteC58, glad you had a great Olympics. I agree on your first point. Generally, thought the presentation of the sport was first class and made a real effort to include those who didn't usually follow them without alienating the purists. But it was a shame that they didn't find time to introduce every athlete before every race. Sometimes it was entirely random - the announcers would get halfway through the field and have to stop because the gun was going off.</p> <p>Saw plenty of spontaneity on the podium (what about the Farah/Bolt moment?) but agree that biting your medal is becoming a bit passe. Perhaps we can persuade medal winners to come up with something new for 2016?</p> <p>Supporters from some nations were certainly rowdier than others (the Lithuanians gave particularly loud and well-refreshed backing to their basketball players) but in the main I was struck by how sporting the crowds were. Even when Greg Rutherford was leading the long jump, there were still loud cheers for his opponents. In the team sports (and the boxing arena) the atmosphere was more raucous - but in a good way. Can't comment on that particular incident with the Poles though I'm afraid.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2.16pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680277\"><strong>markgreenwood</strong></a> asks a questions about the fairness of the ticketing process: <strong>\"You say that you think the ticket allocation process was probably the fairest way of distributing tickets I still feel this was the one thing that Locog got completely wrong. Their system encouraged people to bid for far more tickets than they really wanted. It encouraged the rich, the gamblers, the credit-card-junkies to go for broke and commit thousands of pounds. These people were usually rewarded with success, for some, fistfuls of tickets. Their system specifically discouraged anyone who was more careful.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680521\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Compared to a first come, first served system (the only real alternative), I still think a ballot was the best approach for the first batch of ticket sales. Locog have figures that they claim show no one really ended up with fistfuls of tickets - the average successful applicant got four costing \u00a3275.</p> <p>But - and it's a big but - there were many other aspects of the ticketing process they got wrong. There should have been a stricter limit on how many tickets a single applicant could apply for. Ticketmaster's system simply wasn't able to cope with the demand and seemed unnecessarily unwieldy. Many people spent many frustrating hours waiting to be told the tickets they wanted weren't available. Ben Marsh, with his amazing online ticket tracker, managed to do what the world's biggest ticketing company failed to do and find a way of checking which tickets were actually available at any one time.</p> <p>I also feel Locog should have been upfront about roughly how many tickets would be available for each session at each price point. Both the IOC and Locog admit there are lessons to learn from the ticketing process - not least for the way the IOC divides up its tickets between the host, the International Olympic Committees and the sponsors.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>2.22pm: On <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Guardian Sport's Facebook page</a> K.k. Kaushik asks when will India have a chance to host the Games.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680698\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You could ask the same question of the middle east and Africa. The fact the IOC will go to Rio next time, the first ever Olympics in South America, shows it is willing - and keen - to take the Games to new territories. <br>But it was notable that Baku and Doha both dropped off the longlist for 2020 (leaving Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid) and president Jacques Rogge has a long list of logistical and practical concerns about the middle east.</p> <p>India is an interesting one - the Delhi Commonwealth Games was seen by many as the proof of concept for an Olympic bid, but didn't go so well. A solid bid for 2020 did not materialise. But there is no doubt that in sporting and economic terms it is a huge market - even if Olympic sports are not traditionally very strong. There are also issues around how a bid would be structured and funded. 2024 could be a possibility.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>2.26pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680622\">ExtraConnect</a></strong> asks about the handover between Games: <strong>\"Any idea why the \"Olympic Movement\" do the Olympic handover ceremony at the end of the main Olympics and not after the paralympics? Surely the Games are over / shouldn't hand over until after both events are finished, or are the Paralympics not officially under the IOC banner?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680819\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Olympics are held under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee. They then pack up their Louis Vuitton suitcases and leave Park Lane, before the International Paralympic Committee (based in Bonn and headed by Brit in Sir Philip Craven) roll into town.</p> <p>Locog, however, organise both events as an integrated whole - they have been held in parallel with the Olympics since 1988 in Seoul.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>2.29pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680572\">OllyWinkles</a></strong> asks about the TV coverage of future Games: <strong>\"It seems entirely likely that the BBC will not be able to afford rights to broadcast future Olympics. The thought of watching the games on Sky Sports fills me with dread. Is there anything the Government can do to make sure the Olympics remain on free-to-air television in perpetuity?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680897\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rest easy, the BBC has rights through to 2020. The BBC certainly had a good Games, with almost universal praise for its coverage (if not its full spread of presenters)...</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>2.33pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681044\">beninho</a></strong> asks about the use of background music at the track and field events: <strong>\"Seb Coe said he thought is was 'appropriate' but his body language was not convincing. Since it was not discernable via TV and I didn't attend any live events, I have no strong view, but don't much like the way music has crept into football (e.g. when a goal's scored). What do you think about it?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681044\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was certainly one of the talking points of the Games for those of us in the stadium. On the first night of athletics action, as Dibaba surged to victory in the women's 10,000m there was extremely loud European dance music playing and it seemed entirely incongruous. Locog admitted they'd got that wrong and turned it down a bit.</p> <p>But, to my own surprise, I found that once they had done so the music actually added to the atmosphere - particularly in morning sessions that are traditionally flat affairs but in London were attended by noisy fans who seemed excited to be there.</p> <p>Not sure Seb, a track and field purist, was massively convinced but most seem to like it. I agree with you about music after goals in the football though - Middlesbrough and Wigan among the worst offenders.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>2.38pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678926\">HarryPalmer42</a></strong> asks about the legacy of the Games and how the media will cover some of the sports that have been popular during the past two weeks: <strong>\"Having seen the public interest in these sports raised over your stint as olympics editor what will your recomendation be to the Guardian senior management in relation to future coverage of the smaller sports? As I fear the back pages and content of the website will soon be Football, Football Football as before.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681232\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's a very fair question - if largely above my pay grade. There's no doubt that many of those watching (and many of those covering) the Olympics welcomed the respite from the national obsession/sport. It's a simple fact that for many people these sports exist only once every four years, but I agree the media also has a responsibility to provide a spread of coverage. But with the best will in the world, it's going to be hard to find space for sports in which we're unlikely even to qualify in 2016.</p> <p>The likes of rowing, triathlon, taekwondo, equestrian are a slightly different case - it's up to those sports to capitalise on the boost in profile and popularity the Olympics brings and bring their sport to a wider audience. If there is a genuine appetite for coverage (and with web analytic tools we can see exactly how popular different sports are) then we will provide it. Cycling is a good example of a sport that really broke through in Beijing and has capitalised since - there were days during the Tour de France when we filled page after page of the sport section with it, often at football's expense.</p> <p>But for all everyone is slightly down on football at the moment, you can bet that within a fortnight everyone will be back on board with the soap opera.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>2.45pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678736\">mullets</a></strong> is curious about the Olympic village: <strong>\"Were athletes able to come and go freely? Would they be able to leave and go for, say, a meal with their families on an evening? Was there a guest house-like curfew? What about during the day on non-competition days?\"</strong></p> <p>Owen replies:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Athletes could come and go from the Village at will, but individual teams would all have had their own policies regarding curfews etc, especially while still in competition. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/london-2012-kim-collins-axed-st-kitts\">Kim Collins fell foul of his team's rules and was barred from competing in the 100m</a>.</p> <p>Team GB officials said their athletes were all disappointingly well behaved. German discus gold medallist Robert Harting, on the other hand, celebrated victory by tearing off his vest and running down the hurdle track. He then got drunk on a German cruise ship moored in Docklands, lost his accreditation, failed to get back into the village and spent the night at a train station. Needless to say he looked a bit sheepish at his medal ceremony the next day.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>2.48pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678670\">AndyMitchell</a></strong> asks about the TV coverage of the Games: <strong>\"Am I being unreasonable or do you agree the Olympic Broadcasting was a bit under par in places?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681506\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interesting you should say that @AndyMitchell. Although the BBC's coverage was generally widely praised (not that I saw much of it for obvious reasons), there were some grumbles about OBS - the IOC-owned broadcaster that provides the feed. There was a huge row during the cycling road races about their inability to provide split times, making the race difficult to follow (which prompted a blame game between OBS, the BBC and Locog). Neither were the various intricacies of the controversies in the velodrome (most obviously Victoria Pendleton's elimination) made very clear. I suspect it is one of the issues that will form part of the debrief - after Locog did such a good job of presenting the sport in the venues, it was a shame that OBS couldn't always capture that.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>2.52pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678443\">JacksonPollocksNo5</a></strong> wants to know about the volunteers and how many of them were paid: <strong>\"I know of someone who was going to do it (but be paid) but despite being paid for training and getting his uniform etc. was refused to be allowed to do it as he didn't turn 18 until his first day of work.

Which ones were doing it for free?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681605\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hi @JacksonPollocksNo5 (good name, btw. I was lucky enough to see the Stone Roses with Bradley Wiggins et al during the Games - definitely an Olympics highlight). Anyway, the 70k Locog volunteers - the Games Makers - were all unpaid, they just got their purple uniform and a travelcard. Likewise Boris's army of 8,000 London Ambassadors (the ones in the garish pink). But other staff were paid - the G4S security guards (in bright lime green - garish colours apparently being a 2012 prerequisite) and the TfL advisers in stations and tube stations.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>2.55pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681580\">bromley</a></strong> asks about the future of the Olympic stadium: <strong>\"How are they going to reduce the capacity by 20,000 and provide a roof over all the seating for football? It will be a huge shame to lose the character of the place.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681678\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It remains to be seen. There still hasn't been a final decision on the stadium, with negotiations between the London Legacy Development Corporation and West Ham ongoing. There should a final conclusion to the long running saga/fiasco by October. I suspect West Ham will still get the nod, but there is much negotiation still to be done. I agree that it was a fabulous sporting arena. It's likely that the reduction in capacity will come from the addition of hospitality boxes between the two tiers and spacing out some of the remaining seats. But the sight lines and intimate atmosphere that made it so special as an athletics stadium should remain. The sound system sounded great too so it should work for big concerts. Whether it will work for football?

Certainly, there were big fears before the Games (fuelled by the government and organisers) that these Olympics would take place in some sort of militarised zone and feel oppressive and overly corporate, with long queues and endless search points. Warships in the Thames, rocket launchers down the road from my house in Oxleas Wood and fighter planes flying overhead in the days before the opening ceremony didn't do much to change perceptions. <br>In the event it didn't feel like that at all. Once hundreds of thousands of people flooded the venues they changed the atmosphere entirely, aided by the brilliant volunteers and - ironically - the 18,000 troops drafted in. I was happy to be proved wrong.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>3.16pm: Owen is signing off now. Thanks for your comments and questions.

  "<p>Egypt got a sneak preview of The Dictator as Ramadan finished back in 2009. Okay, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145406/dictator\" title=\"\">not that Dictator</a>: it wasn't Sacha Baron Cohen's zany, Assyrian-bearded Gaddafi duck, but a <a href=\"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/48722\" title=\"\">leathery tyrant played by veteran actor Hassan Hosny</a> with a passing resemblance to a certain shortly to-be-ousted Egyptian leader. The Arabic Eid al-Fitr blockbuster invented the country of Bambozia for its japes, while Baron Cohen's global blockbuster took place in the <a href=\"http://www.republicofwadiya.com/\" title=\"\">republic of Wadiya</a>; adjoining fictional territories with satire holding ultimate sovereignty in both.</p> <p>In theory, anyway. The Egyptian Dictator, which failed to anticipate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/mar/22/middle-east-protest-interactive-timeline\" title=\"\">the events in Tahrir Square of 16 months later</a>, was apparently a bit on the toothless side. But its release at least showed that it is possible for entertainment to touch on political issues in Arab countries (one of Hosny's feckless sons in the film, for example, enjoys selling off Bambozian assets to China). Which makes me think it's a shame that Baron Cohen's comedy didn't get released in places where it could have really done some damage.</p> <p>The Dictator is Baron Cohen's second-most successful film, and in line with its stronger geopolitical slant, did more business proportionally outside the US (64% of its $167m) than Borat or Br\u00fcno. Kim Jong-il (the film's dedicatee) and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (described as looking \"like a snitch from Miami Vice\" in the film) were obviously unlikely to have it in their Netflix queue, let alone let their countries watch it. But if the film's disclaimer \u2013 that General Aladeen wasn't Arab, and so the film is kosher \u2013 is to be taken seriously, why couldn't it get a release in more Arab countries? Especially the ones busy scrapping to kick out their despots: how much more appreciative an audience could you possibly get? But, out of all the Arab or Muslim nations, only democratic Lebanon (where the film performed well \u2013 it's <a href=\"http://boxofficemojo.com/intl/lebanon/yearly/\" title=\"\">currently the year's eighth most successful</a>), got its dose of Baron Cohen.</p> <p>The sticking points aren't hard to spot. Baron Cohen's scatological humour rules his work out straightaway in any public-moral-policing Gulf state, even before politics are on the table; a Dubai censor called Borat <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/dec/01/filmcensorship\" title=\"\">\"vile, gross and extremely ridiculous\"</a>. I would love to be in the room if that man ever views The Dictator's birthing scene. As for the politics, it's much harder to tell how off-putting to Arab countries The Dictator's are. You can see why they might be too edgy for states in transition \u2013 such as Libya or Egypt \u2013 or too near-the-knuckle for controlled regimes such as Morocco.</p> <p>But perhaps it's the cultural politics that are most damaging of all to its release prospects. Whatever Baron Cohen's and the writers' protests, you can't <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqSxKWuaWXE\" title=\"\">turn up to the Cannes premiere on a camel</a> and then try and claim you're not playing with Arab stereotypes. Several of The Dictator's best jokes (like the Munich Olympics videogame, or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFCEBWkLwqc&amp;feature=fvwrel\" title=\"\">the helicopter scene</a>) depend on the tension generated by pushing those buttons, but too many of its worst jokes do, too. The presiding idea may be to lampoon dictatorial narcissism and stupidity, but the film's aim is too diffuse, and the more the hackneyed gags about Arab pronunciation pile up (yes, yes, Wadiyan is supposed to be based on Hebrew...), the more cultural collateral damage is chalked up in the name of satire.</p> <p>Racism is certainly what the one English-language review I could find from an Arab-world commentator, <a href=\"http://varietyarabia.com/Docs.Viewer/d2d9fa14-02c6-4d5b-a5c8-fe67689236fe/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Variety Arabia's Joseph Fahim</a>, takes away from the film: \"Aladeen is the product of every cliche the Western world has held of Arab men for many decades: he's a woman-hating loutish brute who demonstrates an obtuse loathing for the US.\"</p> <p>The Lebanese don't seem to have been too troubled by that kind of thing, though, so perhaps the film is capable of finding an audience in the Arab-speaking world after all. I'm still not convinced that kind of direct engagement \u2013 whether in the Middle East, or other repressive hotspots \u2013 was what Baron Cohen and team ever had in mind, though. The Dictator's post-release publicity machine made play of the fact it got banned in Belarus, Pakistan, Malaysia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan \u2013 but the brouhaha seemed for the benefit of western audiences, adding a touch of the postmodern, life-blurs-into-art frisson Baron Cohen can no longer bring into his films. At least half of The Dictator took aim at developed-world liberal hypocrisies, as well as at crackpot regimes. Aladeen's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1E9MiUECXU\" title=\"\">final address to the UN</a> was a cunning inversion of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGfLAtiUi1A\" title=\"\">corresponding scene in Chaplin's The Great Dictator</a>, but its attack on false American democracy only highlights the priority audience for the film.</p> <p>So somehow I doubt the Arab world was ever on Paramount's release agenda. It's easy to be fatalistic: with little chance of getting the film into most of those countries, why should Baron Cohen cater to them? But his work has skirted Middle Eastern issues in the past, not least via his ever-present hectoring of antisemitism. The Dictator \u2013 playing both ends with sly amoralism \u2013 is a missed opportunity to go in hard and audaciously on the region's problems, in a way that would have made itself heard irrespective of whether the film picked up official releases. That would have returned Baron Cohen back to the role he's always sought: a clear and present danger.</p> <p>\u2022 Next week's After Hollywood will look at whether Nollywood can break through to the mainstream.

  "<p>In a torrential downpour on Nigeria's notorious Lokoja highway, traffic marshal Suleiman Said watches a fuel-laden tanker do an illegal U-turn into oncoming traffic.</p> <p>\"What can you do? It's as if they give tanker drivers something before they climb into their lorries,\" he said. \"They regard small cars as rats.\" With only one road safety official for every 1,000 vehicles, policing the roads of Africa's most populous country can be \"as if you are the only sane person on a highway of madmen\".</p> <p>West Africa ranks near the top of <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">the world's deadliest roads</a>. In five of the region's countries, there is no national law to enforce wearing seatbelts. Globally, only Eritrea has a higher rate of road deaths per capita <a href=\"http://ynaija.com/deathtraps-nigeria-ranked-second-worldwide-in-road-accidents/\" title=\"\">than Nigeria</a>.</p> <p>However, a new road safety model means Nigeria is now the only African country on track to achieve the <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22910939~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html\" title=\"\">World Bank's global push</a> to halve road deaths by 2020.</p> <p>In the federal road safety commission's headquarters in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, a dozen employees take calls from across the country. Around 100 calls are fielded each week, dispatching cars, ambulances and volunteers to distressed motorists. On a giant screen, blinking dots track the agency's 400 patrol cars \u2013 and ensure the vehicles aren't themselves speeding.</p> <p>The service, set up in 2008, is at the heart of an attempt to reduce road deaths in Nigeria. \"We have done a lot through technology and database improvements,\" said the agency's director, Osita Chidoka. \"Every Nigerian knows someone who has died on our roads. Now people don't always have to depend on villagers, who may mean well but are not the best qualified people to be the first to reach an accident scene. I have had people say to me: 'You don't know me, but you saved my life'.\"</p> <p>Statistically, at least, things are looking up: registered crashes have more than halved, to about 5,000 annually; deaths are down a third, to 12 a day. Many other accidents may go unreported. \"Overall it's positive, because our ultimate goal is to bring down deaths,\" said Chidoka. \"But we need to make more investments in enforcement and a culture of safety.\"</p> <p>One floor above his office, staff watched a monitor showing real-time data, from the number of bookings on particular stretches of road to which patrol cars' sirens were switched on. \"This is something we couldn't do before [2008]. Having everything digitised means we can look at if numbers are going up or down and ask ourselves what do we need to do,\" said Janet Adepegba, the information technology director at the centre.</p> <p>Under a pilot scheme, solar-powered speed cameras in the capital, Abuja, can track new licence plates. That coincides with 100,000 more bookings dished out year-on-year. Offenders include on-duty patrol officers \u2013 which, the agency says, shows that it polices its own employees. \"We are trying to improve visibility through technology. Not only are you caught, but people know you're caught,\" Chidoka said.</p> <p>Engineering is also helping. Nigeria has increased the number of paved roads in recent years, often sponsored by multinationals that are also ploughing money into training schemes for drivers of articulated lorries.</p> <p>But there are glitches. Unrolling digitised licence plates nationwide has faltered amid erratic registration price increases, and the speed cameras work intermittently. Complaints of extortion by traffic police are routine.</p> <p>But officials say the most formidable barrier to road safety remains poor driving. \"Speeding is the main problem,\" said Chidoka. \"Road safety is also a class issue in Nigeria \u2013 there's a perception that it only affects poor people. The political will isn't there among people who think: 'I have a good car, an expensive car, so I am safe'. Or they can afford to fly longer distances.\"</p> <p>In an average week, 1.5 million Nigerians cram on to buses. Others turn to motorcycle taxis \u2013 often driven by people with no formal training, in overcrowded cities, and that sends the numbers of fatal crashes spiralling upwards, officials say.</p> <p>Road signs, which have popped up across the country, have a limited impact. \"In Abuja, where the roads are really good, we still see high incidents of accidents,\" said Adepegba. \"You can put the best driver in the best car on a terrible road, or a terrible driver and car on the best road, and both can have the same results.\".</p> <p>On a carpet of crushed glass, Oliver Onyemoes watched a roadside mechanic attend to his battered green taxi. For the second time in a week, the brakes had failed in his 14-year-old car. \"I will drive the car until it stops because I cannot hang myself by not working,\" he said.</p> <p>Sebastian, the garage owner, said: \"Nigeria is like a dumping ground for cars whose lifespan has expired. You know the car is going to break down again because this person has no money to buy a new one. That is why our mechanics can fix cars with their eyes covered.\"</p> <p>Back in Lokoja, as his shift drew to a close, traffic marshal Said watched people collecting spilt fuel from an overturned tanker. \"It's ignorance, yes, but poverty more than that,\" he said. \"If the driver is badly trained, it is because of [a lack of] money. If people are running towards the [fuel, when they] should be thinking 'Let me run away, and live', [they] are desperate to sell some fuel just to make some small money.\"</p>",

  "<p>Apple is claiming that more than a quarter of Samsung's $30.4bn in US smartphone and tablet sales result from copying of the iPhone and iPad or infringe on other patents, a damages expert for the US company said on Monday.</p> <p>But Samsung's lawyers argued that Apple's evidence was not sufficient to merit such an award as the two sides clashed in the San Jose courtroom as the trial entered its third week.</p> <p>The Silicon Valley company is demanding up to $2.75bn of damages from its Korean rival. The figure includes an estimate of profits lost to infringing Samsung gadgets.</p> <p>The South Korean company sold more than 87m mobile devices in the US from mid-2010, when Apple's complaint originates, to March 2012, according to documents displayed before the jury.</p> <p>Accountant Terry Musika, citing Samsung records and testifying as an Apple expert witness, estimated that $8.16bn in revenue, or 22.7m of those total unit sales over that two-year period, came from products that infringed Apple patents, such as the first Galaxy S smartphone in July 2010.</p> <p>Samsung typically does not reveal its sales in the US or elsewhere. Since the third quarter of 2011 it has stopped giving figures for worldwide shipments of its mobile phones, smartphone and tablets. Instead it provides briefings to financial and industry analysts, who then make their own calculations from other industry sources about the totals. Apple, Nokia and BlackBerry maker RIM all declare how many handsets they have shipped in each quarter, while Samsung, HTC, Motorola and Sony have ceased doing so.</p> <p>However, Samsung has been obliged to divulge details of US shipments for a wide range of allegedly infringing phones and tablets. Those have pointed to far smaller figures than many had expected.</p> <h2>Complex calculations</h2> <p>Musika said that his team's calculations suggested that Samsung earned roughly a 35.5% gross profit margin on that revenue, between June 2010 through March 2012, and justified his calculation by saying that it involved a team of 20 programmers, accountants, statisticians and economists to work out the estimated damages at a cost to Apple of $1.75m.</p> <p>\"It's not me sitting at a desk with a calculator,\" Musika, a former KPMG and PriceWaterhouseCoopers accounting partner, told the court. \"There are literally hundreds of millions of calculations.\"</p> <p>But Samsung argued that Apple, which was struggling to keep up with demand for the iPhone 4 from July to October of 2010, did not have the capacity to have delivered on those additional sales. \"Apple couldn't service its own customers with the iPhone 4, but it could service customers it didn't have?\" Samsung attorney Bill Price asked Musika.</p> <p>Price also argued that the damages should vary depending on whether the Samsung products at issue in the lawsuit infringed on just one or all of Apple's patents.</p> <p>Apple's legal battle with its fiercest business rival \u2013 which is also its largest supplier \u2013 has transfixed the global mobile industry. It moves into a technical damages-estimate phase this week. The trial, which began in late July, has seen a procession of executives, designers and patent experts testifying on behalf of the US company. Closing arguments are expected to begin next week.</p> <p>Apple concluded its case on Monday, upon which Samsung's lawyer made a formal request to have the complaint dismissed on the basis that Apple had not proved its case. Judge Lucy Koh listened to about an hour of argument from both sides before determining that it should continue on the basis that the testimony so far was sufficient that a jury should make a determination of whether there was infringement.</p> <p>Because the case is against the US subsidiaries of Samsung Electronics, Koh did drop three phones that are not widely sold in the US, and not sold by Samsung US, from the case. Those are the \"world\" variants of the Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S and Galaxy S2 smartphones. But the US-specific models of those phones remain part of the case, and Apple can still pursue its case against Samsung's parent company on those three phones.</p> <p>The world's most valuable technology company is accusing Samsung, now the leader in smartphones, of copying its iPhone and iPad in various elements of \"trade dress\" \u2013 the cosmetic appearance of the devices \u2013 and infringing a number of patents covering their onscreen operation. The South Korean company denies that and says Apple infringes several of its wireless technology patents.</p> <p>Musika cited Samsung documents that identified the iPhone back in 2007, when the first of the revolutionary smartphones emerged, as one of four major factors defining mobile trends in the ensuing five years.</p> <h2>Prior art?</h2> <p>Samsung called its own expert witnesses on Monday afternoon, seeking to disqualify a number of Apple's patents \u2013 in particular its \"rubber-banding\" effect, in which when a user tries to scroll beyond the top or bottom of an onscreen list, it \"bounces\" back, and its \"pinch to zoom\" two-finger control gesture, and the use of a single finger to move objects onscreen \u2013 by citing university and other products devised in 2003.</p> <p>If the jury decides that Apple's patents are invalid because of such \"prior art\", Samsung might not have to pay any damages under those elements.</p> <h2>Microsoft: no cloning</h2> <p>The trial continues to offer glimpses behind Apple's secretive operations, from its industrial design process to its product marketing machine.</p> <p>On Monday, an Apple executive testified that the company had licensed prized design patents to its one-time bitter rival Microsoft but with an \"anti-cloning agreement\" to prevent copying of its iPhone and iPad. That deal is believed to be part of a licensing deal struck by Steve Jobs with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in 1996 when Apple was in dire straits. Jobs persuaded Gates that Microsoft should cross-license the patents, keep developing Microsoft Office for the Mac platform, and invest $150m in buying non-voting stock in Apple. That deal is believed to be why Apple and Microsoft have not clashed in the courts over any patent issue relating to smartphones since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 \u2013 but in contrast battles with Nokia, Motorola and other handset makers have become commonplace.</p> <p>The decision to license Apple's design patents to Microsoft was consistent with its corporate strategy, Teksler said, because the agreement prohibited Gates's company from manufacturing copies. \"There was no right with respect to these design patents to build clones of any type,\" Teksler said.</p> <p>Apple had contacted Samsung in 2010, hoping to strike an agreement with its rival on patent licensing before their dispute hit the courts, patent licensing director Boris Teksler said. Teksler testified that Apple offered a clutch of patents for licensing but, crucially, viewed patents related to what he called the \"unique user experience\" as a highly protected category.</p> <p>Those included design patents at issue in the lawsuit, covering the look and feel of the iPhone and iPad. Teksler told jurors last week he could count \"on one hand\" the instances Apple has licensed those patents. Samsung was offered other patents at a cost of $20 per handset and $30 per tablet. It declined the offer.</p> <p>Apple filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Jose, California, in April 2011.</p> <p>Apple finished presenting evidence on its own patent claims on Monday, and Samsung began calling witnesses. Koh said she hoped the attorneys would be able to present closing arguments next week.</p>",

It stems from the exploits of Kevin Keegan and Mick Channon, with Matt Le Tissier starting to make his own impact later in the 1980s. The club had been sound for many of the subsequent years and were FA Cup finalists as recently as 2003, when they were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal.</p> <p>That sense of status was to disintegrate at a startling rate and Southampton were relegated from the Premier League two years later. The club then tumbled out of the Championship in 2009, with a 10-point penalty imposed in League One because the club's parent company had gone into administration.</p> <p>The revival achieved by the current manager, Nigel Adkins, has been remarkable. It is his work that has restored a sense of stability. Shortly before his appointment in September 2010 Southampton's owner, Markus Liebherr, had died suddenly but Adkins appears to deal well with whatever circumstances he encounters.</p> <p>He is familiar with the game at nearly all levels. His CV, indeed, is different from most of his cosseted counterparts in the Premier League. The former goalkeeper has a degree in physiotherapy and was player-manager of Bangor City, where he won the League of Wales twice. Adkins is all the more interesting since a generally impressive record still contains setbacks.</p> <p>His work speaks of persistence more than effortless progress. While he was in charge, Scunthorpe were promoted to the Championship and relegated from it. Adkins took the club back and kept it there in 2010. His move to Southampton, then in League One, followed and the club achieved consecutive promotions.</p> <p>There was an uncanny consistency to those campaigns, with the club always well placed in the table. The side also had a pleasing balance. Southampton were the highest scorers in their division last season with 85 goals but only Reading, who won the Championship, and Hull had a better defensive record.</p> <p>The club ought to be secure. They were, after all, in the top flight for the 27 years from 1978 to 2005 and have in St Mary's a modern stadium with a capacity of over 32,000 that should now be filled on a regular basis. While the turnout in the stands will be good the anxiety lies as ever with the calibre of the men on the field. Steven Davis was free to sign once Rangers entered the liquidation process.</p> <p>Another newcomer was costly. Southampton have made their record signing with the \u00a37m purchase of Jay Rodriguez. The attacker collected one England Under-21 cap as a substitute. Rodriguez is 23 now and has excelled of late with Burnley in the Championship. Adkins has had to make the tricky assessment of his likely impact at Premier League level since strikers who have already proved themselves in that environment are unaffordable.</p> <p>They are quite likely to be vibrant in the short term. Southampton have already relished that kind of impact. Billy Sharp came to the club in January for \u00a31.8m from a fellow Championship club, Doncaster Rovers. In a few months he ran up nine goals from 15 appearances.</p> <p>It is not the sort of rate that is liable to be sustained in the top flight but the excitement of being on such a stage often has an impact for a while and strikers, above all, are creatures of mood. Adkins has a general interest in improving the attack and confirmed that he wishes to buy the Blackpool winger Matt Phillips but the manager denied there had been an improper approach to the player.</p> <p>At present it is likely that durability will be more important than flair if Southampton's prospects are to be bolstered. Pre-season friendlies do not always provide reliable evidence but there must have been some disquiet in Adkins' mind during the recent 4-0 victory by the visitors Udinese. The manager was heartened by some aspects of the friendly but must aim for greatly improved defending, particularly since Southampton start their Premier League programme with a match at Manchester City on Sunday.</p> <p>Resilience was already a common topic of discussion before the encounter with Udinese. Adkins has lately signed the 20-year-old Argentinian goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga from Gillingham and it is anticipated that he will be able to challenge Kelvin Davis for his place. Gazzaniga had the good fortune to appear merely for the second half with Udinese, when the match was petering out and just a single goal was scored.</p> <p>The fans fret about the back four and there has been much talk of an interest in the centre-back Scott Dann, although the \u00a36m price sought by relegated Blackburn is almost double the valuation of Southampton and other potential bidders. Regardless of the outcome in Dann's case, Adkins's side will have to show even more of the resilience that was evident in the Championship.</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago, a picture showing hundreds of dark-skinned men splayed across a beach was passed around on Facebook. The men appeared to be either asleep, or more likely, dead. They lay against each other, their faces averted from the camera, while men in fatigues holding semi-automatic weapons towered over them. The caption read: \"Continuity of massacre of Muslims of Burma by Buddhists. More than 1,000 killed yesterday. Please share.\"</p> <p>After some probing, the photograph <a href=\"http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/12867/social-media-is-lying-to-you-about-burmas-muslim-cleansing/\" title=\"\">turned out to be a fake</a>. But all fabrications aside, there actually is a bona fide crisis unfolding along the Burma and Bangladesh border \u2013 despite the poppycock on social media, the sham did raise questions that traditional media have largely ignored.</p> <p>Violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Burma's Rakhine region erupted in June after the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18395788\" title=\"\">alleged rape and murder</a> of a Buddhist girl by Muslim men. The scale of violence has led to scores of deaths and the <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/31/burma-government-forces-targeting-rohingya-muslims-0\" title=\"\">mass displacement of tens of thousands of people</a>. After a state of emergency was declared in the province, the entry of Burma's security forces lent another dimension to this conflict. Amnesty International <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/myanmar-rohingya-abuses-show-human-rights-progress-backtracking-2012-07-19\" title=\"\">said in early August</a> that Rakhine Buddhists, together with security forces, purposefully meted out devastating violence against the Muslim minority.</p> <p>This violence is only the latest chapter in a long history of state-sponsored repression against the Rohingya. It began when Burma began its project of \"Burmanisation\" in the 1950s, with its lofty aims for racial purity and the nationalisation of resources following the end of British rule. The minority was targeted in pogroms in 1978, <a href=\"http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/suu-kyi-must-not-ignore-the-rohingya-1.122681\" title=\"\">stripped of their citizenship in 1982</a> and became the perfect foil for rampant human rights abuse, including slave labour and torture, that <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/ishak-mia-sohel/plight-of-rohingyas-in-myanmar-international-community-and-aung-sung-suu-kyi_\" title=\"\">led to a second exodus into Bangladesh</a> in 1991-1992.</p> <p>But not only are the Rohingya a disenfranchised people, they are dark-skinned Muslims with little relevance, representation and significance to anyone. Unable to deal with a matter the much-vaunted Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has not endorsed, the western world has tiptoed around the issue. Aung San Suu Kyi's silence is evidently an attempt to placate her constituency ahead of general elections in 2015, and to criticise her now would be like admonishing Nelson Mandela in the run-up to the 1994 election in South Africa. But unlike South Africa in the 1990s, Burma is not on the verge of some tremendous political shakeup; while the Rohingya are being sacrificed as collateral damage in the greater project of the democratisation of Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi is missing an extraordinary opportunity to live up to her reputation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in that parallel universe known as the \"Muslim world\", the Rohingyas have joined Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq and Afghanistan on the list of flagship Muslim causes. In a region that is home to the world's greatest concentration of Muslims, the delayed reaction of neighbouring Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei is startling. Last week, Bangladesh, another Muslim country, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19125916\" title=\"\">ordered three NGOs</a> to stop providing food and other humanitarian assistance to Rohingyas in the border area, claiming it did not want to encourage more asylum seekers to its shores. Already 40,000 unregistered Rohingyas live in makeshift camps in Bangladesh, and <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e487546.html\" title=\"\">according to the UN Refugee Agency</a>, the latest violence will result in a greater influx of people \u2013 whether Bangladesh likes it or not.</p> <p>While Burma's Muslim neighbours struggle to respond, Saudi Arabia has thrown money at the problem. It has fallen to Turkey to <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/fm-davutoglu-pledges-to-help-rohingya-muslims.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=27556&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">act decisively</a> by further extending its newly found benevolence to the Islamic world. As images of the Turkish prime minister's wife <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEfniqNel0g&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fb_source=message\" title=\"\">sobbing</a> as she witnessed the effects of the violence herself begin to be passed around online \u2013 further cementing the Rohingya cause to the long list of Muslims' suffering \u2013 Muslim prayers have bemoaned the global silence as proof of the grand conspiracy against Islam. And yet little is being done by Muslims to actually reverse the treatment of their purported brethren themselves.</p> <p>It all makes for a rather disempowering picture, but it doesn't have to. Given how fast a fake picture can spread its way across the world, imagine what we could do with a little engagement.</p>",
  "<p>The US, Britain and France are scrambling to retain their influence with Syrian opposition groups amid fears that most support from the Gulf states has been diverted towards extremist Islamic groups.</p> <p>Rising concern that an increasingly sectarian civil war could spread across the region, combined with reports of brutality by some opposition groups, and evidence that the best-organised and best-funded rebel groups are disproportionately Salafist (militant Sunni fundamentalists), has triggered an urgent policy change in western capitals.</p> <p>Washington, London and Paris now agree that efforts to encourage a unified opposition around the exile-led Syrian National Council (SNC) have failed, and are now seeking to cultivate more direct links with internal Syrian groups.</p> <p>Ausama Monajed, a British-based SNC member, conceded: \"The SNC could have done a better job, a more effective job, in organising the forms on the ground, and now the key issue is to bring fighting groups together in some other framework. But that does not mean that the SNC will be sidelined altogether. It is still the biggest political grouping and has a political and diplomatic role to play.\"</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, flew to Istanbul on Saturday to meet Syrian opposition activists and boost military and intelligence co-operation with the Turkish government to prevent the violence spreading across the border. Jon Wilks, Britain's special envoy to the Syrian opposition, was also in Istanbul last week for a meeting with someone the Foreign Office described as \"a senior political representative\" of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), during which he stressed the importance of human rights and respect for minorities as a condition of future co-operation.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/britain-aid-syrian-opposition-groups?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the UK announced \u00a35m in new non-military aid</a> to Syrian opposition groups, pointedly insisting that all the recipients should be organisations inside Syria, therefore excluding the SNC. Clinton's meetings in Istanbul were also intended to sidestep the exile group, on the grounds that it had little influence on events inside Syria.</p> <p>\"This was a conclusion the state department came to some time ago, and it is just now percolating through into policy,\" said Joseph Holliday, an expert on the Syrian rebels at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.</p> <p>Both Wilks and the US ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford \u2013 who was withdrawn from Damascus last October out of concern for his safety \u2013 took part in an unpublicised meeting in Cairo at the beginning of the month. The aim of the meeting, organised by the Doha centre of the Washington-based Brookings Institution thinktank, and attended by external and internal opposition groups including the FSA, was to set up a broad-based committee to hammer out a mutually agreed transition plan.</p> <p>In France, the government of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is under intense pressure, particularly from former president Nicolas Sarkozy, to intervene directly on the side of the opposition.</p> <p>Fabrice Balanche, a Syria expert at the University of Lyon, said the incoming foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, \"realised that France had invested too much political capital in the SNC\". He said the new government had instead thrown its weight behind Manaf Tlass \u2013 a former Republican Guard general and member of Bashar al-Assad's inner circle \u2013 who defected in July. France is hoping the FSA will coalesce around Tlass, providing some coherence to the disparate array of militias.</p> <p>However, a Syrian financier linked to the opposition warned that the FSA would remain divided as long as it relied on multiple, uncoordinated sources of funding. \"The local brigade commanders on the ground swear allegiance to whoever supports them and the expat community sending them money is completely divided,\" the financier said. \"These are [Syrian] expats in the States and the Gulf using their own trusted channels for getting money through, so the money is pouring in from many different pockets. The number of fighters each commander can summon wax and wane with his ability to arm and pay them and their families, so there is no particular leader with enough clout to bring the brigades together.\"</p> <p>The exceptions to this rule, he said, were Saudi Arabia and Qatar, but that money went disproportionately to Salafist and jihadist groups. \"The most organised systems are run by extreme Islamist groups and they have the highest income. The more extreme brutality tends to come from that direction, but they have the most ammunition and guns, and they get their money from a unified source. All the other money comes from multiple sources and multiple channels. You can only unify these units with a unified source of money.\"</p> <p>Julien Barnes-Dacey, a Middle Eastern expert at the European Council for Foreign Relations, said that western states realised that \"if they don't get on board now, they will lose every opportunity of leverage. If the Saudis and Qataris run loose with the groups they are backing, there will be great chance of blowback.\"</p> <p>\"Blowback\" is a term widely used to describe the backing of jihadist rebels against the Soviet army in Afghanistan in the 1980s, which provided a recruiting ground for al-Qaida and global jihadism.</p> <p>According to western diplomats, a Kuwaiti sheikh is also playing a key role in channelling money collected in the Gulf to militant groups judged to have sufficient Salafist credentials.</p> <p>Western influence with the FSA is limited by a continued refusal to supply arms because of the uncertainty of where the weapons would end up. Barack Obama is reported to have issued a \"presidential finding\" (a secret executive order) earlier this year, stepping up CIA activity in and around Syria, but that too stopped short of arms supplies.</p> <p>According to reports from Washington and the Turkish-Syrian border, the main US intelligence role as been to act with the Turks in stopping arms reaching groups they view as undesirable.</p> <p>On her visit to Istanbul, Clinton did hint at more direct action in the future. She said the US and Turkey had agreed on \"very intensive operational planning\" by military and intelligence officials. \"We have been closely co-ordinating over the course of this conflict, but now we need to get into the real details.\"</p> <p>Clinton did not exclude the possibility of setting up a no-fly zone, long advocated by Turkey but rejected up to now by Washington because it would require a large-scale military operation.</p> <p>On Saturday she said the joint US-Turkish planning team would perform an \"intense analysis\" of all options as a possible precursor to more direct assistance.</p>",
  "<p>It might sound strange, but it was more of an honour to be nominated for the Social Enterprise Unsung Hero award than to win it. That's not to say I wasn't pleased, but to know my colleagues had taken the time and effort to put me forward was really something.</p> <p>The past year has been extraordinary, not just for me but for the whole team at <a href=\"http://www.thirdsectorhebrides.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Third Sector Hebrides</a>. Based in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, a chain of islands just 150 miles long, we run seven trading social enterprises.</p> <p>We're a 40-strong team, and it's been 28 years since I joined the organisation. I was the only employee, supported by a committee, and was armed with a \u00a324,000 grant we needed to overhaul what we were doing.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2012, our turnover is \u00a31m \u2013 not bad in a population of 26,400 people. We've recently expanded our facilities through the purchase of a 1.4 acre site, which was formally part of a tweed mill. As well as acquiring a new asset, it also serves as the base for Staran CIC, our ground maintenance and landscaping enterprise. With the bigger space we've grown our community transport hub, adding another 12 minibuses. Fuelled by a larger fleet we've tendered for (and won) more contracts.</p> <p>The 2,000-square metre \"shed\" is home to a new micro enterprise too, which we believe is the first social enterprise MOT station in the UK. We're now able to service our own vehicles, which keeps costs down and means we can do repairs quickly.</p> <p>We bought the equipment from a garage that was closing down. While the owner wanted to sell up, the community was going to lose a valued business and a young mechanic his job. It was an opportunity for the taking. We employed the mechanic as part of the team and over the winter got ourselves ready for business. This included registering the CIC with the <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/\" title=\"\">Vehicle and Operator Services Agency</a> (VOSA), who had not come across a social enterprise garage before.</p> <p>The enterprise is getting a good stream of customers, many of whom come in via referrals from nearby garages that don't offer MOT services.</p> <p>The next thing on the to-do list is to recruit another employee. Getting people into training and employment is one of our social missions and this year we helped 66 young people into work through the Future Jobs Fund. And one of our social enterprises, <a href=\"http://www.hebrideanchocolates.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hebridean Chocolates</a>, which produces quality handmade chocolates and has a workforce that includes people with physical and learning disabilities.</p> <p>To tackle unemployment we have been working with community organisations across the Hebrides. Almost a third of households (29%) are now on the edge of poverty. Faced with these realities, we have been frustrated by the Work Programme \u2013 delivering it has not been easy in a rural environment. It is no surprise when faced with so few opportunities that people take action. We're seeing this in the islands. People are getting together to use \"community right to buy\" legislation to acquire substantial plots of land and estates. There's a quiet revolution going on, and its capturing people's imaginations both near and far.</p> <p>We've just hosted a visit from a representative of the Youth Council of Croatia who wanted to see firsthand how we do things. We're also helping inform the Croatian government about social enterprise. It's sharing this best practice that makes me realise how much we've learnt along the way. Other countries are only just exploring what social enterprise can do for their people and their communities, and the <a href=\"http://activecitizens.britishcouncil.org/\" title=\"\">British Council's Active Citizens</a> programme is helping to facilitate these international exchanges.</p> <p>Crucial to our success has been to know our long-term goals. It helps keep an organisation on track but allows for flexibility. It doesn't matter the road you take as long as you're delivering your social mission on the way.</p> <p>I also believe in keeping your eyes peeled for opportunities and building good relationships with everybody you meet. We had rented the \"shed\" for six months and were able to buy it at a good price because the seller has been able to witness the work that went on. People see social enterprise at work and want to contribute. Now, not only can we plan long term (key to our sustained growth) but we've got assets in property to the value of \u00a31.4m. I'm already wondering what's the round the corner and what other opportunities are on the horizon, but I guess that comes with the job.</p> <p><em>Alasdair Nicholson, chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.thirdsectorhebrides.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Third Sector Hebrides</em></a><em>, the winner of the Social Enterprise Unsung Hero award 2011. </em><a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>The 2012 Social Enterprise awards are now open for applications</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
