Normally I'd say this is a huge loss for St. Louis, losing their best hitter, but the Cardinals respond by putting Craig in the outfield, the hot-hitting Matt Carpenter on first and push the Best Player In Modern Postseason History (Carlos Beltran) into the three-hole. There are worse problems to have (although it's not the greatest defensive lineup):</p> <p>1. J. Jay, CF<br>2. M. Carpenter, 1B<br>3. C. Beltran, RF<br>4. A. Craig, LF<br>5. Y. Molina, C<br>6. D.

The St. Louis Cardinals had the San Francisco Giants in a 3-1 series lead going into Friday night, and the Giants had no choice but to start the underwhelming lefty with the overwhelming contract, hoping only to get four or so solid innings from Zito before saying a few prayers and opening up the bullpen doors.</p> <p>Instead, Barry Zito gave the Giants 7 2/3rds scoreless innings, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/20/san-francisco-giants-st-louis-cardinals-nlcs-game-5-live\">the Giants went on to win 5-0</a> and the St. Louis Cardinals had to travel to San Francisco for a Game 6 that they would rather have avoided. The Cardinals are still in control, of course, as they remain just one win away from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/19/detroit-tigers-world-series-new-york-yankees\">facing the Detroit Tigers</a> in a rematch of the <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/usatoday/article/1642871?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|Detroit%20Tigers|s\">2006 World Series</a>. Tonight, they put Chris Carpenter, injured for much of the year, on the hill against the Giants' Ryan Vogelsong, hoping that it doesn't come to a Game 7.</p> <p>Is there such thing as momentum in a postseason series? If so, do the San Francisco Giants now have that? If we were going by sheer narrative, the Giants getting such a miraculous start from Barry Zito would almost guarantee that they would win tonight and at least push a Game 7. They have maybe their best starter on the mound in Vogelsong and will have their fans behind them both today and (they hope) tomorrow. They have all those intangible things this series now, but this is the postseason where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/15/new-york-yankees-detroit-tigers-derek-jeter\">Captain Intangibles himself went down</a>, so we'll see.</p> <p>After all, the Giants are still a loss away from elimination and the Cardinals have Chris Carpenter and an offense unlikely to be shut out two games in a row. The Giants may not be ready to go quietly, I can't imagine anyone on that roster wants Zito's Friday night start to go to waste, but don't underestimate how little the Cardinals want to see this series go game seven. This? This is a coin-flip game, my friends.</p> <p>So, it's another do or die game tonight.

  "<p>Harlequins boarded the plane for London on Sunday with nine points in the bag, top of Pool Three, and with an insurance policy in their back pocket should Nick Evans decide against another three years in England.</p> <p>Conor O'Shea, the director of rugby, should hear Evans's decision in the next fortnight and within the Harlequins camp there is qualified optimism that the fly-half will sign, but the last two weekends have revealed another New Zealander who does not look out of place manoeuvring the English champions around a rugby field.</p> <p>Ben Botica's kicking is also up to scratch, earning Harlequins 18 points in the first round against Biarritz before adding another 20 here on Saturday when he also showed he is quite prepared to run things his way, even if it means getting only qualified support from his boss.</p> <p>Nine months ago, Evans was pulling the strings when Harlequins last visited the west of Ireland and left arm-wrestled out of the Heineken Cup by the poor relations of Irish provincial rugby. Of course there were extenuating circumstances. Compared to the benign breeze of Saturday, Evans played with a storm raging in off the Atlantic and a gale coming up from the lough. But Botica clearly impressed O'Shea, even if he must have caused a few palpitations by playing 15-man rugby to the bitter end.</p> <p>\"It's one hell of a place to come,\" said O'Shea. \"They were massively up for the game and we are delighted. Ben Botica played excellently.\"</p> <p>O'Shea, a former Leinster and Ireland full-back, then displayed his local knowledge by explaining how difficult it is to play at Connacht's headquarters: \"Do you come here and have an easy ride? I've been coming here all my life and you don't.</p> <p>\"Ben Botica did well in a hostile environment. You learn a lot more away than at home and he was very composed. Maybe he could have kicked a bit more in the second half. Maybe. But the wind was strong and it was ideal that he kept the ball in hand.\"</p> <p>In fact, with the French referee, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garces, a stickler around the tackle area, turning against Connacht, Botica's decision to keep playing merely turned the screw. That and his second-half penalties, which finally took the game away from Connacht when at one time they were 10 points up and threatening to build a decent head of steam.</p> <p>It would be no surprise if the Ireland coach, Declan Kidney, dipped into the Connacht backline for the second-string autumn Test against Fiji in Limerick; centre Dave McSharry and full-back Robbie Henshaw are real possibilities.</p> <p>McSharry ran a delightful line and Dan Parks gave him an equally precise pass for the first try of the night, which left Harlequins wondering whether they were about to tread on another Connacht banana skin. Instead, Danny Care did what he does best and in doing so contributed two quick tries before half-time, righting the ship that had looked to have run into heavy waters.</p> <p>\"We were pretty slow getting into the game,\" conceded the Harlequins captain, Chris Robshaw. \"They came out guns blazing whereas we built our way into the game. But that last 10 minutes [before half-time, when Care scored] gave us a lot of confidence and let us regroup and come back.\"</p> <p>Which is what they did. As the crowd became increasing irritated by the referee, so the game slipped away from Connacht. After the 43 points and three tries of the first half, only three penalties were landed in the second as Harlequins imposed something of a headlock.</p> <p>\"If we had been able to hold on to the ball a lot more in the last 30 we might have got more. We had issues going through any number of phases,\" said O'Shea, who is clearly looking forward to pool rivals, Biarritz, coming to Connacht.</p> <p>\"I tell you what, at the end of the pool when Biarritz have to come here, it will be one hell of a place to come. It's like a completely different pitch, The Sportsground,\" said O'Shea.</p>",
  "<p>The chairman of the anti-racism campaign Kick It Out, Lord Ouseley, has defended the organisation and blamed the football authorities for a lack of leadership following a weekend that saw a number of players boycott the charity's awareness drive by refusing to wear shirts promoting its message.</p> <p>Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand and Reading's striker Jason Roberts are among a growing group of players who have become disenchanted with Kick It Out's efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination, despite 19 years of striving to eliminate them from the professional game. The pair's decision not to wear the organisation's branded shirt while warming up for their matches on Saturday came a year after the exchange between John Terry and Anton Ferdinand that led to the former England captain's four-match ban by the Football Association and \u00a3220,000 fine for using racist language.</p> <p>At Loftus Road on Sunday , before Queens Park Rangers' match with Everton, several players including Anton Ferdinand, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Nedum Onuoha, Sylvain Distin and Victor Anichebe also decided not to wear the T-shirts.</p> <p>Ouseley, however, has rebutted the perceived lack of action from Kick It Out, claiming that the group is relatively powerless by comparison with the FA and Premier League.</p> <p>\"We don't make the decisions, we don't run football. We are a small charity trying to help football come to terms with the reality of the 21st century,\" he said. \"We can shout from the rooftops and I can understand what the black players are saying: you are too involved in the game in the way you operate to be independent and say the things that have to be said.</p> <p>\"The power and decision-making is with the Football Association and the Premier League. We all would have liked the John Terry case to have been wrapped up within days last October, alas it's lasted a whole year and it has caused a lot of pain and grief.</p> <p>\" They know what has to be done. We've been knocking on their door for a long, long, long time so they know what their responsibilities are. The absence of their voices during all this has been noticeable.\"</p> <p>The FA has said it continues to give its \"unequivocal\" backing to Kick It Out but the governing body believes the decision of whether to support the charity remains an individual and club matter. A spokesman said: \"The FA are 100% supporters of Kick It Out, we are funding partners and we believe they have an extremely important role in helping the authorities to fight discrimination in all its forms. The FA have increased funding for the current year and are reviewing funding going forward.\"</p> <p>The FA chairman, David Bernstein, also released a statement last Friday saying it was doing its utmost to stamp out racism. \"Domestically the FA has ultimate responsibility for the leadership of the game at every level and I, personally, remain determined to lead English football in this fight,\" he said. \"John Terry has now been sanctioned and held accountable for his actions. I am pleased he has apologised and we must now draw a line under this matter. However, we too will learn from the case.\"</p> <p>The decision by players not to wear Kick It Out shirts comes after a turbulent year regarding racism in football. The Terry-Anton Ferdinand incident in October 2011 came days after an altercation between Liverpool's Luis Su\u00e1rez and Manchester United's Patrice Evra at Anfield, resulting in an eight-match ban and \u00a340,000 fine for the Uruguayan who was found guilty of racial abuse by the FA. Last Tuesday night the England Under-21 midfielder Danny Rose was subjected to monkey chants from a section of Serbia supporters in Krusevac.</p> <p>Ouseley did not criticise the players who opted against wearing the shirts but he believes their dissatisfaction should be directed elsewhere. He said: \"I can understand the irritation from the black players who feel they have grievances which have not been heard. They've turned their fire against Kick It Out as a sport campaign organisation that's out there on the front line trying to bring about change but has not been able to sufficiently bring about it to satisfy them.</p> <p>\"Those players have every right to express their grievances. I think their grievances are misdirected at not wearing a T-shirt because I think the grievances are much more substantial. I think it's with the game as a whole.\"</p> <p>A Premier League spokesman added on Sunday night: \"We are long-term supporters and funding partners of Kick It Out and respect both the quality of their work and their independence. They have played an integral part in the progress made to promote equality and tackle discrimination in the English game.</p> <p>\"In the Premier League huge efforts have been made to make football more inclusive. Fans from black and minority ethnic communities now make up 13% of our match attenders, a figure that has grown every year for the last five years.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/series/reading-the-riots\" title=\"\">riots</a> that gripped British cities in August 2011 were a graphic manifestation of the most disturbing global trend of our time: the growing gap between rich and poor, between the powerful and powerless, between those with unfettered dreams and hopes and those forced to focus on mere survival.</p> <p>Over the last 50 years the powerful have tightened their grip on \u2013 and their influence over \u2013 the political and economic levers of control. They have grown ever richer and more exploitative at tremendous cost to the powerless and the earthly environment we share.</p> <p>The powerless have been increasingly&#xa0;alienated from decision-making. They have been asked to accept&#xa0;relatively modest lifestyles for themselves while&#xa0;tolerating extreme and obscene consumption by their more&#xa0;fortunate brothers and sisters on the other side of&#xa0;the fence.</p> <p>The 2011 riots laid bare the truth that few human problems are more pressing than halting the slide of young people into absolute disaffection. Have we stopped to understand the factors that drove some young people to go out and riot and loot, while others of similar background \u2013 and facing similar predicaments \u2013 did not?</p> <p>Yes, boredom may have played a part, and the global descent into consumerism, and the economic recession. But these riots did not explicitly echo the common protest themes of human rights, equality and justice. And the violence and looting that took place did not seem to be perpetrated by any identifiable or organised group, with any particular goals besides personal enrichment and breaking societal rules.</p> <p>This situation is not unique to the UK; it is the global trend. At home, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica\" title=\"\">South Africa</a>, we are experiencing a spate of popular protests \u2013 termed \"service delivery protests\" \u2013 many of them characterised by violence, looting and the destruction of property. Eighteen years since the demise of apartheid, people rightly feel it is unfair for them to accept their marginalisation forever. Different countries, different contexts; similar causes and outcomes.</p> <p>We need to create space for people to speak to, and listen to, one another. We need to address the factors that divide us before the divisions overwhelm us and tip us into the abyss. Bridging the gaps of understanding between and within our communities will not come from throwing up our hands in dismay and saying it's so complicated and far-fetched that it must be impossible.</p> <p>No. If we abandon our hope that we can build a world in which all people feel&#xa0;dignified, in which all feel they have&#xa0;a role to play and that their contribution is valued, then we are abandoning our faith in humanity.</p> <p>For no matter where we come from or where we live, whether we drive the latest Mercedes or ride the rustiest old bicycle, the simple truth is that we need each other to ensure the survival of our species. We are members of one family, God's family, and we were made for goodness, not for greed. We were made to share, not to hoard. We were made to respect one another and our world.</p> <p>In Britain this week I will participate in an important conversation to examine the causes and effects of the 2011 riots, bringing together people of all&#xa0;ages and backgrounds to articulate their needs and those of their communities.</p> <p>The inter-generational character of the conversation \u2013 marrying the tremendous energy and power of young people to the knowledge and wisdom of adults \u2013 is fundamentally important.</p> <p>Conversation for Change is a key programme of the <a href=\"http://www.tutufoundationuk.org/\" title=\"\">Tutu Foundation UK</a>. We don't expect to turn things around overnight but recognise the importance of affording people a sense of hope \u2013 in themselves, in each other and in their communities.</p> <p>Those who are marginalised from power need constructive mechanisms to articulate their anger and concerns to those who have power and resources.</p> <p>All over the world, including in Britain and South Africa, people feel unable to participate fully in their communities. Indeed, many feel that outside of election periods, nobody really cares.</p> <p>This is not an incurable malaise. Fixing it requires caring and responsive governments to create environments in&#xa0;which unemployment can be reduced, education, healthcare and housing can be improved and cross-cultural understanding can take root.</p> <p>It requires citizens who are active participants in determining their personal and community destinies. It requires societies that understand that failing to act to narrow the disparities in the qualities and expectations of peoples' lives threatens our very existence.</p> <p><em> Conversation for Change takes place on 23&#xa0;October at Fairfield Halls, Croydon. www.tutufoundationuk.org</em></p>",
  "<p>Amazon is forcing British publishers to cover the cost of a 20% VAT charge on ebook sales \u2013 even though the true VAT cost to the online retailer is only a fraction of that amount under its generous Luxembourg-based tax regime.</p> <p>The firm is able to wield such power over publishers because it has a near monopoly of the UK digital book publishing market. According to reliable estimates, it sells nine out of 10 ebooks in the UK, while using its Luxembourg tax status to wring more profitable terms from publishers.</p> <p>Companies such as Amazon collect the VAT levy from consumers before passing it on to governments. In the case of Amazon's UK ebook sales, it only has to pass 3% to Luxembourg. If it was based in the UK it would have to hand over 20%.</p> <p>According to a contract seen by the Guardian, Amazon starts negotiations with its publishers on the basis that the UK VAT rate of 20% must be knocked off the cost price.</p> <p>However, its base in Luxembourg allows it to benefit from a European tax anomaly and pay only 3% VAT on digital books sold to UK readers. Subsequently, Amazon charges the difference between the UK VAT levy imposed on publishers and the actual 3% that it pays, which amounts to an extra \u00a31.38 of profit every time it sells a \u00a310 ebook in this country.</p> <p>It then negotiates further substantial discounts on top of the VAT subsidy, which in some cases can result in publishers receiving less than 10% of the price paid by the online customer.</p> <p>Publishers that do n0t fall into line can be dealt with summarily. \"These are not pleasant people to do business with,\" one senior publishing executive said. \"They have no compunction in shutting down the buy button on their site on our titles if we step out of line,\" a practice that can be carried out in seconds. The publisher asked not to be named for fear of permanent damage to their commercial relationship with Amazon.</p> <p>According to another unnamed publisher who negotiated an ebook deal for a well-known figure, Amazon sought a deal that would have resulted in a 92% discount. The publisher refused the terms, which would have seen them receive just 80p on an ebook selling for \u00a310 on Amazon's UK website.</p> <p>The contract seen by the Guardian is couched in legal language that confirms Amazon's considerable commercial power. The section that spells out the fact that Amazon's starting price for discount negotiations is exclusive of 20% VAT says: \"Base price is the digital list price exclusive of the standard statutory rate applicable to ebooks in the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>This means a publisher signing up with Amazon would have to agree to a starting price of \u00a38.33 for an ebook retailing at \u00a310 \u2013 the digital list price \u2013 to reflect the 20% VAT any UK-based ebook retailer would have to pay.</p> <p>But if it were based on the true 3% rate paid by Amazon, that starting price should be \u00a39.71 \u2013 meaning the publisher is already giving the online retailer a \u00a31.38 discount even before it agrees to a wholesale discount that can run as high as 90%. Typically, however, Amazon seeks a discount of up to 65% on ebooks including the phantom VAT charge.</p> <p>The contract also bars the publisher from offering a better deal to a rival retailer without automatically giving the same discount to Amazon.

  "<p>Your analysis of the large-scale tax avoidance undertaken by some operating in Britain (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/uk-tax-rules-profit-global-firm?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">UK urged to curb global firms' profit moves</a>, 17 October) was a helpful reminder that we are not all \"in it together\". However, the pain felt by the loss of this revenue to the UK exchequer is dwarfed by the global scale of tax dodging. Christian Aid estimates that around $160bn (\u00a3100bn) is lost to developing countries every year through the same sort of processes. This is money that could be spent on education, healthcare and sanitation systems. It could support jobs, infrastructure and wealth creation to take millions out of poverty, and in the longer term out of aid dependence.

On one hand we are asking small and medium-sized enterprises to play a pivotal role in getting the UK out of this recession; yet HMRC launches new taskforces into many a local business, while Starbucks, a company that prides itself on its ethical standards and yet sidelines the UK tax system while raking in huge profits, it seems, walks free. <br><strong>Adam Harper</strong><br><em>Director of professional development, Association of Accounting Technicians</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Given the brouhaha concerning mainly but not exclusively American companies avoiding corporation tax, is it not time to consider replacing this with a turnover tax?

There would be no allowances to offset, with the exception, perhaps, of capital investment in the UK infrastructure.<br><strong>Colin Brett</strong><br><em>Buxton, Derbyshire </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Would it be possible to impose a tax on each cup of coffee sold in a coffee house but allow companies to set off this charge against corporation tax?

  "<p><strong> </strong>As timely European victories go, this was one of Leicester's more satisfying. A week ago, as they limped home defeated from Toulouse, there was genuine reason to wonder if their Heineken Cup season was about to crash and burn prematurely. By the final whistle on Sunday, with a try-bonus point safely bagged, the Tigers looked anything but the spent force some had been calling them.</p> <p>It was a reassuring day, too, for the England management as they finalise their plans for the autumn internationals. Dan Cole's place as his country's leading tighthead is not in question but Ben Youngs and Toby Flood both delivered sharply-improved displays at the perfect moment. If Flood's haul of 25 points, including a monster 57-metre penalty and a vital interception try, was the most eye-catching, the swift resurrection of Youngs following a grim experience in Toulouse was equally significant.</p> <p>This was only the scrum-half's third game since returning from injury and the snap and crackle is back. He looked consistently sharp at the base of the scrum, escaped for one scorching 50-metre break and was on hand to seize Steve Mafi's pass late on to complete a try which paved the way for Manu Tuilagi to score his second, and the all-important fourth, with 46 seconds remaining. Given Youngs's travails in France, every metre gained must have felt like a glorious step out of darkness into light.</p> <p>Among other things this result also sets up Pool Two nicely, Toulouse having failed to pick up a bonus point in Treviso. By the time the French champions reach the East Midlands in January the Tigers could, on this evidence, be purring again, having already extended their unbeaten home record to 20 Heineken Cup games. \"I'm glad we've stuck it up some people who were happy to criticise us,\" was the blunt reaction of Richard Cockerill, Leicester's director of rugby. \"We've had a lot poked at us this week and we've questioned what we do but that last 10 minutes showed the spirit the boys have got.\"</p> <p>It was all the more praiseworthy given the Ospreys led 10-0 after 13 minutes, not usually the ideal foundation for a stirring home triumph. The visitors, vaguely reminiscent of Don Revie's Leeds in a predominantly white strip with yellowy-green socks, started splendidly, handling with confidence and scoring a perfectly-executed second-minute try finished by Ryan Jones.</p> <p>A conversion and subsequent penalty from the accurate Dan Biggar extended the lead before the entire tenor of the match changed. Leicester finally started to escape the clutches of the eager Justin Tipuric on the floor and Cole began to give poor Ryan Bevington a serious roasting in the scrums. The Ospreys loosehead was sin-binned eventually for repeatedly hitting the deck and the Tigers duly seized the chance to turn the screw still further. \"I don't think there's a player in England more important than him at the moment,\" stressed Cockerill, confirming the 25-year-old is now the undisputed first choice ahead of Martin Castrogiovanni.</p> <p>The Ospreys, in the end, were kept afloat by the efforts of Tipuric, Alun Wyn Jones and Ryan Jones, alongside the competitiveness of their scrum-half Kahn Fotuali'i. Had they achieved anything like set-piece parity it might have been a closer finish but from 19-19 with 18 minutes left everything went pear-shaped. The Welford Road pitch is not the biggest, as the 2015 World Cup organisers have just reminded everyone, but Flood has hit few sweeter than his 67th-minute effort which cleared the bar by several metres.</p> <p>He later modestly suggested the ball was one of a good batch, while there was also a breeze at his back which came in useful again when, four minutes later, he picked off an attempted pass by Biggar and sprinted 55 metres to score, celebrating with a flying dive borrowed from his England team-mates Chris Ashton and Danny Care. Here, too, was evidence of a fitter, happier player enjoying his rugby once more. \"If I could pin my ears back I would,\" he joked, when asked to explain his impressive turn of speed.</p> <p>The home crowd loved it, although there remained several rows of empty seats in the Caterpillar Stand. Either sofas in Leicestershire are comfier then they used to be or blanket TV coverage on Heineken Cup weekends is eroding the allure of actually attending the big game. If it is an issue at the best-supported club in England it is a collective problem but Peter Wheeler, Leicester's chairman, has made clear the leading clubs are still wedded to a breakaway from the existing European competition in 2014 and their \u00a3152m deal with BT Vision. \"I've never known the chairmen and owners of the English clubs more solidly behind a course of action that everybody believes is necessary to make the European competitions merit-based and equitable to all the participating teams,\" stressed Wheeler.</p> <p><strong>Leicester</strong> Hamilton; Morris, Tuilagi, Allen, Goneva (Smith, 65); Flood, B Youngs; Mulipola (Ayerza, 50), T Youngs, Cole (Castrogiovanni, 54), Kitchener (Deacon, 54), Parling, Mafi, Waldrom, Crane (capt).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Tuilagi 2, Flood, Youngs. <strong>Cons</strong> Flood 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Flood 5.</p> <p><strong>Ospreys</strong> Fussell; Dirksen, Bishop, Beck, Walker; Biggar, Fotuali'i (Webb, 70); Bevington (D Jones, 49), Hibbard, A Jones (Jarvis, 48), A W Jones, Evans, R Jones, Tipuric, Thomas (Bearman, 54).</p> <p><strong>Try</strong> R Jones. <strong>Con</strong> Biggar. <strong>Pens</strong> Biggar 5. <strong>Sin-bin</strong> Bevington 35.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> R Poite (France). <strong>Attendance</strong> 20,224.</p>",
  "<p>Away from the Middle East, Barack Obama's foreign policy has been largely about turning to Asia, sending mixed signals to Latin America, ignoring sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 and hoping that Europe and its implacable crisis go away.</p> <p>Arguably the single most important strategic decision of his first term was the \"pivot\" to Asia \u2013 the promise this year to deploy 60% of naval assets to the Asia-Pacific region by 2020. Chinese analysts say this is the principal reason why bilateral relations are now at their lowest point since Obama became president.</p> <p>Otherwise, the Obama administration has taken care not to upset the Chinese unduly. Obama himself waited more than two years before privately meeting the Dalai Lama; the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made it clear early on that disagreements over human rights should not interfere with co-operation on broader issues between the world's two foremost economic powers.</p> <p>The other rising power of the east, India, usually enjoys better relations with the US when a Republican president is in office. But Obama, who visited India in November 2010, charmed his hosts with flattering references to their country's heritage and booming economy, a stab at speaking Hindi in parliament and a promise of support for a permanent seat on the United Nations security council, a long-cherished ambition that is extremely unlikely to be fulfilled any time soon. If the style was there \u2014 Indians were delighted by the youthful charisma of the president and his wife compared with the stuffy and status-obsessed local politicians \u2014 the substance has been less evident, however. Major defence deals have gone elsewhere, the Indians are deeply concerned by the US rush to exit Afghanistan \u2013 which they fear could benefit hostile neighbour Pakistan \u2013 and nothing as significant as the 2008 US-India nuclear deal that his predecessor pushed through has even been spoken of.</p> <p>On Africa, Obama \u2013 the son of a Kenyan \u2013 has spent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/12/barack-obama\" title=\"\">less than 24 hours in sub-Saharan Africa</a> as president \u2013 and failed to produce a signature policy initiative, leaving many with a sense of anti-climax. \"The president's Kenyan heritage inspired unreasonably high hopes for a robust Africa policy, but his administration has failed to meet even the lowest of expectations,\" <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138158/todd-moss/missing-in-africa?page=show\" title=\"\">wrote Todd Moss recently</a> in Foreign Affairs.</p> <p>\"Even Obama's most vocal supporters quietly admit that he has done much less with Africa than previous presidents have.\"</p> <p>But Clinton has made four trips and notched up 15 African countries. Most recently she was accompanied by executives from some of America's leading companies including Boeing, Walmart and FedEx. This underlines an evolving philosophy of seeing Africa more as investment destination than aid-hungry victim. Militarily, America's backing of African Union peacekeepers in Somalia has been a quiet triumph but al-Qaida's tentacles now stretch to countries such as Mali. Despite the disappointments, Obama still commands popular support \u2013 Conakry, the capital of Guinea, has more than one \"Obama\" cafe and restaurant.</p> <p>Obama has tweaked rather than transformed US policy towards Latin America, despite the increased influence and integration of a region that is growing economically and becoming more dependent on China. Aside from a slight relaxation of the embargo on Cuba in 2009, the White House has largely continued the approach of previous administrations by putting a priority on the (losing) battle against narcotics trafficking. Promises to put more emphasis on reducing US demand as well as Latin American supply have failed to produce results: drug use and murder rates are both rising.</p> <p>Mixed signals on other matters have not helped to impress other nations in the region. The US initially condemned the 2009 coup in Honduras against the leftwing leader Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya but has subsequently supported the administration of Porfirio Lobo. Obama also signed a free trade agreement with Colombia despite opposing such a measure when it was initiated under the previous administration.</p> <p>The rhetorical pitch has, however, softened compared with the era of George W Bush. The Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has said he would choose Obama if he could vote in the forthcoming election, which is likely to be a mixed blessing.</p> <p>On Russia, an early move to \"reset\" relations and make progress on nuclear arms reduction has been more than outweighed by a new deterioration in relations, sparked by Vladimir Putin's crackdown on the opposition, and diametrically opposed world views on Syria.</p> <p>This leaves Europe and the spiralling debt and currency crisis. The Obama administration has been exasperated by Europe's response to the crisis and has consistently urged policymakers to take dramatic, once-and-for-all action to signal that the eurozone is safe. Obama knows that a Grexit (Greece leaving the eurozone) or an unravelling of the currency would decimate global growth and hammer the US economy \u2013 and hurt his re-election bid. But the American view of economic crisis management has been totally at odds with that of the Germans, who are minded to respond: where did the global financial crisis start anyway?</p>",
  "<p>The Roman emperor Augustus is supposed to have come up with the phrase <em>festina lente</em>, which in English means make haste slowly. It is an apt summing up for what has been happening to the global economy these past four years: policymakers have certainly been hyperactive but progress has been painfully slow. Organisations from the Bank of England to the International Monetary Fund, and from the Office for Budget Responsibility to the Federal Reserve, accept they have been far too optimistic in their forecasts.</p> <p>It has been less make haste slowly, more getting nowhere fast.</p> <p>The weakening in activity this year has set off warning bells. The IMF says the risk of a serious global slowdown is \"alarmingly high\" and believes it may have been underestimating the multipliers used to calculate the impact of fiscal policy.</p> <p>Changes to tax and spending affect the economy. If a pound of extra spending delivers a pound of extra growth, that means the multiplier is 1; if it delivers 50p of extra growth then the multiplier is 0.5. The same ratios apply in reverse when governments are imposing austerity programmes.</p> <p>The IMF has been using a multiplier of 0.5, but its latest estimate is between 0.9 and 1.7. The implication is that raising taxes and cutting spending causes a much bigger loss of output than previously thought, helping to explain why growth has been so weak.</p> <p>There are a few reasons to be cautious about the IMF's rethink. First, it might be an attempt to rewrite the past after inaccurate forecasts. Second, calculating the multiplier is a notoriously difficult business and there are many reputable economists who have made much lower estimates. Third, there are those, including George Osborne, who think the higher estimates fail fully to take into account the unprecedented loosening of monetary policy - cuts in interest rates and dollops of electronic money creation - that was designed to offset the fiscal tightening.</p> <p>Even so, the IMF study deserves to be taken seriously. Why? Because the multiplier effect could well be stronger when many countries are imposing austerity programmes simultaneously, and if interest rates are already extremely low there may be a limit to what a further easing of monetary policy can do to stimulate activity.</p> <p>Central banks have sought to help through bond-buying, which drives down long-term interest rates and sends cash to the banking system. But some say that these asset purchases, or quantitative easing (QE), are subject to the law of diminishing returns.</p> <p>Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the IMF is right and the multipliers are bigger than was thought. What thenis to be done? The obvious answer would be to relax fiscal policy, because if the multiplier is in the middle of the IMF's range, \u00a31 of tax cuts or increased public spending would deliver \u00a31.30 of growth.</p> <p>Today's policymakers should, in other words, take a leaf out of Franklin Roosevelt's book and embark on a New Deal style programme of public works.</p> <p>This certainly has its attractions for Britain, where the infrastructure is so poor and the cost of borrowing so cheap.</p> <p>But the economic historian Nick Crafts warned this week against drawing parallels with the 1930s, mainly because US public finances were much healthier than the UK's are now. America's annual budget deficit \u2013 the gap between taxes and spending \u2013 averaged less than 3% of gross domestic product in the 1930s, compared with a figure that could be as high as 8% in Britain this year. The ratio of US national debt to GDP was below 40% at the end of the 1930s, while Britain's is on course to peak at well over double that level.</p> <p>That's not to say that a different approach to fiscal policy would be impossible \u2013 but there is a balance of risks. Tightening or tightening too fast could send the economy on a downward spiral of cuts and weak growth and further cuts.. That's particularly the case when the private and public sectors try to cut their high debt levels simultaneously, as in the UK today. The chancellor is concerned that market interest rates would rise if he appeared to be abandoning deficit reduction. Other risks would be a run on the pound and the possibility that individuals and companies would save more in anticipation of today's fiscal easing resulting in higher taxes or higher inflation tomorrow.</p> <p>These concerns are reflected in the government's stance. Instead of announcing a mass public housing programme to make up the country's shortfall of 3 million homes, Osborne is proposing changes to the planning laws in an attempt to prompt the private sector to take advantage of current low interest rates. Similarly, he prefers to use the state's balance sheet to guarantee private sector infrastructure projects rather than spend the money himself.</p> <p>That approach will take time to work \u2013 if it works at all. As a result, we have to assume that monetary policy will continue to take most of the strain here, as it will in the US and the eurozone.</p> <p>At the very least, the bank rate will stay at 0.5% for the foreseeable future and there will be no reining in of QE. If the expectation of an announcement this week that the economy grew in the third quarter proves another false dawn, the chancellor will be forced to look again at a fiscal stance that iin the next two years is set to take more demand out of the economy than in 2012-13.</p> <p>And what if the economy remains permanently depressed and deflation starts to look a more likely threat than inflation? In those circumstances, as Lord Turner - the chairman of the Financial Services Authority and a candidate to be the next governor of the Bank of England - says, policy might need to get even more unconventional.</p> <p>This is code for so-called \"helicopter drops\" of money, in which the Treasury would effectively write cheques to the public. If every adult received \u00a3500, that would add \u00a320bn of spending power to the economy, and the Bank of England could ensure that the handouts did not add to public borrowing by printing \u00a320bn in new money.</p> <p>But if there is a risk that the markets would freak out at Osborne investing more in long-term infrastructure projects that would help improve the efficiency and productivity of the economy, isn't there also a risk that they would see this as Britain heading down the road to the Weimar Republic? Of course there is. That's why it would be a last resort.</p>",

  "<p>This weekend, David Cameron is a man at bay, beset by critics who claim that the dramatic resignation of his<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-police-pleb\" title=\"\"> chief whip</a> strengthens the impression of a gulf between the privileged background and elitist sentiments of the prime minister's entourage and the vast majority of ordinary Britons.

But the urgency is really the culmination, not of months or even years, but decades of inaction in a country that has taken energy supply for granted due to the geological fortune of North Sea oil and gas.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher was talking about the threat of climate change in 1988 although she did nothing much about it while rushing for hydrocarbons largely as a tool to shut down mines and neutralise powerful trade unions. Meanwhile, the seabed fortune was squandered by a succession of governments. Where is the trillion-pound sovereign wealth fund that could be invested in green technologies or even just provide cash for future generations?</p> <p>Worse than this, no one prepared for the inevitable rundown in North Sea oil and gas, leaving the UK increasingly dependent on high-cost imports. This decline in local supplies has come at a time when the coalition increasingly sees gas as the energy source of the future because it can heat homes and be burned in power stations.</p> <p>Coal, nuclear and gas have traditionally been the fuels of choice for the wholesale power companies but tough new environmental regulations and old age are leading to a fast phase-out of the first two. Meanwhile, efforts to usher in a new era of lower-carbon electricity generation from renewables such as wind and solar plus new nuclear plants have been characterised by ministerial dithering, mixing prejudice with practical concerns.</p> <p>The development of onshore wind has been set back by planning objections while offshore farms have been dogged by rows over the high level of subsidies. Progress has been made with new projects and an enormous amount of work is going on to reduce costs of wind-generated power but even so the renewable sector was always going to produce \u2013 at most \u2013 just 30% of all electricity by 2020. Nuclear, which once provided nearly a quarter of our electricity and now is down to little more than 10%, remains stuck in a financial rut of its own.</p> <p>Many of the foreign power companies that originally championed new UK atomic plants, such as RWE and E.ON of Germany, have decided to leave the market, while EDF, the main cheerleader, has found its enthusiasm dented by a new and less sympathetic government on its home patch, France. EDF is now badgering for the highest possible financial incentives before agreeing to go ahead with its first planned station at Hinkley Point.</p> <p>It may yet get what it wants, but the chances of the once-vaunted nuclear renaissance in Britain seems pretty much dead for an international industry undermined by the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster and huge cost overruns at other new nuclear projects.</p> <p>We will learn on Tuesday about the prospects for UK atomic new-build when the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/ecc\" title=\"\">Energy and Climate Change Committee</a> meets. Similarly, we will hear on 5 November the government's wider vision of how it will keep the lights burning through the final version of the energy bill and, in particular, its details on electrical market reform. This document is meant to show how Britain can provide itself with power, encourage even more lower-carbon generation and keep energy bills down at a time when fuel poverty is growing.</p> <p>How this will be achieved is a mystery as we have seen contradictory messages from a Conservative-dominated and renewable-sceptical Treasury versus a Lib Dem-influenced and low-carbon-facing Department of Energy and Climate Change. For good measure, the commercial community is also divided. A minority of manufacturing leaders believe Britain must embrace a new low-carbon future while a short-termist majority fear only that low-carbon initiatives could drive up costs.</p> <p>And while this struggle to come up with a meaningful and final energy bill goes on, power companies have continued to infuriate consumers and politicians with a succession of domestic price increases. The energy suppliers say they are covering rises in international gas costs and need cash to invest in lower-carbon options. However, like the bank industry before them, their credibility is shot. This is the sector that has been fined for mis-selling products, introduced hugely complicated tariff structures and has shown an ability to raise retail prices quickly in poor times for the market while demonstrating a remarkable laxity in lowering them when markets improve. Their spokesperson as chief executive of Energy UK is Angela Knight, until recently the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association.</p> <p>Not that long experience in the energy sector counts for much. Alistair Buchanan, the boss of regulator Ofgem, has been given the runaround by the power companies and has failed to curb their excesses until too late. On Friday, he unveiled plans to force suppliers to tell householders about their cheapest deals but this was a good deal softer than Cameron's initiative at parliamentary questions, which we are assured has been \"misunderstood\".</p> <p>The real misunderstandings have come from governments (not just this one) failing to grasp the need for an energy policy that looks ahead 30 years and does not leave it all to a market driven by short-term considerations. We need energy ministers who stay in post for more than a dozen months. We need to build low-carbon technology champions. We need an Olympian vision, not a Cameron cock-up.</p>"
