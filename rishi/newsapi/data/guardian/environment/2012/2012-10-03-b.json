  "<p>International land investors and biofuel producers have taken over land around the world that could feed nearly 1 billion people.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/grow/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-10-04/land-sold-last-decade-could-grow-enough-food-feed-billion-people\">Analysis by Oxfam</a> of several thousand land deals completed in the last decade shows that an area eight times the size of the UK has been left idle by speculators or is being used largely to grow biofuels for US or European vehicles.</p> <p>In a report, published on Thursday, Oxfam says the global land rush is out of control and urges the World Bank to freeze its investments in large-scale land acquisitions to send a strong signal to global investors to stop \"land grabs\".</p> <p>\"More than 60% of investments in agricultural land by foreign investors between 2000 and 2010 were in developing countries with serious hunger problems. But two-thirds of those investors plan to export everything they produce on the land. Nearly 60% of the deals have been to grow crops that can be used for biofuels,\" says the report.</p> <p>Very few, if any, of these land investments benefit local people or help to fight hunger, says Oxfam. \"Instead, the land is either being left idle, as speculators wait for its value to increase \u2026 or it is predominantly used to grow crops for export, often for use as biofuels.\"</p> <p>The bank has tripled its support for land projects to $6bn-$8bn (\u00a33.7bn-\u00a35bn) a year in the last decade, but no data is available on how much goes to acquisitions, or any links between its lending and conflict.</p> <p>Since 2008, says Oxfam, 21 formal complaints have been brought by communities affected by World Bank investments, in which they claim that these have violated their land rights.</p> <p>Oxfam's chief executive, Barbara Stocking, said: \"The rush for land is out of control and some of the world's poorest people are suffering hunger, violence and greater poverty as a result. The World Bank is in a unique position to help stop land grabs becoming one of the biggest scandals of the century.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Investment should be good news for developing countries \u2013 not lead to greater poverty, hunger and hardship.\"</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://landportal.info/landmatrix\" title=\"\">International Land Coalition</a>, 106m hectares (261m acres) of land in developing countries were acquired by foreign investors between 2000 and 2010, sometimes with disastrous results.</p> <p>Nearly 30% of Liberia has been handed out in large-scale concessions in the past five years, and up to 63% of all arable land in Cambodia has been passed over to private companies.</p> <p>Oxfam dismisses the claim made by the World Bank and others that lots of available land is unused and waiting for development. \"It is simply a myth. Most agricultural land deals target quality farmland, particularly land that is irrigated and offers good access to markets.</p> <p>\"It is clear that much of this land was already being used for small-scale farming, pastoralism and other types of natural resource use.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/B56001EB4A0DCE24852577D6005B5CB8?opendocument\" title=\"\">2010 study by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)</a> \u2013 the World Bank's official monitoring and evaluation body \u2013 stated that about 30% of bank projects involved involuntary resettlement. The IEG estimated that at any one time, more than 1 million people are affected by involuntary resettlement in active World Bank-financed projects.</p> <p>Oxfam urged the UK government, one of the bank's largest shareholders, to use its influence to persuade it to implement the freeze. \"It can also play a crucial role as president of the G8 next year by putting food and hunger at the heart of the agenda, and addressing land grabs as part of this. Critically, it can also press the EU to reverse biofuels targets \u2013 a key driver of land grabs.\"</p> <p>Stocking said: \"The UK should also show leadership in reversing flawed biofuels targets, which are a main driver for land and are diverting food into fuel.\"</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private lending arm, said: \"IFC does not finance land acquisitions for speculative purposes. We invest in productive agricultural and forestry enterprises that can be land intensive to help provide the food and fibre the world needs. IFC has roughly a $4.85bn portfolio of agri-related investments. Of that, roughly $600m has a land component. Total land holding related to those investments total 0.7m hectares.</p> <p>\"Competition for scarce land resources has spurred rising investment in land. This competition can fuel conflict with existing users. Inevitably, bank group involvement in forestry and agriculture is not without risk, particularly given the fact we are operating in imperfect governance environments. But the total number of complaints received gives no explanation as to their validity.\"</p>",
  "<p>Presidential campaigns aren't where you look for honest, serious discussion of economic policy. Usually, the candidates confine themselves to slogans; sometimes, as with George W Bush, we also get a moron. But in this election, something very different is going on. For the first time, we are explicitly seeing the effects of America's new political duopoly.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney are very intelligent men. And yet, both of them are completely avoiding, or being dishonest about, huge economic issues \u2013 even when their opponent is highly vulnerable to attack. Thus, we have the bizarre spectacle of a Republican ex-private equity banker attacking the Democrat on unemployment, while the Democrat argues gamely that if we just give him more time, everything will be fine \u2013 which we all know is not true. Both men say vaguely that they will \"reform Washington\", when neither means it.</p> <p>Neither of them says a serious word about the causes of the financial crisis; the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/01/how-the-government-failed-to-fix-wall-street.html\">lack of prosecution </a>of banks and bankers; <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/essay-the-growing-income-gap-in-the-u-s-harms-the-economy-20120927?page=1\">sharply rising inequality</a> in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/why-education-inequality-persists--and-how-to-fix-it/2012/05/15/gIQAXEIeSU_blog.html\">educational opportunity</a>, income and wealth; energy policy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/us-presidential-debates-global-warming\">global warming</a>; America's <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/07/21/americans-suffer-from-third-rate-broadband-at-high-prices/\">competitive lag</a> in broadband infrastructure; the impact of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1917726,00.html\">industrialized food</a> on healthcare costs; the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/28/bush-leaving-next-preside_n_115335.html\">last decade's</a> budget deficits and the resultant national debt; or the large-scale, <a href=\"http://www.converge.org.nz/pirm/nutech.htm\">permanent elimination</a> of millions of less-skilled jobs through both globalization and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.</p> <p>In a time of <a href=\"http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/alpha-consumer/2012/09/14/americans-continue-to-struggle-post-recession\">pervasive economic insecurity</a>, with declining incomes and high unemployment, four years after a horrific financial crisis, how can all of these questions be successfully ignored by both candidates?</p> <p>As it turns out, their behavior is entirely rational, though for disconcerting reasons. The answer lies in the combined effect of three related forces: America's deepening economic problems; the role now played by money in politics; and the emotions of a scared, increasingly cynical, economically insecure electorate.</p> <p>Since the late 1970s, US politics has been increasingly shaped by the pressures generated by globalization, rising inequality and America's declining competitiveness. As average Americans felt increasing pressures and endured stagnant real wages, they initially responded by working longer hours and going into debt (personal, household debt). But then came politics.</p> <p>Beginning with the Reagan-Carter contest in 1980, Republicans <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-conn/whats-the-big-idea_1_b_1927492.html\">started</a> to abandon traditional financial prudence in favor of an increasingly demagogic strategy of blaming government regulation, waste and welfare payments in order to justify tax cuts. Demonization of regulation served the additional purpose of justifying the deregulation of industries such as financial services and energy. Since the Republicans' tax cuts were never accompanied by spending cuts, they not only reduced voters' tax bills, but also stimulated the economy generally.</p> <p>It was unsustainable, of course, but when the Democrats tried counter-arguments based on fiscal prudence and government services, they generally got slaughtered \u2013 as did <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/09/10/how-does-the-current-republican-ticket-compare-to-reaganbush/\"> Carter in 1980</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/107286/romneys-tax-silence\">Mondale in 1984</a>.</p> <p>It worked again for George W Bush, although, of course, he lost the popular vote in 2000 and only became president thanks to an <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/12/election_hangover.html\">infamous</a> supreme court decision. But it really did work in 2004, when he trounced Kerry despite the increasingly obvious disasters of the Iraqi occupation.</p> <p>And so, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/the_rumble/2012/09/clintonomics-and-obamanomics-closer-than-you-think\">starting with</a> Clinton's reduction of capital gains taxes and financial deregulation, the Democrats started making deals with the devil. Clinton, to his credit, still tried to do some progressive things where he could, and the internet revolution allowed him to balance his budget. But the Democrats have, by now, been profoundly reshaped by the oceans of money that dominate US politics.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama could afford to run as the reformer, and perhaps even needed to. But not so in 2012: Obama's economic positions \u2013 not just his actions, but even his public statements and promises \u2013 are the result of triangulating reality, public opinion and money. Obama still needs to get <em>some</em> votes from his base, so he must call for some burden-sharing by the rich. But he cannot be honest about the depth, or the sources, of America's structural economic problems, for two reasons.</p> <p>First, he would be telling much of his blue-collar, minority, unionized and/or less-educated voter base that their skills are obsolete and they are economically doomed. Even in 2008, he might not have been able to get away with that; he certainly can't get away with it now. But second, Obama cannot be honest about the economic damage caused by a criminalized, out-of-control financial sector, nor about other major industries contributing to America's economic problems (energy, telecommunications, industrialized food, pharmaceuticals) \u2013 because he needs their money.</p> <p>As a result, Obama seemingly makes himself unusually vulnerable on the economy. But he can afford to, because Romney cannot take full advantage of Obama's vulnerabilities. Romney, you see, depends <em>even more heavily</em> on the money and support of the financial sector, the wealthy, business and of anti-union, anti-immigrant forces. Romney's only appeal to average Americans is through \"values\" conservatism (religion, opposition to gay marriage, abortion, drugs, immigration, etc), vague complaints about government bureaucracy and, yet again, tax cuts.</p> <p>And so Obama can avoid all the hard issues and yet retain the grudging support of his base simply by proposing modest tax increases on the wealthy, and by supporting the safety net (unemployment benefits, Medicare, social security) that Romney might cut.</p> <p>Voila: an election in which there are a dozen elephants in the room, and neither candidate pays them any notice at all; an election that Obama can win because he's somewhat less bad, somewhat less utterly bankrupt, than the other guy. </p> <p>Welcome to America's new and improved two-party system.</p>",

But the dramatic collapse of Arctic sea ice this year presages disaster much sooner. It demonstrates the alarming progression of a vicious cycle: as the sea ice melts away, it is replaced by open water, absorbing sunshine and warming the sea such as to speed the melt. This vicious cycle became apparent in the 90s, when observations of the sea ice extent started deviating from linear projections. Annual sea ice minimum volume is showing a clear trend towards zero in September 2015 \u2013 an ice-free ocean.</p> <p>Scientists warn that this year's weather extremes, and mounting food prices, are due to Arctic warming and therefore liable to worsen progressively in future years as the sea ice disappears. <a href=\"http://www.ameg.me/\" title=\"\">Ameg</a>, the independent policy group that I chair, argues that the only way to avoid such a crisis is to cool the Arctic.

Thus Dorling calls for \"low growth\", but a rate of just 1% would produce a doubling of a given quantity in a mere 70 years. Toynbee even talks of the \"sunny uplands of 3% growth\". The doubling time would be correspondingly shorter (just over 23 years). Such \"growthism\" is no longer sustainable.

This, surely, is to \"focus on Venezuela's needs\".</p> <p>In stark contrast, Henrique Capriles' programme of privatisation, austerity and neoliberalism would return the country to the poverty and stagnation of the \"lost decades\" of the 1980s and 1990s. Watts and Lopez quote Capriles as describing himself as a political centrist \"who looks to the left\", but this is mere rhetoric coming from a man who belongs to one of the wealthiest families in Venezuela and whose political record includes alleged support for the 2002 anti-Ch\u00e1vez coup.</p> <p>Your reporters say \"polls suggest that&#xa0;the race may be tight\", but most polls (including the usually reliable <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.datanalisis.com/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Ddatanalisis%2Bvenezuela%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D841%26bih%3D843%26prmd%3Dimvnsu&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KGVsUJHVBsi-0QXO54C4Dg&amp;ved=0CCQQ7gEwAA\" title=\"\">Datanalysis</a> and <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.hinterlaces.com/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhinterlaces%2Bvenezuela%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D841%26bih%3D843%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UGVsUOXrEcrA0QXAiIGYDQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ7gEwAA\" title=\"\">Hinterlaces</a>) give Ch\u00e1vez a lead of 10 to 15%.

  "<p>At about quarter to one on Tuesday, some people appeared in the Manchester conference centre holding signs that said \"end of queue\". It was a bit optimistic, I thought. Why would anybody queue for an hour to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-speech-labour-conference-video?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's speech</a>? There was a video link anyway, or you could watch it on your phone. But once again, I had underestimated the obedience of the delegates. When they call them the party faithful, they don't mean in the sense that they won't get into bed with any other party; they mean as faithful as a dog. Tell them to queue, master, and they will. They won't ask why, any more than they'd ask what the big deal is about sitting.</p> <p>Conferences are like Christmas, there's never any anger until everyone gets safely away from each other. The starkest thing you could say about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg's speech</a> was that the audience only fell into a rapture twice. This leader has turned his foot soldiers from doorstep darlings (in a \"we might not vote for you, but you lot are all right\" sort of way) to the living embodiment of political disillusion. People who have built their social identity round this underdog party have seen its reputation for benignly doing nothing trashed by a young man in a hurry. You'd think they'd be slightly irked; you'd think it might show. It didn't.</p> <p>Labour was the same story \u2013 even the rage toward the coalition felt vaudeville and uncommitted. There was no interrogation of how the party itself is progressing, neither in the halls nor in the corridors nor particularly in the fringes; there never is. Well, there is no point making trouble for yourself in opposition, you might think (though I bet you next week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">Tory conference</a> is exactly the same). And these are, after all, the diehard political fans. It is possible that they are slightly starstruck, having previously only seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/oct/03/andy-burnham-nhs-reforms-fragmentation\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham's eyelashes</a> on the television.</p> <p>But I no longer believe this to be the adulation of the unquestioning hardcore. Rather, the whole point of a party conference \u2013 not as a meeting of minds, but as a performance to the rest of the nation \u2013 is so well-established that for party members to voice discontent under the glare of the cameras would be as taboo as if the extras stood up in the middle of a film and said they were bored, or they needed the toilet.</p> <p>It is frequently cited as the mark of a deft politician, that he or she can keep the room happy, while saying the things that the nation at large wants to hear but&#xa0;the room doesn't.</p> <p>This was what Ed Balls did, when he made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-labour-conference-live-blog\" title=\"\">an agile allusion to the fact that he didn't intend to reverse this government's spending cuts</a> (I have reached the point in my life where I don't expect any government to reverse anything done by the one before, however much they kvetched at the time. They absolutely hate to repeal. I neither like it nor understand it, I simply know that it's a law of the universe).</p> <p>Nevertheless, there must have been some people in the hall who were pretty disappointed to hear this, but you'd have seen them in hell (rather than the red-bathed hell-alike the Labour hall often resembles) before they'd have let fly a boo, or even a hiss. This isn't because the shadow chancellor is deft. It's because the conventions of this convention are so well understood \u2013 the crowd's role is as meat in the room, but it has to be happy meat.</p> <p>Since TV is the medium of this elaborate performance, the signifiers get simpler and simpler, so that much of it is done with lighting: the Lib Dems bathed in green, to indicate an environmentalism that I actually believe is the case but like everything else, sincerely doubt they'll get their way on; Miliband in blue, steady, unpartisan, one nation, a bit like the other guy, only better. This year, speakers have started to stand in the round, with the audience behind them as well as in front, the clearest admission yet that the performance is for the camera. It doesn't matter if some people are listening to the back of Miliband's head. The crowd is there to sell the image, not buy its message. Where you might once have had a plant in the audience to commence applause, now the whole audience is a plant.</p> <p>Nostalgia for a politics of yore is for people with very short memories. I doubt there was ever a time when conferences were used as a genuine space to thrash out policy. But the inevitable consequence of choreographing everything with your eye according to how it will appear on telly is that you put the accent on repetition, clarity, simplicity and brevity. American presidential candidates have been distilling their thoughts into Twitter-sized bites since before Twitter was invented.</p> <p>Miliband has picked up what I previously thought was a Cameroonian bid to buy some time while he remembered what he was about to say: \"Let me be clear,\" he says. It's the verbal equivalent of TV makeup \u2013 it works from a distance, but up close, the artifice disfigures the face underneath. This pantomime disfigures real political conviction, I mean \u2013 Miliband's actual face is, of course, fine.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://de.twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Dav Whatmore knows what it takes to coach a side to an ICC Trophy against the odds. He did it with Sri Lanka in the World Cup as long ago as 1996; he might do it again with Pakistan in 2012.</p> <p>Whatmore's teams are not afraid of a bit of lateral thinking. In the 1990s he hit upon a neat idea, which would help Sri Lanka to win their first global trophy. The notion of one pinch-hitter at the top of the order was around then. But why not two? So Whatmore encouraged the idea of sending out Romesh Kaluwitharana with Sanath Jayasuriya and giving them both licence to play their shots in the first 10 overs and beyond, if possible. It was brave, even better, it worked.</p> <p>Now Whatmore is plotting the downfall of Sri Lanka in the semi-final of the World Twenty20 in his new role as coach of Pakistan.</p> <p>The notion of playing two or three spinners in T20, especially in the sub-continent has been around for a while. But why not five? That is what Pakistan did against Australia and it worked a treat. His team compromised a little in that match since the paceman, Umar Gul, was permitted to bowl two overs at the end of Pakistan's comprehensive victory.</p> <p>With their array of spinners, and Saeed Ajmal to the fore, Pakistan are well-equipped to play at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, where the pitches are inevitably becoming drier and more worn after so many days of cricket. If they can eke out enough runs no team has such a varied spin attack. So far those runs have come from two of the less exalted cricketers in the world, Imran Nazir and Nasir Jamshed.</p> <p>Sri Lanka's main run scorers are better known. Mahela Jayawardene has been in majestic form and received good support from the team's senior citizens; Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara. These batsmen, in home conditions and in front of a home crowd, will not be as intimidated by the preponderance of Pakistani spinners as the Australians were on Tuesday night.</p> <p>ICC trophies are seldom won by the home team but the Sri Lankans, who have performed with increasing efficiency throughout the tournament, will take some beating. And not all of their citizens are that senior. They may include the 18-year-old Akila Dananjaya, who shows no signs of being overawed by being tossed into this tournament on the back of an impressive net session in front of Jayawardene a few months ago.</p>",
  "<p>Most of us are marked in various ways by the politics of the era in which we first became involved. This is not the same as saying, hopefully, that nobody's political views ever change, although all of us can probably think of people we know whose political views have managed to get stuck depressingly early on in their lives, and have never altered.</p> <p>But, in the same way that Napoleon once said that to understand a country's foreign policy it is always useful to look first at the map, so in understanding a person's politics, it is always useful to know when they were born.</p> <p>That certainly went for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm\" title=\"\">Eric Hobsbawm</a>, who died on Monday. Hobsbawm's lifelong Marxism was rooted in the way he became politically engaged in Berlin as Hitler came to power and the feelings he experienced in <a href=\"http://historyannex.com/20th-century-Europe/France-1930s/popular-front.html\" title=\"\">Popular Front France</a> in the mid-1930s. Hobsbawm has been much censured for continuing to articulate why communists of his generation so often thought the way they did about the Soviet Union. But this only supports my point. If even the possessor of the greatest and most wide-ranging historical mind I ever expect to encounter could be marked in this way, then which of the rest of us lesser intellectual fry is likely to be wholly different?</p> <p>The imprint of formative political years is certainly one way of looking at the evolution of the modern Labour party. Consider this. When Tony Blair was 26 in 1979, a divided and shambolic Labour party was swept from power by Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives. When Ed Miliband was 26 in 1995, by contrast, a divided and shambolic Tory party was already reeling towards landslide defeat under Blair.</p> <p>That doesn't tell you everything about the political differences between the two Labour leaders. But it goes some way to explain why Blair, coming to political maturity in a period of terrible Labour failure, was and is a pessimist about his party \u2013 mistakenly in my view \u2013 and why Miliband, reaching his maturity during a surging wave of Labour success, is basically an optimist about it, perhaps mistakenly too.</p> <p>In my own case, it was Hobsbawm who, more than anyone, supplied the formative imprint. In 1978, he gave his Marx Memorial Lecture. I was present, and clearly remember it as being a rather involved piece of labour historical research rather than the seminal moment in late 20th-century left revisionism that it has become in retrospect. But its key sentence made just as much of an impact back then as today.</p> <p>Marshalling his statistics to show how the industrial working class was in decline as a proportion of the working population, how trade union membership was static and the Labour share of the vote gradually shrinking, Hobsbawm's lecture reached its key sentence. \"The forward march of labour and the labour movement, which Marx predicted,\" he said, \"appears to have come to a halt in this country about 25 to 30 years ago.\" In other words, it peaked around the time of the Attlee Labour governments of the postwar era.</p> <p>If one event could be said to have rid me of the leftism with which I still flirted at that time \u2013 and I still possess a letter from Tony Benn thanking me for writing to suggest he <a href=\"http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/tony-benn.html\" title=\"\">ran for the party leadership in 1976</a> \u2013 it was the Hobsbawm lecture and the rich debate that followed in Marxism Today and the Guardian in the early 1980s. Hobsbawm's lecture compelled a generation to think more truthfully and less romantically about the trajectory and momentum of the labour and socialist project. And everything that Hobsbawm said about the condition of those projects back then is even more true today.</p> <p>When Hobsbawm gave his lecture, the proportion of manual workers and their families in the population had already declined from 75% in 1911 to a little over half in 1976. Today it is well under a third. When Hobsbawm spoke, 46% of the workforce were in trade unions. <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/t/12-p77-trade-union-membership-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">Today the proportion is 26%.</a> When Hobsbawm spoke, Labour's most recent general election vote share was 39%. Today that figure is 29%.</p> <p>But if the forward march of labour had already halted long ago, what words should we use to describe what has happened to it today? Gone into retreat? Regrouped? Ended? My preference is simply to say that the question has become \u2013 long ago \u2013 historically irrelevant for all foreseeable political purposes. The Labour party exists. But labourism is no longer the big answer to anything. That's one reason I am unconvinced about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-uk-infrastructure\" title=\"\">Labour's invocation of the spirit of 1945</a> in Manchester this week.</p> <p>Hobsbawm's death at the start of the Labour conference was even announced in the hall. That would have been unthinkable a generation ago. It was, though, appropriate. Because it was not hard to see how Hobsbawm's lecture posed and continues to pose an epochal challenge to the modern Labour party.</p> <p>It seems to be fashionable this week to say that Blair and Miliband have offered ideologically different answers to the Hobsbawm question of what the post-labourist Labour party should become. Much of the difference, however, can be explained by history rather than ideology. Blair became leader in an expanding global economy. There was more of everything for everyone. It is hardly surprising, especially after four successive election defeats, that Blair often took the line of least resistance and invited everyone into his big tent. Some of us criticised this at the time. But he was a pessimist in optimistic times. And he won three elections.</p> <p>Miliband faces the same question in different circumstances. He became leader in a contracting global economy. There is less of most things for most people. He has to make cuts and say no. Miliband's mildly social democratic approach isn't proof that he is a better, wiser or more principled leader than Blair, let alone a more popular one. It is proof that he is an optimist who faces difficult choices, some of which are imposed on him by Blair's failings. They are different leaders in different situations, and they are not stepping into the same river.</p> <p>But they both know one big thing \u2013 that the Labour party always has to transcend old failed labourism if it is to win and govern. Blair's New Labour and Miliband's one-nation Labour are different attempts to reach out to voters who turned away from Old Labour. Blair's attempt was then. It was extremely successful. Miliband's is now. Its prospects are more fragile. They have more in common than those whose politics are stuck in the past can allow. Hobsbawm would have understood that. And so should we.</p>",
  "<p>The Food Standards Agency has suspended plans to warn pregnant women and young children about the health risks of eating game shot with lead ammunition, prompting confusion and dismay among campaigners.</p> <p>The agency, which issues official guidance to consumers, had been expected to issue a statement on Wednesday warning vulnerable groups against eating game such as deer, grouse, pheasant and boar killed with lead shot.</p> <p>It was also expected to advise other adults who regularly ate wild game shot with lead pellets to cut their consumption to avoid serious lead poisoning.</p> <p>The lead ammunition group, the government's advisory panel, decided on Tuesday to release the guidance, but that decision has been overturned. Sources close to the panel said no clear reason had been given.</p> <p>The panel \u2013 which includes the UK's main shooting and conservation bodies such as the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT), the British Association of Shooting and Conservation, and the Countryside Alliance \u2013 had been investigating the issue since its inception in 2009.</p> <p>Debbie Pain, conservation director of WWT and an authority on lead shot in game birds, who has played a key role in formulating the advice to consumers, said: \"They've now said they're delaying publication but I don't know what that means. Is it a week or a month? I have no idea at all.\"</p> <p>A study by the European Food Standard Agency published in July and based on studies of 144,000 food samples collected over a nine-year period from across the EU <a href=\"http://www.leadammunitiongroup.co.uk/information.html\" title=\"\">found very high levels of lead in pheasant and boar</a>. Although those meats are not often eaten in the UK, the results were so high they skewed the overall findings for all meat products tested.</p> <p>The EFSA report said: \"Particularly high results were recorded for wild boar meat and pheasant meat, presumably associated with the use of lead ammunition. The many high results for wild boar meat skewed the distribution for this food category so that the mean exceeded the 95th percentile.\"</p> <p>Expert studies by the UK government's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) presented to the lead ammunition group cited grouse, duck, partridge and deer as potential sources of lead poisoning for consumers in the UK. The use of lead shot in duck-shooting was banned in the UK in 1999 but was still widespread, the agency said.</p> <p>An FSA spokesman said the decision to suspend publication had been taken \"this week\". He confirmed that the warnings \"will be about lead and exposures to lead and advice for people lessening their exposures to lead. It will be directed at the small number of people who eat lead shot game on a regular basis.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We're not publishing it today. It is still under review and we still haven't quite got it ready yet. We're looking to be publishing something on lead ammunition and small birds and larger animals but we not publishing today.\"</p> <p>He said the FSA had not yet decided when the advice would be published, but that it would appear \"shortly\".</p> <p>The Fera report, given to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2010, said evidence on the scale of the risk to consumers from contaminated game was unclear and inconsistent, but there was a <a href=\"http://www.leadammunitiongroup.co.uk/information.html\" title=\"\">consensus that no levels of lead in food were safe</a>.</p> <p>It stated: \"Humans that eat game animals that have been shot with lead ammunition are at risk of poisoning from the fragments of bullets or pellets that remain embedded in the meat or in other edible tissues; the risk from biologically-incorporated lead in game appears to be low.</p> <p>\"Radiographs of shot deer have shown that when a lead bullet breaks up on impact some fragments are too small to be visible to the unaided eye and would probably be retained in the meat after butchering. People in communities that depend heavily on hunting for subsistence are likely to be most exposed.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the sprawling Caracas barrio of Catia, Mar\u00eda Rosales is wishing she had enough money to stock up on food before Sunday's presidential election. Her neighbours have already begun hoarding supplies in case the outcome is contested \u2013 either by the incumbent, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, or his challenger, Henrique Capriles.</p> <p>Whatever the result, Maria says she is likely to stay close to home; she has little enthusiasm for either candidate.</p> <p>It is a far cry from the euphoria and optimism of 1998, when Mar\u00eda joined the crowds who surged on to the streets to dance and sing in celebration of Ch\u00e1vez's first election victory. She was pregnant at the time, and hoped her unborn child would have more chance under a president who promised to help the poor.</p> <p>Her daughter, Hecmary, is now 13, and Mar\u00eda says those opportunities have failed to materialise, while day-to-day concerns have increasingly become overshadowed by the threat of violent crime.</p> <p>\"This is not the life I dreamed for her,\" says Mar\u00eda. \"We thought life would get better and it did for the first seven years. But since then, things have got more difficult. We're going from bad to worse.\"</p> <p>On a global level, Sunday's election is about who controls and distributes one of the world's biggest recoverable oil reserves. For ideologues, it is a frontline battle between Bolivarian socialism and neoliberalism. But for most Venezuelan voters, it is about safety, fairness and a character who arguably inspires more love and hate than almost any other politician in the world.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez is admired for his charisma and ideals, but castigated for poor management and a failure to protect his country's citizens from crime. His recent battle with cancer has added uncertainty and lowered his campaign profile, but he is still the favourite. Forecasts of the outcome range widely, however, and few are free from bias: in the past month, there have been at least 19 polls with predictions ranging from a 25-point lead for Ch\u00e1vez to a six-point win for Capriles.</p> <p>Senior officials in the president's United Socialist party of Venezuela told the Guardian that the opposition was hyping the possibility of a close race to create uncertainty and lay the basis for a challenge to the result. They hope to shore up support with a huge rally in Caracas on Thursday \u2013 the final day of campaigning.</p> <p>Wandering through the streets of Altameira \u2013 an upmarket district of Caracas \u2013 the Guardian asked a dozen street vendors, parking attendants, taxi drivers, waiting staff and security guards how they planned to vote. Almost all of them voted for Ch\u00e1vez in the past. More than half said they would opt for Capriles this time. The main reason they gave was <em>cambio</em> \u2013 change.</p> <p>The straw poll was hardly scientific, but it reflects what analysts describe as a trend away from Ch\u00e1vez despite the enormous oil wealth of Venezuela and the efforts made by the government to reduce inequality. Under Ch\u00e1vez, the proportion of the population living in poverty has fallen from a half to a quarter. There is free healthcare and education. Nutrition rates have improved. More than 20 universities have been built. Adult education campaigns have helped to improve literacy rates.</p> <p>To shore up his support before this year's election, Ch\u00e1vez has widened the state pension programme, raised the minimum wage by 30% and launched a scheme to build a quarter of a million homes.</p> <p>But in the eyes of many voters, mismanagement, corruption and eye-watering crime rates have undermined the benefits of Bolivarian rule.</p> <p>Mar\u00eda has benefited from an adult education programme and subsidised groceries. But she says food has become harder to find. \"The food programme used to be great, but now you stand in line for a long time and often get nothing. Before Ch\u00e1vez, there was more choice.\"</p> <p>For many voters, the president's achievements have been overshadowed by rising violent crime \u2013 a major concern for almost everyone the Guardian interviewed. By some counts the murder rate in Caracas is higher than that of Baghdad. Last year alone, the country's homicide rate tripled to 67 per 100,000 inhabitants, the highest in South America according to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory. The government says the rate is about 50 per 100,000.</p> <p>On Mar\u00eda's street, two people were gunned down last month, but she says she has grown accustomed to the violence. \"In the past when someone was killed, everyone would go to see what happened. But now we just stay indoors to protect ourselves. There's nothing you can do. It's too common.\"</p> <p>Her daughter, Hecmary, never goes out at night and travels with friends by day.</p> <p>Although Ch\u00e1vez has launched a new police force to try to tackle this, their neighbour Yibilady J\u00edmenez says crime is why she too will vote against Ch\u00e1vez. \"Nobody talks about food prices or holes in the road. When it comes to election issues, the only one people here talk about is security. It's always been bad, but it has become much worse.\"</p> <p>In a sharply polarised society, fear of crime is one of the few issues that crosses the income and political divides. Diego Tirado was also born the year Ch\u00e1vez became president \u2013 in his case to a middle-class family that now owns a stylish Italian restaurant in a Caracas shopping mall. The teenager \u2013 who goes to a private Jesuit school \u2013 says he is scared of being kidnapped. His sister's college friends turn up in bulletproof cars with bodyguards.</p> <p>At least a dozen of their friends' families have left the country in recent years, but not because of financial pressure or high taxes; under Ch\u00e1vez, many of the country's better off have maintained their lifestyle or even grown wealthier. Diego's mother, Julieta \u2013 who was among hundreds of thousands at a Capriles rally in Caracas on Sunday \u2013 says the wealth divide has not closed. \"In the past 14 years, I think my rich friends have actually got richer. Some are Swiss bankers. Some supply the state broadcaster. They've always had money. Now they have more.\"</p> <p>\"Economically, we have maintained our status, but our lives are not better because we are forced to live in ghettoes,\" said Jose Luis, Diego's father. \"I hate that. We can't walk the street or go to the beach or the national park because we are afraid. I'd like to buy a house, but I don't dare to because it would make us more vulnerable.\"</p> <p>The benefits of the Ch\u00e1vez era are more evident in the low-income neighbourhood of Guatire, where Danyely Lozada \u2013 another teenager born when he came to power \u2013 has grown up.</p> <p>She says things are getting better for locals. Although she is worried about crime and remains at home at night, she says the dangers are exaggerated and in any case have been reduced since a new national guard post was recently established nearby. Before the election, the local government has also resurfaced some of the roads and a nearby shanty town has been given breeze blocks to upgrade the wood and corrugated zinc homes.</p> <p>There are limits to what the state has achieved. The family say they have received no benefits from government social programmes. When her stepfather, Marlon, broke his wrists in a traffic accident, he had free surgery but had to work for four months to pay for the pins and paperwork.</p> <p>Danyely's mother has taken on a job so her daughter can attend a private school and further her ambition of becoming a forensic clinician. \"Public education is not good. There is too much sex and drugs,\" said Marlon \u2013 a former convict who is now an evangelical Christian.</p> <p>He declares himself a Ch\u00e1vez supporter. \"With him, the power is with the people. It's not that there is less poverty, but the poor now have more opportunities.\"</p> <p>Whether he has created enough chances and redistributed enough oil money to outweigh the growing risk of crime in people's minds is likely to determine Sunday's vote in this vibrant democracy.</p> <p>\"For the first time I am seeing a tight race. Either candidate could win,\" said Asdrubel Olivares, a political analyst at the Ecoanalitica consultancy. \"The deciding element will be mobilising voters and this is an area where Ch\u00e1vismo has an advantage.\"</p> <p>Getting the public to join in decision-making is one area where even Ch\u00e1vez's fiercest critics agree he has brought improvements. \"One good thing to have come from the Ch\u00e1vez period in government is the widespread conviction that the population have developed a greater right to participate,\" said Teresa Albanez, who oversaw the primary election for his rival Capriles.</p> <p>\"Ch\u00e1vez has institutionalised this and people have internalised this. That's good, but it is sad that he hasn't accomplished enough to benefit them.\"</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Virginia Lopez</em></p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>The International Monetary Fund's chief economist has warned that the global economy will take a decade to recover from the financial crisis as the latest snapshot of the UK economy suggested that growth in the third quarter will be at best anaemic.</p> <p>Olivier Blanchard said he feared the eurozone crisis, debt problems in Japan and the US, and a slowdown in China meant that the world economy would not be in good shape until at least 2018. \"It's not yet a lost decade,\" he said. \"But it will surely take at least a decade from the beginning of the crisis for the world economy to get back to decent shape.</p> <p>Blanchard made his comments on a Hungarian website Portfolio.hu ahead of the IMF meeting next week in Tokyo. Germany is expected to defend its handling of Europe's debt problems at the meeting, but Blanchard said there was more that Europe's largest economy could do to support Spain and other struggling eurozone nations. In particular, he urged Berlin to accept a rise in inflation and wages that would make it less competitive with its trading partners.</p> <p>He said there was no risk of hyperinflation in Europe. Higher inflation in Germany, though, would be beneficial: a somewhat higher inflation rate in Germany should simply be seen as a necessary and desirable relative price adjustment, he said.</p> <p>Blanchard's comments came as figures from Markit showed that the UK's important services sector grew in August but slipped back by September as the Olympics factor waned.</p> <p>According to industry figures from Markit the services activity index dropped from 53.7 to 52.2 and employment fell, adding to gloomy surveys of the construction and manufacturing sectors earlier in the week.</p> <p>Markit, which compiles a monthly index based on figures from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said it was now clear that the bounce back from the slump in the first half of the year was weaker than expected and could result in the UK economy growing by just 0.1% in the third quarter.</p> <p>Hopes that the Queen's diamond jubilee and the \u00a39bn spent on the Olympics would lift sales over the longer term have largely been dashed as growth slows and the outlook, though robust with a growing order book, remains subdued.</p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which began a two-day meeting on Wednesday, is on Thursday expected to keep interest rates at 0.5% and maintain the stock of bonds in its quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn.</p> <p>Most economists believe it is possible the lacklustre figures will persuade the MPC to add a further \u00a350bn at its November meeting when the first estimate of the third quarter figures is available.</p>",
  "<p>It is the issue most notable by its absence in the 2012 presidential race. But the environment may yet have an impact this election as campaign groups target the vulnerable congressional seats of Republicans who dismiss the dangers of climate change.</p> <p>The present US Congress is generally considered the most unfriendly to the environment on record \u2013 with multiple votes in the House of Representatives to strike down or weaken environmental regulations, cut back funds for developing clean energy, and discount the existence of climate change.</p> <p>Now, nine Republicans \u2013 all in tough re-election contests \u2013 are facing payback for their records on the environment.</p> <p>In the congressional races, the League of Conservation Voters, aims to spend $2m before election day to defeat what the group calls <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/elections/flat-earth-five/\">the 'Flat Earth Five'</a>: Republicans who do not accept established science on climate change.</p> <p>The League's targets include: Dan Benishek of Michigan, Ann Marie Buerkle of New York, Francisco Canseco of Texas, Dan Lungren of California and Joe Walsh of Illinois. The group is spending heavily on television ads as well as direct mail.</p> <p><a href=\"http://action.sierraclub.org/site/MessageViewer?em_id=251625.0\">A parallel effort launched last week</a> by the Sierra Club, Toxic Money, Toxic Votes, was aimed at punishing Canesco, Lungren and four other Republicans for their voting records. Collectively known as the Toxic Six, the group also includes Republicans Mike Coffman of Colorado, Chris Gibson of New York, Jim Renacci of Ohio, and Bobby Schilling of Illinois.</p> <p>The Sierra Club sent out a direct mailer this week in Lungren's district, accusing him of being too close to the industry and noting that the congressman received nearly half a million dollars from oil and gas companies.</p> <p>The targeting of House races is a relatively new tactic for campaign groups, and reflects the realisation among green activists that an environmentally friendly president, like Obama, could not deliver on climate change \u2013 or maintain existing protections \u2013 without support from Congress.</p> <p>The rise of the conservative Tea Party movement in the 2010 elections made it politically expedient for Republicans to deny the existence of climate change, or block environmental protections. The Tea Party ascendancy saw Romney as well as Obama shifting their positions on climate change.</p> <p>Jeff Gohringer, a spokesman for the League, said there were signs that dismissing the dangers of climate change could come back to haunt members of Congress. He said polls indicated the extra push from the environmental group, was paying off.</p> <p>\"It's fair to say all five of these members are struggling,\" Gohringer said of the five Republicans targeted by his organisation. \"What we are seeing now is that these members are actually being put on the spot for their positions on climate change.\"</p> <p>The website Real Clear Politics <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/house/2012_elections_house_map.html\">on Friday rated districts</a> for Schilling, Buerkle, and Walsh as likely Democratic pick-ups. Lungren, Renacci, Coffman, and Canseco were in toss-up races, according to Real Clear Politics.</p> <p>At least one candidate, Canseco, has publicly complained about the campaign. The League announced an additional $600,000 television ad purchase in his district this week.</p> <p>\"It is really counterproductive to have a debate about whether or not there is climate change and whether or not there is climate change occurring,\" Canseco told the Christian news service One World Now. \"What we should be having is a debate about policies that are promoted and implemented in the name of climate change and that negatively impact opportunities for our citizens and kill jobs.\"</p> <p>Benishek's district was ranked as leaning Republican, though the latest polls show a dead heat. Gibson was comfortably ahead in his district.</p> <p>Environmental groups have also stepped up the pressure on Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, gathering 160,000 signatures for a petition demanding the contenders mention climate change in their first debate on 3 October.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://climatesilence.org/\">the Climate Silence website</a> launched last week tracks how Obama and Romney have backtracked on action on climate change over the years.</p> <p>The push follows growing frustration with both Obama and Romney within the environmental movement. Romney, under pressure from Tea Party conservatives, has departed from a relatively moderate stance on climate change as Massachusetts governor.</p> <p>By the time of his speech to the Republican convention, climate change was relegated to a laugh line.</p> <p>Obama has also shifted, abandoning his 2008 rhetoric to heal a \"planet in peril\". As the website notes, Obama has expanded offshore oil drilling and failed to mention climate change in connection with this summer's historic drought or extreme weather such as hurricanes. However, the president did give environmental groups a boost in his convention speech by declaring climate change was real and not a hoax.</p> <p>\"There is a desire, there is a hunger to hear from the candidates about what they are going to do about global warming,\" said Eric Picha, president of Friends of the EarthAction , one of the two groups behind the Climate Silence website. \"You can see they are not saying a lot and what they are saying is not terribly helpful.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you want to sour the mood of any discussion with an academic, throw in one of the following words: austerity, managerialism and employability. And who can blame them?

Instead of creating more questionable lists of such supposed skills and attributes, we should focus on the processes by and through which individuals move through their higher education onto their post-graduation lives, in employment and other spheres. @lenmholmes</p> <h2><strong>Kerry Bellamy, vice-chair, <a href=\"http://www.aldinhe.ac.uk\">Association of Learning Development in Higher Education</a> (ALDinHE)</strong></h2> <p>Kerry works as the student advice and mentor manager, working in student services at University of Wales Newport.

  "<p>It's every parent's worst nightmare. The fear of a child being abducted haunts us all, not least when high-profile cases saturate the media, as has been the case this week.</p> <p>A generation ago, television viewing seemed to be routinely interrupted by public information campaigns warning children about \"stranger danger\". All adults of a certain age will remember the lasting impact of watching as children the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85UlWqk-YKI\" title=\"\">\"Charley Says\" broadcasts</a> in the 1970s, warning about risks such as strangers in parks approaching you.</p> <p>\"Don't talk to strangers\" feels too didactic and unfriendly for this age. And, in any case, there are no such public service campaigns now. So how should a parent explain to a child how to behave safely?</p> <p>John Cameron, head of child protection operations at the <a href=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NSPCC</a>, says it's important that adults instil a sense of perspective in children about the risks. \"Say something like: 'Not all strangers are bad, but occasionally they might want to harm you. You must never get into a stranger's car and you must scream and shout if they try to make you.' But I would reinforce the idea that not all strangers are dangerous.\"</p> <p>Cameron says it is important that children do not lose the desire to explore their environment, as they must learn how to sensibly assess risk: \"They can't be cosseted. As adults, we can become over-anxious and our children then suffer. The risk of a child being abducted is incredibly low and has remained roughly the same for decades. In previous decades, we were relentlessly told that the danger came from strangers, but we know that's not the case. We have also developed an idyllic sense that rural areas are safe and urban areas are dangerous in relation to the risk of abduction. But, again, that's not the case.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/people/mel37@cam.ac.uk\" title=\"\">Michael Lamb</a>, a professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge who specialises in \"shaping children's adjustment and wellbeing\", agrees that adults often \"mis-focus\" the perception of danger when communicating to children.</p> <p>\"The majority of children who are abused or abducted are done so by people known to them,\" he says. \"We therefore risk giving them a false sense of security that they should only be wary of total strangers. The best instruction to give to children is not to go off with someone unless they have first checked with their parent or carer. The risk is that we communicate to children that there is more danger around than is actually the case.\"</p> <p>Lamb also argues that parents should reassure children they are being monitored \u2013 and, obviously, follow that through by actually monitoring them when they are outside exploring: \"It is clearly good advice to say: don't get into cars. But we also want parents to be more aware of what their kids are doing at all times. We must present the idea to children that their parents are there as a source of guidance. We have been good in the past about inoculating our children against strangers, but we must also be wary of instilling in children an unwillingness to believe that someone they know could be harmful.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"But I accept that finding a balance is tricky. We can over-exaggerate the dangers, especially with the influence of modern media. We also can't de-risk the world entirely. It is important that children are given the opportunities to explore. There is good evidence from studies that teenagers are better adjusted when they know that their parents are still monitoring their whereabouts. This extends to all children.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.agony-aunt.com/about/\" title=\"\">Suzie Hayman</a>, the agony aunt and trustee of the parenting advice charity <a href=\"http://familylives.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Family Lives</a>, says the best way to talk to younger children about any danger is through \"What would you do if \u2026?\" scenarios: \"From an early age, we should be asking them how they would react to a certain situation \u2013 say, if they throw a ball into a road, or if a stranger asks them to get into a car. We shouldn't lecture them about the dangers, rather they should be encouraged to think of the right response first. We should then correct them if they don't get it right. We want to train them to have the correct instincts when it comes to potential dangers.\"</p>",

  "<p>Alan Quinn is a BAE shop steward helping to build Typhoon fighter aircraft. (\"We don't bash metal any more, we glue metal to carbon fibre and Kevlar parts.\") He's anxiously looking to see if the proposed merger with EADS will expand Britain's high-end manufacturing base \u2013 or further erode it. But the 52-year-old also finds time to be a school governor, a magistrate and, for the past two years, what his constituency MP Ivan Lewis calls \"a good, crusading councillor\" in Labour Bury.</p> <p>What did Quinn think of Miliband's speech? \"I was surprised how good it was, delivered confidently and unscripted. He's now looking like a PM. I didn't expect it to be that good.\"</p> <p>Before the speech Quinn had fretted that Labour had wasted five months on its leadership contest in 2010, allowing the coalition to blame the debt crisis entirely on Labour's legacy, not the bankers.</p> <p>Now, he says, \"Ed's grown in the job and has the measure of Cameron. He was ahead on banking and phone hacking. I've met him twice and he comes across as sincere and honest.\"</p> <p>Plenty of delegates echo these sentiments. Sheila Dore, an east London teacher, recalls hearing Miliband addressing local education meetings. \"He'd speak, but he also listened.\"</p> <p>These views have infected the 2012 conference. \"It's not perfect, but it is more democratic; they're not telling us what to say in our speech; there's less PR, music and flashing lights. It's more low-key but it allows a better conversation,\" says Dore. Another Labour delegate says: \"The mood is better. Last year no one was really listening; this year we are.\"</p> <p>The result has often been a tentative atmosphere in the cavernous conference hall, the former Manchester Central train shed, draped in black curtains to make it fit the smaller audience. Apart from the Olympic session and Miliband's own speech (low-key by modern histrionic standards), there have been few emotional high points and standing ovations.</p> <p>Modern Labour conferences are dominated by people who have got on in life but remember mum's struggle with ill health and low pay, dad's unemployment, their former community's loss of industries, jobs and decent pensions, the stresses that killed grandma, the victimisation (blacklists still exist) at work. Traditional passions, including the NHS, still arouse strong feelings and Labour conferences are still happier with public spending plans than cuts.</p> <p>But there is greater acknowledgement nowadays of unavoidable choices, the need for efficiency, green manufacturing and skills (they make very green steel in Scunthorpe these days), the power of markets as well as their unfairness. Much mocked as Miliband-ish policy wonking, Professor Michael Sandel's hour-long Sunday seminar (\"What money can't buy\") is said to have enthralled the Usdaw delegation, the union of shopworkers, who felt they were getting a glimpse of Harvard.</p> <p>Others mutter \"conference has been turned into a thinktank\"; by that they mean didactic and earnest.</p> <p>In the main hall and on the crowded fringe, routine Tory-bashing in speeches has been punctuated by hisses for the Lib Dems as hapless pantomime villains of the coalition, though neither the leader nor his lieutenants have attacked the Clegg crew much, knowing they might have to deal with them if Labour wins without a Commons majority in 2015.</p> <p>There is little evident enthusiasm to contemplate that option. \"We can win by ourselves,\" says Ipswich councillor Keith Rawlingson. \"I'm glad the Lib Dems are in coalition with the Tories, not us,\" adds his wife, Lindsey. \"The Lib Dems are toxic,\" confides their friend, Gary Hills. Old tribal dislikes die hard and optimism remains central to an activist's dedicated life, even as activists accept that few people now want to join political parties.</p> <p>What they try to do instead, says MP Ivan Lewis, is engage with them in specific campaigns \u2013 for a school or hospital, against a polluting plant \u2013 and give participatory rights to them inside Labour's tent as supporters, not members.</p> <p>Bhavna Joshi, who fights Tory housing nimbyism in Great Ashby, Hertfordshire (it sounds like JK Rowling's new novel), puts it differently.</p> <p>\"The public is beyond slickness and spin in politics. The ordinary man in the street wants to know what we stand for. They're not voting for a person, they want to know what a political organisation can do for them.\"</p> <p>Her colleague, Gary Hills, agrees, though their friends, the Rawlingsons, think the need to engage voters in a dialogue of ideas \u2013 \"morality and decency over market dictation\" \u2013 comes first.</p> <p>They don't think much of using social media for this purpose, but in polite, lowered voices suggest that Labour has to acknowledge the problems \u2013 for jobs and public services \u2013 which recent immigration has created. Miliband's speech gave them a flick in that direction. Its success has generated expectation that he is now an established leader who is getting the measure of his ambition for Labour.</p> <p>Wandering around the conference on the 29th anniversary of his own election as Labour leader, Neil Kinnock was an early Ed-not-David man. People should have noticed by now that Miliband is tough, he says, rattling off a list that includes fighting his own brother, taking on Murdoch and the banks, even abolishing annual shadow cabinet elections.</p> <p>Is he a geek? Kinnock is another of those who say that people who meet him think: \"What a nice guy. He engages with people in an unusual way, a bit like Mo [Mowlam] did. 'I hear what you say.'\"</p> <p>In the bar of Manchester's Midland Hotel, the historical heart of the conference, a gnarled old union apparatchik from the Clydeside shipyards, Unite's Jim Mowatt, offers his own verdict on the speech.</p> <p>\"I know this man better than I did before, and I trust him more,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>Individuals have ideas. The good ones attract followers. The right followers generate a movement. The transition from one to another is not always easy to identify, and harder still to explain.</p> <p>Has the B Corp idea arrived? It's impossible to say for sure, but Andrew Kassoy must be quietly confident. More than 620 companies have signed up. Some, such as the clothing retailer <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/eu/enGB/home\" title=\"\">Patagonia</a>, are seriously big players. Even global statesmen are singing B Corp's praises.</p> <p>\"We don't know him or anything\", says Kassoy, in reference to former US president Bill Clinton, who recently waxed lyrical about the B Corp concept during a speech at Oxford University. \"I guess someone must have been talking to him about us.\"</p> <p>The relationship has clearly developed since then because last week Kassoy found himself on stage at the annual meeting of the 2012 Clinton Global Initiative.</p> <h2><strong>New gen capitalism</strong> </h2> <p>So what is B Corp and why is it garnering so much interest? Kassoy, a private equity veteran, describes it as no less than an \"evolution of capitalism\".</p> <p>\"B\" stands for benefit - social and environmental, as well as financial. If 20th century capitalism was obsessed with maximising financial returns, Kassoy insists, then the 21st century will be all about creating social value.</p> <p>\"There's a generation of entrepreneurs and stakeholders who want business to be about more than just money,\" says Kassoy. \"They want business to have some kind of purpose. We like to say that has turned into a global movement of entrepreneurs who are trying to redefine success in business.\"</p> <p>B Corp, or B Corporation to give it its full name, is a response to this sea change. At its most basic, it's a certification scheme. Companies sign up, undergo a self-assessment and have their social and environmental credentials independently verified. If their policies and performance pass muster, they are allowed to join the B Corp club.</p> <p>Kassoy, who came up with the original B Corp idea five years ago with two course mates from Stanford University, accepts that there's already \"an alphabet soup of certifications\" out there. Isn't this just another? He insists not. His, he says, is \"comprehensive\".</p> <p>\"Most certifications are product certifications,\" says Kassoy. \"They tell you a lot about the bar of soap that you're buying or the bag of coffee\u2026 but they don't tell you about the whole company. So big agriculture is increasingly making organic food, but it doesn't tell you that those companies are doing anything useful for the environment or for their employees.\"</p> <p>The B Corp stamp is designed to give consumers and investors alike the ability to cut through the greenwash and identify companies with responsible management across the board. Good companies, not just good products, is Kassoy's message. \"At present, there's no way to tell the difference between a good company and good marketing. People make all sorts of claims, but how is anyone supposed to know?\" Enter the B Corp certified seal of approval.</p> <h2><strong>Certified followers</strong> <br></h2> <p>Companies seem to be buying in (literally, as well as figuratively: membership costs between $500 and $25,000 per year, depending on the company's size). From 13 signatories five years ago, there are now around 620 B Corps. The list ranges from large US brands such as eyewear designer <a href=\"http://www.warbyparker.com/\" title=\"\">Warby Parker</a> and online retailer <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/\" title=\"\">Etsy.com</a>, through to smaller startups and \"place-based\" businesses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cascadeng.com/\" title=\"\">Cascade Engineering</a> exemplifies the kind of \"integrated model\" that B Labs - the non-profit that administers the certification \u2013 exists to promote, says Kassoy. Located in western Michigan, \"a tough area, employment-wise\", the firm provides well-paid jobs, while also producing products for the developing world and managing its environmental impact.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cabotcheese.coop/\" title=\"\">Cabot Creamery</a> is another. One of the largest dairy produces in the US, the firm is run on a co-operative basis - one of a growing number of co-ops and employee-owned businesses in the B Corp stable. As a movement, B Corp is predominantly a North American phenomenon. But that's changing. Indeed, the reason Kassoy took to the stage at the Clinton Global Initiative was to announce a partnership with Sistema B in South America. Kassoy hopes to enrol 100 B Corps from the region by next year.</p> <p>They will add to the 29 B Corps that already exist outside the US and Canada. The list includes firms from Kenya, India, Chile and Nicaragua, among others. The idea has yet to catch on in Europe, which will be the focus of B Lab's next big push.</p> <p>Companies sign up for one of three reasons, according to Kassoy. For some, it's leadership. Being part of the B Corp community enables them to \"shout louder\" than they can as lone businesses. For others, it's about \"differentiating themselves\". Kassoy is reluctant to use the word marketing, but that's what it comes down to. Last come the offers. Like the savvy deal-broker it is, B Lab has negotiated concessions on everything from software to business association subscriptions.</p> <h2><strong>Benefit Corp Inc</strong> <br></h2> <p>The story doesn't end there. Certification is the bulk of what B Labs does, but not everything. Kassoy and his fellow founders would like to see B Corps written into the statute book.</p> <p>Right now, US corporate law effectively obliges directors to prioritise shareholder interests above all else. That needs to change, he says. To kick things off, all certified B Corps are required to have their social and environmental commitments written into their governing documents.</p> <p>Again, word is getting out. Eleven US states have now introduced so-called Benefit Corp legislation for B Corp-style companies. As yet, the rules don't generally include incentives such as tax breaks or public sector contracting preferences.</p> <p>Kassoy believes it's only a matter of time before such incentives are introduced. \"Essentially these are businesses that are internalising externalities, so they are creating measurable public benefit \u2026 It [Benefit Corp legislation] is a powerful statement to treat these companies differently because of the benefits they create for society. It's a harbinger of things to come.\"</p> <p>So speaks a man with a good idea to his name. And, who knows, perhaps even a movement.</p> <h2><em>Andrew Kassoy will be speaking at our GSBQ event in New York on Wednesday 10 October.

  "<p>My friend and colleague of 20 years, Jeremy Pope, who has died aged 73, was one of the pioneers in what is now a global movement to curb corruption and improve integrity in government.</p> <p>Jeremy was born in Wellington, New Zealand, and educated at the Anglican St Peter's Cambridge preparatory school and at Wanganui Collegiate school. He was very involved in all aspects of school life, including cricket and drama, and music, in which he excelled. When moving on to Victoria University, Wellington, it was a toss-up whether he would study music or law. Law won.</p> <p>In 1963 he married Diana Miller (who had said she would marry him only if and when he completed his degree, which he duly did). They were an incredibly close couple, role models for many who knew them. In the 1970s they co-authored a bestselling travel guide to New Zealand which remained continuously in print for more than 20 years.</p> <p>Jeremy's father, who worked for the Chicago Tribune and New York Times, reporting on the Chinese revolution and the Korean and Vietnam wars, triggered his interest in global affairs. As an editor of the New Zealand Law Journal in the 1970s, Jeremy denounced New Zealand's sporting contacts with South Africa. He was responsible for the introduction of the country's duty solicitor scheme.</p> <p>In 1976 he was appointed assistant director of the legal and constitutional affairs division of the Commonwealth secretariat in London, and in 1980 became director of the division. During his time in London he became the only non-African member of Sanroc, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee, which led campaigns to isolate South Africa in protest against apartheid on the sports field.</p> <p>In 1993, with six others, he co-founded Transparency International (TI), an anti-corruption organisation based in Berlin. From 1993 to 1997, he was its first managing director; he stepped down to head a research and development unit in London from 1997 to 2003. At TI, he was the catalyst for the first open discussions on corruption and governance involving civil society in numerous countries, often in environments of official hostility, for instance in parts of Africa, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. He inspired hundreds of activists to take up this struggle. He was appointed an anti-corruption adviser to the World Bank president in 1995.</p> <p>In 2003 Jeremy parted ways with TI, and co-founded Tiri, an organisation dedicated to taking the anti-corruption movement in a new direction. We started Tiri without any funding, so we worked from Jeremy and Diana's kitchen for the first two years. This suited Jeremy, who could work in his shorts and T-shirt. In the last four years, after he returned to Wellington, he served on New Zealand's Human Rights Commission, where he was noted for his courage, good humour and gentle wisdom.</p> <p>Jeremy is survived by Diana and their children, Adam, Jemima and Samuel, and grandchildren, Jessica and Miki.</p>",
  "<p>Shareholders have stepped up their campaign to remove Rupert Murdoch as chairman of News Corporation ahead of the media company's annual meeting this month.</p> <p>Hermes, a British fund manager that controls \u00a324.8bn assets, joined an action on Wednesday launched by dissident shareholders seeking to oust News Corp's chairman in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>Glass Lewis, one of the largest shareholder advisory groups, has also recommended its clients vote for the appointment of an independent chair. This is the second year that major shareholders have rounded on Murdoch and his board.</p> <p>Hans Hirt, global head of corporate engagement at Hermes, said: \"While we acknowledge the recent board changes made by the company, News Corp has still not sufficiently addressed the significant shareholder concerns about its board structure and corporate culture highlighted at last year's annual meeting. The time is right for the company to appoint an independent chair in order to rebuild trust, and ensure that the interests of all investors are more properly represented.\"</p> <p>The resolution was co-filed by Christian Brothers Investment Services (CBIS) and members of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF). It will be voted on at the company's annual meeting in Los Angeles on 16 October.</p> <p>A similar vote last year failed to pass. Murdoch and his family own about 12% of the media giant but control 40% of the vote because of News Corp's dual class share structure. Last year, the majority of independent voters voted against much of News Corp's board including Murdoch's sons Lachlan and James.</p> <p>This year's meeting comes amid rumours that News Corp is considering appointing James Murdoch to head Fox Networks, the division that runs the firm's flagship Fox channel. Such a move would come in a year that has seen James Murdoch criticised for his handling of the hacking revelations and resign as chairman of both News International, the company's British newspaper division, and BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster that it controls.</p> <p>Julie Tanner, director of socially responsible investing at CBIS, called the speculation a \"slap in the face for shareholders, not to mention victims of the hacking scandal\".</p>",
  "<p>When historians look back on Barack Obama's first and second presidential elections, they may see some commonality. Four years ago, the country's first black White House candidate was smeared with all sorts of allegations. The would-be president was not born in the US. He was a mole. A socialist \u2013 no, make that a communist. Barack was gay. Barack was a Marxist. <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/18/foxs-bolling-advances-obama-muslim-myth/189961\" title=\"And a Muslim too\">And a Muslim too</a>.</p> <p>Now the same myths are rumbling through the country's bars, online forums and, worryingly, major news outlets. And this time there is a list of failed promises \u2013 on Guant\u00e1namo, universal healthcare \u2013 to add to the attack, while the personal claims seem to be yet more torrid (this week's most bizarre is that \"Obama's mother was a porn star\").</p> <p>It is against this backdrop that new playwright Rashid Razaq is staging his debut production, based on Obama's college days at Columbia, New York. Provocatively titled <a href=\"http://www.waterlooeast.co.uk/the%20president%20and%20the%20pakistani.html\" title=\"\">The President and&nbsp;the Pakistani</a>, it revisits Harlem, 1981, when \"Barry\" Obama was living with his alleged party-loving, drug-abusing, illegal alien Pakistani friend, Sohale Siddiqi.</p> <p>\"They had an odd-couple relationship,\" says Razaq, a reporter for the London Evening Standard, showing me a picture of the pair sprawled on a mustard yellow sofa, a leather-jacketed and polo-sweatered Obama kicking back with an impressively moustached, skinny Pakistani. In the play, Siddiqi has been renamed Salim \"Sal\" Maqbool; in Obama's 1995 autobiography, Dreams From My Father, he was recreated as a composite character named Sadik, mentioned in only a few pages.</p> <p>\"Sal is a cokehead\", says Razaq, who admits he has never spoken to the person on whom the character is based. \"He has manic, nervous energy while Barry is the stable, secure, sensible guy. But there is a real closeness between them and hopefully that comes across.\" At heart, Razaq's play is a studied 80s bromance.</p> <p>But what would Siddiqi himself make of it? When I track down Obama's former room-mate, who now works for Getty Images and lives in Seattle, he is reluctant to speak. Not least, he says, because a reporter from Associated Press \"got his interview by barging in unexpectedly at my workplace in spite of my declinations\" during the last campaign cycle.He says the reports of his drug use have been wildly overstated: \"I was never in 'rehab',\" he emails, \"I simply curtailed drugs.\" It is true, however, that in the late 1990s, as state senator of Illinois, Obama wrote him \"a personal reference, stating that he knew me\" when Siddiqi was applying for jobs in the dotcom industry. Their lives had naturally drifted apart by that point, but a solid bond remains. Siddiqi still refuses a steady stream of press requests to talk about his old friend, including the offer of $50,000 to talk to one anti-Obama film-maker just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>I send Siddiqi a copy of the script and ask him what he thinks. He says he feels \"helpless\" about the play. \"The portrayal of 'Sal' as a clingy and dishonest roommate is completely off the mark and makes me cringe,\" he writes.</p> <p>\"Obama was exceptionally kind and considerate of others which I considered to his own detriment \u2013 the play got that part correct,\" he says of his time spent living with the president in a shabby apartment on East 94th Street. It was a lease that Siddiqi, who was an illegal immigrant when he met Obama (having overstayed his tourist visa), had lied to win, despite the cockroaches, \"like plump dates\", scuttling across the apartment floor. Siddiqi confirms that the young Obama, a high school pothead, \"was lighthearted and fun-loving for the first half of our cohabitation and grew serious later\". He himself, meanwhile, was preoccupied with \"assimilating to my new environment [US], getting rich legally, socialising with friends, meeting women. Our cohabitation was on a temporary basis with me hoping to move to more comfortable surroundings and he wanting to live closer to Columbia.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397116206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274386787/barack-obama-roomie-play--008.jpg\" alt=\"barack obama roomie play - rehearsal\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrus Lowe (Barry Obama) and Junaid Faiz (Sal Maqbool) in rehearsal for The President and The Pakistani.

Mild-mannered but sure-footed direction comes from Tom Attenborough, son of Michael Attenborough (artistic director of the Almeida theatre, London) and grandson of actor and director Richard.</p> <p>I wonder if Razaq agrees that representing a living president during the busiest period of electioneering is political in itself. \"All theatre is a political act to some degree. We're just grabbing it by the balls,\" he says. Emphasising his right to artistic licence, he says he drew inspiration from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/09/barack-obama-childhood-indonesia\" title=\"Obamas own book\">Obama's own book</a> and scoped <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/25/barack-obama-the-college-years\" title=\"David Maranisss biography of the 44th president\">David Maraniss's biography, Barack Obama: The Making of the Man,</a> published earlier this year, for further detail.</p> <p>When we meet \"Sadik\" in Dreams From My Father, he is ushering Obama into his flat as a woman in her underwear cuts up lines of cocaine on the kitchen table. In Maraniss's doorstop of a book, Obama first meets Siddiqi at a New Year's Eve party in San Francisco, the young, gangly, would-be president greeting his future roommate with pitch-perfect Urdu, asking: \"How are you, Boss?\" It was a phrase he had picked up from his best buddies at Occidental College in California \u2013 Pakistani students Imad Husain, Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid who, like Siddiqi, were part of Karachi's wealthy elite. So close were the group that Obama went to Pakistan with them for a three-week holiday in 1981, staying with Hamid and Chandoo's families.</p> <p>Maraniss argues in his book that the group has distanced itself from Obama for fear of hurting his presidency, but they remain friends: \"The Pakistanis were a fun-loving bunch,\" he laughs, talking on the telephone from Washington DC, \"but they were intellectuals.\" Despite their party harder reputations, the three went into highly paid corporate finance: Husain is a Boston-based banker; Hamid works for one of the world's biggest private equity firms in Dubai; and Chandoo \u2013 who is recorded to have fundraised some <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/pages/volunteer-fundraisers-q4/\" title=\"$50,000 to $100,000 for Obamas current campaign\">$50,000 to $100,000 for Obama's current campaign</a> \u2013 is a financial consultant, living with his family in upmarket Westchester, New York.</p> <p>Camp Obama plays all this down, fearful of the Pakistani Muslim connection being used to taint their candidate. \"A friend of mine did wonder if the play was about Pakistan now,\" says Syrus Lowe, who plays the young Obama, as we discuss the irony of one of the president's hallmark foreign policies: the covert US war against Pakistan, waged entirely through drone attacks.</p> <p>Lowe says he likes to think Obama is \"dropping those drones with a bit more conscience\" than the average US president might. Maraniss is less circumspect. \"The Pakistanis, in my mind, didn't shape him in any way but made this transitionary period of his life comfortable for him, as he was still learning what it was to be African American. They could see his ambition more clearly than other people; it was to them that Obama first said he wanted to be president one day.\"</p> <p>The President and the Pakistani is at the <a href=\"http://waterlooeast.ticketsolve.com/\" title=\"here\">Waterloo East theatre</a>, London SE1, until 4&nbsp;November.</p>",
  "<p>The EU's emergency and development arms are to work together more closely to reduce the vulnerability of the poorest households to shocks from conflict, drought and other crises, and to tackle the underlying causes of food insecurity in regions such as the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.</p> <p>EU officials said the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/12/733&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\" title=\"\">approach, outlined in a new policy document,</a> was designed to build resilience in communities to withstand the impact of future crises and disasters \u2013 and save money in the long-run at a time of growing pressure on aid budgets.</p> <p>\"Unexpected natural catastrophes, food crisis or economic shocks can seriously undermine the results of our work in developing countries,\" said Andris Piebalgs, the EU commissioner for development. \"We need to focus our actions towards tackling the root causes of recurrent crises rather than just dealing with their consequences. This is not only more efficient but also much cheaper.\" The EU estimates that every euro invested in disaster-preparedness saves between four and seven euros on disaster response.</p> <p>Resilience \u2013 the ability of individuals, communities and states to withstand shocks \u2013 is seen as an increasingly important development goal at a time of recurring crises. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/28/sahel-chronic-hunger-crisis-solutions?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">The Sahel region of west Africa has suffered three droughts since 2005</a>. This year's severe drought and a failed harvest left 18 million people without enough food, and only prompt action by donors \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/feb/16/east-africa-crisis-response-effective-not-fast\" title=\"\">stung by criticism that they failed to act early enough in Somalia</a> \u2013 staved off disaster.</p> <p>\"Since taking on the EU crisis response role, I've seen every possible disaster \u2013 short of an asteroid hitting the Earth \u2013 and how, when the effects are intensified by climate change, demographic growth and urbanisation, [they] are hitting more people than ever,\" said commissioner Kristalina Georgieva, responsible for international co-operation, humanitarian aid and crisis response. \"If we want our assistance to be effective and cost-efficient, we must not just put a bandage on the wound \u2013 we must help find a cure. This requires a shared vision from the humanitarian and the development communities and a joint commitment to act.\"</p> <p>The European commission's flagship resilience initiatives are its support for two regional schemes, Supporting Horn of Africa Resilience (Share) and l'Alliance Globale pour l'Initiative Resilience Sahel (Agir). Share, launched by the commission last year with commitments of \u20ac270m, is designed to improve the opportunities of farming and pastoralist communities and the capacity of public services to respond to crises. The scheme also seeks long-term solutions for refugees and displaced people within countries and the region. Priority sectors could include livestock health and development, management of natural resources such as water, national and regional trade, nutrition and governance.</p> <p>Agir, launched in June as the Sahel crisis was taking hold, lays out a roadmap for better co-ordination of humanitarian and development aid to protect the most vulnerable people when drought hits again. It includes improvements to early warning systems and links with the insurance industry. One EU-funded project in Mali involved a cash transfer programme in the town of Madina Sacko for about 45,000 people affected by drought. The EU responded to the Sahel crisis with \u20ac123m in humanitarian funding and \u20ac372m for development programmes.</p> <p>The EU said it had already seen encouraging results from Share and Agir, linking humanitarian and development resources to boost recovery from the recent droughts: \"This is a substantial shift in mentality and practice: from distributing aid to drought-affected people in order to survive until the next drought to investing in the long-run \u2013 building irrigation systems, promoting more resistant crops, helping pastoralists manage their livestock.\"</p> <p>Share and Agir focus on food security, but the EU plans to promote resilience in other regions and for other types of shocks including floods, cyclones, earthquakes and tsunamis.</p> <p>Over the long haul, the EU emphasised the importance of governments and regions embedding resilience within their development polices. \"Resilience can only be built bottom-up,\" said the commission. \"The starting point for the EU approach to resilience, therefore, is a firm recognition of the leading role of partner countries.\"</p> <p>The commission said that in countries facing recurring crises, increasing resilience will be a central aim of EU aid, with programmes based on common assessments prepared by humanitarian and development officials. In times of unforeseen crises, the commission would seek maximum flexibility in mobilising \"non-programmed\" funds and the possible use of trust funds for emergency situations.</p> <p>\"There are more frequent and more severe shocks for communities to handle,\" said the EU. \"So our approach has to change as well. We aim to manage crises better by helping address their root causes rather than struggling with their consequences.\"</p>",
  "<p>The shock announcement that the award of the west coast mainline franchise is to be scrapped after the discovery of significant technical flaws in the franchise process, may have some unanticipated consequences for procurement.</p> <p>The legal grounds on which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/03/west-coast-rail-contract\" title=\"\">Virgin</a> launched a judicial review after the contract was awarded to FirstGroup are enshrined in EU procurement directives, which have come under much criticism in the UK for being too bureaucratic and inflexible.</p> <p>However, had the UK not had to sign up to the directives, any appeal by Virgin might have been brushed off. The remedies directive, which co-ordinates national review systems through common standards, contains the legal process for appeals, including a stand-still period whereby contracts are not awarded until 10 days after the intention to award them to a particular supplier has passed. This is to allow time for appeal, which happened in the case of Virgin.</p> <p>Had the much maligned remedies directive not been in place, any appeal would have been made after FirstGroup had been awarded the contract.</p> <p>Now an investigation will be conducted by the Department for Transport, which is likely to put the running of the West Coast line into the hands of state-owned Directly Operated Railways to ensure services are maintained.</p> <p>Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin has indicated that the contract will be re-tendered, and this will be under the auspices of updated EU procurement directives, which are due to come into force probably next year. These are expected to enable companies' past performance to be taken into account as part of the evaluation criteria, something that has hitherto restricted. If that had been one of the criteria this time round, the outcome might have been different.</p> <p>Full details of what went wrong with the tendering process will no doubt come to light. But three officials have been suspended, apparently for incorrectly calculating the risk involved in the winning bid. Virgin had branded FirstGroup's winning bid as a recipe for bankruptcy, after payments were heavily loaded towards the back end of the 13-year deal, with premiums far exceeding the bond being offered as security.</p> <p>Assumptions made about passenger numbers and inflation calculations depend both on UK economic growth and a global economy, and the ability of the franchisee to bring in new customers. The margin for error on both these factors over a contract lasting more than 10 years is enormous.</p> <p>Compare the Bank of England's track record for forecasting inflation just one year ahead. As any capable contracting person knows, this enters the realms of guesswork and slight changes in assumptions can lead to different outcomes for contracts that may be for only three or four years, let alone 13. This creates a risk that assumptions can be made that favour a particular supplier, with complicated calculations providing an alibi. However, as the NHS is discovering with PFIs, long term contracts are high risk.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lse-smcc.com/index.php/conference\" title=\"\">Professor John Kay argued</a> at LSE's strategy and management consulting conference last year that similar questionable assumptions determine the fate of proposed road schemes. So any Department for Transport review should also look at the commissioning of road schemes.</p> <p>The back-loading of payments makes good sense as a bidder as failure to make the terms of the contract by that time is less likely to result in the contract being terminated.</p> <p>The Department for Transport clearly needs a different approach to letting such contracts. Out must go meaningless assumptions and the even more meaningless calculations resulting from them. In must come a greater emphasis on capability, flexibility in an uncertain economic future and which bidder has the best and most convincing strategy.</p> <p>This abandoned tender exercise points to some deeper seated malaises in public sector contracting. Central government contracting and procurement should be independent of government departments. The current model is not fit for today's world. A truly expert contracting group must be created that would be powerful enough to challenge departmental vested interests. It would need to be overseen by the National Audit Office and government departments would be able to hold it to account. The Treasury could also commission external reviews of the organisation or of contracting for major areas of expenditure and its costs and performance would be transparent.</p> <p>Across the public sector, suppliers frequently complain to me that they do not feel fairly treated in tendering exercises. However, they will not complain because of a concern, however unlikely, that if they do so, they will be discriminated against in future tenders.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>\"Do you think anyone will show?\" I asked. </p> <p>It was 18:00 and we were at the Hub Westminster waiting to open the doors for DataKind's <a href=\"http://datakind.org/events/londondatadive/\">first international DataDive here in London</a>. The DataDive would bring together data scientists and charities for the weekend to collaborate on data problems together. We'd held events across the US with great success, but the UK brought new questions to the table \u2013 would Londoners be as willing to give up their free time as our US crowds had been? Would the rumors of London's growing data scene hold true or was the term \"data science\" too buzzy to attract the analysts and statisticians we hoped would show? Would the charities be prepared to think about data as more than just something they had to report to funders? </p> <p>Even though the doors officially opened at 19:00, our first guest arrived an hour early. \"Is this the DataDive?\" she asked. \"I just heard about it on Twitter and just had to come down and help!\" We were going to be OK.</p> <h2>DataDives</h2> <p>By midday about 70 data hackers had swarmed the Hub to use their skills wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing data to help charities tackle problems with data. At <a href=\"http://datakind.org/\">DataKind</a> (formerly Data Without Borders) we've been running \"DataDives\" across the US since last October, creating opportunities for non-profits to access pro bono data talent they normally might not be able to afford. The idea is to bring the same algorithms that drive everything from Google's search to Netflix's movie recommendations to bear on the charity sector's data. Instead of writing code to help people find good restaurants, our pro bono scientists write code to help people find clean water. These DataDives provide an outlet for data scientists to use their talents for more than just getting people to buy stuff and at the same time make non-profits more effective at using data. </p> <p>The events feature three charities that work with DataKind in advance to define questions they'd like to answer from their data. On Friday night, representatives from each organization pitch their projects to a volunteer army of data scientists, leading them into Saturday when they break into teams to tackle problems ranging from how to better allocate resources for mentoring troubled school children to analyzing aerial images to assess fertilizer efficiency in the developing world. </p> <p>The events focus heavily on collaboration: charities work alongside \"data ambassadors\" (data savvy project leads) and together they dig into the projects as a team. The events also attract a range of data professionals who, more often than not, teach each other in the process. It's not uncommon to see a programmer sitting alongside an economist, sharing coding tips and statistical tricks with one another.</p> <p>Through collaboration these events are giving data scientists a chance to have social impact, mission-driven organizations are learning skills to maximize their impact and, in the process, we're all getting to live in a better world.</p> <h2>A First Rate Third Sector</h2> <p>\"If you don't have data, you're just another person with an opinion,\" Benita Refson, Executive Director of <a href=\"https://www.place2be.org.uk/\">Place2Be</a>, told the crowd of attendees Friday night. Place2Be was one of the three charities in attendance, an organization that offers one-on-one mentoring to troubled schoolchildren. They had loads of data on demographics of the students, evaluation information, and school data that they wanted to use to answer some basic questions about which students would respond best to their services. Place2Be is already quite data savvy, as far as charities go, but they had a lot of data and not many resources to look at it. This event would give them a chance to have London's data community lend a hand.</p> <p>The other groups brought fascinating questions as well. <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/\">Oxfam GB</a> came with a database of all of their email campaigns, wondering how they could more effectively engage their constituents without bombarding them. Lastly, <a href=\"http://www.keyfund.org.uk/\">Keyfund</a>, a group that improves high schoolers' life skills by funding them to do community-building projects, came with data about each of their projects. </p> <p>After a weekend of working with data scientists on these problems, the three groups walked away with scads of graphs, analyses, and maps that they could use to assess their effectiveness. Place2Be got a preliminary report on which schools and which students reacted best to their programs (early result: hyperactive girls show some of the best improvement), Oxfam received transformed data that would allow them to analyze why people unsubscribe from their newsletter, and Keyfund learned that very little improvement was seen in high schoolers' skills between Phases 2 and 3 of their program, leading to the possible recommendation of merging the two phases to save some money. </p> <h2>What's Next</h2> <p>We always say that these weekend events start the conversation, but it's our job to see that they're finished too. One of our favorite moments from this event, like many of our events, was when both volunteers and non-profits asked \"how do we keep doing this?\" We were blown away by the enthusiasm of the London data community and are exploring ways to keep that momentum going through other events. We're also following up with the charities to transition their needs into longer term projects, perhaps supported by our long-term branch, the DataCorps, perhaps supported through other engagements. No matter what, we couldn't have been happier with the turnout, the enthusiasm, or the results.</p> <p>The private sector is not left out of this conversation, however. In fact, this event was made possible through extensive partnership with <a href=\"http://www.aimia.com/\">Aimia</a>, one of the largest customer loyalty companies. Aimia not only sponsored the event, but also provided time, effort, and amazing analysts that worked with organizations, managed the event, and helped provide support throughout the entire weekend.<br> Oh and that first DataDiver who walked in the doors? She left at 23:00 that night to go clubbing. On the train home, she had an inspiration and stayed up to see her analysis through, presenting it the next morning at the conclusion of the event. Yes, with people like that, we're going to be just fine.</p> <h2>NEW!

  "<p>Digital products (ie websites and apps) are typically viewed as being \"carbon light\" or low-impact, and, as a result, there has been little pressure for suppliers or businesses to be accountable for the emissions or environmental impacts. </p> <p>This is in particularly stark contrast to the expectations of paper sourcing and manufacture of the public, NGOs and the sector itself.</p> <p>Delivering our digital products requires energy and produces carbon dioxide emissions, so it is important for us to understand more about what drives this demand for energy and what we can do about it. </p> <p>This is in addition to the depletion of natural resources, pollution and associated ecological impacts that result from demand for the physical equipment and the sources of energy generation through out the life cycle.</p> <p>We have been working to create a digital sustainability strategy, which aims to minimise our digital footprint while also maximising accessibility and the quality of our readers' experience, improving operational resilience and supporting commercial growth.</p> <p>Guardian News and Media (GNM) recognises that there is currently very little detailed research into digital media environmental impacts. It is also not clear where the boundaries of responsibility lie. Is it the computer hardware makers, the networks, the Guardian or the consumer who logs on to our website? </p> <p>This is largely due to the complexity of how digital systems and the internet works and interconnects. To rectify this GNM has been developing its own research in partnership with Bristol and Surrey universities.</p> <p>We teamed up with Bristol-based <a href=\"http://sympact.cs.bris.ac.uk/\">Sympact</a> to focus on developing a deeper understanding of the energy use and carbon dioxide emissions that result from the delivery of our digital products, such as theguardian.com.</p> <p>As a result, this year we have published an estimated carbon footprint of the guardian website for the financial year 2010-11 in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-digital-carbon-footprint\">separate digital footprint</a> section of the report.</p> <p>We have also been working with Stephen Wood, an engineering doctorate student at the University of Surrey, who is researching whether it is possible to reduce environmental impacts at the design stage of the software product development, in addition to improving operational efficiency of data centres and the hardware. This may take the form of curating content on the website to improve navigation and user experience.</p> <p>Sympact and Wood have been collaborating as well as working with Guardian staff to better understand what digital sustainability means for GNM. This integrated approach is key because the knowledge gained by the Sympact project is essential to assessing the potential impact of software design interventions and GNM's digital teams provide us with an understanding of which interventions are practically possible.&#xa0;</p> <p>In recognition of the importance of this issue, a board-level sponsor, Tanya Cordrey, director of digital development, has been appointed to establish a leadership position in digital sustainability.</p> <p>The immediate task for GNM as the sponsor is to ensure that outstanding data and information are collected to strengthen and complete the research. Subsequent responsibilities will be to oversee the transformation of the research into practical action and the implementation of a digital sustainability strategy in support of GNM's overall sustainability and digital first vision. </p> <p>Of course, in the digital field not everything is under our direct control so we have also been assessing our impacts through the supply chain.</p> <p>Clearly, one of the biggest impacts is our reliance on a global network of data centres for delivering digital services. Not only do we need to understand how to reduce our impacts in this area, we also need to think about the implications of increased digital energy demands and how resilient the digital first model is to the possibility of energy blackouts.</p> <p>The business also needs to be aware of future operational costs, legislative requirements, and reputational risks.</p> <h2>Why act?</h2> <p>The Guardian is driven to address and reduce the environmental impacts of digital media delivery as part of its carbon positive commitment to take climate change more seriously. </p> <p>The digital sustainability strategy also gives us the opportunity to engage with our audience, showcase our openness and demonstrate how we are contributing to a more sustainable future.</p> <p>On top of this, we hope to improve the design of our digital products, cut costs and reduce our carbon footprint across the value chain.</p> <p>We also recognise the risks from inaction, including opening ourselves to criticism that we are not living our values and failing to spot and address strategic risks such as energy security.</p> <h2>Key areas of attention</h2> <p><strong>Influencing behavioural change </strong><br>Many leading companies, such as 02 and Proctor &amp; Gamble, recognise the largest carbon impacts lie not in their direct operations but from the customers' use of their products and services. </p> <p>As a result, they have been developing strategies to encourage their customers to change their behaviour. That is sometimes through the development of new products \u2013 such as washing powder that allow customers to reduce the water temperature (Ariel 30) \u2013 as well as through providing information and education. </p> <p>GNM's sustainability vision already has a commitment to \"act as an agent of change for good through inspiring readers, customers and staff to change behaviours\".</p> <p>While our main concentration has been achieving this through our editorial content, we recognise the opportunity to improve our readers' understanding of their digital environmental footprint.</p> <p>One way of doing that is to develop interactive tools and personal internet energy monitors. One app created by our university partners was tested at the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/digital-carbon-footprint\">Open Weekend</a>.</p> <p>Other opportunities lie in encouraging readers to view our content on low-power devices, such as Kindle, iPad and smartphones.</p> <p>We can also encourage good power management practice on PCs and Macs, as well as recommending that home wi-fi networks are turned off overnight.</p> <p><strong>Operational efficiency</strong><br>Perhaps the most obvious action we can take is to reduce our carbon footprint by reducing the energy of the hardware in the data centres we use \u2013 whether owned by us in our own buildings and third party locations, or even equipment owned by cloud service providers, such as Google or Akamide.</p> <p>This could be through using less kit by virtualising physical servers or storage and using only what we actually need when we need it. Another way will be to buy equipment with greater energy efficiency and also evaluate the energy sources of the data centres.</p> <p>We also plan to undertake a sustainability risk assessment of our supply chain and produce a supplier code of conduct policy. This will allow us to apply due diligence to ensure sustainability principles are addressed in contracts to minimise risks to GNM.</p> <p>For more details of the challenges we face with our digital supply chain please see the procurement section. </p> <p><strong>Product development</strong><br>There is a need to build further engagement with the internal digital teams. One idea is to run a Hack Day or some form of interactive workshop to see how we can create a framework or language for building digital sustainability thinking in mainstream software development. </p> <p>It will also be important to engage with product&#xa0;teams&#xa0;about developing sustainability principles in design. </p> <p>This work will hopefully help to inform decisions in the product process, including design, development and maintenance. </p> <h2>Actions taken to reduce operational impact 2011-12</h2> <p><strong>Digital systems architecture</strong><br>The Guardian's digital systems team runs a large data centre to serve&#xa0;our&#xa0;global audience. It uses a significant amount of power to both run and cool it, and we are committed to reducing this where possible both from an emissions and a cost perspective. </p> <p>In the financial year 2011-12, we have looked extensively at using cloud processing where possible to take advantage of available scale (size) and efficiency. This will allow us to access more server processing power when we hit peak traffic demand rather than buy new kit that will be under-utilised. </p> <p>A good example of this is the way we are serving traffic to our highly successful Facebook application. Were we to do that from our data centres, we would have had to considerably increase the number of servers to cope with the rise in traffic. Instead, our <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/\">Facebook application</a> is hosted entirely in the cloud, where capacity is allocated on demand. We believe that this has saved power, emissions and costs.</p> <p>A large proportion of&#xa0;our&#xa0;data centre equipment is now reaching the end of its life. By focusing on power consumption we have chosen suitable units with the lowest power needs and high energy efficiency.</p> <p>The shift to using cloud computing and the delivery of the new infrastructure are key objectives for the financial year 2012-13. These we believe will both lead to lower emissions and power costs while allowing us to keep pace with our digital ambitions at an affordable cost. </p> <p><strong>Office IT hardware procurement</strong><br>It's not only our online presence where we can make a difference; we also use a lot of IT equipment for our 1,600 staff, for example \u2013 desktop computers, printers, phones and office servers.</p> <p>Over the past financial year, we were able to reduce our energy use by further virtualising our servers. We're replacing about 58 of our servers with an equivalent platform of 20. This will reduce energy usage from 58kW to 20kW per hour, leading to savings of more than 300MWh per year or \u00a355,000, equivalent to 156 tonnes of CO2e.</p> <p>Other proposed plans are to reduce storage, given the proposed systems incorporate the latest innovations in power efficiency. This will decrease the server count, which should lead to savings of more than 460MWh per year, equivalent to 239 tonnes of CO2e.</p>",
  "<p>In this report, we are able for the first time to show the carbon footprint of our digital media operations. Guardian News and Media (GNM) has developed the methodology in partnership with the Sympact Project, researchers at the University of Bristol and Surrey. </p> <p>The estimated carbon footprint of providing content for www.guardian.co.uk and www.guardiannews.com, as well as for our audience to consume it, for the year 2011-12 is about 10,000 tonnes CO2e \u2013 around a third of our current overall business footprint. </p> <h2>Why</h2> <p>There is a perception that digital products (ie, websites, blogs and mobile apps) are typically viewed as being \"carbon light\" or low impact, especially compared with paper products. </p> <p>This is largely because people do not understand the complexity of the internet, given its global and opaque nature, and do not have a direct connection to the effects of their media consumption. </p> <p>We teamed up with Sympact to focus on developing a deeper understanding of the energy use and carbon dioxide emissions that result from the delivery of our digital products, such as&#xa0;guardian.co.uk. Sympact is joint-funded by the Research Councils UK Digital Economy and Energy Programmes.</p> <p>We are not doing this as a result of regulatory pressure, but to better understand the situation for ourselves and share our findings and approach with others in the industry to help stimulate debate and encourage the development of more sustainable digital products and services. </p> <h2>How it works</h2> <p>To build our stakeholders' understand it may be valuable to set out what happens when a webpage is accessed.</p> <p>As you use your laptop, tablet or smart phone, requests are sent from your device to a number of different server computers that build the components of the page, ie the template, text, pictures, video and adverts. </p> <p>These requests are transferred through your Wi-Fi modem or the 3G network via your internet service provider into the internet infrastructure or network and out to the server computers, which return the data.</p> <p>As set out in figure below, the path your request takes depends on which device you use, as this determines the access-network route into the internet infrastructure. The path through the internet network is driven by which server computers need to be accessed to provide data, which in turn is controlled by the type of request (ie video or text) and your geographical location. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397155545\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873049412/LOV2012_Ops_Digital1-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Digital1\" width=\"460\" height=\"410\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GUARDIAN GRAPHICS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, in the case of the Guardian webpage, the template and text comes from our own data centre in London. But many of the other elements, such as images, video, audio, and advertising are often stored on third-party servers (such as content delivery networks) that are physically closer to the reader around the world. </p> <h2>The Findings</h2> <p>Based on this analysis, we can provide an estimate of the global energy footprint of reading the Guardian online. The estimated carbon footprint for the year 2011-12 from our web operations is in the magnitude of 10,000 tonnes of CO2e. As an absolute value, this figure should be used with caution as there remain considerable uncertainties due to some of the estimates and assumptions that we have had to make.</p> <p>But our primary goal for doing this work was not to report for the sake of it but to learn more about where emissions occur in this system \u2013 to guide us in knowing where we should concentrate our efforts in the future. As such, the findings have been revealing if not straightforward in the conclusions that we should draw. </p> <p>More details on the methodology of the model and complexities we faced will be published shortly on our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/blog\">sustainability blog</a>.</p> <p>Energy consumed using guardian online is heavily dependent on the equipment (customer device) being used because, at about 86%, this is the largest source of emissions of our footprint. This makes controlling our emissions difficult. Indeed, the server computers, where we have most control, represent a much smaller element of the emissions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397155546\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873086718/LOV2012_Ops_Digital2-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Digital2\" width=\"460\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GUARDIAN GRAPHICS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the most significant variables are the time that users spend consuming content, the device they use to do so, and the technology they use to connect to the internet. </p> <p>For example, in the table below we compare three examples of browsing guardian online for 11 minutes (a typical visit). The first, using a laptop connected to the internet over Wi-Fi; the second via a smartphone connected over a 3G mobile network; and the third a tablet via Wi-Fi. As might be expected, the smartphone system uses less energy overall. Although the tablet still uses only half the energy of the laptop.</p> <p>But each of these scenarios would suggest that we should be prioritising very different activities if we wish to reduce the overall impact of our websites on the environment. In the laptop scenario, where user devices dominate the energy footprint, we might best focus on raising awareness through our editorial coverage. </p> <p>In a world where mobile access dominates, the networks and servers become more significant, suggesting we should be striving first to reduce the energy used by these components. Reducing the volume of data required to meet users' needs for news access would be one way of perhaps addressing this issue. This was discussed in more detail in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/digital-environment-carbon-footprint\">previous blog post</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397155547\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873113678/LOV2012_Ops_Digital3-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Digital3\" width=\"460\" height=\"450\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GUARDIAN GRAPHICS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Actions</h2> <p>Of course, analysing data is one thing, but far more important is what we then do with it.

  "<p>When, live on stage on Wednesday morning, I asked <a href=\"http://www.topright-group.com/\" title=\"\">Top Right Group</a> head honcho Duncan Painter what he felt about the digital publishing market in 2012, his answer was not quite what I was expecting. Digital publishing, argued Painter, was a term with which he held little truck.</p> <p>Despite the obvious contradiction of his comments coming at the opening session of the <a href=\"http://www.ppa.co.uk/events/digital-publishing-conference-and-awards-12/\" title=\"\">PPA Digital Publishing Conference</a>, as the day unfolded and we heard the strategies, insights and learnings from a lineup of the UK's leading figures in business and consumer publishing, it became increasingly clear what Painter was referring to.</p> <p>As we head into 2013, the publishing industry's story has really moved on. Particularly for companies such as Painter's, which operate in the business information sector, the rather tired and two-dimensional \"print versus digital\" debate has now run its course. It has been replaced with a consensus that the focus should be on the content and not on the platform \u2013 an ideological return to the fundamental premise behind the business of publishing in the first place.</p> <p>\"Digital\", with its power to fuel destabilisation and innovation in equal measure, might once have been a label for the new and unknown, but today it is an accepted underlying force within the sector. And so, if publishing today is digital, then what the heck is digital publishing? You can see Painter's point.</p> <p>For the purposes of PPA members and delegates, however, the term \"digital publishing\" is a simple and effective way of differentiating this week's event from the PPA's main annual conference held every May. Wednesday's event was therefore focused on the new skillsets, products, approaches and business models kicked into life by new channels, and how they are impacting on established businesses and startups alike.</p> <p>It is clear that this impact varies hugely across the PPA's broad membership. Companies that were previously labelled B2B publishers have gone through a fundamental transformation in recent years, which has been reflected in the creation of <a href=\"http://www.ppa.co.uk/business/\" title=\"\">PPA Business</a> \u2013 a relaunched division to meet their emerging needs. This is a profitable sector that is increasingly global, focused on information and data services, and looking at the delivery of content to mobile devices.</p> <p>Michael Dell, senior vice-president of <a href=\"http://www.ihs.com/\" title=\"\">IHS</a> and chairman of PPA Business, gave some context to the trends. He told delegates that total UK business publishing revenues last year were \u00a36bn, with the majority (51%) now coming from information and data services.</p> <p>In the consumer sphere, while print revenues still dominate overall, it is the potential for mobile content delivery that is also continuing to generate excitement. Tablets, driven by the phenomenal growth of the iPad, have given consumer publishers access to a paying audience.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.futureplc.com/\" title=\"\">Future's</a> Mike Goldsmith says this audience is happy to subscribe to a finite, edited digital edition in their thousands, while <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wired</a> publisher Rupert Turnbull reports that users are happy to spend time with advertising, particularly where the creative has been designed especially (85% of Wired app users agree) and the consumer can engage with it in some meaningful way (89% of Wired app users agree).</p> <p>The Economist, a magazine brand that manages to straddle the business and consumer worlds, has found success both on the tablet and in print. Neelay Patel, Economist Digital's vice-president of commercial strategy, gave delegates a masterclass in how the publisher has created two distinct behaviours that match how subscribers consume content from the Economist on different platforms. Lean Back 2.0, explained Patel, describes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/video/2012/apr/10/lean-back-2-0-andrew-rashbass-ceo-the-economist-group-keynote-presentation-video?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the immersive experience of print and tablet readers</a>, while Lean Forward 2.0 defines the desktop experience: more social and sharable.</p> <p>Digital channels have opened up a huge potential global audience for the Economist, says Patel, and it applies rigorous testing when investing in marketing campaigns to convert these new users into paying subscribers.</p> <p>Conversion was a topic also addressed by New Scientist's John MacFarlane, who discussed the sometimes awkward relationship between content aggregators such as Flipboard and Zite. MacFarlane cited examples of how such sources present potential on the one hand. For example, research claimed 21% of people predominantly use apps as a source of news and certain publishers, armed with a paid-content strategy, were collaborating with aggregators in an attempt to exploit this source.</p> <p>However, MacFarlane also gave warning to publishers of the potential for the aggregation sector as it matures to increasingly interrupt the relationship between publishing brands and their audiences. It is the importance and value of securing this relationship that permeated the day, filtering down through Painter's opening remarks and into the final View From The Top session featuring senior executives from Centaur, EMAP, IHS, and UBM.</p> <p>Essentially, whichever way publishing brands might interact with the communities they serve \u2013 whether as a data provider, through the delivery of content in print or digital channels, or via face-to-face events \u2013 that interaction itself is a key source of data that can be recorded, understood and used to inform and improve that relationship.</p> <p>It's certainly no surprise that Painter underlines the importance of this relationship, having joined Top Right Group and the publishing industry from <a href=\"http://www.skyiq.com/\" title=\"\">Sky IQ</a>, the customer intelligence unit of BSkyB. This focus on audience and content was not, however, completely at the exclusion of platform.</p> <p>Throughout the day there was discussion of specific issues around content delivery on topics such as HTML5 versus native apps, and other more technical issues. It is surely a signifier of the sector's growing sense of optimism, that this year's PPA Digital Publishing Conference was a lot less about shiny new digital and a lot more about good old publishing itself.</p> <p><em>Barry McIlheney is CEO of the </em><a href=\"http://www.ppa.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>PPA</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>A key conceit of Ireland's \"Celtic tiger\" boom involved reading economic growth in cultural terms. The \"boom\" was attributed not only to the genius of exceptional political leadership, but also to a fundamental shift in values among the wider population. Neoliberalism and the liberalisation of society were in harmony, and if this didn't quite signal the end of history, it marked a definitive break with a past often represented as a long dark night of conflict, emigration, and the suffocating hegemony of the Catholic church.</p> <p>As society in Ireland continues to be forced to pay for the consequences of boom-time speculation, it may well be that it is the present that is more of a foreign country. However, as the renewed public focus on the systemic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalene_asylum\" title=\"\">abuse of the Magdalene laundries</a> indicates, the conceit of a \"past\" transcended was as ideologically self-serving as the elite desire to represent the property bubble as proud proof of national arrival.</p> <p>Last week, a <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0926/magdelene-laundries-apology-motion-defeated.html\" title=\"\">Sinn F\u00e9in private members motion in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann</a> urged the government to issue a long-overdue apology to the survivors of the Magdalene laundries, an act that would <a href=\"http://www.magdalenelaundries.com/name.htm\" title=\"\">allow them to draw pensions and access a reparations scheme</a>. The government argued that it was obliged to wait until the end of the year for the final report of the inter-departmental committee investigating state involvement with the laundry system, and the motion was defeated.</p> <p>In reacting to what was widely regarded as another stalling tactic \u2013 by a state that has cynically sought to extract itself from responsibility for these \"private institutions\" \u2013 the survivor advocacy group <a href=\"http://www.magdalenelaundries.com/press_releases.htm#250912\" title=\"\">Justice for Magdalenes</a> noted the injustice of needlessly prolonging the wait of a diminishing group of elderly women. They are entitled not only to restitution for their incarceration in a brutal system, but recompense for their labour, having been exploited and enslaved in washing the clothes of a society where they were hidden in plain sight.</p> <p>The implacable callousness of the state has at least served to refocus attention on the nature and scale of the unlawful imprisonment imposed on \"deviant\" populations. <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/magdalene-laundry-true-story-margaret-bullen-samantha-long-614350-Sep2012/\" title=\"\">The Journal.ie</a> published an account by Samantha Long of a meeting with her mother Margaret Bullen, who, when she met her at the age of 42, \"looked like a pensioner\". Sent to Gloucester St Magdalene Laundry at the age of 16, she died 35 years later, after a life deemed worthy of little else than hard labour and abuse. In The Irish Times, <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0925/1224324359767.html\" title=\"\">Fintan O'Toole</a> drew on <a href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/coerciveconfinementinpostindependenceireland/EoinOSullivan\" title=\"\">Eoin O'Sullivan and Ian O'Donnell's book Coercive Containment in Ireland</a> to place the laundries in the context of a highly organised \"shadow system of confinement\" that also encompassed industrial schools, psychiatric hospitals and \"mother and baby homes\", and where \"at any given time between 1926 and 1951 \u2026 1% of the entire population\" was incarcerated.</p> <p>Given the acute testimonies of suffering and the sheer scale of the systemic abuse, public debate has sought parallels and allusions in other histories. The <a href=\"http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/11857/2012-39/O%E2%80%99Brien-calls-for-immediate-Magdalene-survivors-apology\" title=\"\">Labour TD Michael McCarthy</a> described the Magdalene laundries as \"our own Holocaust\". With far less exaggeration and more analytical precision, O'Toole described it as an \"Irish gulag system\".</p> <p>Historical resonances are important, but there is a danger in replicating the stark division of Irish history into a benighted Catholic past and a better, liberal present. Ireland continues to produce and confine \"problematic\" populations, only now it is not \"fallen women\" and the problematic working class locked up by a patriarchal church and state, but the <a href=\"http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745631653\" title=\"\">\"human waste\"</a> of a fragile global economy, migrants locked up by states committed to stemming human mobility while tapping the mobility of capital.</p> <p>At present, approximately 6,000 people live in <a href=\"http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/asylum_seekers_and_refugees/services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/direct_provision.html\" title=\"\">direct provision accommodation centres</a> in Ireland while their asylum claims are processed. Originally introduced as an \"emergency measure\" in 1999 to speed up asylum determination procedures, over a third have been in this system for more than three years, and waits of seven or eight years are not unheard of. Unable to access education, employment or frequently even to cook for themselves, asylum-seekers are accommodated and fed, and granted an adult weekly allowance of \u20ac19.10 (rates that have not changed in real terms since their introduction over a decade ago). For this other population, also corralled and controlled outside of society, it is unsurprising that anxiety, depression and ill health are widespread.</p> <p>No comparison should obscure the particular forms of violence and suffering that mark different experiences. But the parallels are politically important. Ill health scarred the lives of children in industrial schools \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/learning/report-state-sanctioned-child-poverty-and-exclusion\" title=\"\">a recent report</a> has documented the appalling conditions and health problems of the children of asylum seekers, who constitute one-third of the population of the direct provision system. According to O'Toole, thousands of people died each decade in the neglectful conditions of psychiatric hospitals \u2013 in September Emmanuel Marcel Landa became the latest person to die in the direct provision system, and <a href=\"http://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/news/congolese-asylum-seeker-dies-in-accommodation-centre/1415\" title=\"\">as Sue Conlon of the Irish Refugee Council noted</a>, \"the impact of long delays, lengthy residence in direct provision accommodation and the real threat of deportation may well have been a contributory factor in Mr Landa's untimely death\". The forced separation of the wrong type of families mocked the Catholic emphasis on the sanctity of the family \u2013 today a hugely costly and ineffective deportation system separates families, and <a href=\"http://www.irishleftreview.org/2012/10/02/antideportation-ireland-launches-campaign-direct-provision-deportation/\" title=\"\">deports children born in Ireland to \"home countries\" they have never been to</a>.</p> <p>It is an easy argument that \"we must look after our own\", especially in an acute recession. However, the history of the \"Irish gulag\" illustrates the thinness of any such national fiction. Further, the system of direct provision, introduced during the \"boom times\", must be <a href=\"http://plutopress.wordpress.com/tag/alexandra-hall/\" title=\"\">understood primarily as a politicised system of deterrence and control</a>. It is this systemic violence that unites the wasted lives of the \"immoral\" and \"deviant\" subjects of the past, and the \"bogus\" and \"undeserving\" of the present.</p> <p>In one of her last pieces on a system she did so much to investigate, the late Mary Raftery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/irealnd-magdalene-laundries-scandal-un?fb=native&amp;CMP=FBCNETTXT9038\" title=\"\">noted that \"Irish society was deeply complicit in the incarceration of women and girls in the laundries\"</a>. There are <a href=\"http://www.swp.ie/content/hundreds-march-galway-save-asylum-centre\" title=\"\">faint but hopeful signs</a> that contemporary Irish society may recognise its complicity in the abuse of asylum-seekers, and organise to <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1002/breaking35.html\" title=\"\">support</a> and <a href=\"http://antideportationireland.blogspot.fi/\" title=\"\">defend</a> them.</p>",
  "<p>I've been asked what the point of national polls is. The question was posed because, with the electoral college system, this election is going to be decided in the swing states. Indeed, most voters have pretty much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/oct/election-2012-vote-makes-difference#custom/a0/s0/r0/e0/l0\">no chance at casting the decisive vote</a>.</p> <p>But here are five reasons why I believe national polls are and should remain an important part of any election coverage.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>1). National polls can tell us what the real issues are</strong></p> <p>You know with the back-and-forth of the horse race coverage, it's sometimes hard to forget that elections are ultimately about issues. After the election occurs, politicians are going to have to go to Washington and try to solve the problems facing this country.</p> <p>Politicians should know what Americans' positions on healthcare, medicare, economic stimulus, the environment, etc are. We often elect individuals for many different reasons than they think. Few would think that we elected President Obama in 2008 because the majority agreed with <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2012/01/70-of-american-voters-disagree-with-obama-favor-increased-access-to-oil-and-gas-resources/\">all of his position stances</a>. Likewise, it's difficult to believe that Republicans took the House in 2010 because Americans were upset with President Obama's <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/court.htm\">supreme court picks</a>. </p> <p>Without polls on issues with the national electorate, politicians could make all sorts of claims and <a href=\"http://www.publicopinionpros.norc.org/features/2007/jan/lavrakas_printable.asp\">there couldn't be any factual repudiation</a>. Now, politicians may still make inaccurate statements with regard to what elections mean, but at least we have the numbers to know they are overstepping their mandate.</p> <p><strong>2). People in the non-swing states matter, too</strong></p> <p>We may have an electoral college, but that doesn't mean voters in non-swing states don't matter. The only reason safe blue and red states aren't \"important\" is because their outcomes are decided. Another way to look at it, however, is that these non-swing states are actually the vast majority of the country. Yes, Ohio is important in this election, but politicians shouldn't kowtow to their interests only. Presidents are the leader of all the United States, not just the chosen 10 or so swing states.</p> <p><strong>3). The swing states may not <em>be</em> the swing states</strong></p> <p>It's silly to think that the states that were <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/05/18/romney_faces_a_blue_wall_--_but_is_it_solid.html\">swing states last time around will be the same this time</a>. Especially early in the campaign, national polls probably tell a better story of where the electorate is. Had we just relied on the old idea that Missouri was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_bellwether\">ultimate bellwether</a>, as it once was, we would have thought that John McCain was in good position in 2008. This year, we believe Ohio is the ultimate swing state, but perhaps it won't be, given President Obama's <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-ohio-president-romney-vs-obama\">solid lead there</a>.</p> <p><strong>4). National polls are <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/2010-06-17-silver-election-error.png\">usually more accurate than state surveys</a></strong></p> <p>Does anyone <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/obama-leading-romney-9-fla-no-way\">really believe</a> that Mitt Romney is down by anywhere close to 10 points in Florida, as Quinnipiac found? There are so many national polls that outliers don't move polling averages as much, making them more accurate and reliable.</p> <p>The national polls are also often conducted by better firms than the statewide polling is. Anyone ever heard of Gravis Marketing, before 2012? I hadn't. I don't mean to pick on Gravis (although they have had a huge Republican <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-jackman/skewed-polls-nonsense_b_1923107.html?utm_hp_ref=@pollster\">house effect</a>), but they are typical of many state pollsters. They tend to have small sampling periods, don't call cellphones, and just don't have a track record of any kind. I know when I read a national poll from ABC/Washington Post or NBC/Wall Street Journal that I'm getting quality data from tested sources.</p> <p>That's not to say that we should dismiss state polling. In fact, I spend most of my days looking at state data. It does seem that President Obama <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/24/1135190/-Daily-Kos-Elections-Polling-Wrap-Republicans-cling-to-national-polls-must-ignore-awful-state-polls\">may be doing better</a> in the swing states than the national numbers indicate. Still, national polling can provide a nice check on whether state numbers are out-of-whack.</p> <p><strong>5). The chance that the winner of the popular vote differs from the state vote is just not large</strong></p> <p>It should be recognized that a national poll is pretty representative of the swing states at large. In any given election, there's only a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/23/chances-bush-gore-tie-2012\">3-5% chance</a> that the electoral college winner will differ from the national vote winner. That chance is pretty much zero if the national polls continue to show Obama leading Romney by 3-4 percentage points. Even if the national margin were to shrink to 1 percentage point, the chance that the electoral college winner would be different is only 25%.</p> <p>Even if we did get inside a 1-point national vote, it's not particularly clear that swing state polls would provide much clarity. We would know what states would provide the winning margin. Yet, polling margin of errors are large enough that once we get this close, we really wouldn't have that much of a better idea about who would win. Remember in 2000 when <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:If7pIAfUT34J:www.columbia.edu/~ks20/Erik-sig-web-battleground.pdf+2000+gore+electoral+college&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShrPVkfKplN7GyN8PAUisANl8Lf5OL3dZjUBcGMciRDY3bBLrd8Y6EtOJ7VF1wyTt7PWCdkpnLjkZCrJtUyFag3Mv1pgWJKhw8_QjORr9qyw44OMo7b6tRhNl3rSQPum0YCZ2AU&amp;sig=AHIEtbQjYY9WmOTe-JQ3ewhI9gX0WbmO0Q\">many thought</a> Al Gore would lose the popular vote and win the electoral college, but the opposite happened?</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>National polls are an important complement to state data. They don't tell the whole story, but they give us a lot of important information regarding both where the electorate is and why it is where it is.</p>",
  "<p>There is growing dissatisfaction with the technical and technocratic emphasis in innovation, as progress doesn't seem to have been made in fixing some of society's most severe problems.</p> <p>Attention is now growing around people-centred innovation, which creates a participatory, practice-based process to find sustainable new strategies for a socially and sustainable future.</p> <p>This approach has been given impetus by a paper from the European Union's thinktank <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/bepa/pdf/publications_pdf/social_innovation.pdf\" title=\"\">Empowering people, driving change \u2013 social innovation in the European Union</a>, which said \"the long-held belief that economic growth creates employment and wealth that goes on to alleviate poverty has been disproved by recent events, and the time has now come to try new ways of bringing people out of poverty and promoting growth and well-being not only for, but also with citizens\".</p> <p>As a result, the European Commission is looking wider than the usual suspects of governments and traditional institutions, to solve problems and is reaching out to work with social entrepreneurs, designers, active citizens and other change makers. This is quite a daunting task because these unusual suspects are often far from Brussels and not very interested in EU policies.</p> <p>Moreover, social innovation is by nature experimental, cross cutting, collaborative and dispersed. Social innovators are comfortable working with uncertainty, without blueprints, roadmaps or clear-cut business plans. Not a great fit with the bureaucratic culture of the EC which is risk averse, focused on financial control and keen on projected outputs. Two distinct worlds, that do not mingle well.</p> <p>It means that social Innovation requires innovation in the social model of the EU itself.</p> <p>An interesting encounter between these two distinct worlds was set up in Naples in 2011. The <a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/\" title=\"\">Euclid Network</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.unicreditfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">UniCredit Foundation</a> ran an international social innovation competition called Naples 2.0 to mobilise global brainpower to provide concrete solutions to social challenges identified by the citizens of Naples.</p> <p>Why Naples you might wonder? A city of beauty and squalor, of failing government and organized crime. But Naples has a long tradition of citizens taking things in their own hands and coming up with creative solutions when none seem possible. Why a competition? Because no one or no idea is ruled in or out and the prize rewards creativity.</p> <p>Seven prize winners received help to develop their business plans, one is on track for \u20ac150,000 of funding for a local catering business. Naples 2.0 was the first competition of its kind and was followed with interest by the EC. The key was to engage local people in issues that were difficult to solve. It demanded that everyone \u2013 organisers, funders and innovators \u2013 had to be willing to invest time and money without knowing the outcome. Ultimately this is social innovation.</p> <p>Building on this experience, EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is launching the commission's first social innovation competition on 1 October, in co-operation with <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Nesta</a> and Euclid, and in memory of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Vasconcelos\" title=\"\">Diogo Vasconcelos</a> \u2013 the fighter for social innovation who spent his career trying to bridge the gap between citizens and the political system, who tragically died last year.</p> <p>The competition is geared to creating a strong platform for social innovators across Europe. A courageous experiment to unlock the enormous potential; the passion and the power of the people.</p> <p>But, can a competition bridge the gap between citizens and politics? Competitions are cost-effective, create a level playing field so anyone can come up with an extraordinary solution to a challenge or problem. Whether this is the perfect instrument for traditional institutions to foster and stimulate social innovation is too early to say. But it is an attempt to shift the focus to the people, to grass roots initiatives and to what works in daily life.</p> <p>Euclid Network will bring experience and ideas to the new competition in the coming months to see if we can identify successful local initiatives and also create a learning network where ideas can flourish \u2013 to foster a fertile ecosystem for social innovation.</p> <p>Enthusiasm for social innovation does not exempt the EC from innovation in its own practices and policy making. There is a real need to bring more dynamic processes into play and focus on creating valuable outcomes for the people of Europe which are far more than bean counting or balancing the books.</p> <p>An important step is to realise that focusing on actively engaging people, and not just on economic growth, is the route to a socially sustainable future. From this can come a better functioning EU and a more democratic and liveable society.

  "<h2>Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics </h2> <p>September's CIPS/Markit report on services was consistent with the message from the other activity surveys released earlier in the week, namely of an economy that is struggling to grow. While some softening in activity in September was always possible given a temporary boost from the Olympics in August, the big picture is that the business surveys remain at fairly weak levels.</p> <p>While the headline balance remained above the 50-mark, other indicators of the health of the services sector were gloomier. The services employment balance fell below 50 for the first time since November 2011. Meanwhile, the gap between input costs and output prices widened to its highest level since February, suggesting that firms' margins are coming under increasing pressure.</p> <p>Admittedly, activity in September was supported by an increase in the volume of incoming new business, which rose to its highest level since May. But while September's report showed business expectations for the remainder of the year ticked up slightly, they still remain low by past standards. The prospects for a rapid resurgence in the services sector are still looking slim.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit</h2> <p>The PMI data suggests that any buoyancy of GDP data should not be taken as a sign of economic recovery. Instead, the PMI surveys provide an insight into the underlying trend of the economy, and \u2013 like the BCC survey \u2013 warn of a slowing to near stagnation in the third quarter.</p> <p>The all-sector PMI employment index sank to a 10-month low of 48.5 in September, signalling one of the worst months for private sector employment since 2009.</p> <p>Hopes are therefore pinned on the recent upturn in new orders being sufficiently robust and sustained to bring about stronger growth of business activity and renewed hiring in coming months. New orders across all sectors grew at the fastest rate since May, improving in both manufacturing and services, though it is too early to say if this simply reflects a revival after an Olympics-related lull, as indicated by many companies.</p> <h2>John Zhu, economist at HSBC</h2> <p>Post-Olympics, the service sector seems to have seen a welcome rebound in new and outstanding business. However, margins are still being squeezed and this may have caused a reduction in staff levels, though it should be noted that employment balances had looked slightly high relative to the level of activity for several months.</p> <p>Still, the services activity index remains above 50 and therefore in expansionary territory, in contrast to the downward revisions to German and French services PMIs. The recent PMIs therefore provide further evidence to support our view that underlying UK growth will be sluggish but at least positive in Q3. We think headline growth will rebound strongly in Q3, given the reversal of the Jubilee effect. However, growth is likely to slip back again in Q4 to a low positive number as the UK resumes its painfully slow recovery.</p> <h2>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>Despite the overall softening in services, manufacturing and construction activity suffered in September, it remains highly likely that the Bank of England will keep all aspects of monetary policy unchanged at the conclusion of the October meeting of the monetary policy committee on Thursday. With the Funding for Lending scheme still in its early stages, July's extension to quantitative easing due to run through to early November, and the economy seemingly seeing modest underlying growth, there seems little compelling need for the MPC to pull the stimulus trigger again as soon as Thursday.</p> <p>However, the September purchasing managers' surveys indicate that the economy is still struggling to develop sustainable growth, so the Bank of England seems likely to give it a further helping hand before the end of the year.</p> <p>Specifically, we expect the Bank of England to announce a further \u00a350b of QE in November. However, we remain sceptical that the Bank will take interest rates down to 0.25%, given ongoing serious doubts within the MPC that such a move would have a net overall beneficial impact.</p> <h2>Colin Edwards, economist at CEBR </h2> <p>The services sector has now remained above 50 for the previous 21 months, and has averaged an encouraging 52.3 for the three months that make up the third quarter.</p> <p>September's expansion in activity was supported by a continued increase in new orders, while business expectations, which relate to the sectors views on output in 12 months' time, have also seen continued improvements since May. However, downside risks to the sector remain. Employment on the index fell for the first time this year, while cost pressures from other inputs such as fuel, food and energy are also concerns for businesses operating in the services sector.</p> <p>The services sector seems to be recovering from the 0.1% contraction recorded in Q2. However, given weaknesses elsewhere in the economy, as evidenced by figures from the manufacturing sector, a robust return to growth for the UK as a whole seems out of reach at present.</p> <h2>Nawaz Ali, UK market analyst for Western Union Business Solutions</h2> <p>The British pound is hanging on to key support levels near 1.61 against the US dollar after growth in Britain's crucial services sector slowed more sharply than expected last month.</p> <p>UK businesses are cutting jobs in anticipation of a weakening eurozone economy and Spanish debt troubles. These macro-economic factors mean that Britain may battle against recession until 2013.</p> <p>Traders managing sterling positions will be very worried since PMI readings this week do not bode well for third-quarter UK growth statistics due out on 25 October. The question now is: do they risk waiting a few weeks, or should they start cutting ties with the British pound now? If third-quarter GDP misses the growth mark again, the Bank of England could respond with more QE at its November meeting.</p>",
  "<p>Roberto Mancini was relieved to see Manchester City win at Fulham at the weekend, because he did not wish to face Borussia Dortmund, the Bundesliga champions, on the back of a run of disappointing draws. \"It was important to get back to winning, with such a big game coming up,\" the Manchester City manager said.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson probably feels the same way about Manchester United's hard-won, if not exactly commanding, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/02/champions-league-cfr-cluj-manchester-united\" title=\"\">victory against CFR Cluj</a>. Some of the United defending was lacklustre and their usual approach of utilising the width of the pitch was abandoned in favour of a narrow attacking setup that relied on Wayne Rooney passing through the middle of the Romanian defence, but once Robin van Persie responded neatly to one of the best of Rooney's invitations the points were secured and Ferguson's players could begin to put the home defeat by Tottenham behind them.</p> <p>It is important, as Mancini might say, that they do that, because the next game in the Premier League is Newcastle United away. Often a tricky fixture for Manchester United over the years \u2013 for some reason <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQVOdgM8BdE\" title=\"\">Roy Keane taking a swing at Alan Shearer and missing by a mile</a> comes to mind before any actual results \u2013 last year's meeting at St James' Park, or the Sports Direct Arena, as it had just started to be known, produced a surprising and highly significant 3-0 victory for the home side.</p> <p>Surprising, because Manchester United (apologies for using their Sunday name all the time, but Newcastle supporters rightly complain if the abbreviation United is assumed to refer only to the team in red) had just been beaten at home by Blackburn Rovers, of all teams, and some sort of backlash was expected on Tyneside. None came and, in the context of a league title won on goal difference with the last kick of the season, Manchester United squandering six points in two games at the turn of the year was as significant as any later twists and turns.</p> <p>The result was hugely significant for Newcastle, too, as it confirmed to all the potential of the side Alan Pardew was assembling. As a team promoted only the season before, Newcastle were not thought likely to continue their early-season flirtation with the top four and had dropped to seventh by the time Manchester United arrived, but their convincing win over the defending champions and the timely arrival of Papiss Ciss\u00e9 in January turned them into genuine Champions League contenders over the second part of the season.</p> <p>Ferguson's response to defeat in the north-east was to blame \"strong winds\" \u2013 whatever you think about the preposterousness of some of Fergie's excuses you have to admire the fact he always has one to hand, and a deadpan way of delivering it \u2013 and to hasten the rehabilitation of Paul Scholes. The midfielder officially reversed his decision to retire four days later though clearly he would have been preparing for a return for some time before that and, while he proved in the second half of the season that he had plenty of life left in him and had probably stepped down too early, it still came as a surprise \u2013 well, it surprised this correspondent \u2013 that several football writers were prepared to vote for him as player of the year. Everyone likes a fairytale, but over the course of the season Scholes had simply not been that influential. Even had Manchester United won the title, and they came extremely close, it would have been a sentimental award.</p> <p>Scholes is still around and getting games, even though Ferguson has two younger players, Rooney and Shinji Kagawa, who can do more or less the same thing if required. That is, spread the ball out wide, on days when wingers such as Antonio Valencia, Nani or Ashley Young are available, or look up from midfield to see if a telling pass forward may be an option. Kagawa appeared to be the ideal solution to most of Ferguson's attacking wishes when he arrived at the start of the season, yet he was left on the bench against Cluj, Scholes was left at home and Rooney was withdrawn to midfield. You could not say the formation did not work, though you could not say either that Manchester United looked like a team capable of dominating some of the bigger names in Europe later in the competition.</p> <p>Maybe they were just warming up, or maybe Ferguson was conserving energy and players for bigger tests ahead, such as the one at Newcastle this Sunday. In which case he will be more worried about his defence than his attack, with the increasingly uncertain Patrice Evra likely to be given a thorough examination by Hatem Ben Arfa, and Manchester United's perennially patched-up central defence almost certain to find Ciss\u00e9 and Demba Ba a handful.</p> <p>The game at Newcastle last season came almost exactly at the halfway stage. This time it is earlier, but a second consecutive league defeat for Manchester United could still have the same effect, of suggesting Ferguson's players are back in the realms of mere mortals and can no longer boast the almost magical ability to turn round any result or seemingly lost cause through sheer force of personality. Most Premier League clubs can suffer back-to-back defeats without their raison d'\u00eatre being questioned, but Manchester United are not most clubs. The drawback of constructing a myth of invincibility and indefatigability so successfully that opponents have frequently bowed to the myth instead of taking on the football team is that you have to try to keep it up for ever, because people notice when the mask slips.</p> <p>On the basis of Manchester United's past two performances, the mask is in danger of slipping, and Ferguson could have asked for a better time to play Newcastle away. That said, Newcastle could have picked a better time to play Manchester United than four days after a Europa League game against Bordeaux. Not for the first time, a pesky Thursday night game in Europe's lesser competition could complicate everyone's calculations. Should Pardew pick his strongest team against Bordeaux, or save it for Manchester United? Were he to field a weakened team, would a poor result in the Europa League set the wrong tone for the league match on Sunday? It's a tricky one and Ferguson will at least be pleased he got his European business out of the way on Tuesday, and collected three points. Over to you, Mr Pardew.</p>",
  "<p>The floating ice cap of the Arctic has been shrinking at an alarming rate for several years, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">this year's melt was truly remarkable</a>. The area of the Arctic Ocean covered in ice in the summer is now just half the size it was when satellite monitoring began three decades ago, with scientists now radically changing their predictions for when the entire ocean will be open water.</p> <p>It's refreshing to see that oil industry players, both current and former, have formed an unlikely chorus of collective opinion and are saying that drilling in the Arctic is a bad idea. An analysis of the combination of the cost and the risk of Arctic drilling is leading to the emergence of a new conventional wisdom. If corporate social responsibility (CSR) is to mean anything more than mere branding then there is a line beyond which the oil companies cannot go, and it is a line in the ice.</p> <p>When we launched the <a href=\"http://www.savethearctic.org/\" title=\"\">Save the Arctic</a> campaign at Rio+20, I shared the platform with Sir Richard Branson, who spoke eloquently on the urgent need to transition away from carbon fuels. Puma chairman, Jochen Zeitz, was one of the first to sign the <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/together-we-can-save-arctic-20120621\" title=\"\">Greenpeace Arctic scroll</a> that will next year be planted on the seabed 4km beneath the pole. Nick Butler, the former head of BP's expro division and Lord Browne's one-time right-hand man, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/nick-butler/2012/09/19/shells-risky-play-in-the-arctic/?Authorised=false#axzz28EacuFlY\" title=\"\">wrote in the Financial Times</a> that the setbacks Shell has suffered in the Arctic should cause it to pull out.</p> <p>\"To abandon the Arctic project would not be an admission of technical failure, nor an act of submission to the environmentalists. It would be a statement of commercial common sense,\" Butler writes.</p> <p>Also <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewhulbert/2012/09/18/has-unconventional-production-peaked/\" title=\"\">writing about Shell's Arctic venture</a>, Forbes magazine commentator Matthew Hulbert, said: \"There will be another 'Macondo moment' at some stage from unconventional plays. It's just a matter of where, when, and who.\" Macondo, of course, was the blowout that nearly crashed BP.</p> <p>Lloyd's of London warned companies not to \"rush in [but instead to] step back and think carefully about the consequences of that action.\" The German bank WestLB announced it would not provide financing to any offshore oil or gas drilling in the region because the \"risks and costs are simply too high.\" Then last week Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of oil giant Total, made an extraordinary intervention, warning the oil majors that Arctic drilling was bad business. \"Oil on Greenland would be a disaster,\" he said. \"A leak would do too much damage to the image of the company.\"</p> <p>Shell - the company leading the charge into the Arctic - may soon regret not reaching the same conclusions as its peers. It leaves the Alaskan coast this year having made a multi-billion dollar investment that resulted in the drilling of not a single well, after key parts of the company's infrastructure failed to secure safety permits and the unpredictable ice patterns further disrupted their plans. And in return for its investment the company suffered significant brand damage. It is a catastrophic reputational defeat for the company that invented CSR.</p> <p>I've long thought that <a href=\"http://www.nsidc.org\" title=\"\">www.nsidc.org</a> is perhaps the Internet's most insightful website when it comes to climate change. The Colorado-based National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) monitors the size of the cap of Arctic sea ice at the top of the world and publishes a daily updated graph on its site. On the day NSIDC announced a new record sea ice minimum, <a href=\"http://www.350.org/\" title=\"\">350.org</a> founder Bill McKibben was with me in New York, where we held a coordinated international response to the Polar crisis. This is what Bill said: \"There's no place on Earth where we see the essential irony of our moment playing out more perfectly than in the Arctic. Our response has not been alarm, or panic, or a sense of emergency. It has been: 'Let's go up there and drill for oil'. There is no more perfect indictment of our failure to get to grips with the greatest problem we've ever faced.\"</p> <p>Bill recently wrote an extraordinary piece in Rolling Stone magazine entitled <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\" title=\"\">Global Warming's Terrifying New Math</a> in which he accounted for all the buried carbon that we need to keep in the ground if we're to safeguard our civilisation. His calculations, which included Arctic oil, were compelling. Thankfully a similar calculation is being made about the risks \u2013 economic and otherwise \u2014 of drilling in the Arctic. It's what we call the 'business case'. A growing number of industry figures are now standing with Bill and with Greenpeace and the nearly two million people who have already joined our Save the Arctic campaign.</p> <p>There is the now the potential for the birth of a uniquely diverse coalition of civil society groups, industry figures and energy economists all opposed to Arctic drilling. As the winter ice reforms and Shell retreats, we all need to work to ensure this new movement is ready to fight and win when next year the summer melt begins again and the reckless wing of the oil industry once more moves north.</p> <p><em>Kumi Naidoo is the executive director of </em><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/\" title=\"\"><em>Greenpeace International</em></a><em>.

  "<p>It is well worth listening to the BBC Radio Four documentary on the legal action being brought by the group of eight women.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/fileon4\" title=\"\">File on Four documentary</a> interviewed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/16/lovers-undercover-officers-sue-police\" title=\"\">some of the women</a> who say they were tricked into forming <a href=\"http://policespiesoutoflives.org.uk/?page_id=23\" title=\"\">long-term relationships with undercover </a>policemen.</p> <p>One thing which comes across again is the level of intrusion into the lives of the women.</p> <p>For example, one woman, called Lily in the documentary, had a two-year relationship with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/mark-kennedy\" title=\"\">Mark Kennedy</a>, who infiltrated <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/10/mark-kennedy-undercover-cop-activist\" title=\"\">the environmental movement for seven years</a>.</p> <p>She describes how Kennedy, then pretending to be \"Mark Stone\", moved in with her and a group of her friends and became involved in \"pretty much every aspect of my life\".</p> <p>He was at her grandmother's 90th birthday where he seemed very \"comfortable\".</p> <p>Lily's mother said :\"He seemed absolutely devoted to my daughter.

  "<p>The fallout between Kevin Pietersen, his principal employers and his England team-mates has been going on for so long, and so escalated has become the level of mutual contempt, that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/03/kevin-pietersen-england-team-ecb\" title=\"\">rather than an agreement having been reached</a>, it appears more like an armistice, with direct hostilities halted but reparations to be made.</p> <p>The reinstatement of a world-class cricketer is, all things considered \u2013 and they need to be \u2013 a good thing, but to suggest that he will be welcomed back might be stretching things a little too far at this stage. Rather than the end of the saga, the signing of a new central contract is only the beginning. The first four months of the contract are probationary.</p> <p>Somewhere along the line, the nature of the dispute has become twisted, so that by the end of the season, Pietersen was being portrayed in some quarters as a wronged party on a personal crusade against vengeful employers and bullying team members.</p> <p>The England team management, specifically Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss, has been characterised as weak and unprofessional, unable to handle an \"awkward\" character, and the administrators as incompetent. All of which is nonsense, for if there have been faults on that side \u2013 and Flower admits that some things might have been handled differently \u2013 then they fall well short of those exhibited by Pietersen.</p> <p>It might be worth remembering the chronology of this. For three years, the supposedly incompetent management team had actually handled Pietersen and his ego, not to mention others that inhabited the dressing room, very well. It is what made them the success they have been. Then in May, Pietersen announced to Flower, without discussion or equivocation, that he had retired from one-day cricket but that he intended to continue playing Test matches and T20 internationals, although he wanted a say in which ones he actually did play in.</p> <p>It was pointed out to him that, under a clause in the contract he had signed \u2013 one inserted precisely to prevent the sort of situation that Pietersen was creating \u2013 he could not retire from one form of limited-overs cricket without doing so from the other. It was simply non-negotiable: an exception for Pietersen meant an exception for anyone else who wanted it, and the ECB, wishing to preserve the integrity of 50-over international cricket and its desire to compete strongly in the 2015 World Cup, is not prepared to do that.</p> <p>Pietersen played Test cricket during the summer, culminating in his memorable Headingley innings, in the aftermath of which he gave a series of unfathomably dumb self-serving interviews which so angered Strauss, who, waiting in the wings, overheard one of them, that he felt unable to participate in a joint press conference.</p> <p>It was around this time that the parody Twitter account in his name, which Pietersen appeared first to see as a bit of fun, started to become an issue, with him suspecting it to be fuelled by malicious team members. Such a connection was denied although circumstantially he may have had grounds for thinking otherwise.</p> <p>The final breakdown, though, came with the revelation (instigated by the South Africans, who throughout the series, to their own end and his discomfit, played beautifully Pietersen's disaffection with the team) that he had been sending to some opposition players BlackBerry messages unflattering to Strauss and the team. He is now said to be at loggerheads with the South Africans. As part of his reintegration into the England team, however, the ECB has accepted Pietersen's assurance that BlackBerry messages were provocative rather than derogatory.</p> <p>At the time, the repercussions with England were swift. He was dropped from the side for the final Test of the summer at Lord's, but prior to the announcement, having been specifically asked by ECB, who knew of his intention, not to do so at that stage, he released a video on YouTube in which he announced that he was, after all, available for England in all forms of the game.</p> <p>By that time, matters had gone too far simply to take him at his word, so erratic had been his decision making. Since then he has scored runs for Surrey, and, while continuous talks have been progressing, has enjoyed a lucrative stint as a commentator on the World T20 for ESPN Star for which he is understood to have received a truly staggering $2m (\u00a31.24m), a complicated deal tied up with image rights in India.</p> <p>Such information is mostly pretty well documented, pieced together not from a leaky ECB as many would like to think (it is an incredibly anal organisation in this regard) but from responses to legitimate questions that anyone might be expected to ask.</p> <p>It was only during the past fortnight, though, that, as a result of a lengthy conversation with someone very closely connected to it all \u2013 neither an ECB employee or administrator it should be said \u2013 I discovered the true depth of the rancour created by Pietersen.</p> <p>During the 2011 season I was asked by Flower to present a cap to a debutant, and, to extrapolate from the address I gave the team, I reminded them that playing cricket for England was neither a meal ticket nor a sinecure, but a privilege. It seems prescient now.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it is the former that they detect in Pietersen's motives. And it is how they see the motive behind his YouTube mea-a-bit-culpa U-turn. Pietersen, they believe, does not so much want to play for England as needs to, for his legacy in the game, which would come not from the Indian Premier League or international one-day cricket, but Test matches, for his profile and hence for his commercial interests \u2013 for Pietersen does nothing without a commercial imperative.</p> <p>He has very lucrative personal endorsements which would surely depend on his profile internationally rather than just in domestic T20 tournaments. Perhaps too there was the realisation that those image rights in India, which with everything else may make him the highest earning cricketer outside that country, could only be enhanced significantly by, successively, a global tournament in Asia, a Test tour of India and an ODI tour there as well.</p> <p>And overshadowing it all, there is the belief that he regards the IPL not as a bonus, but as a primary income stream to be serviced through the England cricket team.</p> <p>It is in this climate that Flower now has the onerous task of somehow rehabilitating Pietersen into the group. The level of mistrust is so great that it will be one of his biggest challenges yet, for there are plenty who, for all he brings to the side in playing terms, would rather not see him in the dressing room again. To repair relations, Pietersen will make trips back to England from South Africa, where he is due to play for the Delhi Daredevils in the Champions League, and will meet with other senior England players.</p> <p>There is some growing up to do on both sides. We know that lawyers have been involved, to try to get round supposed threats of taking million-pound action for unfair dismissal and breach of contract should he not gain a new contract. According to Alexander Milner-Smith, employment associate in the Sports Group at Lewis Silkin LLP, such a move would have been \"both extremely unlikely and fundamentally lacks legal sense and substance\", and that the ECB would have a stronger case, although financially unprofitable, for suing him for breach of contract instead. Rather it was presumably to ensure that he will not be able to attempt yet another volte-face without considerable penalty.</p> <p>The new captain, Alastair Cook \u2013 while mindful of what has gone on and the effect it has had, and certainly no one's fool \u2013 is rightly ambitious and will want the best side he can field. The new broom may help, but he will need to bring the dressing room with him for it to work. Independent resolution experts might yet be needed, as suggested here weeks ago. It is still messy.</p> <p>Pietersen is now expected to next appear in an England shirt as soon as November during the tour of India but the first great test of his commitment will come in May when the home series against New Zealand clashes with the latter part of IPL.</p> <p>There may be peace in our time, but as yet, it is an uneasy one.</p>",

May every year see the same progress.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, on the Community Links blog, Maeve McGoldrick picks up on the parties' policies on welfare, arguing that <a href=\"http://www.community-links.org/linksuk/?p=3562&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Linksuk+%28linksUK%29\" title=\"\">reform should be about more than just cuts</a>. She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's extremely unfortunate that each of the parties conflate the need to cut expenditure with welfare reform policies. There is a real need for reform which is distinct from the need for a reduction in expenditure. Investment is needed to modernise the support services available to both unemployed people and people in low-paid employment.<br>In particular Community Links strongly believes that we need to invest in an improved, personalised jobcentre and employment support programmes. All of the political parties are shying away from the obvious \u2013 that support services still need reform. Yet we have no evidence from any of the parties of worked through polices on how to do this.<br>... Simply repeating the same cuts narrative for the next three years is unsustainable. The test for welfare reform at the 2015 election is innovative, solution-focused thinking \u2013 at the moment we are not getting this from any of the political parties.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong>The Big Issue</strong>, which is marking its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19784749\" title=\"\">21st anniversary</a>.

On his NHS Managers blog, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Big Issue started in 1991 when an estimated 2-3,000 people slept rough in London. Since then it has gone from strength to strength. Nationwide and acquired a cult status. And, it is a disgrace. For all its success, for all the hand-ups it has given, for all the great work it has done and is doing, the fact is, in June there were 5,678 people sleeping rough in London. An increase of 70%, up on last April. <br> It is a bloody outrage that after 21 years we haven't made the effort or had the wit, wisdom or money to end it.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A fantastic suite of video resources on <strong>young people's mental health</strong> from NHS Leeds. The city's public health resource centre is running a campaign on young people and mental health throughout October and November. And a new website has been launched as part of the local Time to Change campaign. The <a href=\"http://www.listenupleeds.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Listen Up Leeds</a> site features a number of short films of people from Leeds talking about their own experiences of mental health.</p> <p>\u2022 The National Deaf Children's Society, which has <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/34073\" title=\"\">created an e-petition</a> calling the government to <strong>protect specialist services</strong> for deaf children. The charity says</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We know that local authorities are cutting these services to save money, without being transparent about their decisions and actions.<br>These services are not a luxury. They are vital to deaf children's education, health and wellbeing.<br>Too many local authorities fail to take the needs of deaf children seriously or provide basic information that families need to understand decisions and challenge them if necessary.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19789397\" title=\"\">Overseas 'health tourists' costing NHS at least \u00a340m</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074834/labour-conference-sheerman-moots-plan-raise-participation-age\" title=\"\">Sheerman moots plan to raise the participation age to 25</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/13490/charity_bank_announces_new_ceo_and_deputy\" title=\"\">Charity Bank announces new CEO and deputy</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2012/10/03/118561/one-in-five-amhps-wants-to-quit-role-amid-unacceptably-high-stress-levels.html\" title=\"\">One in five AMHPs wants to quit role amid 'unacceptably high' stress levels</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-disowns-threat-to-oap-benefits-8194856.html\" title=\"\">Labour leadership disowns threat to OAP benefits</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/development/pickles-approves-homes-at-heart-of-planning-row/6524021.article\" title=\"\">Pickles approves homes at heart of planning row</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=107155\" title=\"\">Level of homelessness falls in Scotland</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/10/council-pension-funds-should-pool-cash-for-local-investments/\" title=\"\">Council pension funds 'should pool cash for local investments'</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/9583463/Rush-to-hire-private-companies-for-public-policing-will-be-halted.html\" title=\"\">Private companies to be banned from public policing</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1152882/shadow-childrens-minister-blames-financial-pressures-falling-donations-young/\" title=\"\">Shadow children's minister blames financial pressures for falling donations from young</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Plans for new nuclear power stations in the UK have suffered a setback as Chinese financial backing for two new reactors has failed to materialise, and a bid by French nuclear group Areva has not been submitted.</p> <p>In March, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy\" title=\"\">German utilities E.ON and RWE scrapped plans to build two new reactors at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire</a>, inviting bids for the project, called <a href=\"http://www.horizonnuclearpower.com/\" title=\"\">Horizon Nuclear Power</a>, with a deadline last Friday.</p> <p>On Wednesday, French nuclear engineering group Areva told the Guardian that it had dropped its interest \u2013 in partnership with the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group \u2013 in bidding for Horizon. \"Areva and CGNPC have suspended their interest in the planned sale of Horizon Nuclear Power and did not submit a bid,\" an Areva spokeswoman said, adding that the company was still committed to new nuclear in the UK through other avenues.</p> <p>Areva's withdrawal leaves bids by a consortium led by US nuclear engineering company Westinghouse \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2719932a-0c99-11e2-a776-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28DlUQkie\" title=\"\">reportedly</a> without the involvement of the China National Nuclear Power Corporation, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/20/china-uk-nuclear-power-plants\" title=\"\">as has been previously floated</a> \u2013 and one by Japan's Hitachi, whose nuclear techonology is not yet licensed for use in the UK.</p> <p>A decision is expected within weeks, but if either failed to proceed because of financial or other challenges, that would leave EDF as the main developer committed to building new nuclear reactors in the UK.

  "<p>Outsourcing group <strong>Capita</strong> will lose out when the Criminal Records Bureau is replaced in a few months with a new service, the company has announced.</p> <p>The CRB is to merge with the Independent Safeguarding Authority to form the Disclosure and Barring Service by the end of the year, with the new service fully operational next March.</p> <p>Capita has been working with the CRB for ten years, but said:</p> <blockquote> Capita is aware that the Home Office is pursuing discussions with another supplier with the intention of awarding them a contract to support the new DBS operations. <br> Capita is disappointed not to have been selected by the Home Office to support DBS.

  "<h2>Neil Saunders at Conlumino</h2> <p>One of the worrying signs from this update is the extent to which some parts of the international business have deteriorated: growth in Asia has slowed substantially while European sales have declined. While there are understandable reasons for this, it does suggest that Tesco is now a company fighting battles on many fronts. For a management team that has been weakened by departures, this is a highly uncomfortable position and is one that, if not addressed, could leave resource, talent, investment and focus stretched too thinly.</p> <h2>Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo</h2> <p>The surprise came in international profit, which fell 17.1% led by a 28% fall in European profits to \u00a3171m. Tesco blames the fall on the deteriorating macro-economic environment and their decision to clear stock. For the outlook Tesco has commented that UK trading margins are likely to be similar in the second half as the first. The global macro-environment is also likely to be the same challenge (so Europe is likely to remain weak) and in Korea, the change to opening hours will hit full-year profits by \u00a3100m. All together we think consensus forecasts could continue to edge down.</p> <h2>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst</h2> <p>There has been a lot of focus on \"the Tesco UK recovery\" ahead of these interims but the bigger problems are emerging overseas. It says a lot about the sheer scale of Tesco that it can absorb a potential \u00a3100m profit hit in South Korea from the restrictions on shop opening hours without blinking, but that sort of setback doesn't help. Nor does a surprisingly big profits fall in Europe, or the stubbornly high losses at Fresh &amp; Easy in the US.</p> <h2>Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon</h2> <p>Despite the amount of capital that has been absorbed (by Fresh &amp; Easy) and the losses that it has generated, we suspect that if it were announced today that the US was to be closed or sold, then Tesco shares would rocket. This may not be the best long-term outcome, but if it is to remain part of the group then we would expect to see very compelling evidence that this makes sense. We think that the deadline is the prelims in April.</p>",
  "<p>I cannot say I know Marjorie Scardino well. And I have little knowledge of her role as Pearson's chief executive. But in my informal talks with her she has made one thing abundantly clear: she has an abiding passion for newspapers. </p> <p>I am not sure whether that personal preference played a part in the fate of the Financial Times. I like to think it did because, throughout her 15 years at Pearson's helm, there have been continual rumours about the paper being sold off.</p> <p>It was never going to be an option while she was in charge because she simply loved the paper, its journalism and its ethos. She ensured that it had a safe haven inside Pearson.</p> <p>Of course, the FT and the group of which it is part, needed to justify itself by turning a profit, which it certainly has done in recent years. (And the paper alone makes money, incidentally.)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/03/pearson-marjorie-scardino-step-down\">Now that she is to leave</a> questions about its future will undoubtedly be raised once again. For the moment, let's leave that speculation to one side and pay tribute to Scardino's faith in, and support for, the Financial Times.</p> <p>It springs from her own journalistic background. Marjorie Morris, as she then was, dropped out of law school at George Washington University to become a journalist with the Associated Press in Charleston, West Virginia.</p> <p>After rising to desk editor she met a rookie reporter called Albert Scardino and romance blossomed. They married in San Francisco where Marjorie returned to university and duly gained her law degree.</p> <p>After a couple of years, the couple moved to Savannah, Georgia, where she became a partner in a law firm. And it was there in 1978 that they founded their own newspaper: the Georgia Gazette. </p> <p>The paper, characterised as a \"feisty alternative weekly\", won editorial plaudits (including a Pulitzer) for its campaigning journalism. But it failed financially and closed in 1985, thus providing a valuable, if painful, lesson for Marjorie about the publishing business. </p> <p>Albert joined the New York Times \u2013 covering media, I think \u2013 while Marjorie managed, against the odds, to land the job of managing editor of the north American division of The Economist magazine. </p> <p>She oversaw the doubling of its US circulation and was rewarded for her success in 1992 by becoming chief executive of the Economist Group, which brought her to London.</p> <p>Within five years she was given the infinitely more complex task of running Pearson's global empire. I ought also to mention that Albert was an executive editor here at The Guardian for a while and maintains a close interest in media affairs (see <a href=\"http://www.port-magazine.com/commentary/lessons-from-the-leveson-inquiry/\">his recent piece on the Leveson inquiry</a>).</p> <p>It's fair to say that despite the wide-ranging concerns at Pearson that have taken her away from newspapers, Marjorie still has a beating journalistic heart. The FT was always safe in her hands. Will the new Pearson chief, John Fallon, feel the same way?</p>",
  "<p>Street food is all about the here and now. It's cooked in front of the customer, and eaten straight away. Little for the supermarkets to learn from, you might think \u2013 after all, their food is designed to sit in a chiller cabinet for anything up to three days. But the supermarkets are resourceful to the last. They are intent on capturing that street food \"vibe\".</p> <p>The success of street food in Britain reflects a real change in our food culture. We don't want starter-main-dessert any more. It's too restrictive. We want a bit of this followed by a bit of that. With their <a href=\"http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/companies/supermarkets/marks-and-spencer/marks-and-spencer-launches-modern-asian-ready-meals-range/232734.article\">new Modern Asian range</a> \u2013 26 dishes based on small and large plates of dim sum, noodle bowls, bento boxes and curries \u2013 M&amp;S are doing their best to reflect that evolution in the way we eat.</p> <p>\"You can eat how you want, when you want\" says Caroline Crumby, product Developer in Global Meal Solutions for M&amp;S. \"It's a move away from the 'formal meal occasion'.\" The range's banana leaf packaging is designed to look authentic, but simple. It's pared right back \u2013 like the best street food usually is.</p> <p>Taking its inspiration from street foods in Jamaica, Turkey, Vietnam, Morocco, Madeira, Italy and Spain, Waitrose's Good to Go range also sets out to be unfussy and unadorned. It's what inspired Jonathan Moore, Executive Development Chef for Waitrose: \"Our food isn't hidden away \u2013 no foil tray, with a cardboard lid, shoved inside a box with sexy photos on the packaging. The filling is the hero.\"</p> <p>M&amp;S are also launching a \"Limited Edition pop-up range\". Sounds edgy. And it's only in stores for a short amount of time. For a supermarket to offer a range that makes a virtue of its seasonality, and \u2013 therefore its limited availability \u2013 is something new. The idea is that this range doesn't come from a huge organisation with an enormous supply chain that can feed us whatever, whenever. When it's gone, it's gone - not an original bit of marketing, but a clever one.</p> <p>Traders are used to the idea of big business stealing their ideas. \"I used scotch bonnets in a sauce\" says Mark Gevaux, aka The Rib Man, \"then one of the supermarkets started using scotch bonnets in their sauce. Same now with nagas. If you don't think they have spies, then wait for this coming year and see what's next. Buttermilk fried chicken? Gourmet hot dogs ? Kimchi? Trust me \u2013 they spy.\"</p> <p>The fact is, the supermarkets don't need to \"spy\". But The Rib Man's right \u2013 those dishes are all on the way. M&amp;S are particularly interested in kimchi \u2013 and fermenting, pickling and curing \u2013 as a way to introduce punchy flavours with longevity. Waitrose are putting their money on Peruvian flavours. We never imagined we would see sushi on the shelves. How soon before we get <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/sep/13/how-to-make-perfect-ceviche\">ceviche kits</a> with fresh fish, lime and chilli?</p> <p>Caroline Crumby just got back from a research trip to New York where she was taken with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/14/david-chang-momofuku-interview\">David Chang's steamed pork buns at Momofuku</a>. Now she's thinking of bringing them to M&amp;S. She wasn't \"spying\". \"What is original now?\" she says. \"Those buns are a version of a version. It's gone beyond retailers just looking at stuff and popping it on the shelves. What's the original recipe? That's why these are such exciting times.\"</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, a new global initiative was launched. You may not have heard of it, but it has already positively affected the lives of nearly 2 billion people, or 30% of the world's population.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\" title=\"\">The Open Government Partnership (OGP)</a> is made up of countries and civil society organisations who share a belief that tapping into the expertise of their citizens and businesses will enable them to make better decisions.</p> <p>It was launched in September 2011 by its first two co-chairs, presidents Barack Obama and Dilma Rousseff of the US and Brazil. At its launch, they declared a collective commitment by the OGP's participating countries to work together to make their administrations more transparent and accountable. This concept of partnership runs throughout the OGP as the initiative champions the idea that civil society organisations and governments should work together to push forward the open government agenda. This is also reflected in the structure of the rotating co-chairmanship, which now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/26/open-government-partnership-francis-maude\" title=\"\">passes to the UK and Indonesia. </a></p> <p>In the first year the initiative has grown rapidly. Today the partnership is made up of 57 governments from all around the world. Action plans have already been published by 46 countries, containing concrete commitments on how they will make their governments more open, while another 11 are currently developing their plans. With more countries having recently expressed their intention to take part, open government is now truly a global initiative.</p> <p>At the first annual meeting, held in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/open-government-brasilia-2012\" title=\"\">Brasilia in April,</a> representatives from across the world gathered to share their national visions and plans for throwing open the doors of government for their citizens. Between them they have made over 300 diverse commitments, yet one common feature is that they are designed to help build trust and revitalise the relationship between governments and citizens.</p> <p>Over the past year, the progress of participating governments has been significant. In <a href=\"http://blog.opengovpartnership.org/2012/09/tanzania-ogp-update/\" title=\"\">Tanzania</a> for instance, the government has created a web-based water point mapping system for local governments to help them to provide better services to their citizens. The <a href=\"http://blog.opengovpartnership.org/2012/07/bulgaria-shows-progress-on-open-governance-commitments/\" title=\"\">Bulgarian</a> government is publishing&#xa0;daily budget spending reports&#xa0;with the recipient of each payment and what it is designed to achieve. To support citizen engagement, the<a href=\"http://www.workerscenter.org/peoplesbudget\" title=\"\"> Philippines'</a> budget department has just released its first annual People's Budget, a layperson's summary version of the national budget and its process.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/commitments/improving-transparency-business-activity-companies-special-state-concern\" title=\"\">Croatian</a> government requires companies of special state interest to publish their annual business activity reports.

Now is the time to focus on action and ensure that the commitments which have been made are met. Central to this is the role of the many civil society organisations that have been at the heart of the creation and development of OGP. Over the past 12 months they have helped, and when necessary have nudged, governments into action when they felt they have fallen short on delivering.</p> <p>In Ukraine, civil society came together when the government produced a draft national plan which they felt did not truly reflect the needs of Ukrainian society. A civic coalition of experts developed an alternative national plan, which fully corresponds with OGP requirements, and began working to promote it. After a four-month advocacy campaign, the prime minister of Ukraine signed the document, with 80% of it coming directly from the civic coalition's plan.</p> <p>Alongside this external pressure, the OGP is establishing new internal structures aligned with the commitment to action. In addition to self-assessment reports which governments are obliged to publish, an outstanding new panel of experts will externally verify claims.</p> <p>The role of the policy experts and senior advisors that staff the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/independent-reporting-mechanism\" title=\"\">independent reporting mechanism (IRM)</a> will be to ensure a diversity of voices is heard on the quality and pace of countries' efforts to deliver on their commitments.</p> <p>In its first year OGP has demonstrated that across the world, the will exists to make governments more open. The initiative transcends political boundaries and has the power to become this generation's defining theme. It is bringing citizens, civil society and governments closer together and creating meaningful change. By September 2013, we are determined to continue working to share the OGP's messages of open government with millions of people around the world.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Guardian News and Media's (GNM) environmental performance reporting aims to cover all the relevant impacts within the boundaries we can control or influence and while we cannot cover everything, we are continuing to expand our knowledge and data.</p> <p>Given that we have limited resources, we are focusing most of our effort on where we have the largest impacts and control:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Carbon footprint</strong> Emission sources of carbon from across the business and supply chain</li> <li><strong>Resource footprint</strong> Consumption and use of natural and processed resources, including paper, operational consumables and materials</li> <li><strong>Waste footprint</strong> Sources of waste generation across the business</li> </ul> <p>In line with our carbon positive commitment, we have further expanded our measurement to include our digital operations, including data centres.</p> <p>Beyond this, we are now measuring the emissions from our New York and Manchester offices and have also improved the collection of data relating to business travel.</p> <p>We have also improved other data, including print site waste and ink consumption.</p> <h2><strong>Carbon Footprint</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112813\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873150771/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint1-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint1\" width=\"460\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint1</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the financial year ending March 2012, GNM's Carbon Footprint emissions were 32,850tCO2e, a 2% increase on a comparative basis with the previous year.</p> <p>The emissions increase is due to a switch in purchasing to a recycled British mill that uses more energy, although we still maintained our paper emission target of 370kg per tonne of paper. </p> <p>The continuing expansion of our carbon reporting through our supply chain and operations means that the scope of the footprint has changed from what was reported last year. </p> <p>Our carbon footprint has not been significantly changed. Although, what we are now able to offer is greater detail and we can, for example, show that our own servers represent 2% of emissions. </p> <p>We have been able to estimate, for the first time, the carbon footprint of www.guardian.co.uk. For 2011/2012 this was in the magnitude of 10,000 tonnes CO2e - approximately a third of our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-digital-carbon-footprint\">current GNM footprint</a>.</p> <p>The model used to calculate the emissions is still going through academic peer review and we are currently analysing how best to manage the uncertainty in the data and how to incorporate it into the overall footprint. </p> <p><strong>Reducing Emissions </strong></p> <p>One thing is certain is that it becomes increasingly difficult over time to continue reducing emissions.</p> <p>It is therefore important to look at our performance over time and in fact GNM has achieved a 25% reduction since our base year of 2009/10.</p> <p>Looking through a slightly different lens, we reduced carbon intensity in the last financial year by 1% to 20.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per employee, based on our wider boundary.</p> <p>In terms of our directly controlled operations, including offices, data centres, print sites and business travel, we saved 3% carbon in 2011/12 compared with the same period the previous year. This was achieved through a combination of investment, improved efficiency, and environmental management and reduced operations. This has been part been of a continued effort to reduce our directly controlled emissions which have reduced by 31% since our base line of 2008/9.</p> <p>Our two Guardian Print Centres in Manchester and London achieved reductions of 9% in total emissions. In addition, emissions per tonne of newsprint used fell to 116kgCO2e in 2011/12 compared to 122kgCO2e. </p> <p>We are looking to develop better metrics to measure efficiency and this likely to include per page emissions and energy base load. The base load is the consumption of electricity which occurs regardless of how or what we print, for example associated with lighting and heating.</p> <p>Business travel emissions rose by 42% or 320tCO2e in the last financial year. Air travel rose by 52% or 240tCO2e and train travel by 32%. This is the second year which has seen an increase in air travel.</p> <p>This increase is predominately due to better data collection, so it is not possible to give accurate comparative data. In December this year we put into place a mandate and a new travel management company. This has lead to a significant improvement in the collection of travel emission data compared with the previous year. </p> <p>While budget cuts mean that we are monitoring travel more carefully, there has been a sharp increase in flights between London and New York as a result of the strengthening of our presence in the United States. </p> <h2><strong>Resource Footprint</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112814\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873226100/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint3-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint3\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paper consumption is not only our number one carbon source but also our largest known direct impact on the environment. </p> <p>When purchasing paper we aim to balance price, quality, security of delivery, carbon emissions and sustainable paper sourcing. GNM refers to sustainable paper sourcing as paper fibre which, is from a recycled or certified (i.e. <a href=\"http://www.fsc.org/\">Forest Stewardship Council</a> (FSC) or <a href=\"http://www.pefc.co.uk/\">Programme for the Endorsement of Forest</a> Certification (PEFC) source.</p> <p>In the last financial year 98% of the newsprint and 94% of magazine grade paper used for the Guardian and Observer was either recycled or used certified virgin fibre. </p> <p>Newsprint recycled levels fell to 81% in 2012, but are still above our 80% target. However, this is compensated by an increase of 6% in certified virgin sources to 17%.</p> <p>For virgin source magazine grade paper 94% is certified with only 6% remaining uncertified. In 2010/11 14% of virgin magazine grade paper was uncertified. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112815\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873201320/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint2-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint2\" width=\"460\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reduced sales and pagination, as well as a lower weight of paper and efforts to reduce paper wastage, meant that GNM saw a 5% reduction in newsprint consumption in 2011/12 to 44,570t. </p> <p>Water is a precious resource and we are conscious that we must continue to monitor and manage our usage. This is why in the current financial year we are looking at the opportunities for collecting water consumption data from our paper suppliers. In areas of the business where we do monitor water, we are managing to reduce it.</p> <p>Our two print plants achieved actual water reductions of almost 16%, or 1.5 million litres, during the last financial year. This was mainly due to improved controls, water recycling, cleaning processes and observation of water use to detect and fix leaks. </p> <p>Ink consumption across both presses was reduced by 14%, or 169,900 kg. This was due to efficiency measures and reduced printing. </p> <p>We endeavour to minimise the environmental impacts of our ink. We have substituted harmful solvents through the switch to water-based inks and we can be sure that none of the coloured pigments contain heavy metals such as cadmium.</p> <p>Our inks currently contain a small amount of petroleum-based product but the percentage is less than 2.5% and is diluted during the printing process. Other chemicals used in the printing process are diluted in water up to 98%. Therefore used newspapers are totally safe to compost.</p> <h2><strong>Waste Footprint</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112816\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873247953/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint4-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint4\" width=\"460\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> While office waste has a relatively low environmental impact compared with our other activities, it is an issue with high visibility among staff. In fact, the issue had previously come up repeatedly in workshops held with departments across GNM to look at sustainability objectives.</p> <p>Last year we launched a Love Your Waste campaign to reduce contamination and improve recycling as well as improving bins and signage. As a result, we increased our office waste recycling to 78%, including composting in the financial year ending March 2012. All waste is managed according to current legislation and even though we do recycle WEEE - waste electrical and electronics equipment (i.e computers, mobile phones), batteries, toner cartridges and CDs this data was not available for inclusion in the waste figures for this reporting year.</p> <p>We also managed a reduction in total waste volumes. No waste now goes directly to landfill and waste to incineration fell by over 40 tonnes, although in the last three months of the financial year, non-recycled waste had been increasing month on month. In addition, the volume of total paper waste continues to increase and further investigation is still required to understand why this is happening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112817\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873282953/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint5-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint5\" width=\"460\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With a focus on segregation and better resource management, total waste at the print sites fell by 13% or 192,000kgs. London achieved a 17% reduction in total waste, while both print sites saw improvement in recycling by 4% Manchester now 84% and London 78%. Both sites also reduced hazardous waste this includes solvents, plate developers and oil filters.</p> <p>Paper waste continues to be a focal point, given that it is a valuable resource and recycling it therefore generates an income for the sites. The quality or the purity of the paper also affects the price therefore paper is segregated in three main ways:</p> <p>White - paper not printed on, lost due to splicing errors and left on cores<br>Printed - paper lost in press start up and errors in printing <br>Brown - packaging paper used to protect the newsprint when delivered to site</p> <p>For example, at our Manchester Site 61% of waste by weight is printed paper waste.</p>",
  "<p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp has already conquered Germany. His Borussia Dortmund have won the league the past two years and last season set a Bundesliga record for the number of points won in a season: 81. The following week they walloped Bayern Munich 5-2 to win the German Cup and the Double for the first time.</p> <p>That Klopp can walk on water the Borussia Dortmund supporters are already sure. But can he march on in Europe? We may find out this week.</p> <p>On Wednesday the 45-year-old manager takes his young and almost preposterously attack-minded side to the Etihad Stadium to play Manchester City in an attempt to put a huge dent in Roberto Mancini's European ambitions. Dortmund won their first Group D game against Ajax two weeks ago and the English champions can ill-afford to drop more points after their defeat at the Bernab\u00e9u.</p> <p>But which Dortmund will turn up? The swashbuckling side that beat Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 5-0 at the weekend or the side that shipped three goals at Frankfurt in a 3-3 draw during which the manager was sent to the stands and afterwards described the performance as \"shit\"?</p> <p>There is unquestionable talent in the side, even after the loss of Shinji Kagawa to Manchester United last summer and Nuri Sahin (now at Liverpool) to Real Madrid the previous year.</p> <p>The striker Robert Lewandowski scored 22 goals in 34 Bundesliga matches last season and will be fresh for Wednesday night having been rested at the weekend. His Polish compatriots Jakub Blaszczykowski and Lukasz Piszczek have a sublime understanding down the right and on the left Marco Reus is showing why he is considered the most talented young player in a very talented generation. The 23-year-old joined from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the summer and his choice of Die Schwarzgelben ahead of Bayern Munich shows how far Klopp has taken the club. They \u2013 not Bayern \u2013 are now the team to join and the team to beat.</p> <p>And, as if that was not enough, there are also the effervescent Mario G\u00f6tze (a long-standing target of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger), the defensive midfielder Sebastian Kehl and, at the back, the elegant centre-back Mats Hummels, who made such an impression for Germany at Euro 2012.</p> <p>However, despite the calibre of the players at his disposal and the impressive results domestically, Klopp has struggled in Europe. Last season's Champions League adventure was a huge disappointment with the German side finishing last in a group containing Arsenal, Marseille and Olympiakos. The previous year they failed to get out of their Europa League group.</p> <p>In pre-season, when Klopp was asked what his aims for the Champions League were this campaign, he said simply: \"To win it,\" adding: \"We don't ignore our quality and even when we won the league for the first time we didn't think that that was a one-off. Now we think that the Champions League is a realistic target.</p> <p>\"That doesn't mean that we will actually do it. It is just that with the quality we have that seems a fair enough target. If you get a great team together, then good football is also possible. And we have a great team. Together we have also created a relaxed yet incredibly results-oriented working environment.</p> <p>\"Everything can't come to you at once. We have to be patient as well. Our football works on the international scene, there is no question about that. And we will play our way in Europe. We won't change. And hopefully we can do it with more consistency than last season.\"</p> <p>Klopp's players seem to be on message. Talking about the Champions League before the first game against Ajax, Ilkay Gundogan said: \"We won't be as naive this time as last season,\" while Hummels added: \"We are just that bit cleverer this time around.\"</p> <p>Klopp would smile at his players' comments. He has got them exactly where he wants: confident yet aware of what went wrong last season. \"The Champions League has something special about it and that can, initially, inhibit players,\" he said recently, before adding: \"but this season we feel as if we belong. Bring it on!\"</p>",
  "<p>Tesco has reported its first fall in profits in 20 years after it was forced to invest heavily to revive its struggling UK chain and cracks emerged in its sprawling international empire.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Philip Clarke, said it was \"far too early\" to say whether the \u00a31bn facelift announced for its UK supermarkets back in April was winning back shoppers: \"The signs are encouraging but the plan is a long course of treatment, not a single dose.\" The UK chain managed flat like-for-likes in the second quarter, ending an 18-month losing streak.</p> <p>The performance of the domestic chain is crucial to the group's success as it generates two-thirds of group profits, but on Wednesday alarm bells sounded after Tesco warned that its profits were also being squeezed in South Korea, its second biggest market, and that US chain Fresh &amp; Easy had failed to make any inroads into its losses.</p> <p>Overall group trading profit dropped 10.5% to \u00a31.6bn in the six months to 25 August; within Britain, profits were down more than 12.4% at \u00a31.1bn. \"The market was prepared for a decline in profits but this is a disappointing statement even in that context,\" said Seymour Pierce analyst Kate Calvert. She said the performance of Tesco Bank, which will launch current accounts next year, \"was the only positive\".</p> <p>New laws in Korea mean Tesco can no longer trade its Homeplus stores round the clock and must close two Sundays a month \u2013 a restriction that is expected to shave \u00a3100m off group profits this year. Problems also emerged in its previously reliable Central European division, where profits slumped by a fifth as the \"chill winds\" of the crisis in the eurozone reached consumers in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, who are cutting back spending on non-essential goods such as electricals and homewares.</p> <p>Speculation over the future of Fresh &amp; Easy also intensified after it announced a worse than expected loss of \u00a374m and slowed the rate of new store openings for a second time. Clarke insisted shareholders were more interested in the fate of the domestic operation: \"The real question from investors when I speak to them is about the UK. So many retailers who have gone global have given up their home market&#xa0;\u2026 I will not allow that to happen and I could feel that it was in danger.\"</p> <p>After a poor Christmas, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/15/tesco-growth-megastores\" title=\"\">Tesco stunned investors in January when the company issued its first profit warning in more than 20 years</a>, with Clarke citing the need to invest heavily in the UK chain where it had taken \"a little bit too much away from the shopper\" during years of penny-pinching to boost profits. At the retailer's annual results in April, Clarke fleshed out plans for a \u00a31bn programme to refurbish 430 stores and hire the equivalent of 8,000 new store workers to improve customer service. More than half the stores have now been revamped and Clarke said he was \"encouraged\" by customers' initial responses to the changes being made. But he added: \"Our first target is to be performing in line with the [UK] industry in like-for-like terms.\"</p> <p>Clarke maintains that the UK grocery industry is at a crossroads, as the worlds of physical and online shopping collide. With that in mind he has cut the rate of new store space being opened this year by 40% and is trying to reinvent its largest \"Extra\" hypermarkets, which, with rows of flat-screen TVs and home furnishings, are increasingly obsolete as consumers either cut back spending or browse online.</p> <p>In some of the new-look stores it had added bigger food and clothing ranges, but Clarke said it would consider \"downsizing\" some of the Extras, a push that could see space sublet to other retailers. It has already opened a branch of fast food chain Nandos in its Extra store in Wembley, north London, although Clarke was quick to add: \"I'm not saying that was the answer.\"</p> <p>With the major grocers fighting for market share, Tesco had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/08/tesco-price-cuts-sales-fall\" title=\"\">accused by some analysts</a> of buying customers with a campaign of money-off coupons. Clarke insisted the level of discounting was the same as a year ago, but they had used customer information gleaned from the Clubcard loyalty scheme to tailor offers to individual shoppers' buying habits.</p> <p>On Wednesday Sainsbury's reported like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, of 1.9% for its second quarter, though that figure was flattered by extensions to its supermarkets that have generated more selling space.</p> <h2><strong>Not so easy in the US</strong></h2> <p>Tesco's US start-up Fresh &amp; Easy should be given a \"deadline\" of another six months to prove itself after racking up a bigger than expected loss in the first six months of the year.</p> <p>The grocer has ploughed more than \u00a31bn into the five-year-old chain which is yet to turn a profit and on Wednesday dramatically scaled back expansion plans for this year to concentrate on making the 199 stores it already has profitable. At present less than 30% of Fresh &amp; Easy stores make a positive contribution and Tesco boss Philip Clarke indicated his dissatisfaction: \"We need more from Fresh &amp; Easy.\" But added that \"if we can find a way through\" the business potentially offered \"decades of value for shareholders\".</p> <p>Ahead of the first store openings in 2007 Tesco claimed to have spent thousands of hours researching US shopping habits, including hiring researchers to probe the fridge contents and lifestyles of 60 American families, checking the time they got up, what they ate for breakfast and when they shopped. However, the original store interiors and product ranges have since been completely rejigged and more changes are in prospect including the introduction of staffed checkouts after some customers were put off by self-service tills.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said that if the US chain was closed or sold Tesco's share price \"would rocket. \"This may not be the best long-term outcome, but if it is to remain part of the group, then we would expect to see very compelling evidence that this makes sense. We think that the deadline is the prelims in April.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dame Marjorie Scardino, one of the UK's highest-profile female corporate leaders, is to step down as chief executive of Financial Times and Penguin owner Pearson at the end of 2012, and will be replaced by the head of its international education division, John Fallon.</p> <p>Fallon will succeed Scardino as chief executive on 1 January 2013, and joins the Pearson board with immediate effect. He has been chief executive of Pearson's international education division since 2008 and is responsible for education businesses outside the US.</p> <p>Scardino, an American-born British citizen, has been Pearson chief executive since 1997. During her tenure, sales have tripled to nearly \u00a36bn and profits grown more than three times to a record high of \u00a3942m in 2011, as the company focused on learning products and moved towards digital.</p> <p>Shortly after her arrival, Scardino tidied up Pearson's conglomerate structure, for example selling off its historic stakes in investment bank Lazard, and focused the business on education and publishing. She tenaciously defended Pearson's ownership of the Financial Times, memorably declaring she would sell the business newspaper \"over my dead body\"; her departure will trigger speculation that a sale of the financial newspaper could happen.</p> <p>She received cash and share awards worth \u00a39.6m in 2011, making her Britain's highest-paid female director of a FTSE 100 company.</p> <p>Pearson boosted pre-tax profits 72% to \u00a31.1bn last year, thanks largely to the sale of its 50% stake in FTSE International. This year, it expects to generate more than half its revenues from digital and services businesses for the first time in its history, up from a third in 2011.</p> <p>Education accounted for two thirds of Pearson's total \u00a35.9bn revenue in 2011; the international education division generated sales of \u00a31.4bn and operating profits of \u00a3196m last year.</p> <p>Scardino said: \"For more than 160 years, Pearson has stood for integrity, quality and business strength. It has been a privilege to be part of such a great company for a small part of its history.</p> <p>\"Though we've changed the company beyond recognition from its form in 1997, we are still in the foothills of the climb to make all kinds of learning more accessible and more effective for more people.</p> <p>\"I know that John, the board, the senior team and our 40,000 people have the bravery, imagination and decency to lead the company to new ways of achieving these goals, while holding on to the traditions and values that make Pearson unique.\"</p> <p>Fallon said: \"Marjorie's legacy is a company with a strong performance record, a deep commitment to its wider social purpose and a unique culture. I am proud to be part of the company; it is a tremendous honour and responsibility to be asked to lead it.</p> <p>\"Pearson has a clear position of leadership in global learning and publishing, with strong foundations for growth in technology, services and developing economies. Our challenge is to seize those opportunities in an era of tremendous industry change.\"</p> <p>Before joining Pearson, Fallon was director of corporate affairs and a member of the executive committee at Powergen.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Of course there are some ethnic and family links across the border, but generally the Rwandan government has been judicious in staying its hand.\"</p> <p>Puntzel's comments highlight the sometimes testy relations between donors and aid recipients, especially at a time when donors place increasing emphasis on the importance of good governance and human rights. The EU, the world's largest aid donor, last year said it placed far greater focus on democracy, human rights and governance in its aid programmes under its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/oct/13/eu-focus-human-rights-aid\" title=\"\">new \"agenda for change\" development policy</a>.</p> <p>However, the LSE report cautions against too formulaic an approach towards democratic rules, formal state institutions and elections. \"If democratic rules are likely to lead to significant exclusion of either powerful elites or important regional, ethnic, language or religious groups, then they may be inferior to forms of power sharing,\" says the report.</p> <p>Warning that donor attempts to promote democratic or market reforms can lead to violence, it says sometimes tolerating corruption, unproductive rents and less than democratic governments has actually been the price of peace.</p> <p>\"The promotion of democracy in a country needs to focus on establishing mechanisms for checks and balances on executive authority rather than the form of political party competition,\" said the report, which looks at why some fragile states \u2013 understood as countries particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of large-scale violence \u2013 slide into collapse while others manage to achieve periods of \"resilience\".</p> <p>Putzel and his co-author, Jonathan Di John, cite Zambia as an example of \"resilient stagnation\", a state that managed to avoid violent conflict throughout its post-colonial history but also became an example of peaceful regime change. Stability was the result of \"an inclusive bargain\" among contending elites, underpinned by a dominant national political party, they said, but the trade-off has been economic stagnation because economic policies \u2013 the deployment of subsidies and access to valuable economic (mining) rights \u2013 were based more on political than economic criteria.</p> <p>\"Good governance reforms promoted by aid agencies need to take into account existing elite bargains or they may have unintended negative outcomes on democratic and developmental possibilities,\" says the report.</p> <p>Another uncomfortable message for aid agencies is that the failure to prioritise security in state building threatens to undermine aid efforts. Where the state cannot maintain power without unleashing violence against its own population, as is currently the case in the DRC, external efforts need to put the construction of accountable security forces ahead of other aid programmes, argues the report.</p> <p>\"Most of the attention of the international community towards security in fragile states has been related to downsizing the state's security forces, demobilising programmes \u2026 and wider concerns or providing 'human security' and respect for human rights,\" it says. \"While these are desirable objectives, they are unattainable without the establishment of a basic security capacity within the state.\"</p> <p>A key finding is the importance of taxation, cited as a major indicator for measuring state performance. The report urges western donors to support the creation of taxation systems in developing countries. It also urges donors to channel aid through the state rather than bypassing it, which can contribute to the creation of a \"dual public authority\", a scenario that \u2013 over time \u2013 can weaken states \"in favour of rival networks of patronage\". This chimes with one of the outcomes at last year's aid effectiveness conference in Busan, South Korea, when donors reaffirmed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/dec/02/busan-shifting-geopolitical-realities\" title=\"\">that aid used for general budget support should be the \"default\" option</a>.</p> <p>The authors' main contention is that rather than democratic institutions, the \"underlying political settlement\" determines political or economic outcomes. Focusing on the political settlement, they argue, directs attention to the crucial role of elites in securing stability in a state, which should lead donors to be concerned \"about the incentives elites face to play by the rules of the state\".</p>",
  "<p>Do you choose the advisers you work with based on their specialist knowledge of your sector? If you do, you may not be benefiting from other information that you may need in order to make the most of opportunities.</p> <p>As the founder of one of a small but growing number of companies that work with charities, social enterprises and businesses to improve their income generation, we regularly come across perceptions that people have about different types of organisation. For example, people who think that profit-making companies are \"bad\", or that starting a charity and keeping it going is \"easy\". We meet people who think that money donated to a charity should only be spent on causes, with nothing left for core costs, and those who believe that private-sector sales people are manipulative, rich and uncaring.</p> <p>The arrival of new structures like Community Interest Companies (CICs) and the emergence of a new generation of profit-making companies with a genuine commitment to social value has started to blur the boundaries between the for, not-for and not-just-for profits. We are forced to accept that, as ever, the reality is far more complicated than we'd like. But we risk missing a trick: in all the rhetoric about cross-sector working, partnerships and knowledge transfer we are still failing to learn from organisations with different approaches and structures to our own. Our experience suggests that this failing is at its most acute in the area of income generation.</p> <p>The way in which organisations generate income, whether through fundraising, sales, tendering or donation needs closer examination because:</p> <p>\u2022 In times of economic pressure we all need to innovate to survive, and it's important that muttering that \"times are tough\" doesn't distract us from concentrating and controlling our own future.</p> <p>\u2022 We are too slow to use the latest evidence and research to inform how we approach income generation.</p> <p>\u2022 Significant failings in both the for-profit and the not-for-profit sector have damaged customer and stakeholder trust; we all need to understand the whole picture to improve our lot.</p> <p>Below are three of the many areas where we see more similarities than division between the private and third sectors.</p> <h2><strong>Super-doers </strong></h2> <p>Whatever type of organisation you run, the chances are that too few people within your team are responsible for generating your income. If this problem is acute, of course you need to focus on cultivating more of these engaged, energetic and vital individuals. But, that isn't an easy task, so while you are working on it, what can you do to increase the sense of accountability across the whole team?</p> <p>Creating a sense that a few people are responsible for the dirty business of bringing in money increases the pressure on those who do it, and decreases the chances that the rest of the team will identify and respond appropriately to opportunities. After all, if your job is to deliver services, not to secure contracts, why would you stay behind after a big meeting to discuss what else is going on in a key partner organisation?</p> <h2><strong>Unintended consequences</strong></h2> <p>When things aren't headed in the right direction we often turn to planning, and from there to goal and incentive setting. From the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/27/ppi-complaints-double\" title=\"\">mis-selling of PPI</a> and the recent controversy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/2012/sep/28/defence-street-fundraising\" title=\"\">surrounding street fundraisers</a> we have compelling evidence on the risks, and unintended consequences of setting incentives. This view is supported by Goals Gone Wild: The Systematic Side Effects of Over-Prescribing Goal Setting, a paper by Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez et al, in which they outline a number of risks associated with the over use of goals to control behaviours, including an increased risk of unethical behaviour.</p> <h2><strong>Not valuing trust</strong></h2> <p>Social media has increased the level of engagement that individuals expect with organisations, and the speed at which good and bad news travels. There isn't an easy route here. You need to engage and use the technology \u2013 the risk of people saying bad things about you in the Twittersphere doesn't disappear just because you aren't there \u2013 and by not engaging you may miss amazing opportunities.</p> <p>The values which govern how you operate face-to-face need to apply in all arenas. Manipulation, bad mouthing, high pressure techniques and unguarded comments aren't acceptable anywhere, and will soon come back to bite you. See this example from <a href=\"link:http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2012/jul/19/greenpeace-shell- arcticready- in-pictures#/?picture=\" 393319863&amp;index=\"0&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">Greenpeace</a> of how quickly a trusted brand can undo years of reputation building.</p> <p>There are so many areas where all organisations need to change and improve that this list could go on and on. Times are tough, but the response isn't for us all to stick with what we've always done. And if private and voluntary sector organisations both need to move on, why can't we move forward together?<br><em><br>Isla Wilson is a director of <a href=\"http://rubystarassociates.co.uk/\">Ruby Star Associates </a> which specialises in sales, selling, training, marketing, business + social enterprise.
