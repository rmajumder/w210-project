  "<p>A global medical charity is calling for drones to be included in international arms limitations treaties, arguing that on top of the physical harm they wreak they also inflict psychological harm \u2013 both when they strike and by causing innocent people to live in fear.</p> <p>A report by <a href=\"http://www.medact.org/\" title=\"\">Medact</a>, whose members are health professionals, says there are many reasons to be concerned about the increasing use of unmanned, armed drones.</p> <p>It says: \"In addition to the number of deaths and injuries of innocent civilians, we also have concerns about the psychological damage to people living under the constant threat of drone attack and to service personnel who carry out the assassinations.</p> <p>\"There is also some evidence that medical personnel and others who arrive at the scene to assist the injured have been targeted in drone attacks. This is a war crime.\"</p> <p>The most accurate figures on the numbers of civilians killed by drones are from Pakistan, says the report, and they range from light casualties to the large estimates of deaths, including those of children, family members attending funerals and medical personnel, provided by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The Bureau says that between 2,985 and 4,533 civilians have died since 2001 in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.</p> <p>Injuries, says Medact, are fewer than deaths, which is unusual in a conflict.</p> <p>\"While more injuries than deaths probably go unreported, this nevertheless gives an indication of the deadly nature of drone attacks and the unnecessary deaths that will occur if mistakes are made in targeting, observation or intelligence gathering,\" says the report.</p> <p>\"The deaths and injuries suffered by innocent civilians in what are euphemistically called 'surgical strikes' are often underreported.\"</p> <p>Women are disproportionately affected by drones, it adds. \"What little control they have over their lives is further eroded by a weapon they know could strike at any time.\"</p> <p>By the end of last month, Britain had carried out more than 300 drone strikes in Afghanistan. There are plans to double the UK's fleet and to open a second control station at RAF Waddington in late 2012, says Medact, which challenges the legitimacy of what it calls asymmetrical warfare.</p> <p>Marion Birch, director of Medact and a co-author of the report, said: \"Drones are not only unacceptable from a human, moral and legal point of view, they are traumatising families and damaging the chances of peace. We believe it is time for the UK government to stop purchasing, developing and deploying armed drones.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hamid Bouadimi leaves the sitting room of his south London flat and returns holding a green plastic bag. Labelled \"patient property\" and tied with a knot, it contains the clothes that his five-year-old son, Hichame, was wearing when he was killed by a lorry on&#xa0;St George's Road, Southwark, on the way home from school last Wednesday.</p> <p>He sits down and takes out the items one by one to show to me. First a red sweatshirt bearing the community primary school's logo, then neatly folded trousers, a sticker bearing a smiley face Hichame earned through good behaviour that day, which police or paramedics have placed in a plastic bag. His little vest, socks and pants are there too. And the black school shoes that both parents took him to buy just a week ago.</p> <p>Hichame's mother has barely slept since she watched her youngest child die in the street. Mr Bouadimi, who has health problems, says he is doing his best to keep the family going. Their youngest daughter, Lamia, is back at Charlotte Sharman school on the other side of St George's Road, the three-lane red route west from Elephant and Castle, where flowers and candles have been left with messages of condolence. The couple's two teenage sons have not been back to school since the funeral.</p> <p>Transport for London removed pedestrian guard rails from the junction where Hichame was killed in March. The cause of the crash is not yet clear and the driver involved was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, but the family is looking for answers.</p> <p>\"I was always scared of that road,\" says Mr Bouadimi. \"Most of the drivers drive fast, and if the police put a camera there they would see it. The school is very close to the main road, and I don't know who was the clever man who made the decision to take away the barriers. It's really upsetting to be honest with you. My son is gone but I'm really worried. There has to be a camera and a flashing sign showing kids coming out from school, at least at 9 o'clock and 3.30. It's&#xa0;not complicated to do, it's just a&#xa0;sign. I&#xa0;don't want anybody else to experience what I've experienced.\"</p> <p>Tragedies like this are thankfully far rarer than they were in the 1980s, when more than 5,000 people were killed on Britain's roads every year (around 100 a week). In 1999 Britain had the safest roads in Europe apart from Sweden. But there are signs that such disasters \u2013 with human consequences that will reach down the years, for how does a six-year-old girl in an already vulnerable household cope with seeing her little brother's life obliterated? \u2013 are on the rise.</p> <p>The number of people killed on Britain's roads increased by 3% in 2011, to 1,901 \u2013 the first increase since 2003. The number of pedestrians killed jumped by 12% to 453, with the biggest increases among children and the over-60s \u2013 \"vulnerable road users\", in the jargon.</p> <p>Whether this is a statistical glitch, or the start of a deadly new trend, is a matter for debate. The first quarter of 2012 also showed an 8% increase (compared with the same period last year) in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured, but not all the numbers move in the same direction. While the number of casualties on motorways and in non-built-up areas fell last year, serious injuries in built-up areas went up. Road accident data are complicated.</p> <p>What is not in question is that road safety has moved up the political agenda. In February the Times launched its Cyclesafe \"Cities fit for cycling\" campaign, after its reporter Mary Bowers was critically injured in a collision with a lorry. Cycling was a big issue in London's mayoral election. \"Boris bikes\" were among the Conservative mayor's flagship first-term achievements: his rivals queued up to challenge him with statistics that showed pedestrian and cyclist deaths had gone up since he took office.</p> <p>\"It's interesting that when a cyclist is killed in London now, it's in the Evening Standard and attracts quite a bit of coverage, when in the past that wasn't the case,\" says transport writer Christian Wolmar, who aims to be Labour's mayoral candidate in 2016. \"There has traditionally been a lot of cycling in places like Cambridge, York and Chelmsford. But London, almost by accident, has become a cycling city. It's come from the bottom up, and transport planners and politicians are playing catch-up. They have still not recognised that if you have a lot of cyclists it requires the transfer of road space.\"</p> <p>Last week the Association of British Insurers called for new restrictions on young drivers, noting that one in three of those killed on the roads is under 25. It proposed a ban on night-time driving, a minimum learning period of a year and a lower drink-drive limit. Road-safety campaigners and charities such as Brake and Living Streets are united behind efforts to improve provision for cyclists and reduce dangerous driving. But they worry that pedestrians, a less organised group than cyclists and lacking Olympic celebrities such as Victoria Pendleton to take their side, struggle to command the same attention, even in a fortnight that saw a 12-year-old boy killed by a hit-and-run driver in Bradford and a 15-year-old left in a coma in west London, as well as the death of Hichame Bouadimi.</p> <p>Deaths of older pedestrians, 184 of whom were killed on Britain's roads last year, usually command even less attention. Josie Keogh's mother, Mary Daly, was killed by a speeding driver near her home in Slough in January 2010. \"She was walking on the pavement by a&#xa0;semi-main road and a man in a BMW mounted the pavement. He lost control, the car completely turned around and ended up facing the other way. He was charged with careless driving,\" she says.&#xa0;Mrs Keogh appealed against the charge and the sentence of community service and a one-year ban from driving without success.</p> <p>\"My mum was 80, but very fit. She walked everywhere. But I found that, because of her age, her death was trivialised. It was devastating. I was speaking to my mum 30 minutes before she was killed. She had five children and 11 grandchildren, and even now it's still devastating for us that that happened to her. That she was walking down the road and a car mounted the pavement and killed her. It's hard to explain how you feel \u2013 the shock and the loss \u2013 because it was completely unnecessary.\"</p> <p>Former transport secretary Justine Greening blamed variations in the weather for 2011's figures, with increased use of mobile devices highlighted as another cause of worsening safety. A handful of high-profile cases have seen drivers jailed for killing people while using mobile phones.</p> <p>But some experts believe the government bears responsibility for the worsening situation. On his first day in the job as transport secretary in May 2010, Philip Hammond made a speech in which he said, \"We will end the war on motorists. Motoring has got to get greener, but the car is not going to go away.\"</p> <p>Funding for speed cameras \u2013 famously loathed by David Cameron's Cotswolds neighbour and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson \u2013 was withdrawn. A clampdown on \"cowboy clampers\" was announced. National casualty-reduction targets were dropped. An 80mph speed limit on motorways was proposed. A department for transport spokesman says: \"An impact assessment is being carried out and a consultation will take place later this year.\"</p> <p>Oliver Carsten, professor of transport safety at the University of Leeds, and the RAC Foundation's Professor Stephen Glaister believe this change in tone sent a dangerous signal. \"Either the central message is about being careful and watchful, or it is that speed is not so salient, so maybe it's OK to go a little bit faster,\" Carsten says. \"And very small increases in speed can have a very dramatic impact when there are crashes.\"</p> <p>Glaister says he was \"appalled when the government encouraged the idea that speed cameras were not useful. Over the years there has been improving compliance with speed limits. Violations have reduced, and this is associated with a reduction in casualties. But most recent data shows both casualties and speeds have gone up. Any road-safety person would say there is a direct correlation.\" Oxfordshire, one of the first local authorities to turn its speed cameras off&#xa0;after the coalition was elected, last year turned them back on.</p> <p>Campaigners continue to push for stronger enforcement. The government has promised to get tougher on drink and drug drivers and make careless driving a fixed-penalty offence, but says there will be no return to national targets.</p> <p>Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of victims' charity Roadpeace, believes the evidence shows the justice system is moving in the wrong direction, away from taking road deaths seriously. A recent consultation by the director of public prosecutions suggested police responding to 999 calls and drivers who had killed their \"nearest and dearest\" through dangerous driving might not in&#xa0;future be prosecuted.</p> <p>\"With fatal crashes, causing death by careless driving is now the most common charge laid. They're just going for easier options where drivers can plead guilty and get banned for a year. Death by dangerous driving charges have more than halved in the past three years, since the less serious charge of careless driving was introduced. The police, the courts, prosecutors, are all under pressure to go for the cheaper, faster option.\"</p> <p>Across Britain, the approach to the street environment is changing. Towns&#xa0; and cities including Liverpool, Sheffield and Leicester have adopted a speed limit of 20mph in residential areas. The idea gaining ground is that segregation of road users may not be the solution \u2013 that drivers are more careful when made to be aware of their surroundings. There have been experiments with \"shared space\", and street \"clutter\" has become unfashionable. Transport for London has removed more than 80km of guard railings, with Edinburgh set to follow suit.</p> <p>But road safety is not always an exact&#xa0;science. As street designer John Dales explains, a road with no cycling casualties might appear safe from the statistics, when in fact cyclists are too scared to use it. \"The one thing we know&#xa0;empirically is that the slower the cars, the lower the accident statistics.\"</p> <p>Dalila Bouadimi stayed with friends for two days after her son's death, unwilling to come home, and now wants the family to move. The bedroom Hichame shared with his sister is empty. Lamia is sleeping on a mattress in a room with her older brothers.</p> <p>\"She's lonely, she thinks something is missing and she keeps talking about him all the time,\" says Mr Bouadimi. \"They were close ages, very good friends. At school on Monday she&#xa0;came out at break and started looking for him in the playground because she forgot he passed away, she was calling out his name, and the teacher said: 'No, no \u2026 it's OK, OK.'\"</p> <p>When I leave his home, Mr Bouadimi says I&#xa0;must make sure to write in my article how kind the teachers, police and&#xa0;ambulance staff have all been to&#xa0;his&#xa0;family.</p> <h2>Road deaths on the rise: the numbers</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>12% </strong>\u2013 increase in drink driving between 2010 and 2011</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>8.3m</strong> \u2013 number of people in living in places with 20mph speed limit</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>12%</strong> \u2013 rise in pedestrian deaths between 2010 and 2011</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>1901</strong> \u2013 number of people killed on British roads last year</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>184</strong> \u2013 pedestrians aged 60+ killed last year</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>201</strong> \u2013 prosecutions for dangerous driving in 2010</p>",

  "<p>The amount of money invested in a \"sustainable and responsible\" manner in the UK has swelled to an estimated \u00a3275bn, a report has found. The study from Eurosif, the Brussels-based European Sustainable Investment Forum, claims that an exciting new phase in the development of ethical investment is now taking place in the UK. To mark National Ethical Investment Week, which starts on 14 October, Guardian Money looks at the latest themes on green finance and explains how you can join the ethical revolution.</p> <h2><strong>Rail:</strong> The right track for green investors</h2> <p>It says a lot about the changing nature of environmental investing that the latest theme in some portfolios is the glamour stock of the Victorian era \u2013 railway companies. Amid rising petrol prices and congested roads, many rail firms, particularly in the US, have enjoyed a renaissance, supported by environmental investors keen to see polluting trucks taken off the highways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648192\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041320018/Train-in-sunset-001.jpg\" alt=\"Train in sunset\" width=\"220\" height=\"139\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1970s and early 1980s many American railroad companies were on the verge of bankruptcy, having lost their passenger business to the car, and much of their freight as well. But they fought back with huge increases in fuel efficiency \u2013 America's railroads are three times more fuel efficient than sending freight by truck \u2013 and improved service reliability. Around 40% of freight in car-loving America is now carried by rail, a much higher figure than in Europe, while President Obama has agreed huge new federal investment in<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/16/barack-obama-high-speed-rail\" title=\"\"> high-speed passenger lines</a>.</p> <p>Shares in railroad companies have soared. <a href=\"http://www.up.com/\" title=\"\">Union Pacific</a>, which dates back to 1862 and dominates west of Chicago, was trading at $30-$35 in 2004 but shares now change hands at more than $120. In 2009, legendary investor Warren Buffett bought America's second biggest rail operator, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, in a deal valuing the company at $44bn, while CSX, the third biggest operator, has seen its share price quadruple since 2004.</p> <p>Truck companies that work with the railroads rather than compete with them, have also benefited. <a href=\"http://www.jbhunt.com/\" title=\"\">JB Hunt</a>, one of the biggest road hauliers in the US, partners with railroad firms to cut carbon emissions. As an example, it says, it can truck a shipment from a Procter &amp; Gamble plant in Delaware on the east coast to a rail freight terminal in Pennsylvania, then transport it by train to Chicago, where it is switched to another train to California, and for the last 100 miles by road truck \u2013 again to a Walmart store. So a 3,000 mile shipment travels just 150 miles by road.</p> <p>It tells customers: \"We can help you convert more of your over-the-road shipments to rail, saving you money and reducing greenhouse emissions by 50%.\" It's a win-win for customers, investors and the environment. JB Hunt's share price has jumped from $6 at the start of 2003 to $55 this week.</p> <p>Train companies form a key part of <a href=\"http://www.jupiteronline.com/\" title=\"\">Jupiter Ecology's</a> \u00a3340m portfolio, managed by Charlie Thomas. \"When investing in environmental solutions companies, rail businesses tick many important boxes,\" he says. \"They score well in terms of pollution abatement and efficient use of natural resources, while also responding favourably to the demographic challenges caused by a rising population (eg improving local air quality and reducing congestion).\"</p> <p>He has invested in Kansas City Southern, as well as Hub Group, which, like JB Hunt, is an \"intermodal\" company maximising efficiency between road and rail. But it's not just a US story. Jupiter Ecology counts East Japan Railway among his top 10 holdings.</p> <h2><strong>Water:</strong> the big new wave</h2> <p>Ten litres of water is used to produce just one single sheet of A4 paper. Around 850 litres of water is needed to irrigate, grow and process the oranges squeezed to produce one litre of juice. And if you buy steak mince this weekend, consider this: it will have taken 7,750 litres of water to produce a half-kilo pack that's enough to make a few burgers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041395163/An-orange-tree-001.jpg\" alt=\"An orange tree\" width=\"220\" height=\"144\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orange tree Photograph: Etsa/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Etsa/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's little wonder that environmentalists are deeply concerned about \"water stress\". Asia's industrial revolution is driving a vast increase in water demand \u2013 and the supply is running out. The United Nations reckons that if things stay as they are, by 2030 demand will exceed supply by 40%, leaving up to four billion people suffering acute shortages.</p> <p>Only 2.5% of the world's water is fresh, and two-thirds of it is in fast-melting polar ice and snow cover. China is particularly at risk as industrial expansion continues at a breakneck pace. The country has 21% of the world's population but only 7% of its available water. When countries industrialise, they use far more water. In the developed world, industry uses 42% of the water supply; in the developing world, 81% is used by agriculture. But as countries build power stations, steel plants and paper mills, their water consumption rockets.</p> <p>So how are ethical investors responding? Sue Round is head of investment at Ecclesiastical Insurance, which runs the <a href=\"http://www.ecclesiastical.com/foryou/investments/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Amity</a> range of green and ethical funds. Her starting point is encouraging water-intensive companies to disclose how much water they and their suppliers are using, through what's called the<a href=\"https://www.cdproject.net/water\" title=\"\"> Carbon Disclosure Water Project</a>. The project aims to put \"water stewardship\" at the heart of every company's business strategy.</p> <p>But is it having real impact? Round insists big companies are taking it seriously, citing Tesco as an example. It has worked with suppliers and factories to cut water usage by 300m litres a year. But while that's undoubtedly good for the environment, how does it help investors? Round points to Marks &amp; Spencer. \"It has made considerable water savings in recent years. All their environmental efficiencies have added significantly to their bottom line.\"</p> <p>The Amity International fund also invests in companies that are engineering solutions to the coming water crisis, such as recycling industrial and residential waste water. It holds shares in <a href=\"http://www.boustead.sg/\" title=\"\">Boustead</a>, a Singapore firm specialising in waste water engineering and whose products are in 800 water plants across the globe. \"Its treatment systems can safely return waste water to drinking water quality,\" says Round. Its share price is currently nearly $1, double the level of three years ago but still below the peak before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Ecclesiastical is also investing in desalination as a potential solution to water stress. It is estimated there are currently 543 ongoing desalination projects across 90 countries, each costing between $100m-$300m. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the biggest investors, but there are major projects in the US and China. Even Thames Water has spent \u00a3250m on a desalination plant in Beckton, east London, which can supply drinking water for one million Londoners, and Southern Water is considering one on the south coast.</p> <p>\"Advances in technology have turned a proven but essentially uneconomic activity (boiling seawater to produce distilled vapour) into one increasingly attractive as a solution to water scarcity via membrane osmosis,\" concluded Ecclesiastical in a research note earlier this year. It believes desalination will be a significant investment play for ethical investors, naming GE, Suez and Siemens as potential stock beneficiaries.</p> <p>And most green funds now have a portion of their portfolio dedicated to water stocks, while others, such as <a href=\"http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/library/fundview/CHP4/Pictet%20Water\" title=\"\">Pictet Water</a>, invest only in water.</p> <h2><strong>Agriculture:</strong> solutions, not speculation</h2> <p>Big agriculture and the ethical and green investment community rarely see eye to eye. Two years ago a Swiss investment research firm named agricultural firm Monsanto as the world's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/28/the-least-ethical-compani_n_440073.html\" title=\"\">least ethical company</a>. Many ethical investors also despise the billions pouring into food exchange-traded funds (ETFs), where speculators are cashing in on constricted supply and rising food prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648194\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041262831/Close-up-of-Sweet-Corn-US-001.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of Sweet Corn USA\" width=\"220\" height=\"137\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweetcorn USA Photograph:  /Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  /Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But one British agricultural firm is catching the attention of green investors worldwide. Genus, based in Basingstoke, is the former breeding division of the Milk Marketing Board and is regarded as the world leader in improving pig and cow herds. \"Basically it is seen as a&#xa0;green and ethical stock because it has developed techniques to reduce the amount of feed and water required to get meat on to people's tables,\" says Mark Hoskin of ethical financial advisers Holden &amp; Partners. Shares in Genus, now one of the 250 biggest stock market-quoted companies in Britain, have tripled since 2009 from 475p to 1474p this week. It is currently a top holding in Ecclesiastical's Amity fund.</p> <p>Other green and ethical fund managers focus on food quality. Triodos, the ethical bank, which is shortly to launch a sustainable equity fund, says food companies will make up around 12% of the portfolio. <a href=\"http://cheviot.co.uk/investment-funds/climate/factsheet\" title=\"\">Cheviot Climate Assets</a>, a&#xa0;relatively new environmental fund, has 13.4% of its fund in food, specialising in grain production and harvesting, food testing and food processing.</p> <p>The staple food stock, so to speak, of most green funds is <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/\" title=\"\">Whole Foods Market</a>, the US&#xa0;organic supermarket chain with an outpost in London's Kensington. It has earned a Waitrose-style reputation in the US, where its combination of high quality and high prices have prompted wags to label it \"Whole Pay Check\". But its share price has hit $100 in recent trading, compared with just $10 in early 2009, and significantly above its 2006 peak of $77. Jupiter Ecology's largest holding is <a href=\"https://www.unfi.com/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">United Natural Foods</a>, the biggest independent distributor of organic foods in North America. Despite the financial crisis, the squeeze on household budgets and rising unemployment, United Natural Foods' share price has increased from $25 to $60 over five years. When the credit crunch first struck, analysts reckoned that households would cut back on costly organic produce but it seems the opposite is true, in North America at least.</p> <p>\"The sector has grown by 10%-15% a&#xa0;year for the last 10 years but even after that it still only accounts for 4% of all grocery sales in America,\" says Charlie Thomas of Jupiter Ecology. \"However, the number of people putting an organic product in their supermarket basket has gone from 20% to 80% of households.\"</p> <p>Organic food suppliers and retailers may meet western levels for sustainable agriculture but John Ditchfield of ethical advisers <a href=\"http://www.barchestergreen.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Barchester Green</a> acknowledges they do little to alleviate hunger in poorer countries.

But this looks like an underestimate.</p> <p>Only last week, communities minister Don Foster launched a \"<a href=\"http://www.communityshares.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Community Shares Unit</a>\" to help local people become part-owners of much-loved assets and services such as their community pub or football club. Backed by the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/\" title=\"\">Department for Communities and Local Government</a>, and run by <a href=\"http://uk.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operatives UK</a> and <a href=\"http://locality.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Locality</a>, the unit aims to help more local enterprises use share offers to get projects up and running.</p> <p>There is clearly an appetite for such schemes: earlier this year, a share offer for a community solar power station called <a href=\"http://www.westmillsolar.coop/\" title=\"\">Westmill</a> on the Oxfordshire/Wiltshire border raised more than \u00a34m in just six weeks.</p> <p>With these schemes there is usually a minimum investment, which is sometimes as low as \u00a310-\u00a350 but, more typically, \u00a3200-\u00a3250. The projected investment returns can vary, though 4%-6% a year is not uncommon.</p> <p>There does not appear to be a \"one-stop-shop\" website that rounds up all the community projects across the country that are looking for investors. However, both the Community Shares Unit and the <a href=\"http://communitysharesfund.coop/\" title=\"\">Community Shares Fund</a> feature details of current and past share offers.</p> <p>Guardian Money will continue to highlight some of the more interesting schemes that come to our attention. For example, ethical investors in Great Britain are being encouraged to look across the Irish Sea and invest in Northern Ireland's first community-owned wind energy co-operative.</p> <p><a href=\"http://drumlin.coop/home.asp\" title=\"\">Drumlin Wind Energy Co-operative</a> has plans to operate five 250kW turbines north of Belfast, and has already raised \u00a31.6m, which will fund the first two. Individuals, businesses and organisations can invest between \u00a3250 and \u00a320,000; it believes it can offer an average annual return of 7% to 10% over 20 years. The share offer is open until 30 November.</p> <p>Another site worth checking is <a href=\"https://www.abundancegeneration.com/\" title=\"\">Abundance</a>, which describes itself as a \"community finance platform\" allowing people to put money into UK renewable energy schemes and receive a regular cash return based on the energy produced. It currently has two projects open: a wind turbine in the Forest of Dean, and a scheme to install solar panels on homes in the South Downs.</p>",
  "<p>Ethical, sustainable, environmental and socially responsible investing covers a broad range of very different investments, so first decide on your personal priorities. Secondly, decide if you want to pay a financial adviser to help, or whether you feel confident enough to do it yourself.</p> <h2><strong>The financial adviser route</strong></h2> <p>Try the <a href=\"http://ethicalinvestment.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Ethical Investment Association</a>'s site, which lists specialist advisers in your area. From the end of this year, commission will be banned, so you will have to pay a direct fee rather than commission built into the price of the fund.</p> <h2><strong>The DIY route</strong></h2> <p>There is now a vast amount of data and information online to help you. But don't just tap \"ethical investment\" into Google: you may be steered into unwise timber and wind investments. A good starting point is <a href=\"http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/\" title=\"\">Worldwise Investor</a>, which, after you register, lists most funds and their performance. The organisers of <a href=\"http://www.neiw.org/consumers\" title=\"\">National Ethical Investment Week</a> also have an overview for new investors.</p> <h2><strong>Types of funds</strong></h2> <p>Traditional ethical funds typically use a combination of negative screens (to eliminate tobacco, arms, gambling etc) and positive screens to favour businesses with a good record on corporate social responsibility or that are involved in environmentally-friendly or low-carbon industries, such as renewable energy or waste management. Green funds are less about negative screening and focus instead on companies actively engaged in improving the environment. But as Jason Hollands of Bestinvest says: \"The reality is most companies do not neatly fit into good or bad' but are shades of grey. Views on which stocks to include are often finely balanced, such as supermarkets, which on the one hand may stock lots of Fairtrade goods, but can stand accused of squeezing other suppliers or putting small, local shops out of business.\"</p> <h2><strong>Buying a fund</strong></h2> <p>DIY investors should visit an online fund supermarket, where you can buy and manage funds at low cost. If you wait until the end of the year, you should be able to purchase units at an underlying charge of around 0.75% to the fund manager and around 0.25% to the fund supermarket \u2013 and save on the 0.5% of your total investment that has in the past been paid out every year to a financial adviser.

  "<h2><strong>My overseas job has turned sour despite my strong work ethic</strong></h2> <p><strong>I work for a big international organisation, and six months ago moved from one overseas office to another. I have moved around the world quite a lot, so am aware it takes time and patience to shift between countries.</strong></p> <p><strong>When I arrived, I realised the manager was barely managing the staff, there was low capacity and one colleague was under-delivering. In order to get some support from this person, I had to take over the day-to-day management and coaching for him, and have been passed all the work that has remained undone in the previous months, as well as my own heavy workload.</strong></p> <p><strong>On top of this, my manager completed a performance review with me, in which my work was praised but comments were made about my character and style with which I&#xa0;disagreed. I asked her to review it and she referred to three instances where she felt I had been offensive to her, but didn't offer specifics. I&#xa0;believe she is feeling defensive and challenged on her management weaknesses.</strong></p> <p><strong>I think the situation is being manipulated to cast aspersions on my character, and despair that I am doomed to fail. I am also wary of going to HR who, from advice I have previously taken, are unlikely to do anything, or are more likely to support a manager in any dispute. I&#xa0;am very distressed that I am in a new job and a&#xa0;new country and in this situation, and it is beginning to affect my happiness and certainly my ability to deliver at work. I feel burnt out, stressed and depressed.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Your letter leads me to two general conclusions. First, that you are probably accurate in your analysis of your new manager's state of mind. And secondly, because you're seriously stressed and depressed, you're now magnifying the problems you face. Let me take the second point first.</p> <p>You are employed by an international organisation and have worked for them successfully in a number of different countries. Their central records will confirm that and will include positive references from previous managers. You must not allow yourself to believe that your reputation within the company depends crucially on this one manager's opinion, formed over the last six months. (And even this manager has already recommended you for a performance-recognition bonus.) So, please try to relax a little.</p> <p>Then, put yourself in your&#xa0;manager's place. She must be aware of her shortcomings; you spotted them immediately. She would also have noticed the way that you took it upon yourself to become the unofficial manager and mentor of your under-performing colleague. Admirable though this was, you must see that, to her, it would have seemed an implicit \u2013 and very public \u2013 affirmation of her own inadequacy. She knows you are good; but finds your manner uncomfortable. She may well be looking for reasons to justify her feelings but I very much doubt if she's out to get you.</p> <p>Managers are assessed like everyone else. Those responsible for assessing your manager will be aware both of her failings and her defensiveness. Please don't despair; and please don't get into a state of open challenge with her. I&#xa0;know it shouldn't be necessary for people to make allowances for their inadequate bosses \u2013 but it very often is.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Adopting an \"adult\" approach is likely to be most effective. Why not explain to her that you are very keen to understand how you can be most effective in this new setting, and explain how you have worked in the past and the sort of operating relationship you have built with previous managers. Let her know that you are positive and committed to the role.</p> <p>Explain that if she feels there has been some behaviour that she finds uncomfortable or even unacceptable then it is important that she tells you as quickly as possible if you are to build a positive relationship. It may also be worth suggesting a one-to-one meeting outside the normal performance management arrangement to review how you have settled in and discuss longer-term objectives and ideas. <strong>tetters</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Do your job well, help where you can, but don't try to be the one-person solution to every problem. No one will ever thank you for it. <strong>Imsava</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your performance review should have a place for you to comment on your performance. If it does, don't use it to get back at your manager \u2013 use it to set out your successes and how you've shaped them in line with the local culture. However tempting it is to help others, unless your manager has specifically asked you to, do it at your peril. <strong>kathjones</strong></p> <h2><strong>How do I find a career that suits the skills gained in my degree?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I'm going to graduate with a 2:2&#xa0;degree from a top-four university in chemistry with Spanish. I'm worried as I don't think any graduate jobs will be open to me apart from teaching. In addition to speaking Spanish fluently, I speak French. Help please! I don't even like any of the other professions (ie I want to stay away from finance, banking, marketing).</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I wonder why you haven't mentioned your chemistry degree? There must have been some reason \u2013 even some interest \u2013 that led you to take the subject in the first place. Why do you seem to have abandoned it?</p> <p>You seem to know pretty clearly what you don't want to do yet seem to have little idea what you would like to do. Concentrate on that. You're not limited by the nature of your degree. Your languages do more than qualify you to teach: in almost all sectors of business life (entertainment, import/export, travel and leisure, journalism, pharmaceuticals) there will be jobs for which your Spanish and French would be a valuable bonus to an employer. You must know what gets your brain and imagination working. Follow that instinct. Don't go for the fatter starting salary: go for what you'd almost be prepared to pay to be allowed to do. And only you can know what that is.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Check out the websites of the entry programmes for global companies that work in English and have R&amp;D, and see what's on offer. With your skills mix, that could possibly include a wide range of R&amp;D chemistry (not only industrial, but beautycare, food science etc) and perhaps also bio-tech, but also a lot of non-R&amp;D options (eg&#xa0;patent attorney). <strong>Oommph</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It sounds as though you're looking at individual careers and sectors and deciding whether they interest you. How about taking a slightly different approach and making a list of the skills you have and, of those, which you enjoy exercising and why. Then look for jobs that might allow you to use those talents. <strong>readie</strong></p> <p><strong>For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to </strong><a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\" title=\"dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\"><strong>dear.jeremy@theguardian.com</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Earlier this year, two American bloggers triggered a global media&#xa0;convulsion by embarking on what they called a <a href=\"http://www.the-beheld.com/2011/05/why-im-not-looking-in-mirror-for-month.html\" title=\"\">\"mirror fast\"</a>: covering the mirrors in their homes, and shunning mirrors elsewhere, in&#xa0;an effort to reduce what one of them called \"the overriding self-consciousness that's taken up residence in my psyche\". Since the social pressure to conform to ideals of&#xa0;beauty falls mainly on women, I&#xa0;can only guess what it's like to be so aware of one's appearance: I assume it's related to what I feel whenever a badly-angled photo reminds me how astoundingly bald I&#xa0;am. But for the fasters, the experiment proved a liberation. \"All&#xa0;the other interests in my life \u2013 my&#xa0;goals, passions, friends, family, favourite hobbies, etc \u2013 have attracted the energy and attention I used to give to my looks,\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/fashion/mirror-fasts-help-take-the-focus-off-yourself.html\" title=\"\">wrote Kjerstin Gruys</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/19/mirror-fasting-self-image-beauty\" title=\"\">Autumn Whitefield-Madrano said</a> she felt \"calmer and more serene\". They'd pulled off an ingenious psychological trick. In a world obsessed with appearances, it's impractical just to&#xa0;decide you're going to think differently. What they'd done, instead, was to deny themselves the feedback that fuelled the fixation.</p> <p>Which is striking, because almost every other approach to health and happiness assumes the opposite: that more feedback is always good. The way to get fit, we're told, is to track miles jogged and weights lifted; to get slim, you track calories; and the first law of time management is to keep a detailed log, to see what you're really doing with your day. Reflecting an increasingly popular approach, the website <a href=\"http://www.moodscope.com/login\" title=\"\">moodscope.com</a> uses mood-tracking to combat depression. There's an entire \"personal informatics\" movement, mentioned here previously, whose members use <a href=\"http://www.fitbit.com/\" title=\"\">smartphones and other devices</a> to turn their lives into data, so as to identify patterns and make improvements. (Join the fun at <a href=\"http://quantifiedself.com/\" title=\"\">quantifiedself.com</a>.) But mirror fasts are a reminder that more feedback isn't necessarily for the best.</p> <p>In a parallel exercise last month, Steven Corona, a tech entrepreneur from South Carolina, <a href=\"http://stevecorona.com/living-without-time\" title=\"\">\"unsubscribed from the clock\"</a>: \"I&#xa0;dropped my watch right into the garbage. Shut off the glowing green-blue digital clocks that seem to piggyback on every appliance known to man...\" He&#xa0;switched his iPhone to a random time zone (and did, he admits, continue to use its calendar to notify him of appointments). Much mockery followed: clock-fasting, critics rightly noted, wasn't an option for those who had to show up at an office by 9am daily. Still, as a compulsive watch-checker, I was inspired. After a few disorienting days, Corona says, his stress levels plummeted; he lost himself in projects, and learned to \"read the sun\". Insomniacs are advised to hide their clocks, because what doctors call <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22932731\" title=\"\">\"nocturnal time-monitoring behaviour\"</a> is relaxation's greatest foe. Corona simply took that principle to its conclusion.</p> <p>You, of course, may have no hang-ups about mirrors or clocks. But it can be illuminating to ask if you've got other sources of feedback you might be better off without. Bathroom-scale readings? Bank-balance checking? All have their place. But all are also subject to the problem with personal feedback: once you've developed the habit of measuring something, it's hard to resist the conclusion that that thing matters. Maybe it doesn't. (And even if it does, maybe intuition would serve you better.) Sometimes, there may be data about ourselves we're better off not knowing.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Follow Oliver on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliverburkeman\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Magnus Carlsen is on the brink of breaking Garry Kasparov's all-time record rating of 2,851 points after the 21-year-old world No1 made a brilliant recovery from his poor start in the Grand Slam final which ends on Saturday in Bilbao.</p> <p>The Norwegian, who had lost to Fabiano Caruana in the S\u00e3o Paulo stage, defeated the Italian in their return game at Bilbao, then won his next game to share the lead. Then, on Friday night, he crushed the reigning world champion, Vishy Anand, with a classic attack in 30 moves. Victory on Saturday afternoon against the world No2, Levon Aronian, would break Kasparov's record.</p> <p>Aronian v Carlsen can be viewed free and live on the internet and can be followed (3.30pm start) at chessbomb.com which has move-by-move computer assessments and online spectator comments.</p> <p>Ratings measure a player's overall current performance and are published monthly by Fide, the global chess body. Masters are rated 2,400 up, grandmasters 2,600 up and elite GMs 2,700 up. Only six players have surpassed 2,800. Bobby Fischer's peak was only 2,785 and some believe there has been significant rating inflation in the last 25 years. Recent rule changes mean that even a weak amateur can now speedily qualify for a Fide international rating by competing in a couple of the weekend congresses which are staged frequently in all parts of the UK.</p> <p>Carlsen's win from Caruana made a great impression as the No1 coaxed a strategic endgame win from a seemingly barren position. One commentator called it \"gold from lead\". Carlsen also showed his own solution to computer-analysed openings. He began with 1 e4 e6 2 d3, harmless but giving just the tiny edge he needed. Next day a calm Exchange French with exd5 led in his hands to a decisive king's side attack.</p> <p>White's 16 h4! tempted f6? 17 Bxg6! fxg5 18 fxg5 and Qh5, while three moves later 19...f6?

Last Christmas one of their organisers asked a child what he wanted for Christmas only to be told that he wanted a blanket to keep out of the cold.</p> <p>\"We never finished the war on poverty that was started in the 1960s\", said Hart as she describes how the organisation operates in half the counties of West Virginia. In some, the run-down coal towns of the south, median incomes are $16,000, barely a third of the US average. Hart says the real unemployment rate is well above 20%.</p> <p>Asked how West Virginia has coped with the recession, she replied: \"There wasn't much here to start with and it's getting worse.\"</p> <p>Poverty and inequality were supposed to big issues in this year's campaign. The growing gulf between rich and poor became a hot issue in 2011 as a result of the Occupy Wall Street protests, and the latest official figures show things getting worse, not better. Of the 34 rich-country members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, only Chile, Mexico and Turkey are more unequal.</p> <p>But for all president Barack Obama's rhetoric over taxing the 1% or the brief firestorm that followed the disparaging remarks Mitt Romney made about the 47% he claimed \"pay no income tax\", many feel the plight of America's poor is being ignored.</p> <p>Martin Gilens, politics professor at Princeton university, said: \"Both parties are highly dependent on affluent donors to fund their campaigns. Neither party has seen it as a particularly advantageous issue to push. That's why inequality has pretty much never been an issue either the Democrats or the Republicans has embraced in this country.\"</p> <p>The share of national income of the richest 1% more than doubled between 1980 and 2008, from 8% to 18%. They make an average of $1.3m in after-tax income, while the poorest 20% take home $17,700.</p> <p>Richard Freeman, economics professor at Harvard, said: \"It's clearly a problem. Even conservatives would see that if the trend were to continue it would be devastating. Imagine the trend going on for another decade or two. Most people would say that would be dangerous\".</p> <p>Already, the risks to the American economy have become apparent. Stagnating real incomes in the three decades leading up to the financial crash of 2007 left many US citizens increasingly hooked on debt. Robert Frank, economics professor at Cornell university says American corporations have forgotten Henry Ford's insight: workers need to be paid wages high enough for them to buy the goods they are producing.</p> <p>West Virginia, the US's second poorest state after Mississippi, has always struggled. The coal mining industry has slashed jobs as it has gone high tech, the steel industry is gone and its mountainous terrain presents physical obstacles to doing business. But in this recession it has been hit yet again.</p> <p>While Romney pledges to cut entitlements, people on a minimum wage of $7.65 an hour struggle to meet even their most basic needs. At the Bread Basket, a drop-off point for Appalachian Outreach in Ritchie County, people line up for food parcels. Grits, dried pasta, tinned food, basic necessities for those whose money runs out at the end of the month.</p> <p>Annie Owens has been organising the drop-off for 28 years and says now is the worst time she can remember. She has had to restrict the handout to the elderly and disabled in order to cope with the demand, \"People put their pride aside and come and get it\", she said.</p> <p>One of those collecting a food parcel, pensioner Barbara Smith, said: \"It's important to us. It helps us go from month to month. You have to make up your mind whether it's your medicine or your food\".</p> <p>Asked whether poverty was an issue in the election for America's politicians, Owens was emphatic. \"This is not an issue for them. If we tell them this is going on they don't believe us. They think we are hillbillies, that this is our choice, that this is the way we want to live. But often it's not choice, it's not the way people want to live our lives. They forget about the small people.\"</p> <p>For some life is getting better. Fracking, the controversial method for producing natural gas, is creating jobs. Pipelines too are being built across the mountainous terrain. There are jobs blowing the tops off mountains for coal. But the majority of these jobs are short term, low paid and benefit free. Once the job is done, there is nothing to fall back on.</p> <p>Hart worries about the environmental impact of allowing energy firms to rip up West Virginia's stunning landscape. \"What do you do for tourism when you blow up a mountain top? People want jobs and there's nothing else,\" she said.</p> <p>Freeman, Gilens and Frank said there were policies that could help: full employment, changes to the tax code to make it more progressive; much greater investment in education; reform of campaign financing to break the stranglehold of rich donors.</p> <p>Obama's healthcare reform apart, there has been little evidence that America's political class is interested in this sort of agenda.

  "<p>The White House was under intense pressure on Friday to disclose whether any senior administration officials were aware of requests for increased diplomatic security in Libya ahead of the fatal 9/11 attack in Benghazi, following Joe Biden's insistence in the vice-presidential debate that \"we weren't told\".</p> <p>The Republicans have gone on the offensive over Biden's remarks, claiming he misled the American people by claiming ignorance over security concerns in advance of the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi in which the ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. Early on in the TV debate, the vice-president said: \"We weren't told they wanted more security; we did not know they wanted more security.\"</p> <p>Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, came under repeated questioning during Friday's news briefing about what precisely Biden had meant when he made that comment. The Romney campaign has seized upon testimony given to a congressional committee the day before the debate that suggested requests for beefed-up diplomatic security had indeed been made to the Obama administration before the 11 September attack.</p> <p>Carney said that Biden's \"we weren't told\" remark related specifically and only to the White House. \"The vice-president was speaking about himself and the president and the White House. He was not referring to the administration.\"</p> <p>Carney added that there were countless diplomatic facilities around the world and it was left to security experts in the state department to ensure adequate protection for embassy staff abroad.</p> <p>In a news conference almost exclusively dominated by the Benghazi issue, Carney tried to turn the controversy back on the Republicans by accusing Republican congress members of slashing the budget for diplomatic security \"in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest 2% in this country\". Under the budget proposal of Paul Ryan, Romney's running mate, non-military discretionary funding would be cut by 19% by 2014, which the Obama campaign has calculated would lead to a cut of $300m in embassy security.</p> <p>Carney also accused the Romney campaign of trying to \"politicise this, to turn this into a campaign issue.\" He said: \"That's a shame when we're talking about brave men and women in our diplomatic service who represent the American people.\"</p> <p>But Carney's counter-punches are unlikely to hold back the wave of questions that the Obama administration is now facing over exactly what it knew and when about requests for extra protection in Libya before the attack. The press spokesman repeatedly side-stepped questions from reporters about whether Obama had been informed about several previous threats to attack the Benghazi consulate in the days leading up to 11 September.</p> <p>\"I cannot get into the specific details of a classified briefing,\" he said, adding \"there was no actionable intelligence that suggested there would be an attack at the Benghazi facility.\"</p> <p>As the White House tried to fight back the flames of the Benghazi controversy, leading Republicans fanned them. Newt Gingrich, a failed candidate for the Republican nomination now backing Romney, predicted on CBS television Friday morning that Biden's remarks on Benghazi would \"haunt them from now until the next debate\".</p> <p>A senior Romney adviser, Dan Senor, questioned the administration's grasp of vital national security issues. He said Biden's comment had pointed to \"the larger failures of the administration to be completely transparent about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi and the security situations leading up to the attacks.\"</p> <p>Even before Thursday night's debate, pressure was mounting on the administration over whether it had done enough to protect US diplomatic staff in Libya. On Wednesday the congressional oversight and government reform committee was presented with a diplomatic cable sent on 2 August by Stevens to the state department in Washington asking for an additional 11 security personnel to be added to the rotation of 24. Though the 11 were to replace temporary security staff who were leaving, Stevens made clear in the cable that violence and terrorism were a threat amid a volatile political landscape.</p> <p>He wrote: \"Due to the level of threat in regards to crime, political violence and terrorism, post feels this is an appropriate number of LES [locally employed staff] security personnel needed to further embassy diplomatic outreach missions. Violent security incidents continue to take place due to the lack of a coherent national Libyan security force and the strength of local militias and large numbers of armed groups.</p> <p>\"Host national security support is lacking and cannot be depended on to provide a safe and secure environment.\"</p> <p>The Republican-controlled committee also heard from two former US security chiefs in Libya who testified that they had found it impossible to get the message across back home that security was a critical problem.</p> <p>Andrew Wood, former head of a US military team in Libya, told the committee that \"the security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there\". He added that the head of US security in the region had pushed for more people \"but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with\".</p> <p>Eric Nordstrom, the former security chief for US diplomats in Libya, said that in his view he had been fighting a losing battle over numbers in which \"we couldn't even keep what we had\". Pointedly, he said that he concluded after contact with state department bosses that \"we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident\".</p>",

  "<p>The dozens of colourful bars and coffee shops in central Cork, along the banks of the river Lee, are still bustling as money flows into the city's tills \u2013 despite Ireland's precarious finances \u2013 from tourism, surrounding dairy farms and the presence of IT giants such as Apple.</p> <p>But the self-styled rebel city \u2013 harking back to its fiercely independent roots \u2013 could be about to move up a gear as it vies to become the Irish equivalent of Aberdeen and the centre of a new oil industry.</p> <p>The billionaire O'Reilly dynasty is promising to develop the country's first oilfield following new analysis of drilling results that suggests they have struck black gold in the Celtic Sea.</p> <p>Shares in Providence Resources, in which the former Irish rugby star and media magnate Tony O'Reilly is an investor and his son \u2013 another Tony \u2013 is chief executive, have soared from 180p a year ago to 686p as a result of the latest findings from its Barryroe field, off Cork, and increasing excitement about other prospects all around the coast.</p> <p>You might expect the locals to be celebrating, and certainly one middle-aged gambler, perched on a cushioned stool before a slot-machine at the Gold Rush casino on MacCurtain Street, is delighted. \"Good luck to those guys,\" she says over piped music, her eyes glued to neon dollar notes whirling in front of her. \"An oil discovery has got to be a good thing, hasn't it? It could bring jobs, which would stop all our children having to go abroad to London and Canada.\"</p> <p>But claims that the once-mighty Celtic Tiger has a chance to reinvent itself \u2013 this time as a petroleum state \u2013 are met with indifference elsewhere.</p> <p>Alan Duff, who runs the St Gabriel's Credit Union on St Patrick's Quay, around the corner from the Gold Rush, is more than well-acquainted with the debts of a hard-hit nation. He is more downbeat about the oil find.</p> <h2><strong>Petrol price</strong></h2> <p>\"It's hard to get excited about this,\" says the sharp-suited but softly spoken manager. \"You know the government have given away the leases for next to nothing and even if the oil is ever brought ashore it will not lead to a fall in the price of petrol.\"</p> <p>Out on the coast, closer to the waters where Providence has made its mark, there is also scepticism \u2013 plus worries about the impact that oil can have on the environment.</p> <p>Rory Jackson, who makes a now frugal living fixing up old yachts, says too many false dawns have been declared by the oil industry for him to get excited. \"These stories always seem to coincide with the government announcing tax increases,\" he says, pointing to punitive budget cuts to child benefit expected in December.</p> <p>The locals' reluctance to celebrate is understandable, not least because there have been some high-profile setbacks in the Irish oil and gas business, such as Ramco Energy's Seven Heads gas field producing water as well as gas at one stage. Shell has taken more than a decade to develop the Corrib gas field due to popular opposition to a pipeline route and the O'Reilly family's bid to become Ewing-type oil barons is not exactly new.</p> <p>The family have been the driving force behind the Barryroe field and its promised 100,000 barrels a day potential for almost 30 years, and have been involved with several discoveries that ultimately went nowhere.</p> <p>O'Reilly Jr acknowledges this. \"But that is why this is important,\" he says. \"My father must have sunk $60m or $70m into searching for oil and gas. Now we believe he is vindicated.\"</p> <p>Providence announced this week that its latest assessments of the Celtic Sea field indicated recoverable reserves of 280m barrels \u2013 far more than ever before and worth about \u00a320bn at today's prices.</p> <p>O'Reilly is in no doubt that this is the big one everyone had been waiting for. \"What we are announcing is the beginning of that [oil] industry. We hope there is a renaissance of international companies who come to Ireland and help us exploit our natural resources.\"</p> <h2><strong>Overtures</strong></h2> <p>O'Reilly claims he has had \"overtures\" from oil companies in Asia and America as well as Europe which are willing to share the risk \u2013 and potential $1bn (\u00a3620m) cost \u2013 of the first-phase development. ExxonMobil, the world's largest non-state-owned oil company, is already a partner with Providence at another offshore site, Dunquin in the Atlantic basin, where the two companies hope to start drilling in 2013.</p> <p>O'Reilly wants the oil to be landed in Ireland and refined locally but says a partner would be needed for this too. There is already a refinery at Whitegate, near Cork, plus a deep-water harbour that would provide a base for support vessels needed to develop the oilfield.</p> <p>But the biggest prize for Ireland would be if the Barryroe scheme develops as O'Reilly hopes \u2013 and triggers a resurgence of interest not only in the Celtic Sea but in other regions.</p> <p>Gas has been piped from the Kinsale Head field off Cork for 30 years and there have been other oil finds around the coastline, but none have been big enough to be worth developing. Now the economics have changed \u2013 as a result of higher energy prices, lower taxes and new drilling techniques \u2013 for fields such as Barryroe. \"We are leading the charge but we hope our success causes others to think about Ireland again,\" says O'Reilly. \"People are going to far-flung regions such as the Arctic, when they could be active in much more benign conditions.\"</p> <p>John Mullins, president of the Cork chamber of commerce and boss of the state-owned gas group Bord G\u00e1is, says foreign investment from IT and pharmaceutical groups has kept the region more buoyant than many others during the big economic downturn. Nevertheless, oil could help stem unemployment, which is nearly 10%. \"I'm not an expert in geology or seismology but all the information suggests quite a significant commercial find,\" says Mullins, who has already set up an oil and gas exploration group at the chamber. \"Whether it proves to be a false dawn or not, we need to be ready with partners to help.\"</p> <p>Also hoping for an oil boom is the Port of Cork. Executives there have already put forward plans for a \u20ac40m (\u00a332m) new multi-purpose terminal. This is mainly to handle containerised traffic but could be used for the oil support business, they explain. The dock managers have already received a delegation of Exxon executives.</p> <p>Foreign companies seem to be the key to much of what happens in Ireland at present. As one property manager said: \"When you talk to one of these large [overseas] firms it is like people from another planet. They are full of hope and optimism whereas locals have had so much bad news that cannot conceive anything getting better. No one in Ireland, perhaps O'Reilly aside, wants to take a risk: they're full of fear.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is facing mounting pressure to spell out precisely what activities it regards as high-risk \"casino-style\" investment banking \u2013 which are to be ringfenced from traditional savings and loans to safeguard the banking system.</p> <p>Publishing a draft banking reform bill , Treasury minister Greg Clark said: \"We want to ensure that taxpayers are protected whilst retaining our status as a global financial centre. The government remains on course to have all ICB [Independent Commission on Banking,] legislation in place by the end of this parliament.\"</p> <p>But Andrew Tyrie, the MP leading the scrutiny of the government's banking reforms as chairman of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, is annoyed at the lack of clarity in the bill. He wanted to know which recommendations from the ICB \u2013 better known as the Vickers' commission after chairman Sir John Vickers \u2013 the government wants to jettison. In broad terms the proposals have been endorsed enthusiastically by the chancellor, George Osborne, who is pressing to get the bill formally before parliament early next year. There are similar moves to erect a EU-wide regulatory ringfence in banking were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/02/bankers-bonuses-bonds-eu-report\" title=\"\">unveiled this month by European commissioner Michel Barnier</a>.</p> <p>But Tyrie raised concerns over a lack of detail in the draft bill and wants clarity on whether or not controversial interest rate swaps \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/29/banks-fsa-review-compensation-payouts?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">derivatives found to be at the centre of widespread mis-selling scandals</a> \u2013 will sit within the ringfence.</p> <p>The Treasury is understood to have written to Tyrie seeking his views on which side of the ring-fence interest rate swaps sold to small business should sit.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Tyrie said: \"The draft bill appears to leave a lot of detail to be determined in secondary legislation. We will press vigorously to find out what that is going to contain. Only by doing so will anyone \u2013 the industry, bank customers, parliament and the public \u2013 be able to find out what this legislation really means for them.\" Despite the importance of this legislation, MPs have less time to scrutinise the proposed laws than is typical as all sides recognise the need to get the bill into law as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Tyrie will next week issue a call for written evidence from banking experts in response to Friday's draft bill to be submitted as soon as possible. His commission must deliver its scrutiny report on the banking reform bill by 18 December, and will then produce a second, wider report on standards in banking which is expected to be published in the new year.</p> <p>The commission will host veteran American regulator Paul Volcker next Wednesday and is expected to question him on the scepticism he has already voiced over ring-fencing. The former chairman of the Federal Reserve is often cited as the intellectual forebear of Vickers. He is credited with coining the so-called \"Volcker rule\", which seeks to prevent commercial banks from owning hedge fund-type operations and using their own money to take high risk bets on the markets.</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9561349/Gentle-giant-Paul-Volcker-has-too-little-time-left-to-fix-the-world.html\" title=\"\">Volcker told one newspaper</a>: \"In my experience ring-fencing is not terribly effective ... It only works in fair weather, but doesn't work in foul weather. They have already run into problems and they are bound to run into more.</p> <p>\"John [Vickers] and I have the same concerns in mind. But the logic would be to separate the two parts of banking, not to keep them within the same institution. I find it puzzling to suggest that within one organisation you can have a branch that is entirely independent of another subsidiary, with the confidence that never the twain shall meet?\"</p>",
  "<p>A British financial group has been urged to take action after six indigenous protesters in Guatemala were shot dead by the military during a demonstration against an electricity price increase by one of the group's utilities.</p> <p>Nine soldiers including a colonel will go on trial over the deadly crackdown, which aimed to clear a road of demonstrators opposed to rising energy bills issued by Energuate, a company majority-owned by Actis, a private investment firm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/02/uk-sells-share-emerging-markets-actis\" title=\"\">spun off from CDC, Britain's development finance arm,</a> in 2004.</p> <p>People who took part in the protest against Energuate said Actis and the Guatemalan government must prevent similar incidents.</p> <p>\"Our demands need to be listened to \u2026 As indigenous people we are consuming their energy, but they are getting rich off the people,\" said Juana Celestina Batz Puac, who lives in Totonicap\u00e1n and witnessed the killings. \"Our actions are directly linked to electricity.\"</p> <p>Energy rates for peasant families in Totonicap\u00e1n have more than doubled in the past year to \u00a37.33 a month, according to Batz. \"This is way too much,\" she said.</p> <p>Representatives of the 48 communities of Totonicap\u00e1n, a highland municipality with a majority Maya-K'iche' population, erected blockades on the Inter-American Highway on 4 October to protest against the price increase and other measures they deemed unfavourable to indigenous people, including constitutional amendments and a revision of the teacher training programme.</p> <p>According to a UN report released on Thursday, demonstrators threw stones at troops in three army vehicles, who responded by teargassing the crowd. As people tried to flee, soldiers opened fire with live ammunition, killing six people, the report said.</p> <p>Thirty-three demonstrators and 13 army personnel were injured in the confrontation.</p> <p>Members of the 48 communities pay for street lighting they say does not reach them. In May, locals occupied Energuate offices in Totonicap\u00e1n to demand the cancellation of a contract for public lighting.</p> <p>The electricity company said it was not to blame: \"Fundamentally this situation produced a conflict that we didn't cause,\" said Maynor Amezquita, a communications and external relations officer with Energuate. \"We only charge what the [National Electric Energy Commission] stipulates that we can charge.\"</p> <p>Amezquita said municipalities set the price of electricity for streetlights and public lighting, and the company billed homeowners for the service.</p> <p>Energuate, formerly named Deocsa and owned by Gas Natural Fenosa, was purchased by Actis in May 2011. It supplies electricity to 1.4 million people in Guatemala's rural areas, covering 94% of the country's land mass.</p> <p>Actis said it was \"very distressed by these recent incidents. Like others, we believe that the current system of paying for street lighting through a flat charge on customers' energy bills is unfair. We continue to lobby the Guatemalan government to change it. Actis made a significant investment in the energy sector in Guatemala in May 2011. We are committed to providing high quality reliable electricity to customers at the right price.\"</p>",
  "<p>He's the City's kingmaker, who would have decided the future of BAE Systems \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/angela-merkel-bae-eads-merger?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">if the Germans hadn't got there first</a> \u2013 and who ejects FTSE 100 bosses from their jobs and who virtually controls Britain's tobacco companies through multibillion-pound stakes.</p> <p>But unlike some of his peers, the man wielding such financial power is no Oxbridge educated City stereotype operating from the lavish interior of a tower in the Square Mile.</p> <p>Based in an unassuming business park on a side street in Henley-on-Thames, Neil Woodford presides over the investments of small investors who have poured \u00a330bn into his Invesco Perpetual funds.</p> <p>For a decade, the 52-year-old's funds have been the darling of financial advisers and private investors alike. Billions of pounds have gushed in, much of it from \u00a350 a month savers and \u00a35,000 Isa deposits that, multiplied many times over, give him immense influence.</p> <p>His funds are the biggest shareholders in 30 of the companies in the FTSE 250. What he says matters. The City believes it was he who forced out Astra Zeneca's chief executive, David Brennan, in April as the shareholder spring of investor revolts against executive pay got under way.</p> <p>His style is usually to push for change from behind the scenes, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/oct/08/bae-opponent-fund-manager-neil-woodford?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">his frustration with BAE's romance with Airbus owner EADS exploded into the open on Monday</a> when he pressed the equivalent of a nuclear button by going public with his opposition to the tie-up. To prove he was serious, he hired bankers from Ondra Partners \u2013 whose sharp line-up of partners include the former Amersham boss Sir William Castell. By Wednesday the bid was over, killed by German government opposition. Had it limped on, the opposition of a man controlling more than 13% of the shares would have been hard to overcome.</p> <p>It is evidence of how Woodford, who summons FTSE 100 bosses to his Henley headquarters rather than travelling to the City, uses his power. To many, he is an example of what John Kay, commissioned by the government to encourage long-term investment, should look for in a fund manager, holding shares for 15 years rather than switching in and out in search of a quick buck.</p> <p>A farmer in his spare time with a degree from Exeter in agricultural economics, Woodford got his breakthrough during the technology bubble, which brought both the best and worst of times. In the 1990s he built up a solid reputation at Perpetual, a relatively small but fast-growing investment house he had joined in 1988. His funds out-performed but the headlines still belonged to others: Carol Galley at Mercury, Anthony Bolton at Fidelity and his own boss at Perpetual, Sir Martyn Arbib.</p> <p>As global stock markets were swept up in the technology, media and telecoms exuberance, Woodford stood back. He refused to buy \"new economy\" stocks and by early 2000 his one-year performance was the worst in the market. He fell off the major financial adviser buy lists, with one telling the Mail on Sunday that Woodford had \"missed the investment boat&#xa0;\u2026 He is becoming more intransigent. Maybe his pride is getting in the way.\"</p> <p>Then, from 2000 to 2003, the FTSE collapsed. Woodford's funds went up. His holdings in \"old economy\" businesses survived as internet stocks shrivelled. He invested into the least-loved sector of the stock exchange: tobacco. His holdings in British American Tobacco (Lucky Strike, Dunhill), Reynolds American (Camel, Winston) and Imperial Tobacco (Gauloise, Davidoff) turned into the star share price performers of the decade and remain at the core of his portfolio. No tobacco company deal in Britain can now be struck without Woodford's approval.</p> <p>When Perpetual was sold to Amvescap for \u00a31.1bn in 2001 (a deal in which Arbib pocketed \u00a3400m) it looked as if Woodford might walk. But the newly named Invesco Perpetual persuaded him to sign up for a five-year contract. Now with a 24-year tenure, his longevity with one fund manager is rare. He has worked at only one other fund management group (Eagle Star), helped by a culture which supports his style of investing, which is individualistic and led by conviction.</p> <p>Despite that, and despite having the look of a forthright panellist on a TV football programme, he is uncomfortable with punditry. Indeed, he told the Guardian that he did not regard himself as powerful. \"I'm a very active, long-term investor. My average holding is around 15 years. What that means is exactly what John Kay says: with ownership comes responsibility.\" This explains his decision to speak out during the BAE row. With a 13% holding he knew his view would be crucial.</p> <p>He sees his job as \"value discovery\". His funds are not intended to track stock market indices and he describes as \"socially useful\" his investment in unquoted companies \u2013 a cause of controversy as they can be riskier attract regulatory scrutiny.</p> <p>About 5% of his fund goes into companies spun out of places such as Oxford and Cambridge university.</p> <p>In reality, he is happier down on his farm in Hambleden near Henley, though when he tried to redevelop it last year he came up against a tough opponent in Jeremy Paxman, the Newsnight presenter.</p> <p>Paxman was among protesters who turned out to block plans by Woodford and his fiancee, Madeline White, with whom he has two children, to build an all-weather arena to train their horses. Paxman described it as \"enormous, unsightly and environmentally unfriendly\". In a rare defeat, Woodford withdrew the application.</p> <p>He also courted some controversy in 2008 by backing a series of flotations on the junior stock market, Aim, by City broker Cenkos and once again his performance is lagging. His \u00a320bn Income funds are a long way down the one-year performance league, perilously close to the bottom quartile in the tables. But this time, no one is talking about a fallen star. Woodford, who describes himself as patient investor, appears to have found patient followers too.</p> <p>\"I'm very conscious of my responsibility,\" he said. \"I am just doing my job. My job is to represent the people who have trusted with me their money.\"</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne has warned that world leaders fear a worsening of the global economic crisis as growth slows and pressure intensifies on indebted governments and weak banks.</p> <p>Speaking in Tokyo George Osborne on Friday, the chancellor said the immediate danger of another financial disaster had receded but the prospect of a seismic shock to the global economy in the next few years was heightened by \"a triple threat\", which could come from a further economic downturn in Europe, the US or emerging economies.</p> <p>Coming only days after the International Monetary Fund downgraded the growth forecasts for the majority of developed countries, including the UK, Osborne's view chimes with most policy-makers across the world.</p> <p>He said: \"There is less of an immediate sense of crisis at these meetings than there was at last year's annual meetings, but there is a greater concern about what lurks behind the next corner, a greater concern about the medium-term risks.\"</p> <p>The IMF has warned the US, Europe and Japan that a lack of action to refashion the financial system in the wake of the banking crisis has created problems for the future. In a report earlier this week it said the actions of the European Central Bank had lifted the immediate prospect of a eurozone country going bankrupt, but that risks remain next year unless there are moves to spur growth.</p> <p>Osborne said: \"You have the eurozone, the looming US fiscal cliff and an emerging market slowdown as triple threats to global recovery.</p> <p>\"What has been stressed at these meetings in Tokyo is the importance of delivery in all these areas: in the eurozone, delivering an effective implementation of what has been talked about; in the US, resolving the problem after the election of the fiscal cliff; and in emerging markets, continuing the structural reforms and openness that they require.\"</p> <p>Osborne is under pressure to relax Britain's austerity programme after more than two years of low or no growth. Economists expect to see the UK economy exit recession when GDP figures appear later this month, though the overall trend will remain flat.</p> <p>The IMF has given the UK the green light to delay some austerity measures in favour of a boost to investment and tax cuts.</p> <p>Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the IMF's analysis that austerity measures could be more damaging for the economy than previously assumed gives Osborne the excuse he needs should he miss his deficit reduction targets later this month.</p> <p>\"This seems to give the go-ahead to the chancellor to defer some of his spending cuts until the economy is stronger,\" she said.</p> <p>The IMF calculated the impact of tax rises and spending cuts could lead to bigger reductions in GDP, effectively doing more harm than good to the economy and forcing the government to borrow more.</p> <p>Osborne is expected to miss his borrowing target for 2012-13 by as much as \u00a325bn after a fall in tax revenues and a rise in social security costs linked to high unemployment.</p> <p>He hinted in his speech to the Tory party conference earlier in the week that the global slowdown could encourage him to be more flexible in his approach.</p> <p>But at the IMF meeting he repeated his stance that countries needed to push ahead with spending cuts and structural reforms, saying: \"In general, western countries face a sink or swim question which the prime minister posed or, as he also put it, do or decline.</p> <p>\"In UK we are doing rather than declining. We are confronting our problems and the reforms that are required and tackling our debts.\"</p>",

But a closer look reveals the boxy battery packs attached to frames or luggage racks. These are e-bikes, and proponents say they could change urban transport forever.</p> <p>Electrically assisted bikes, the sort that can be used without a licence or insurance if they stay within certain power and speed restrictions, remain relatively rare in Britain, but elsewhere in Europe they are increasingly big business.</p> <p>Last year <a href=\"http://www.colibi.com/docs/issuu/European%20Bicycle%20Market%20&amp;%20Industry%20Profile%20-%20Edition%202012.pdf\" title=\"\">310,000 e-bikes were sold in Germany</a>, a 55% year-on-year rise. In all more than 700,000 were sold in western Europe. The equivalent figure for electric cars, long touted as the low-carbon transport of the future, was just over 11,500, even with the millions spent on subsidies and on-street charging points.</p> <p>The UK saw a relatively paltry 20,000 e-bike sales last year, but supporters hope the electric bike could help overcome the longstanding British resistance to cycling as everyday transport. E-bikes, they argue, which provide a smooth but significant extra kick when the pedals are turned, allow people of more or less any age or fitness level to whirr smoothly from place to place, even up steep slopes, arriving unflustered and un-sweaty. This is particularly valuable, they add, in an era of ageing populations.</p> <p>\"You travel faster for less effort \u2013 who can argue with that?\" says James FitzGerald, whose Suffolk-based <a href=\"http://www.justebikes.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Justebikes company</a> has just opened the west London store, its first in the capital. \"They're also safer for city cycling as the added acceleration means e-bike riders can move away from traffic lights more quickly. And in a city they're much more practical than an electric car.\" E-bikes, also known as electronically power assisted cycles (Epacs) or pedelecs, certainly seem to have a wide demographic appeal compared with regular bikes \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/who-is-the-typical-e-bike-customer/013184\" title=\"\">survey by the British Electric Bicycle Association</a> found more than a third of purchasers were aged 50-59.</p> <p>While the most common models tend to be commuter bikes, in FitzGerald's shop are folding models and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2011/aug/31/cycling-haibike-electric-bike\" title=\"\">electric mountain bikes</a>, often bought by outdoor enthusiasts with ageing limbs or creaking knees. There is even an electrically assisted <em>bakfiets</em>, the traditional Dutch-style cargo cycle with a container at the front big enough for a couple of children and a weekly shop, the manual versions of which can require iron thighs for the slightest incline.</p> <p>E-bike technology has moved on considerably from slightly clunky early incarnations. Batteries are lighter and longer-lasting, while the Dutch-made Sparta brand sold by FitzGerald features such gizmos as an electronic speed and power display which doubles as an immobilser - take it off the bike and the motor cannot be used.</p> <p>FitzGerald says he has held talks with <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/ministers/norman-baker\" title=\"\">Norman Baker</a>, the Liberal Democrat junior transport minister and semi-official voice of cycling in the government, over ways to increase the take-up for e-bikes, while the Department for Transport says it sees e-bikes as a potentially important part of wider strategies to get people on bikes.</p> <p>It nonetheless remains uncertain whether they will take off in the UK, with its lack of a wider cycling culture: overall, the percentage of journeys made by bike every year is around 2%, against more than 25% in the Netherlands. The <a href=\"http://www.ecf.com/\" title=\"\">European Cyclists' Federation</a> says Britons are little more likely to ride an e-bike than a normal bike if they feel the lack of dedicated bike lanes and other infrastructure makes it unsafe. E-bikes can also seem expensive to Britons unused to buying good-quality bikes: the well-made Sparta bikes sold by FitzGerald start at around \u00a31,500.</p> <p>Carlton Reid, editor of the <a href=\"http://www.bikebiz.com/\" title=\"\">BikeBiz cycle industry website</a>, predicts that such factors will limit the growth of e-bikes in countries like the UK and US.</p> <p>\"There's no sign that e-bike sales in the UK are about to sky rocket,\" he predicts. \"Because of its cycling infrastructure, the Netherlands has a ready market for bicycles and when Dutch cycle shop customers get older they naturally gravitate towards power assistance. Very importantly, the average selling price of a Dutch roadster is far above the average selling price of a standard bike in Britain. And Brits are not used to paying \u00a31,000 for their bikes, so bikes that cost more than this are scary, scary expensive.\"</p> <h2>What is an e-bike?</h2> <p>The point at which an e-bike becomes an electric moped, and thus subject to all sorts of laws about helmets, insurance and licences, is somewhat complex and covered by a range of EU regulations.</p> <p>In the simplest terms, an e-bike must weight less than 40kg, have a power output of no more than 200w and must propel you to no more than 25kph, or just over 15mph. Crucially, they must (at least officially) only offer electric assistance, meaning the pedals have to turn for the motor to kick in even if there is a separate throttle.</p> <p>In practice, put one of the modern machines on the top power setting and it will whizz you from a standing start to 15mph with the barest spin of the pedals. Some e-bikes come with a boost button taking them over 15mph, labelled with an unspoken wink as \"off-road use only\". This is most likely not legal, the DfT warns. Riders of any e-bike have to be aged over 14.</p> <p>Some e-bike groups want the power and speed limits increased, but this has met <a href=\"http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/ctc-bagb-versus-eu-etra/012393\" title=\"\">significant resistance from cycling groups</a> worried about such nippy, powerful machines sharing bike lanes with traditional bikes.</p>",
  "<p>A profit warning from industrial group <strong>Morgan Crucible Company</strong> sent shares lower across the engineering sector.</p> <p>The advanced materials company, which provides carbon technology services to the aerospace industry as well as ceramics and body armour, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/oct/08/industrials-cookson-profit-warning-ftse?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">hit earlier in the week </a>after a sector peer <strong>Cookson</strong> issued its own warning of a slowdown.</p> <p>But after it said trading had deteriorated in the third quarter across most of its markets, particularly in Europe and China, its shares lost 28.5p to 227.3p. The slowdown was most pronounced in its advanced materials and technology business, including a delay in body armour contracts from the second half until 2013.</p> <p>Third quarter revenue was around 10% lower than in the first quarter, so its full year performance would be \"materially below the board's previous expectations.\" It said it was taking actions to cut costs, with a \u00a315m charge in 2012 but annual benefits of \u00a37m to \u00a38m.</p> <p>Harry Philips at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> Following on from Cookson, it will be a case of spotting the next warning. <strong>IMI</strong> and <strong> Bodycote International </strong>will top many lists but the lack of a Chinese/Asian exposure will be a plus \u2013 much of Morgan and Cookson is the lack of an second half pick up the region. </blockquote> <p>IMI dropped 21.5p to 904p, Bodycote fell 22.9p to 351.3p, automotive and aerospace group <strong>GKN</strong> lost 7.1p to 209.9p, Cookson closed 9p lower at 530.5p and controls group <strong>Spectris </strong>slid 112p to \u00a315.49.</p> <p>In a rather timely move, analysts at N+1 Singer cut their recommendation Spectris from buy to hold. They said:</p> <blockquote> We have reduced our forecasts for Spectris, ahead of its third quarter trading statement next week, to reflect the weakening industrial backdrop. We have cut our earnings per share estimates by around 6% [for the next three years]. We have also reduced our target price from 1950p to 1780p. </blockquote> <p>Overall, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell 36.43 points to 5793.32 as Thursday's rally ran out of steam. Over the week the index lost around 80 points as the eurozone crisis dragged on, with investors anticipating a Spanish bailout request as Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the country's credit rating to BBB minus, one notch above junk status. Talks about Greece's austerity budget also continued, despite a flying visit from German chancellor Angela Merkel to Athens to show support for the country's government.</p> <p>But better than expected US consumer confidence figures and helped limit the damage.</p> <p>Banks turned in a mixed performance after contrasting results from US firms JP Morgan Chase - better than expected - and Wells Fargo - disappointing. <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> added 0.45p to 39.7p but <strong>Barclays</strong> dipped 0.45p to 232.2p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> fell 2.9p to 270.9p. RBS floated its <strong>Direct Line</strong> subsidiary on Thursday at 175p a share, and the insurer closed at 186.5p, down 1.5p on the day.</p> <p>Elsewhere it proved to be a mixed day for Roman Abramovich.</p> <p><strong>Evraz</strong>, the Russian steelmaker controlled by the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 13.3p to 234.3p after it temporarily shut its Czech production line due to low demand. The European sector has been hit by the economic downturn, as well as rising costs and cheap imports.</p> <p>At the same time analysts at Credit Suisse cut their recommendation from neutral to underperform and their target price from 310p to 200p, on falling iron ore and coking coal prices:</p> <blockquote> As Evraz has a high level of vertical integration with a fairly high cost of mining, it remains highly leveraged to the global bulk commodities' downcycles. As we downgrade iron ore and coking coal price assumptions for 2013-14, we expect a large portion of Evraz's mining operations to become loss-making in 2013. </blockquote> <p>But on the bright side for Abramovich, Aim-listed <strong>AFC Energy</strong>, the fuel cell company where his Ervington Investments is paying \u00a38.7m for a 15% stake, added nearly 16% to 38.5p following Thursday's news of his involvement.</p> <p><strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 30.5p lower at 715.5p after Barclays moved from overweight to equal weight and cut its price target from 910p t0 765p in a hefty note on the mining sector.

We believe the next step will be an increase in Chinese fixed asset investment, leading to further commodity and equity price increases. </blockquote> <p>On Kazakhmys in particular, it said:</p> <blockquote> Our view on Kazakhmys was premised on the assumptions that 1) management had its high cost structure under control and 2) the market had priced this in, neither of which was nor seems to be true now. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Bumi</strong> continued its recovery after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/11/nat-rothschild-bumi-bakrie-family\" title=\"\">plans to abandon its Indonesian coal business</a> and become a cash shell, adding 21p to 280p.</p> <p><strong>WH Smith</strong> added 5p to 636p, recovering some of Thursday's fall in the wake of news that Kate Swann, widely regarded as having done a good job at the retailer, was stepping down as chief executive next summer. There was some speculation she could move on to <strong>Home Retail</strong>, down 0.7p at 104.3p, the owner of her former employer Argos. but analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> It was interesting that the shorts started to run for cover in Home Retail yesterday, on the fear that Kate Swann will march in as chief executive next summer and sort the business out, but successful executives don't usually go back to companies they've worked at before. </blockquote> <p><strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> moved 24p higher to 712p after an upbeat trading statement. The investment firm reported record assets under management of \u00a32bn and revenues up 20% in the first quarter. It said:</p> <blockquote> Future stock market levels and investor confidence will have a significant part to play during the remainder of our financial year. In the coming months we will be launching our iPad app and a number of other major new initiatives. </blockquote> <p>It should also benefit from a shake-up of the way financial products are sold. From next year, commissions will be replaced by a fee-based system and Hargreaves believes it has put in place a competitive structure ahead of the changes.</p> <p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> fell 1.4p to 327.1p as the group began looking for a plan B following Wednesday's collapse of its proposed merger with EADS.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the defence sector, <strong>Chemring</strong> climbed 7.4p to 342.7p after a deadline for US private equity group Carlyle to either make a firm offer or walk away was extended by the takeover panel from last night to 9 November.</p> <p>Chemring said the move was \"to enable the parties to continue their ongoing discussions regarding a possible offer.\"</p> <p>The company, which makes flares, ejector seat mechanisms and bomb detectors, initially announced it had received an approach in mid-August, but a subsequent profit warning raised fears that the predator, Carlyle, might walk away, or at least make a lower offer than originally planned.</p> <p>Analysts took the latest extension as a good sign. Roger Johnston at Edison Investment Research said:</p> <blockquote> [This] shows the two sides are trying to thrash out a deal. I still feel it is unlikely a trade buyer will emerge at this time and therefore this is all about price now. Carlyle will feel under no pressure to bid high while Chemring management will not want to go out with a whimper so this will be a finely balanced negotiation. I suggest a price around the 400p mark will be enough to clinch the deal, but whether Carlyle feels this reflects defence uncertainties enough is another matter. </blockquote>",
  "<p>At a time when Europe seems on the brink of falling apart, when Europeans are taking to the streets to express their wrath towards other partners in the union and when mainstream politicians in the UK are looking for a way out of the club, a decision by a group of Norwegian intellectuals to prompt the question: what has the EU done for us? We take a look at some of the more positive impacts the EU has had on our lives.</p> <h2>Peace</h2> <p>The origins of peace in Europe lie in the alliance made between France and Germany t gave birth to the European Coal and Steel Community, a forerunner of the EU. The ECSC was first conceived by Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister in 1950 \"to make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible\". The continent has indeed enjoyed lasting peace. International security remains one of the EU's top priorities, not just in Europe but the rest of the world.</p> <h2>Single market</h2> <p>The single market is probably the EU's single biggest achievement after peace, though it's arguably hard to separate the two. It guarantees the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. Apart from the unifying effect of this set-up on European citizens, it has provided the opportunity for them to travel, live, work, study and do business across the union, and to enjoy a wide range of competitively-priced services and goods.</p> <h2>Single currency</h2> <p>The eurozone was established in 1999 and is made up of 17 member states. Despite the threats it has faced in recent years, it is likely to remain a central part of Europeans' everyday life. Most Europeans see the benefits it brings to them as travellers - not having to convert moneywhile away on holiday or business. But its main practical benefit has to do with economic growth. It has helped to strengthen the EU's international standing and improve integration within the union itself.</p> <h2>Easier, passport-free travel</h2> <p>Since the 15 member countries which signed up to the Schengen agreement abandoned their border posts, it is possible to travel freely and easily not just to Tuscany and Dordogne, but across huge swaths of the union. Driving licenses are valid across the continent, while the single currency standardised trains and the fact that holidaymakers are fully covered for emergency hospital treatment in other EU countries have all encouraged freedom of movement.</p> <h2>Foreign aid</h2> <p>The EU accounts for half of all global aid. Last year, it donated \u20ac53.1bn (\u00a342.8bn). The European commission by itself is the world's second largest bilateral donor after the US, providing \u20ac12.3bn of external aid in 2011. Aid constitutes about 9% of the EU budget. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's peer review of EU aid in 2012 found that the body was a \"formidable player in global development\" that had taken \"positive steps to make the programme more effective and increase its impact\" since its previous review in 2007. The European commission is ranked the fifth most transparent donor in the world out of 72, above every EU member state except the UK and the Netherlands.</p> <h2>Cheaper and safer flights</h2> <p>Increased competition between airlines operating within the member states introduced in the 1980s and 90s has provided us with cheaper flights to a much wider range of destinations than ever before. Flights are also safer as a result of tightened regulations and improvements in air traffic control.</p> <h2>Democracy and human rights</h2> <p>Brussels sets standards of human rights, democracy and the rule of law to which countries must adhere if they want to be part of the European Union. In practical terms these guidelines have had a particular impact on the countries of southern, central and eastern Europe, which joined after they emerged from dictatorships with often underdeveloped civil societies.</p> <h2>Equal opportunities</h2> <p>The EU has tackled discrimination on the basis of gender, race, age and disability with a range of different directives which have had their biggest impact on the labour market.</p> <h2>Cheaper telephone calls</h2> <p>In the 1990s the EU liberalised the telecommunications markets. That together with new technology has led to considerably lower prices. The cost of international telephone calls has fallen by more than 80% in the last 30 years, while mobile phone roaming charges have also been significantly reduced.</p> <h2>Improved air and water quality</h2> <p>Member states have demonstrated their own appetite for protecting the environment, but they would arguably not have done so much had pressure not been applied by the EU via legislation to improve the quality of rivers, seas and beaches, and reduce acid rain and sulphur emissions.</p>",
  "<p>How ironic that after another week of global debate over Luis Su\u00e1rez's theatrics he should be the last striker standing at Liverpool. How badly the shortage reflects on a club of such grandiose designs.</p> <p>Fabio Borini is where one of the two remaining senior strikers at Liverpool was always destined to be following the club's calamitous end to the transfer window \u2013 on the sidelines, having broken a foot while training with Italy Under-21 in Pescara on Thursday. Liverpool are awaiting their own assessment of the \u00a310.5m summer signing from Roma before putting a timescale on his recovery. It will be a surprise, and a rare piece of good fortune for Brendan Rodgers, to see the 21-year-old back before the transfer window reopens in January.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager has 18 Premier League, Europa League and Capital One Cup fixtures to navigate until then, more should he overcome his former club, Swansea City, in the latter competition on 31 October. Rodgers will also be worried by the fact that Uruguay take on Argentina and Bolivia in World Cup qualifiers in the coming days. Lose Su\u00e1rez and Liverpool's pool of strikers will amount to Daniel Pacheco, Adam Morgan, Samil Yesil and Jerome Sinclair, aged 21, 18, 18 and 16 respectively. Only Pacheco has appeared in the Premier League. And this was the area of the Liverpool team in most need of improvement under Kenny Dalglish.</p> <p>Borini has made a slow start to life at Anfield and the sense of alarm at his loss is not a reflection of his contribution thus far. Rodgers, in fairness, took responsibility for the Italian's difficult adjustment last week after playing Borini in an unfavoured position out wide. The manager also claimed then that his plan was to integrate Borini into the first team gradually but had to abandon such thoughts \"because of where we were at\".</p> <p>That is as much as Rodgers can say these days about Liverpool's performance in the last transfer window. It was well documented at the time and, as a new young manager in a major role, he has nothing to gain by reiterating annoyance at his employers' failure to back his judgment on Clint Dempsey on transfer deadline day. Plus his predicament is recognised by the Anfield faithful, prompting the manager to thank supporters for their patience after Sunday's goalless draw against Stoke City.</p> <p>Rodgers' gratitude towards the fans was overshadowed by the rancour that followed Tony Pulis' calls for Su\u00e1rez to be banned for a belly-flop inside the Stoke area and Robert Huth's escape for stamping on the Liverpool striker. So, too, was the Liverpool manager's astonishing dismissal of Andy Carroll when asked if he regretted not having the centre-forward in the late push for victory. \"I'm not one who goes down the desperation route,\" he replied. \"I don't do the desperation thing by kicking it long in the last 10 minutes.\" But Liverpool, right now, do not have a squad to deliver Rodgers' Plan A or B, the latter being \"to make Plan A better\".</p> <p>The Liverpool manager may have been naive for believing that, by letting Carroll join West Ham United on a season-long loan 24 hours before the transfer deadline, Fenway Sports Group would finally bow to his appeal to pay \u00a36m for the 29-year-old Dempsey the following day. As they should have done. He has learned from that episode but, in terms of compromising his tactical beliefs to accommodate the players at his disposal, Rodgers has been unwavering and refused. The stance appears self-defeating at this early stage in his Liverpool career.</p> <p>Rodgers' fortune so far as Liverpool manager stems from reaping the benefits of a youth academy system put in place by Rafael Ben\u00edtez and implemented by Frank McParland. He has had little option but to champion young talent this season, and it is to his credit that Raheem Sterling, Suso and Andre Wisdom have been given the opportunity to shine. One by-product is the marginalising of Stewart Downing and Jordan Henderson, players who cannot argue with their current status but who may be required by Rodgers until January, when FSG can make amends by providing their manager with a Theo Walcott or a Darren Bent.</p>",

A Peanuts avatar-maker, virtual pumpkin carving and piano playing are thrown in for good measure.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-iplayer-radio/id560458506?mt=8\">BBC iPlayer Radio</a></h2> <p>Brits who were disgruntled at the lack of whizzy radio features in the most recent update for the BBC's main iPlayer app may be mollified by this new standalone app for the broadcaster's radio output. It streams live stations over 3G or Wi-Fi, has a slick EPG and radio tuner-style dial, and offers on-demand shows from the last week. Still no downloads though for offline listening.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/rockmelt-explore-best-web/id563685339?mt=8\">Rockmelt: Explore the Best of the Web</a></h2> <p>Rockmelt started life as a social-skewed desktop web browser, before pirouetting onto mobile devices. This new iPad app is as much a Flipboard-esque article reader as a web browser, pulling in editorial from a range of sites and making it available for offline reading. Facebook and Twitter personalisation is included too.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/romeo-juliet-explore-shakespeare/id562203479?mt=8\">Romeo and Juliet: Explore Shakespeare</a> / <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/macbeth-explore-shakespeare/id562189027?mt=8\">Macbeth: Explore Shakespeare</a></h2> <p>Okay, so this is cheating, since two apps in one entry takes this roundup to 21 apps for the week. These belong together though: two excellent attempts to bring Shakespeare plays to the iPad by Cambridge University Press and developer Agant. Expect full audio performances with actors including Fiona Shaw and Michael Sheen; glossary definitions, word clouds, themelines, study activities and deep search features.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/magazine-for-geeks-like-us./id557744510?mt=8\">The Magazine: For Geeks Like Us</a></h2> <p>This is the work of Marco Arment, who's best known for making reading app Instapaper. This is his move into digital magazine publishing, commissioning four 500-1,000 word features for each bi-weekly issue, focusing on technology and related fields. His <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2012/10/11/the-magazine\">blog post about the project</a> is worth a read too, as he pitches it for \"an audience bigger than a niche but smaller than the readership of The New York Times\".<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bad-piggies-best-egg-recipes/id558812781?mt=8\">Bad Piggies Best Egg Recipes</a></h2> <p>Angry Birds publisher Rovio launched its Bad Piggies Best Egg Recipes printed cookbook in 2011, but now it's been turned into an iPad digital edition. It includes 41 egg-related recipes, with step-by-step instructions, photos and some interactive easter eggs starring the birds and pigs from its games.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pyramids-3d/id557865627?mt=8\">Pyramids 3D</a></h2> <p>It has been, as you can see, a very big week for iOS apps. This is the latest release from UK/US book-apps publisher Touch Press, offering 3D tours of three Giza pyramids and eight tombs, with digital restorations of wall paintings, high-res photos of artifacts to spin around, and all manner of experts delivering their knowledge on ancient Egypt.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ebay-now/id564040819?mt=8\">eBay Now</a></h2> <p>This app is US-only for now, and in fact it only works in San Francisco at the moment. Still, it's a sign of where eBay is heading: same-day delivery of products bought from retailers including Toys R Us, Macy's, Walgreens and Home Depot, ordered and paid for from an iPhone app.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/photoset/id540053309?mt=8\">Photoset</a></h2> <p>Photoset came as a bit of a surprise: a brand new app from blogging company Tumblr designed to \"create and share beautiful photosets on your iPhone or iPad\". The idea being you arrange photos and then share them to Tumblr, Twitter and other social sites, as well as via email.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/prometheus-weyland-corp-archive/id563562816?mt=8\">Prometheus \u2013 Weyland Corp Archive Second Screen App</a></h2> <p>An unwieldy name for what's a pretty interesting idea: an app designed to be used alongside the Blu-ray disc of Ridley Scott's Prometheus film, synchronising with the action and serving up screen tests, motion galleries, interviews and artwork, as well as a \"Live Lookup\" feature tapping IMDb for info on actors. And you might think \"Oh, can't people just WATCH THE FILM\", but this is more akin to DVD extras, designed to be used on second, third and later viewings.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bamm.tv/id563287602?mt=8\">BAMM.tv</a></h2> <p>The BAMM.tv website has been filming bands and musicians performing live for some time now, but now all that footage is available through an iPad app in HD quality. You can browse the sessions, read liner notes, create playlists and find out more about the artists \u2013&#xa0;all within a virtual venue environment.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/craftsy/id540872054?mt=8\">Craftsy</a></h2> <p>The Craftsy website specialises in video courses for all things craft-related, from jewellery-making and cake-decorating through to gardening and knitting. Now those courses are available in an iPad app, where you pay for them using in-app purchase, then can watch as often as you like, while asking questions to the instructor if you get stuck.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dishonored-official-map-app/id565975972?mt=8\">Dishonored Official Map App</a></h2> <p>This could perhaps have gone in the Best Games post this week, but it's strictly an app: a \"digital companion\" to console game Dishonored, which is currently receiving rave reviews. Published by DK, it provides maps and a guide to collectible items in the main game.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dc-super-friends-haunted-heroes/id567140674?mt=8\">DC Super Friends Haunted Heroes</a></h2> <p>This is a book-app based on DC Comics' stable of superheroes \u2013 well, the child-friendly version anyway, including Batman, Superman and a cast of villains. As the name makes clear, spookiness is the focus, just in time for Halloween, as the DC Super Friends investigate a haunted house. Photo-manipulation, digital stickers, puzzles and colouring accompany the main story.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flock-photos-together/id543421080?mt=8\">Flock \u2013 Photos Together</a></h2> <p>Y'know how the latest TV ads for Sony Ericsson's new Xperia smartphone make a big deal out of its tap-to-share photos feature? Well, developer Bump just made an app that does (sort of) the same thing for iPhones, with some more social bells and whistles. The idea being that friends take photos on their different phones, then it creates a shared album for all of them automatically.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/disney-creativity-studio/id557238273?mt=8\">Disney Creative Studio</a></h2> <p>Here's an artistic app that looks set to appeal to parents as well as their children: \"Let real Disney artists teach you how to draw your favourite Disney characters\". The app uses a mixture of connect-the-dots, colouring and tracing to accomplish this, so even kids will be able to draw a Mickey Mouse that looks like, well, Mickey Mouse.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/everton-fc/id489805882?mt=8\">Everton FC</a></h2> <p>Everton's official club app was already available on iPhone, but its universal upgrade including iPad has made it, as far as I'm aware, the first Premier League football club to have an official app for Apple's tablet. Blues should expect a mixture of news, videos and player profiles.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/read-biff-chip-kipper-library/id559739826?mt=8\">Read with Biff, Chip and Kipper: Library</a></h2> <p>British parents should recognise Biff, Chip and Kipper: their early literacy books are apparently being used in 80% of UK primary schools. Now they've gone digital with this app, adding voice narration, interactive activities and the ability to tap a word to hear it pronounced. Each book costs \u00a33.99 in-app, although if your wallet is flush, a separate <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/read-biff-chip-kipper.-complete/id563906937?mt=8\">Complete Series app</a> bundles in all 48 titles for a single download fee of \u00a3149.99.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xfinity-tv-player/id552293383?mt=8\">Xfinity TV Player</a></h2> <p>Another US-only app: you need to be a Comcast or Xfinity TV customer to use this TV-on-demand app. It's a pure player for accessing the Xfinity catalogue of TV shows and films, including content from channels like HBO, Starz, Showtime and Cartoon Network. The app can be used anywhere over Wi-Fi \u2013&#xa0;part of the US cable industry's attempted march to a \"TV everywhere\" strategy.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/playground.fm/id446421441?mt=8\">Playground.fm</a></h2> <p>One more US-only app to finish this week, from music startup NoiseToys. This is a bit like personal radio service Pandora, except the stations \u2013&#xa0;or playlists \u2013&#xa0;come from other users rather than a recommendation algorithm. Playground.fm users can create playlists from their iTunes collections or Spotify Premium catalogue, then share them with others. How do artists get paid?

  "<p>Of the many accolades bestowed on Charleston, South Carolina, the most prestigious is probably Best City in America (in the eyes of the readers of Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller, anyway). But I'm more interested in two of its more specific boasts: its growing reputation as a gourmet hotspot \u2013 where slow-cooked, traditional Southern food is experiencing a revival \u2013 and the fact that it was voted Sexiest City in America by the readers of Travel + Leisure magazine. What more incentive does a greedy single girl need to head down south?</p> <p>Before I've had a chance to size up the local talent, I am seduced by the prettiness of the genteel port city itself. Founded by the English in 1670, it has picturesque streets lined with palm trees and original, old-timey gas lamps, in front of pastel-painted townhouses with pillars and porches, just begging for a languid afternoon spent lounging with a mint julep. Still so low-rise is the perfectly preserved city that a cruise liner parked in the harbour looms over the rooftops and spires like an ocean-going Godzilla.</p> <p>My first pit stop is at a tiny diner, the Dixie Supply Bakery &amp; Caf\u00e9 (<a href=\"http://www.dixiecafecharleston.com/\" title=\"\">dixiecafecharleston.com</a>) at 62 State Street. It's only open for breakfast and lunch, and most of the menu hovers around the $5 mark. Famed throughout the state for its tomato pie \u2013 flavour-packed tomatoes layered with cheese, garlic, basil and spring onions, in a pie crust, served in slices with a hunk of homemade amber-coloured cornbread \u2013 it also specialises in the rib-sticking southern dish of shrimp and grits. Grits \u2013 a semolina-like paste, made from ground corn cooked with milk and cream \u2013 is something of an acquired taste, which, I must confess, I have not yet acquired.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397626279\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951383662/Shops-in-Rainbow-Row-Char-001.jpg\" alt=\"Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston.\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the city has a growing reputation among the foodie fraternity, and was an early adopter of the locally grown movement, its cuisine is firmly anchored in the past \u2013 from rustic barbecue joints to a rash of new fine-dining restaurants. These include the award-winning Husk (<a href=\"http://www.huskrestaurant.com\" title=\"\">huskrestaurant.com</a>) named Best New Restaurant in America by Bon App\u00e9tit magazine in 2011, where nothing grown or farmed outside of the south is served.</p> <p>English settlers arriving here in the 17th century made full use of the pigs left behind by the Spanish, and found its protected peninsula teeming with hundreds of species of seafood. Native Americans taught them which crops would thrive in the swampy, alligator-infested environment, namely corn, sierra beans, and squash. And the arrival of a wave of French Huguenots in the 18th century, drawn by the city's pledge of religious tolerance to all, brought desserts to the party, plus even more emphasis on pork, introducing charcuterie and cassoulets.</p> <p>Less nobly, Charleston was also the centre of the slave trade in the 18th century: three out of four enslaved Africans arrived in America through this port city. But the ships which docked in the harbour brought with them not only slaves but also cooking and farming practices, introducing rice, okra \u2013 eaten fried or in soup \u2013 collard greens, aubergines and peanuts. And after more than half a century of celebrating convenience foods, the Lowcountry, as the region is known, is returning \u2013 like much of America \u2013 to its culinary roots.</p> <p>Central to this is barbecue \u2013 by which the locals mainly mean pork, the definitive ingredient of southern cooking. At Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Que at 288 King Street, I round off a day of non-stop munching with tender pulled pork, slow-cooked for seven hours, and served with a cheese biscuit (which is nothing like a biscuit, and something like a scone), and collard greens, boiled with and flavoured by juicy lumps of bacon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397626280\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951454834/Peninsula-Grills-coconut--001.jpg\" alt=\"Peninsula Grill's coconut cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peninsula Grill's coconut cake, Charleston</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charleston's compact size makes it one of the few US cities where it is possible to spend a few days without needing a car.

Just as perilous is Market Street Sweets up the road, with its lip-smacking pralines, peanut brittle and bear-claw caramels. A uniformed temptress calls \"Free samples\" from the doorway, like the child-catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Next door, the Peninsula Grill (<a href=\"http://peninsulagrill.com\" title=\"\">peninsulagrill.com</a>) serves its celebrated, sensual coconut cake in 1lb slabs, for sharing.</p> <p>As I stagger home, trying to dodge the sweet treats, I realise, a little too late, that I have assiduously road-tested the cuisine, but not surveyed the city's sexiness.

  "<h2>PATRIOTIC SWELL?</h2> <p>Sometimes the Fiver is left baffled by the country it lives in. Far-out bafflement. Bafflement that spins round Jupiter and Saturn and then thinks: what the hell, let's ride this baby all the way to Pluto. The sort of bafflement you get when a French teacher asks you to conjugate the verb aller into all the compound tenses. Jordan baffles us. The patriotic swell surrounding the Diamond Jubilee still baffles us. But that's nothing compared to the news that 90,000 people will be paying good money to watch England v San Marino at Wembley. Why, Great English public, why? Have you all taken leave of your senses?</p> <p>We're talking about a country that for 22 years has been on a one-team crusade to prove that, actually, there are easy games at international level. A country that has lost 108 of 114 international matches since 1990, scoring 19 goals and conceding 473. A country whose manager, the jocular Giampaolo Mazza, has warned: \"The only thing certain is that we will lose.\" Death, taxes, San Marino getting thumped, England flattering to deceive at major international tournaments: these, pretty much, are the only things the Fiver believes in.</p> <p>Even so, San Marino have been backed at 579-1 to win tonight on Betfair, albeit for pocket-money sums. As Betfair spokesman Tony Calvin told the Fiver: \"I can't readily recall English international opposition being available at that price before \u2013 or indeed the draw being available at 119-1. Mind you, I believe San Marino were backed at 599-1 on Betfair when they played Holland in September last year, so perhaps the English players should be insulted!\" Perhaps. But probably not. This could well be the Saint Wilfrid Feastday massacre.</p> <p>But while the Fiver's eyes will be contractually on the game at Wembley, our soul will be elsewhere. Perhaps in Dublin, where the Republic O'Ireland will be desperately hoping not to get a Nationalmannschafting from Germany. Or watching Serbia v Belgium, two countries with more false dawns than in the east before sunrise around the time of the autumn equinox. Or perhaps looking at Wales, with Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen attempting to tiki-taki Scotland to slow death. Not that Gary Caldwell sees it that way: \"I think tonight's game will be more British in style. There will be a lot of tackles and hard work and there will be a real battle.\" Which, limited as that sounds, is more than San Marino will offer tonight.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\"><em>Follow our live MBM reports on England 4-0 San Marino, Wales 0-0 Scotland and the Republic O'Ireland 1-2 Germany from 7.30pm</em></a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I'm happy to explore my possibilities and share my knowledge and experience.

The director of public prosecutions, Kier Starmer, has also announced that he will immediately review all the evidence in the 395-page report to decide whether new charges of manslaughter can be brought.</p> <p>\"I have now concluded that the Crown Prosecution Service should consider all the material now available in relation to the tragic events of 15 April 1989, including material made available by the independent panel,\" Starmer said. \"The purpose of this investigation is to identify what the focus of any further criminal investigation should be in order for the CPS to determine whether this is now sufficient evidence to charge any individual or corporate body with any criminal offence.\"</p> <p>The DPP will look into the potential for new manslaughter charges, while the Independent Police Complaints Commission will investigate the aftermath of the tragedy and identify possible criminal offences or disciplinary action. The investigation, the biggest ever independent review of the police in the UK, will look into allegations that police officers' statements were changed and that misleading information was passed to the media and parliament. It will primarily focus on South Yorkshire police, in charge on the day of the tragedy, and West Midlands police, who carried out an investigation into their colleagues.</p> <p>\"A large number of current and former officers will be under investigation, including Sir Norman Bettison,\" said Deborah Glass, the deputy chair of the IPCC.</p> <h2>GET A FREE \u00a325 BET WITH BLUE SQUARE</h2> <p><a href=\"http://ads.bluesq.com/redirect.aspx?pid=5296&amp;bid=2932\" title=\"\">Step one: open an account with Blue Square and deposit any amount; step two: place a bet of at least \u00a35 on any sport; step three: we will match your bet with a free bet of up to \u00a325</a>.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\"I am shocked, stunned and amazed that the Fiver letters sections \u2013 a place renowned for pedantry \u2013 didn't throw up one single pedant yesterday pointing out that the rules of Scrabble <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8604625.stm\" title=\"\">were changed back in 2010</a> to allow for the use of proper nouns.

  "<p>Merger talks between defence industry giants BAE Systems and EADS may have collapsed. But the disturbing realities of the global arms trade mean it would always have been a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/angela-merkel-bae-eads-merger-german?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">difficult deal to close</a>.</p> <p>A large part of the reason for this is the extremely close and complex relationships weapons manufacturers, perhaps more than in any other sector, have with their governments and intelligence agencies. This is a consequence of their role in foreign policy, national security and their ability to collect intelligence wherever they operate. They often have close links to political parties too, especially in Germany, as a result of their generous donations. These roles afford them proximity to those at the apex of power. Relationships are reinforced by the revolving door for personnel between corporations and government.</p> <p>As a result, defence companies are insulated from the cold winds of market competition. We can see this not only in the extent of subsidies doled out to the industry globally, but also in the fact that most arms companies fail miserably when attempting to operate outside the confines of multibillion-pound state contracts with guaranteed profits. And in an industry that accounts for about 40% of all corruption in world trade, defence companies are often protected from the full legal consequences of their sometimes nefarious actions by their home governments.</p> <p>BAE was spared the massive legal fallout from paying about \u00a36bn in \"commissions\" on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/07/bae15\" title=\"\">al-Yamamah deal</a> with Saudi Arabia by the direct personal intervention of Tony Blair in the dying days of his premiership. The company was then fined a derisory \u00a3500,000 for \"accounting irregularities\" on one transaction, in return for which the Serious Fraud Office dropped advanced investigations into corruption in five highly controversial arms deals.</p> <p>EADS has also faced its share of corruption investigations. An EADS subsidiary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/16/serious-fraud-office-arms-trade\" title=\"\">GPT Special Projects</a>, is alleged to have made \u00a314.5m in suspicious payments to two Cayman Islands-based entities as part of a \u00a32bn military communications contract between the UK and Saudi Arabia. The recipients received 14% of the equipment budget on the contract, yet appear to have provided no equipment or services.</p> <p>Had the merger talks between BAE and EADS continued it would have been interesting to see how BAE approached these allegations. The company's settlement with US authorities means it is obliged to hand over to the US department of justice any information that it comes across relating to possible corruption. BAE could hardly have undertaken meaningful due diligence without being made aware of details of the GPT case.</p> <p>This conundrum illustrates the complexities of the merger. German, British and, to a lesser extent, French and Spanish law enforcement authorities would have had to co-operate in unprecedented ways to protect the merged entity along the lines currently enjoyed by the constituent companies. State support in the form of research and development grants, financial protection and other subsidies would have been a nightmare to agree and manage.</p> <p>The failure of the merger has probably saved many hours of Anglo-German wrangling over political, economic and law enforcement issues. But there remains an urgent need to impose greater transparency on the relationship between governments and their arms companies, and for those companies to face the judicial consequences of their malfeasance. Unless governments take meaningful action, this industry that counts its profits in billions and its cost in human lives will continue to make the world a poorer place, a less democratic place, a more corrupt place and arguably a more dangerous place.</p>",
  "<p>Republicans have gone on the offensive over Joe Biden's insistence during the vice-presidential debate that the Obama administration was unaware of any request for more security in Libya before the fatal 9/11 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.</p> <p>The Romney campaign is smelling blood over the remarks in which Biden protested that there had been no knowledge of a security problem before the assault in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. \"We weren't told they wanted more security, we did not know they wanted more security,\" the vice-president said.</p> <p>In an otherwise bullish and assured performance, Biden's comments left him exposed to post-debate criticism from conservatives intent on sustaining the past week's surge of the Romney campaign. The vice-president's position appeared to be contradicted by evidence presented to the congressional oversight and government reform committee just a day earlier.</p> <p>Newt Gingrich, a failed candidate for the Republican nomination now backing Romney, predicted on CBS television Friday morning that Biden's remarks on Benghazi would \"haunt them from now until the next debate\".</p> <p>On Tuesday the committee was presented with a diplomatic cable sent on 2 August by Stevens to the state department in Washington asking for an additional 11 security personnel to be added to the rotation of 24. Though the 11 were to replace temporary security staff who were leaving, Stevens made clear in the cable that violence and terrorism were a threat amid a volatile political landscape.</p> <p>He wrote: \"Due to the level of threat in regards to crime, political violence and terrorism, post feels this is an appropriate number of LES [locally employed staff] security personnel needed to further embassy diplomatic outreach missions. Violent security incidents continue to take place due to the lack of a coherent national Libyan security force and the strength of local militias and large numbers of armed groups.</p> <p>\"Host national security support is lacking and cannot be depended on to provide a safe and secure environment.\"</p> <p>The Republican-controlled committee also heard from two former US security chiefs in Libya who testified that they had found it impossible to get the message across back home that security was a critical problem.</p> <p>Andrew Wood, former head of a US military team in Libya, told the committee that \"the security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there\". He added that the head of US security in the region had pushed for more people \"but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with\".</p> <p>Eric Nordstrom, the former security chief for US diplomats in Libya, said that in his view he had been fighting a losing battle over numbers in which \"we couldn't even keep what we had\". Pointedly, he said that he concluded after contact with state department bosses that \"we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident\".</p> <p>During the debate, Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, accused the Obama administration of having an \"unravelling\" foreign policy and pressed Biden hard on Benghazi, saying: \"This was Libya, a country we knew had al-Qaida cells. And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a marine detachment?\"</p> <p>By protesting \"we weren't told\", Biden may have referred to the White House or the president and his immediate circle, in which case it may be consistent with the revelations about requests to the state department for additional Libyan security. But he will now come under pressure to clarify his position, which could extend the Benghazi controversy for one or more news cycles, causing further headaches for the Obama re-election campaign.</p> <p>It also leaves him vulnerable to the accusation that the administration was out of touch with what was happening on the ground in Libya. That was seized upon by the Romney campaign, whose senior adviser, Dan Senor, questioned the administration's grasp of vital national security issues. He said Biden's statement had pointed to \"the larger failures of the administration to be completely transparent about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi and the security situations leading up to the attacks\".</p>",
  "<p>You could be forgiven for thinking that careers in retail mostly revolve around the activity you see in the shops, such as stacking shelves, operating tills and dressing windows.</p> <p>But behind the scenes there's a hive of activity, opening up a whole range of career options in retail.

  "<p>\"Super-selectivity\" is the kind of concocted word beloved of politicians and policy wonks. I hadn't heard it until a couple of weeks ago when Rob Whiteman, chief executive of the UK Border Agency (UKBA), used it to describe the government's immigration policy at the <a href=\"http://www.detentionadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Detention Advice Service</a>'s 20th anniversary conference.</p> <p>Whiteman argued that, within this newly labelled policy, foreign national prisoners were regarded as a specific category of people who really, really should be deported \u2013 presumably, super-super-selectivity. He was referencing a speech earlier this year by then immigration minister Damian Greene to the Conservative think-tank Policy Exchange when the minister talked of super-selectivity or (in the alternative) \"double-plus selectivity\" (yes, <a href=\"http://www.migrantsrights.org.uk/blog/2012/02/mr-green-s-speech-points-double-plus-selectivity\" title=\"\">seriously</a>).</p> <p>In the context of the 10,861 foreign nationals in our prisons, \"super-selectivity\" means one thing: \"you're not staying here\". Such blanket judgments \u2013 treating a class of people as \"a homogenous mass\" as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/julietlyon\" title=\"\">Juliet Lyon</a>, director of the Prison Reform Trust, neatly put it at the conference \u2013 need to be challenged.</p> <p>The notion that the European Convention on Human Rights is routinely abused in defence of foreign nationals also needs to be challenged. \"It's shameful that child killers and rapists can abuse human rights laws to escape deportation,\" <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9566479/177-foreign-criminals-avoid-deportation-on-family-rights-grounds.html\" title=\"\">said Charlie Elphicke</a>, the Conservative MP for Dover &amp; Deal recently. \"What about the right to family life of the families they have destroyed?\"</p> <p>Foreign national prisoners achieved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/apr/21/foreign-national-prisoners-new-pariahs\" title=\"\">pariah status</a> following the \"crisis of 2006 when it was revealed that more than 1,013 were released without being considered for deportation \u2013 an issue so toxic that it led to the swift departure of Charles Clark as home secretary.</p> <p>According to the Prison Reform Trust, foreign national prisoners in UK prisons come from 156 countries and over half are from 10 (Jamaica, Poland, Ireland, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Lithuania, India, Vietnam and Somalia). They aren't all child killers and rapists, nor are all of them violent \u2013 46% of foreign national women are inside for drug offences (compared to 21% of British nationals) and 16% for fraud and forgery offences. According to the female prison welfare project Hibiscus, half of foreign national women have children under the age of 18.</p> <p>The total number of foreign nationals in our prison nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010 \u2014 compared to a 20% increase in British nationals. In 2009, some 11,268 untried foreign nationals went into custody \u2013 that's a staggering 136% increase since 1999 (by contrast there has been a 28% decrease in terms of untried receptions of British nationals).</p> <p>Foreign prisoners are also treated differently \u2013 or at least strongly feel that they are. At the DAS conference, Martin Kettle, policy lead on foreign national prisoners at the HM Inspectorate of Prisons, went through the results of a survey of 5,352 British national and 750 foreign national prisoners on perceptions of life in prisons. Apparently, 81% of British national prisoners knew where they were going when they were coming to a prison compared to 66% of foreign nationals; 75% of British nationals felt safe on their first night compared to 69% of foreign nationals; and 17% of British nationals as against 22% of foreign nationals felt unsafe at that point in time.</p> <p>Kettle spoke of the 'damage of uncertainty': \"If you walk into an immigration removal centre you can feel it in the air.\"</p> <p>The immigration regime was tightened in July specifically to prevent the abuse of article 8 rights \u2013 the new rules state that it will only be \"in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation is outweighed\". A report by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration last November found that between February 2010 and January 2011 about a third of appeals lodged by foreign national prisoners against the decision to deport was successful (425 in total) \u2014 primarily on article 8 grounds. In the same year, <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/articlesAndTranscripts/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf\" title=\"\">5,235 foreign national prisoners were deported</a> from the UK.</p> <p>As of April next year and the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/legislation/bills-and-acts/acts/legal-aid-and-sentencing-act/laspo-background-information\" title=\"\">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act</a>, it will be impossible for foreign national prisoners who wish to challenge deportation proceedings to get legal advice from a solicitor unless they are able to pay for it themselves. \"It is not right to subject someone to a serious sanction of deportation without giving them the means to understand the situation and to assert the rights provided for them by law,\" commented DAS director Nigel Caleb. Quite. By the way, all deportations papers served by the UKBA are written entirely in English.</p> <p>The 2006 crisis led directly to the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/30/contents\" title=\"\">UK Borders Act 2007</a> with a new regime of automatic deportation for any non-EEA national (including those granted indefinite leave) who gets a custodial sentence of 12 months or more. So rather than the facts of individual case determining a decision to deport, it is the length of prison sentence.</p> <p>The so-called crisis has also fundamentally changed the attitude of the Home Office staff from senior managers to caseworkers, Steve Symonds of the <a href=\"http://www.ilpa.org.uk\" title=\"\">Immigration Law Practitioners' Association</a> told delegates at the DAS event. According to Symonds, in nine out of 10 cases where detainees are released, they are released as a result of the decision of a court. \"That is obviously because the UKBA and its casework staff cannot countenance the idea that they release someone,\" he said.</p> <p>Symonds made the case for scrapping the automatic deportation provisions. He called it \"a stupid policy position which does not give any more power to deport anybody, but which prevents sensible consideration of the circumstances of every individual rather than just the homogenous mass\".</p> <p>It is a proposal that is hard to disagree with, bit it won't be introduced until more enlightened times.</p>",

  "<p>Forget the Grand National, the Gold Cup or any of the other 26 races at the Cheltenham Festival. The highlight of this jumps season for me will be if Kauto Star lines up to attempt to win the King George for the sixth successive time on Boxing Day. The Grand National may be the people's race and the Gold Cup the sport's most prestigious but the King George is the champions' race, a contest which, unlike the Gold Cup \u2013 devised originally as a trail for the Grand National \u2013 is invariably won by jump racing's horse of the year.</p> <p>In that context, Kauto Star's achievement in winning five King Georges has been nothing short of remarkable. A decision as to whether he will get the chance to run again in the race this Christmas is expected imminently, when the owner Clive Smith and trainer Paul Nicholls end speculation and either retire him or commit him to one more run.</p> <p>The impression from the racehorse ratings expert Timeform in its latest <em>Chasers &amp; Hurdlers</em> annual, published on Saturday, is that it would like to see him race once more.</p> <p>\"It is hard to imagine a jumps season without Kauto Star,\" Timeform states in its extended essay on the horse. \"A sixth King George would not be such a fanciful idea either, as \u2013 ignoring his Gold Cup display \u2013 Kauto Star was again the best staying chaser in training in the latest season,\" it adds, warming to the idea. \"Certainly, as he jogged exuberantly round the paddock in the champions' parade at Sandown on the last day of last season, Kauto Star hardly looked like a horse for whom age was an issue.\"</p> <p>The current King George favourite, Long Run, the only horse in the last four seasons to have temporarily taken Kauto Star's title, will run in the Grand National next year, provided he has not been able to compete in the Gold Cup, it was announced by his owner on Wednesday. And Timeform is adamant that any more radical changes to the Aintree marathon should be ruled out by racing's rulers.</p> <p>\"It would be easy to make further cosmetic changes to the Grand National, such as cutting the field size and even reducing the extreme distance of the race, but more changes should not, in all conscience, be made without good reason and then only after mature reflection.</p> <p>\"After all, where is the evidence that tweaking the fences in recent years has made the race that much safer? The times have tended to get faster in the National as the course has been remodelled, something which, in itself, has the potential to increase the danger,\" argues Timeform, which concludes: \"Frankly, if there was a simple solution to making the Grand National acceptable to its critics without changing its character, it would have been found by now.\"</p> <p>Big Buck's was given the accolade of the Horse of the Year for the first time, which is against ideas being floated, such as going back to chasing, to give the four-time Cheltenham Festival World Hurdle winner a fresh challenge, arguing that a bid for a fifth in a row is something to relish.</p> <p>Indeed, it points out: \"The defending champion in all four of the major championship races at Cheltenham returned as short-priced favourites in the latest season for a repeat. Hurricane Fly, Long Run and Sizing Europe were defeated, providing an illustration of how hard it is to win a championship even twice in a row. To win one four or five times in succession is nothing short of phenomenal.\"</p> <p>Quevega, meanwhile, will go for her fifth Cheltenham Festival win in the Mares' Hurdle in March and avoid Big Buck's at that meeting. A clash between the two would be \"full of entertainment value, a 'battle of the sexes' fitting into Racing For Change's remit to promote events that 'broaden the appeal of the sport',\" admits Timeform, which suggests a way of bringing the two outstanding staying hurdlers together:</p> <p>\"There would appear to be an opportunity for either Aintree or Punchestown to tempt the respective connections of Big Buck's and Quevega, perhaps by offering to double the prize money for their staying championship if both horses line up.\"</p> <p>There are plenty of other subjects chewed over in the 1,000-plus pages covering the A\u2013Z of the 9,300 runners that competed on Britain and Ireland's tracks last season, as well as analysis of the up-and-coming contenders for the championship crowns.</p> <p>Two of them are at the yard of Paul Nicholls' rival, Nicky Henderson. Sprinter Sacre has been given a rating of 175p (\"astonishing for a horse in his first season over fences\") while the \"sky is the limit\" for Simonsig, who achieved the highest figure for a novice hurdler in Timeform's annuals since the 2002-03 campaign.</p> <p><em>Timeform's Chasers &amp; Hurdlers is published by Portway Press at \u00a375.</em></p>",
  "<p>It was the \u00a31.99 Tesco chicken that, four years ago, came to symbolise cheap supermarket food and helped to galvanise consumers into questioning the provenance and economics of the staple items in their shopping basket.</p> <p>In its new branch in Saxmundham \u2013 the Suffolk market town that even longer ago famously fought off plans for an out-of-town Tesco superstore \u2013 the \u00a34 fresh chickens in the chiller cabinet are being ignored by the late afternoon shoppers who are favouring items covered in \"reduced\" stickers.</p> <p>Among them is mother-of-two Jackie Long, who has popped in on her way home from work and picked up a 2.5kg bag of Maris Piper potatoes which has been further discounted to 95p. \"They'll last another week, mashed, chipped and in stews,\" she says. \"I do my main weekly shop at the Co-op but this is on my way home and around teatime they tend to slash the prices. I have really noticed prices going up in the last six months, particularly of things like bread, coffee and fresh fruit. They've all become a bit of a luxury.\"</p> <p>A straw poll of customers at this store \u2013 just across the road from its arguably more well-heeled and soon-to-expand competitor Waitrose \u2013 reveals that shoppers of all ages and from all social backgrounds are more worried about price hikes than anything else when it comes to making their produce choices.</p> <p>This mirrors findings from a recent government survey which showed that in May the main food issue of concern to 63% of respondents was food prices \u2013 an increase from 60% in November last year.</p> <p>Even ethical considerations have dropped down their list of considerations, according to a separate survey by charity <a href=\"http://www.igd.com/index.asp?id=1&amp;fid=3&amp;sid=71&amp;tid=192\" title=\"\">IGD ShopperVista</a> which showed that price is crucial in determining product choice, with 41% of shoppers naming it as the most important factor and 90% listing it within their top five influences. Ethical provenance was considered least important \u2013 mirrored in the 3.7% slump in sales of organic food and drink last year.</p> <p>Affordability is now the key factor in determining what food and drink we buy. Food prices have risen 12% in real terms over the last five years, taking us back to 1997 in terms of the cost of food relative to other goods. This week cash-strapped consumers \u2013 already stung by extra financial pressures such as rising petrol costs, inflation-busting rail fares and further hikes in their energy bills \u2013 were warned to expect further food price rises as a result of the drought in the US and the washed out UK summer that have affected the supply and quality of crops.</p> <p>Record droughts in large swaths of the US's key agricultural lands have depressed the harvest there, leading to higher cereal prices internationally. All of this has led to a sharp increase in wheat prices in the UK \u2013 from \u00a3150 a tonne to more than \u00a3205 a tonne. Although supermarkets have said they will try to keep down the impact on consumers, this will almost inevitably mean higher bread prices. It is also bad news for meat prices, as farmers struggle to pay for feed for their livestock.</p> <p>The combination of a severe drought early in the year, followed by the wettest early summer on record, has produced some of the worst possible conditions for Britain's farmers, decimating yields and leaving crops prone to disease. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer\" title=\"\">Wheat was the crop worst hit by the heavy rainfall</a>, with a 14% fall in yields, according to the National Farmers' Union.</p> <p>Other crops have also suffered severe damage. The British Growers Association (BGA), representing vegetable farmers, said the pea harvest was down about 45% - a reduction that will mean huge imports to make up the shortfall of one of the UK's most popular vegetables.</p> <p>The much-anticipated Christmas dinner is likely to be dearer too. Poultry producers have seen their overheads increase dramatically, owing to the poor grain harvest, which has pushed up the price of chicken and turkey feed. Early projections show there will be one-fifth fewer Brussels sprouts this year thanks to the weather. Parsnips have had a poor season and the effects of discolouration on potatoes are still to be fully felt.</p> <p>There were a few bright spots \u2013 yields of oilseed rape, though down slightly on last year, are up about 6% on the five year average, according to the NFU. British producers are reporting healthy sales of rapeseed oil as a much cheaper, healthier and UK alternative to imported olive oil.</p> <p>Retailers are also helping by agreeing to relax some of their high standards on the size and shape of vegetables and fruit. Mis-shapen or small fruit has traditionally been rejected by supermarkets, for aesthetic reasons, but the poor weather has meant an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/27/ugly-fruit-vegetables-supermarkets-harvest\" title=\"\">increase in the proportion of slightly odd-looking produce</a>. Throwing that away at a time of high prices would be deeply unpopular, so the shops have promised to take more of them.</p> <p>\"That's the only silver lining,\" said James Hallett, chief executive of the BGA. He said vegetable growers would try to keep price rises to a minimum, but in many cases they would have no choice as they need to recoup their costs. The big question, he said, was whether retailers passed on any price rises. \"No one wants to raise prices when everyone is under pressure, but people have made big investments in growing these crops and they need to try and stay in business. We will have to wait to see what the retailers decide to do.\"</p> <p>All this has put national food policy under the spotlight. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) reported last week in a barely noticed 50-page statistical document - the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/files/defra-stats-foodfarm-food-pocketbook-2012-121005.pdf\" title=\"\">Food Statistics Pocketbook 2012</a> - that UK food prices have increased by 32% between 2007 and 2012. As a result, lower income families have cut their consumption of fruit and vegetables by nearly one-third to just over half of the five-a-day portions recommended for a healthy diet. No surprise, then, that internet companies selling food past its \"best before\" date (but still safe to eat) at knock-down prices \u2013 known in the industry as \"the grey market\" \u2013 are enjoying a boom.</p> <p>And we are changing the way we shop to take advantage of cheap deals. The consumer group Which? has been interviewing consumers in video \"booths\" across the UK for its <a href=\"http://press.which.co.uk/whichpressreleases/have-your-say-on-the-future-of-food/\" title=\"\">Future of Food project</a> \u2013 due to report next month - which is an in-depth investigation into shopping and spending patterns. Early findings show that the average cost of shopping bill is \u00a376.83 per week, an increase of \u00a35.66 compared to a year ago. Most people (86%) said the reason for an increase in their weekly shopping bill was due to an increase in food prices, with only 2% saying it was because they had more money to spend. And 92% said they'd noticed an increase in the price of food in the past year.</p> <p>In addition, more people (91% compared to 81% a year ago) are shopping around to get the best price; more (91% compared to 74% a year ago) are buying cheaper groceries and more (77% compared to 59% a year ago) are shopping at discount supermarkets. Which? is also calling for clearer \"unit pricing\" of food and better labelling so that cash-strapped consumers can better make sense of what they are buying.</p> <p>Mary Creagh MP, Labour's shadow environment secretary, described the current situation as \"a national scandal\". She said: \"Even though we are the seventh richest nation in the world,&#xa0;we face an epidemic of hidden hunger, particularly in children \u2026 Being able to feed yourself properly is fundamental to people yet government figures show that people on lower incomes are buying and consuming less than five years ago as fruit, milk, cheese and egg prices are up by 30%.\"</p> <p>She pointed out that towards the end of its last term in government, Labour published the first national food strategy for 50 years, which aimed to give direction and coherence to food policy no only within Whitehall and its agencies but also across the private and public sectors. It is now gathering dust on Defra ministers' shelves.</p> <h2>Food statistics digested</h2> <p>\u2022 Food prices rose by 32% in the UK between 2007 and 2012 compared to 13% in France and Germany.</p> <p>\u2022 Fruit and vegetable consumption is falling. The lowest 10% of households by income reduced purchases of fruit and vegetables by 20% between 2007 and 2010.</p> <p>\u2022 There are 63 million consumers in the UK, who last year (2011) spent a total of \u00a3179bn on food, drink and catering services, including \u00a3101bn on household expenditure on food and drink.</p> <p>\u2022 Consumer expenditure on food, drink and catering has continued to rise despite the economic downturn. There was a rise of 3.5% in 2011 to \u00a3179 billion.</p> <p>\u2022 The combined market share of food and non-alcoholic drinks of the largest four food and drink retailers has remained unchanged at 62% in 2010. Tesco commanded the largest market share at 23%, down from 25% in 2009 but still well ahead of its nearest rivals Asda and Sainsbury's (both 13% ) and Morrisons with 12%.</p> <p>\u2022 Internet food shopping increased to a new high of 3.1% of sales of food and non-alcoholic drinks in 2010, from 2.5% in 2009.</p> <p>\u2022 Processed foods have risen the most since June 2007, with a 15% rise in the year to June 2012 and 36% since 2007.</p> <p>\u2022 Fruit prices are the second highest reisers, by 34% since June 2007, rising steadily each year.</p> <p>Source: Food Statistics Pocketbook 2012, published by Defra October 2012</p>",
  "<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of new games for smartphones and tablets, this time covering iPhone, iPad, Android and Windows Phone.</p> <p>The week's pick of new and notable games spans driving, football (from both sides of the Atlantic), first-person shooters, board games and robots. Read on for the selection.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/crazy-taxi/id553921725?mt=8\">Crazy Taxi</a></h2> <p>Sega has ported its marvellous driving game Crazy Taxi to iOS, and specifically the Dreamcast version of the game, complete with its Bad Religion and Offspring soundtrack. As before, the game involves charging round a city collecting and dropping off passengers, while leaping off hills whenever possible. 16 mini-games are thrown in for good measure.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftWBHM\">Wild Blood</a></h2> <p>Gameloft has brought its Unreal-powered Arthurian action game to Android, as you control Lancelot in his quest to unseat the turned-mad King Arthur. It's a big game, with 2GB of free space required for the install \u2013&nbsp;but the sumptuous graphics are worth the download wait. Online deathmatching and capture-the-flag modes are also included.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/real-football-2013/id533391318?mt=8\">Real Football 2013</a></h2> <p>Hot on the heels of FIFA 2013's App Store release comes Gameloft's Real Football 2013, with its own FIFPro licence for player names and likenesses, and an emphasis on developing your club, stadium and commercial businesses alongside a winning team. That's in the context of a freemium game, so it's free to download and play, but you pay for virtual cash using varying quantities of real money, from \u00a31.49 up to \u00a369.99.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftF3HM\">NFL Pro 2013</a></h2> <p>And another Gameloft sports game for good measure, this time covering the other kind of football, with helmets and touchdowns and dodgy refs. We're not sure if the latter make it in here, but the game itself \u2013&nbsp;another free-to-play title \u2013&nbsp;has crossed from iOS to Android. It's got an official NFL licence, and similar features for developing the infrastructure around your team.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/babel-rising-3d/06f630ae-b19a-49cd-91ff-4b08d6183cf4\">Babel Rising 3D</a></h2> <p>The latest Xbox-branded game for Windows Phone comes from Ubisoft, and sees you in the shoes of a \"great, almighty, and very angry deity\" picking on a tribe of humans to ensure they don't get the Tower of Babel built. An interesting spin on the god-game genre.<br><strong>Windows Phone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kumo-lumo/id551319982?mt=8\">Kumo Lumo</a></h2> <p>Forget taking it to the cloud, as Microsoft might say. In this game, you ARE the cloud, floating above a virtual world raining on forests and poleaxing enemies with lightning bolts. The visual style is strong and original, and it's a free-to-play game \u2013&nbsp;in-app purchases are used to boost your prospects with virtual gold purchases.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/topia-world-builder/id534282109?mt=8\">Topia World Builder</a></h2> <p>There's a lot of buzz around Topia World Builder because of the involvement of Glenn Corpes, one of legendary god-game Populous' co-creators. This takes some of that series' ideas and applies them to touchscreen gaming, as you shape a virtual world with your fingers, spawning animals and tweaking the landscape as you please.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/super-bunny-breakout/id560556342?mt=8\">Super Bunny Breakout</a></h2> <p>Atari and Zynga, together at last? It's a meeting of minds that has surprised plenty of people, but the results look like they may be fun. This is a 2012 update on the Breakout brick-busting formula, except with a plot involving a team of rabbits trying to break out of an \"Evil Animal Testing\" lab. 40 levels and plenty of power-ups ensure it feels modern rather than retro.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.plagueinc\">Plague Inc</a></h2> <p>Two days after launching, Plague Inc has already zoomed past 100k downloads on the Google Play store, albeit as a free download. It's the latest game from Miniclip, and gets players to \"bring about the end of human history by evolving a deadly, global Plague whilst adapting against everything humanity can do to defend itself\". Which is cheery. An in-app purchase removes ads and unlocks bonus features.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madfingergames.deadzone\">Shadowgun: Deadzone</a></h2> <p>Polished shooter Shadowgun has spawned a new spin-off for Android, although it's in beta for the moment, and only available for devices with Tegra 3 processors (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra#Tegra_3\">this link may help</a> if you're wondering if that's true of yours). The focus here is on online deathmatching, with four playable characters, two modes and two maps.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.leagueofevil\">League of Evil</a></h2> <p>\"Flip, dash and wall-jump your way to destroying the League of Evil,\" suggests the Google Play listing for Noodlecake Studios' new game, which offers well-crafted pixel art, 160 levels and some tight controls. Oh, and lots of acrobatics, with a chiptune soundtrack. It looks as excellent as the existing iOS version.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/monopoly-millionaire/id563613222?mt=8\">Monopoly Millionaire for iPad</a></h2> <p>Monopoly has been one of the most popular mobile games since long before the app store era, but now EA has rebooted the digital version of Hasbro's board game once again. The emphasis here is on speed, as you race for a million in a board tilted towards luxury lifestyles. Multiplayer is supported on one device or via local Wi-Fi.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.chaosrings.googleplay\">Chaos Rings</a></h2> <p>Other developers will be keen to see if Square Enix can make decent money with an \u00a38.99 price on the Google Play store for its RPG, which has been ported from iOS. It sees you playing through four scenarios with a pair of characters each, with battles and plotlines in equal measure.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/world-series-of-yahtzee/id538216630?mt=8\">World Series of Yahtzee</a></h2> <p>Another revamp of a well-established board game (well, dice'n'paper game) from EA, although this one's free-to-play. Will Yahtzee fans balk at the idea of buying in-game \"stacks\" for real money? That remains to be seen, but the game itself sounds good fun, with power-ups and combos. The initial game is ad-supported, but you can pay \u00a31.49 to remove those.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad </strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.contrejour.ie/\">Contre Jour</a></h2> <p>This isn't a native app: it's an HTML5 version of existing mobile hit Contre Jour, which has been created in partnership with Microsoft for its Internet Explorer 10 browser and Windows 8 OS. That means it's good for tablets, including multi-touch controls and use of hardware acceleration. Now, all you need is a Windows 8 tablet running IE10...<br><strong>HTML5</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/girls-like-robots/id533815482?mt=8\">Girls Like Robots</a></h2> <p>\"Girls like robots. And robots like girls. Just don't surround robots with girls; it makes them freak out,\" explains the App Store listing for Adult Swim and Popcannibal's new game. Moustaches, pies and lasers also find their way into the gameplay for this tile-based puzzler, which offers 110 levels of robotic girly action.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ben-10-game-generator-3/id550715659?mt=8\">Ben 10 Game Generator 3</a></h2> <p>Ben 10 remains a popular brand among children, and the previous two Game Generator games have picked up a thriving audience. This third iteration continues the formula: 50 top-down levels filled with traps, enemies and obstacles. However, the twist is the inclusion of a level editor for children to create their own levels and share them with other players \u2013&nbsp;and download their creations too.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.thumbstar.com/games/grumble-and-piccolos-fishing-trip\">Grumble and Piccolo's Fishing Trip</a></h2> <p>There are lots of gem-swapping games available for smartphones and tablets, but how about starfish-swapping? The game focuses on a pair of Chinstrap Penguins catching fish and other sealife for their customers, with match-three gameplay boosted by canny use of power-ups. I went to a press event which included this earlier in the year, and ended up absorbed for 20 minutes, so hopefully it'll find an audience.<br><strong>Android / iOS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.glu.com/game/death-dome\">Death Dome</a></h2> <p>Modern-day app stores are pretty unhealthy places, given the number of population-ravaging viruses on the loose in mobile games. Glu's freemium Death Dome is the latest action game that sees humankind getting a bit... mutanty. Infinity Blade appears to be a big inspiration for the gameplay, with its enormous monsters to battle and skills/looting mechanic.<br><strong>Android / iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Invictus.GreedCorpMobilePaid\">Greed Corp</a></h2> <p>Greed Corp has found a popular audience on PC and console, but now it's available for Android devices too. Expect turn-based strategy in a steampunk setting, with solo and multiplayer modes, online high-score tables and 36 maps to play on. The link above is for Android smartphones, but a <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Invictus.GreedCorpPaid\">separate HD version</a> caters for tablets too.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <p>That's our selection, but what are you playing this week on your smartphone or tablet?

  "<p>In August, <a href=\"http://www.trashtalkhc.com/\" title=\"\">Trash Talk</a> played a warehouse show in their adopted hometown of Los Angeles. A friend of theirs was releasing a new skate shoe line, and he wanted a band to play the launch party. \"We're not really into doing private events,\" says guitarist Garrett Stevenson, \"but we said we'd do it if we could make it a free show, just to make sure we could get in all the people who wanted to see us.\"</p> <p>Everything was going well. Fun times, rad people. But as the night drew on, the crowd outside grew, and when the band took to the stage, things got ugly. \"Right as we started playing people were rushing the doors to get in,\" says vocalist Lee Spielman. \"Then security started macing and tasering the kids who were getting in the way.\" Not that Trash Talk knew anything about it. \"The organisers cut the show short by five minutes. I was just like, 'Hey, maybe it's getting late,'\" says Garrett. \"But I went outside to have a cigarette and I was like, 'Oh <em>shit</em> \u2026 there are riot police in the street with shields, helicopters overhead, shit is <em>everywhere.</em>' I just missed a full-scale riot, and we were the last people to find out.\"</p> <p>From this, we can draw two simple but profound truths about Trash Talk: one, that their live show is a more compelling spectacle than a riot; and two, that if people are willing to risk getting tasered to get into their gig, they're probably doing something right. Trash Talk's new album, 119, backs this up. Tracks such as <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/ofwgkta-official/exile-on-broadway\" title=\"\">Exile On Broadway</a> and Uncivil Disobedience are brutal, downer takes on hardcore punk; proof that Trash Talk are not only one of the most thrilling bands operating in 2012, but also that they're working in the grand lineage of bellicose Californian punk. In the late-70s and early-80s, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/05/black-flag-keith-morris-formed-off\" title=\"\">Black Flag</a> and the Circle Jerks took punk rock, sped it up, laced it with suburban frustration and sold it to smalltown America from the back of a beat-up van. The DIY attitude wasn't just supplementary to the music: it informed it, engendering a spirit of personal integrity and no-compromise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CBag0W08Zoc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CBag0W08Zoc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CBag0W08Zoc\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>This is the spirit Trash Talk work in. Formed in Sacramento in 2005, Trash Talk network extensively, tour incessantly, record their own music, and press and distribute their records via their own Trash Talk Collective imprint. \"It came out of getting frustrated waiting on people,\" says Garrett. \"There's that point of realisation: 'Damn, this is all it costs to put out a record? Why didn't I do that in the first place?'\"</p> <p>Right now, Trash Talk are in the city of Lawrence, Kansas, where they're on tour with their friends <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all\" title=\"\">Odd Future</a>. This isn't your standard headline band, support band deal. Instead, the groups' agents booked the tours running in tandem, with Odd Future playing bigger venues and Trash Talk playing afterwards at the club a couple of blocks down the street. It's been a meeting of the tribes: punk kids checking out Odd Future, hip-hop kids getting their first taste of the moshpit. \"There's a bit of crossover, but it's fun to play to people who don't know us,\" says Garrett. \"We played Columbia, Missouri a couple of days ago. I walked outside afterwards and there were all these Odd Future fans, all like, 'I've never seen a punk band in my life \u2026 that's the craziest shit ever!'\"</p> <h2>'We built a place where we can practise, skate, make zines \u2026 do whatever we want, with our friends, on our own terms'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397652759\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349884574759/Lee-Spielman-Trash-Talk-008.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Spielman Trash Talk\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Spielman of Trash Talk on stage in Hythe, 2010. Photograph: Metal Hammer Magazine</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metal Hammer Magazine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first glance, Odd Future and Trash Talk might look like strange bedfellows but the two groups have a lot in common: when Trash Talk moved to LA in 2011 the groups started hanging out, skating, barbecuing, smoking weed. Before long, friendship turned to collaboration. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/07/tyler-the-creator-odd-future\" title=\"\">Tyler, The Creator</a> directed the video to 119's lead single, FEBN, under his Wolf Haley guise, and he also performs a guest rap on the track Blossom &amp; Burn. But the real sign of the two groups' closeness is that 119 will be a joint release with Odd Future Records. It's a break from Trash Talk's DIY ethos, but the partnership feels natural. \"Odd Future handle business as a collective, a unit,\" says Garrett. \"They do everything they want to do, and if they don't want to do something, it doesn't happen. And that's exactly how we work.\"</p> <p>The album title refers to Trash Talk's living quarters, a repurposed mattress factory near the city's poverty-stricken Skid Row district. \"We wanted to get a spot that we can all live at and be creative,\" says Lee. \"We built a studio, a mini skate ramp and a bunch of lofts in there. It's a place where we can practise, skate, make zines \u2026 do whatever we want, with our friends, on our own terms.\"</p> <p>An illustration of the breadth of Trash Talk's creative enterprise is that their next release, after 119, is Trash Talk Collective: Volume Two, a 300-page hardback art book packaged with a seven-inch record. \"It's the coolest shit I've ever done, man,\" says Garrett. \"It's a mix of pictures, writing, art \u2013 we come back from tour like, 'That kid we met in Japan is an awesome fucking artist, or that guy from Portland takes killer photos \u2013 let's just press it ourselves.'\"</p> <p>It's tempting to try to inscribe political significance on to what the band do. Their track Uncivil Disobedience, introduced by Spielman's howled \"Occupy your streets!\" and dotted with lyrics about \"class war\" and \"inciting a riot\", seem to imply solidarity with the spirit of global protest. But the group deny any such simple political allegiance, with bassist and co-lyricist Spencer Pollard describing the song as being about \"the difficulties in channelling deep frustrations into peaceful movement when violent outbursts are just as easily executed and potentially more instantly gratifying.\"</p> <p>Perhaps it's more accurate to say that Trash Talk are a post-political band. For all the aggression in their music, they have a lot to say about the importance of family and friendship. The truth is that 119, the building \u2013 and by extension, the band itself \u2013 is a way to survive in a city gone feral, where punk kids live in fear of taser-happy policemen and the poor fend for themselves. \"Walk out of our house and you see tents, homeless dudes going through the trash,\" says Garrett. \"That all becomes material.\" So Trash Talk's fierce racket is just a dirty mirror directed at their environment? \"One-hundred-and-fifty per cent, man.\"</p> <h2>Punk's not dead</h2> <p><strong>Three other loud and fast bands you should hear right now </strong></p> <p><strong>SAUNA YOUTH </strong>Fleet-footed London art-punks mixing garage riffs with intellectual lyrics about the mundanity of existence.</p> <p><strong>Key track </strong><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/faux-discx/sauna-youth-psi-girls\" title=\"\">PSI Girls</a></p> <p><strong>CEREMONY </strong>For their fourth album, Zoo, these Rohnert Park punks toned down the hardcore for a sound inspired by the buzzsaw post-punk of Wire's Pink Flag.</p> <p><strong>Key track </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m_CbDMIdlI\" title=\"\">Adult </a></p> <p><strong>HOLOGRAMS </strong>Scruffy Swedish punks sing about Vikings and the dour concrete misery of the Stockholm projects, with added bloopy Korg synth.</p> <p><strong>Key track </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOrRmH4azlk\" title=\"\">ABC City </a></p>",
  "<h2>Subject: history <br>Interviewer: Stephen Tuck, Pembroke College </h2> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Imagine we had no records about the past at all, except everything to do with sport \u2013 how much of the past could we find out about?</p> <p><strong>Stephen:</strong> I would say this to a candidate who had mentioned an interest in sport on their personal statement, though it could equally be applied to an interest in something else \u2013 like film, drama, or music.</p> <p>What I would be looking for is to see how the candidate might use their imagination, building on something they know about (probably much more than I do) to tackle questions of historical research.</p> <p>Answers could relate to the racial/class/gender relations in society (who played the sports, and which sports, at any given time); international politics/empire (which countries were involved, did groups of countries play the same sport); economic development (the technological development of sports, how sport was watched); the values within a society (bloodthirsty sports to more genteel sports); health (participation rates); or many other issues \u2013 the list is long.</p> <p>I would usually ask supplementary questions, to push the students further \u2013 and often, I would have no answer in my mind, but would simply be interested in seeing how far the student could push their analysis.</p> <h2>Subject: English <br>Interviewer: Lucinda Rumsey, Mansfield College </h2> <p><strong>Q: </strong>JK Rowling has just published a book for adults after the hugely successful Harry Potter series. In what ways do you think that writing for children is different to writing for adults?</p> <p><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Candidates who have grown up on Harry Potter might have read Rowling's new book and have thought both about Rowling's change of audience and their own change as readers from child to adult. But even without knowing Rowling's work at all candidates could say something about themselves as readers, and how as readers they approach different kinds of books, and how writers develop a body of work and write for different audiences.</p> <p>Mainly I always want to know that whatever they are reading, candidates are reading thoughtfully and self-consciously, and are able to think as literary critics about all the books they read. I worry that not all candidates might have the same access to a wide range of literature, and I am careful to judge them on what they know, not on what they don't know.</p> <p>If I asked that question about Shakespeare some candidates might have a view of his literary output, but many wouldn't. If I start with Harry Potter, everyone at least has a starting point of recognition. And I think Rowling deserves a mention as I am sure that there are many people applying to study English at university this year who became avid readers because of her books.</p> <h2>Subject: experimental psychology <br>Interviewer: David Popplewell, Brasenose College </h2> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Why do human beings have two eyes?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> This question may result from a more general discussion about the human senses, and can develop in a number of different directions, partly depending upon the knowledge and expertise of the interviewee.</p> <p>For example, two eyes are important for three dimensional (3D) vision. Why is it that we can still see in 3D when only looking through one eye? What determines the optimum position and distance between the two eyes?</p> <p>Why is it that we see a stable view of the world even though we are constantly moving our head? How can an understanding of mathematics, physics and biology help us explain 3D vision?</p> <p>The discussion may develop in to a consideration of the different senses and the role they play in us interacting in our environment, including interacting with other people, and the nature of perceptual experience.</p> <h2>Subject: modern languages <br>Interviewer: Helen Swift, St Hilda's College</h2> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Should poetry be difficult to understand?</p> <p><strong>Helen:</strong> This question arose out of discussion of a few poems that a candidate said he had read, and we were talking through how these poems were conveying meaning (through things such as tone and the imagery they used).</p> <p>We wanted to push the candidate into more conceptual thinking to test his intellectual curiosity and how he would handle moving from familiar particulars (the poems he knew) to less familiar ways of approaching them.</p> <p>What's important for candidates to realise is that we don't expect a single correct answer to such a question; it's a starting point for a new direction of discussion: what sorts of \"difficulties\" might we have in mind? Are these specific to poetry or do they also feature in other types of writing? And so on.</p> <p>What most interests us is that candidates are willing to venture down a new path, however uncertain this may feel: to have a go and show that they have the potential to develop their thinking further \u2013 and thus thrive on the sort of course we offer.</p> <p>Literature forms an important part of a modern languages degree at Oxford, but we know that most candidates won't have studied literature formally before in the language for which they're applying.</p> <p>What we want to know isn't that they've read a certain number of texts to prove their interest, but that they have the aptitude for studying texts: that they're able to think carefully and imaginatively about whatever they've have chance to read (poems, prose, drama) that's interested them, in any language.</p> <h2>Subject: biological sciences <br>Interviewer: Martin Speight, St Anne's College</h2> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do many animals have stripes?</p> <p><strong>Martin:</strong> The main aim of the question is to get applicants to think about biological topics and put them in the context of successful adaptations to life on earth. So I might expect students to start by thinking of some stripey animals, then move on to thinking about categories of striped animals \u2013 for example those that are dangerous (such as wasps, tigers, and snakes), those that have stripes for camouflage (such as zebras but also tigers), and those whose stripes are harmless mimics of dangerous ones.</p> <p>They might think of specific examples for detailed comparison: tigers and zebras for example both have stripes for camouflage and blending in with background, one to hide from prey and the other to hide from predators.</p> <p>Other things that would be worth considering include whether stripes may only occur in the young of a species; whether the colour of the stripes matters rather than just the contrasting stripe pattern, and why do stripe size, shape, width and pattern vary in different species.</p> <p>There are no right or wrong specific answers to the questions \u2013 I'm just interested in candidates' speculations about the advantages of having stripes.</p> <h2>Subject: politics (philosophy, politics and economics)<br>Interviewer: Dave Leal, Brasenose College </h2> <p><strong>Q:</strong> When I was at school in the 1970s, there was talk of a pensions crisis that would one day hit. The talk persisted in the 1980s, and the 1990s \u2013 and then there was a pensions crisis, and little had been done politically to prepare us for it.</p> <p>Is there a fault with the British political system that means we can't sensibly address serious medium and long-term problems when they are identified?</p> <p><strong>Dave:</strong> This question was an invitation to think about democracy and its limitations \u2013 it's a big question, but an important one. I have had candidates come up with good discussions about voting methods \u2013 for example, how having proportions of parliament voted in for much longer terms might promote more long-term policy thinking.</p> <p>Another approach might be to reflect on the responsibility of the electorate; if they do not think in long-term ways, it may not be politicians who are to blame, and the problem may be down to education.</p> <p>One might reflect upon the importance of having an un-elected second chamber to which all really important business could be delegated.</p> <p>One candidate suggested that no one should be allowed to stand for parliament unless they have dependent children, with the thought that this would ensure a personal motivation towards longer term thinking on a variety of matters.</p> <p>There is no single 'right answer' to the question, most answers given serve as the basis for further elaboration. For example, in the case of longer parliamentary terms: what would be the wider consequences of that change? Would they be desirable?</p> <p>We are testing the capacity to begin to locate the source of a problem, and try out solutions through discussion. The precise solution students suggest matters much less than evidence of the refining of ideas and of self-correction where necessary.</p> <p><strong> \u2022 Do you have memories of a nerve-racking university interview?

  "<p>It's not just what you design, it's how you design it. This has particular resonance when referring to the state of the renewable energy industry in the UK.</p> <p>The UK government's stop-start approach to supporting the development of renewable energy solutions suggests some confusion about how to effectively move us toward a green economy. The cut in support for solar power is a case in point. The government <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/01/solar-panel-feed-in-tariff-cut\" title=\"\">recently announced</a> that anyone installing solar panels will receive 16p per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated, compared with 21p previously (and as much as 43p originally), and the subsidy will last for 20 years instead of the 25-year duration formerly pledged.</p> <p>Unfortunately, governments aren't the only ones that say one thing and do another. Many of us express \"deep concern\" about the use of finite energy sources, but don't want to spend the money or take the many steps involved in installing renewable energy solutions.</p> <p>The perception of the higher cost of making greener choices together with the inertia that is often generated by making bold changes remain major obstacles to wider acceptance of renewable energy solutions.</p> <p>Meanwhile there continues to be an explosion of renewable energy entrepreneurs testing new technologies, new designs, new systemic approaches, and even new financing schemes. We are not lacking ideas or entrepreneurs but we are lacking investors (be they private or public sector investors) who are willing to take risks and invest their capital in designing a better world.</p> <h2>What are the barriers?</h2> <p>In the past, cost has been an obvious barrier. Renewable technologies essentially capitalise fuel costs. The cost of the equipment that uses \"free fuel\" (solar, wind, geothermal) is more expensive than the cost of equipment that uses hydrocarbon fuel (coal plants, gas turbines). Thus you pay more upfront, and less to operate. Financing is today's problem, not cost.</p> <p>If capital intensive equipment is to be financed, it has to operate reliably over the course of it's lifetime and to be built, it has to have a reliable market/regulatory environment that will support debt amortisation. Thus, the policy environment has to deliver two things: incentives and reliability. Incentives without reliability is not good enough to deliver the low carbon transition.</p> <p>The cost of developing these solutions is substantial with many interconnected moving parts and complicated supply chains. Even with the advent of digital prototyping that enables entrepreneurs to build and test their ideas in the computer long before building physical prototypes, the time to market for these new technologies is still capital intensive and very lengthy. Once a technology is proven, there's the cycle of explaining and selling the idea first to investors and then to customers \u2013 all development costs before we even get to costs of deployment.</p> <p>The UK's new <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/funding/funding_ops/innovation/innov_fund/eefs/eefs.aspx\" title=\"\">Entrepreneurs' Fund</a> for SMEs and individual innovators makes \u00a335m available in stages to speed up the development of low-carbon technologies. This is the role governments should be playing to jump start the chain of players in the renewable energy ecosystem. We need to invest in the entrepreneurs who are working at the very earliest stages of inventing and designing our path to a low-carbon economy. Once an idea is proven and ready to bring to scale, the investment community is more willing to step in and carry the ideas forward.</p> <p>But it's the early stage of the design process when entrepreneurs need governments to step in and make an investment in prototyping and designing solutions for the green economy.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/embedding-sustainability-design-future?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">his blog</a>, Chris Sherwin wrote that \"doing design without sustainability \u2026 will be as inexcusable as designing dangerous and unsafe products today\". The same will be true of energy eventually \u2013 the question is how to accelerate progress in the right direction and how to help these entrepreneurs bring their ideas to market most efficiently and economically.</p> <h2>New ways of working</h2> <p>One trend that is changing the trajectory significantly is the prevalence of 3D design technology being applied across the entire clean energy ecosystem. With the ability to build a digital prototype early in the process, designers and engineers can do real time simulation and analysis to fully understand how their design will operate \u2013 thereby enabling them to optimise the design.</p> <p>The savings on time and cost that clean energy entrepreneurs and design teams are reporting is astounding and may be the key to reducing the barriers to entry for low carbon solutions.</p> <p>Bristol-based <a href=\"http://www.itpower.co.uk/\" title=\"\">IT Power</a>, a hydrofoil tidal energy technology company, used these design tools to run complex performance tests, resulting in a design that can be installed in shallow tidal flows and can be offered at a highly competitive price. Likewise, the Swedish offshore wind company <a href=\"http://www.hexicon.eu/\" title=\"\">Hexicon</a> used digital prototyping to guarantee the accuracy of its designs and ensure that installations are affordable and efficient energy producers.</p> <p>Cleaner Air Solutions of Durham is another convert applying the latest design technology to it's processes. It designs modular solar panel systems for sites where most solar-power systems would not be feasible. By using digital prototypes to ensure systems fit in whatever space is available, they are able to bring solar panels to a whole new range of sites. The subsequent shortened turnaround time for projects has enabled the company to take on more business and create new jobs.</p> <p>We all have a stake in creating a better, cleaner, brighter future. Businesses alongside government must partner to support early stage entrepreneurs so they can iterate, test and design the solutions we need. Introducing early stage clean tech entrepreneurs to the latest design technology is often far more helpful than an infusion of cash. Instead of cash, they get access to the latest technology and expertise to help bring their idea to market more quickly and more affordably than ever thought possible.</p> <p><em>Lynelle Cameron is senior director of sustainability and philanthropy at </em><a href=\"http://usa.autodesk.com/sustainable-design/\" title=\"\"><em>Autodesk</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>New Yorkers, it's fair to say, have something of a reputation. They're brusque and they're brash and they will trample you with their ambition. But it's not something in the water that makes them like this; it's something a lot of them are swallowing with expensive bottles of Smartwater. It's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall\" title=\"\">Adderall</a>.</p> <p>Adderall is the brand name for a cocktail of amphetamines packaged up by big pharma for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This being a disorder that presents with extraordinary frequency in the US, particularly amongst the offspring of pushy parents. Type A-sorts intent on their kids getting straights As, even if it means putting them on Class As. Because, here's the thing: Adderall is basically legalised speed. And here's the other thing: Adderall works. Or rather, it makes you work. It makes you alert and focused and able to concentrate for hours on end.</p> <p>Adderall works so well, in fact, that some doctors are advocating its use in schools, whether the kids have ADHD or not. This week the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/attention-disorder-or-not-children-prescribed-pills-to-help-in-school.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">published an article</a> about a Dr Michael Anderson, who prescribes Adderall to low-income schoolchildren struggling with their studies. Dr Anderson doesn't even believe ADHD is a legitimate illness, but he does believe that taking Adderall can help disadvantaged children compete with their more privileged peers. \"We've decided as a society that it's too expensive to modify the kid's environment,\" he explains. \"So we have to modify the kid.\"</p> <p>There has been some justifiable outrage about Dr Anderson's standpoint. After all, doling out hardcore drugs to kids who aren't even legally able to buy a beer is deeply weird. But then again, so is America's attitude to drugs. This is a country that has spent <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/05/13/ap-impact-years-trillion-war-drugs-failed-meet-goals/\" title=\"\">40 years and $1 trillion</a> warring against drugs \u2013 or, rather, the \"wrong\" sort of drugs. This is a country that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/nyregion/31drug.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">shuts its borders</a> to anyone who has been convicted of taking a Class C drug. And yet this is a country that not only tolerates certain Class A-type drugs, it actively embraces them.</p> <p>Dr Anderson's unusual frankness has brought into relief what is an open secret about Adderall: it is widely and unashamedly used by large swaths of privileged America so they can work harder, faster, and longer. And I'm not just talking about college kids. While discussions of Adderall in the media focus overwhelmingly on its use in educational institutes, what you hear less about is the number of professionals who use it so they can put more hours in at the office. Indeed, demand for the magic pills is so rampant in New York that when the <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/2/16/anatomy-of-the-great-adderall-drought\" title=\"\">great Adderall drought of 2011</a> struck the city it triggered a thoroughly Gotham-ic panic. Normally stoic New Yorkers <a href=\"http://www.advicegoddess.com/archives/2012/01/02/got_adderall.html\" title=\"\">wept at pharmacist counters</a> and The New York Observer set up a special <a href=\"http://observer.com/2011/11/adderall-shortage-where-to-buy-11232011/\" title=\"\">Adderall Wire</a> to keep tabs on where readers should try scoring. The Observer, let me stress, is not a fringe publication. It printed Candace Bushnell's \"Sex and the City\" column and targets a <a href=\"http://observer.com/about-us/\" title=\"\">\"sophisticated readership of influential young urban professionals\"</a>. Not drug addicts, mind, but influential young urban professionals.</p> <p>One of the reasons America's well-paid classes are so in love with Adderall is that it is pathetically easy to get hold of. There is a reason they call a prescription a 'script over here: find an accommodating doctor and you simply have to say the right words in the right order to get whatever you want. I've dabbled with Adderall before because of a banker-friend of mine who knew one such doctor. My friend worked at UBS from 5am to 7pm and went out in Manhattan from 11pm to 4am. When you're tired of London you may be tired of life, but when you're tired of New York you simply don't have enough Adderall. And this friend made sure she had enough.</p> <p>Adderall, you see, is capitalism's wonder-pill. It optimises your productivity levels, it dulls your personality levels, and it turns you into the closest human approximation there is to a machine. And that's why, despite the fact that it's basically speed, despite the fact that it's ridiculously addictive, despite the fact that it can re-wire your brain and ruin your life, much of corporate America is A-OK with it.</p>",
  "<p>I'm told some of the greatest works of literature were written behind bars. Of course I've never read Oscar Wilde's pink-tinged tome From Reading With Love (or whatever it's called), or Nelson Mandela's barnstorming apartheid-busting bestseller, Long Walk to Freedom, but word has it, if these people hadn't been locked up, both books would have been shit.</p> <p>\"But why are you talking about prison, Rupert?\" I hear you ask, \"Men of your substantial wealth and influence don't end up doing bird with tarnished baddies like the ghost of Jimmy Savile.\"</p> <p>Well, dear reader, times have changed. Punk musicians used to be just green-haired goons that we spat at in the street, but now we're locking them up for talking arse about democracy. MPs were once simply untouchable duck-loving rich bastards who we allowed to graze on country estates at our expense, now we're making them tell us what they spent their pocket money on like naughty schoolchildren.</p> <p>Indeed, this is an alarming epoch \u2013 so worrying that I, Rupert Sawyer, write this latest missive under effective house arrest in Panama \u2013 a situation so dire, that even looking at pictures of Lady Gaga hanging out with holed up J-Ass can't lift my spirits.</p> <p>What is my crime? Am I the mysterious \"fourth celebrity\" to be implicated in Savilegate? Have I released reams of boring digital crap about the US government to the world on a previously unheard of website? No, all I've done is attempt to entertain the world \u2026</p> <p>You see, for many years I have wondered what is the point of a good deal of our television channels? Beyond the high-profile and excellent first-run entertainment shows produced on our shores like Love Shaft, Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model, Road Wars and Celebrity Wipeout, much of British (and Vietnamese) television is stuffed with American imports \u2013 imports that are almost always readily available months in advance of their so-called \"network premieres\" in the UK if people would only get stuck in to the wonderful information superhighway.</p> <p>Why should the British public be held to ransom by these UK channels eager to \"add value\" to popular shows by ruining them with incessant ad breaks, and forcing people to wait and wait to see them? Why, when they can simply download them off the internet in a matter of minutes (broadband connection willing) and watch the shows in glorious high definition with all the commercials cut out by some geeky kid in Idaho?</p> <p>But when I launch a channel that screens these shows immediately after US broadcast, giving the people what they want, the establishment comes down on me like a Cambodian pharmacist's hangover. This, apparently, is what we call progress \u2026</p> <p>Both the broadcasters and the courts should be thanking me, rather than hounding me off to Central America. My \"Torrent 24\" channel was an example of the innovation and ingenuity that used to make this country great. Was Alexander Graham Bell locked up for talking into a yoghurt pot attached to a piece of string? Did they throw away the key when John Logie Baird told people to look into his magical picture box and all they saw was a load of black and white fuzz? No. People embraced those ideas \u2013 so why victimise me?</p> <p>It's quite clear that there is fear among my terrestrial rivals that I will bring them down with my big ideas, and the need, in these troubled media times, to find a scapegoat.</p> <p>Channel 5 knows that I've exposed much of their schedule as a BitTorrent catch-up service, Channel 4 knows they'll never be as cutting edge as Channel 8. ITV, well they're so busy commissioning dog talent shows from Simon Cowell, they probably don't know what day of the week it is \u2026 and as for the BBC, well, I think they've got a lot of questions to answer over the coming weeks, and any distraction from those will come as a welcome relief.</p> <p>Whether I can ever leave this 500-acre luxury estate in Panama without being arrested, I cannot say. If Channel 8 will survive this latest ambush on its reputation remains to be seen. All I know are these three things, which I shall present using an alphabetical device;</p> <p>A. My loyal son Solomon will do all he can to defend the family name and businesses while I'm away</p> <p>B. The \"fourth celebrity\" involved in the Savilegate scandal is [redacted]</p> <p>C.

  "<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8034/8062906685_4fee66d66d.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8034/8062906685_4fee66d66d.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"453\" /> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday, the last of this year's Nobel Prizes in science were awarded, so this the last of my Nobel Prizes in Quackpottery, too. Like Wednesday's Nobel, this Quackpottery award is for chemistry.</p> <p>If you have just popped in for the first time to read this little series, let me review the prize rules. First, similar to the Nobel Prize, this award is limited to still-breathing scientists. Additionally, they must have already won the Nobel Prize in a scientific field and they must openly embrace some form of anti-scientific or pseudoscientific quackery. This fantasy award consists of a gold-plated duck penis and the presentation of this award is accompanied by 42 quacks from an outraged duck.</p> <p>The winner of this year's Nobel Prize in Quackpottery for Chemistry is <a href=\"http://www.karymullis.com/science.shtml\">Kary Mullis</a>. Mullis is the American biochemist who was awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his improvements to the concept of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a prize he shared with Michael Smith, who was recognised \"for his fundamental contributions to the establishment of oligonucleotide-based, site-directed mutagenesis and its development for protein studies\".</p> <p>I selected Mullis for this award to honour the severity of the damage that he has wrought upon his own scientific credibility. The reasons I chose Mullis are legion, and are based on his many unfounded attacks upon solid science that has been published in fields for which he has no expertise, research experience or training.</p> <p>\"I read a lot, and think a lot, and I can talk about almost anything\", Mullis assures us <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/mullis.html\">in his Nobel autobiography</a>. </p> <p>\"Being a Nobel laureate is a license to be an expert in lots of things as long as you do your homework.\"</p> <p>But Mullis <em>hasn't</em> done his homework. Despite lacking any training, research experience or expertise in either medicine or virology, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/01/hiv-contrarian-still-publishing-still-wrong/\">Mullis -- in common with Peter Duesberg -- disputes whether HIV causes AIDS</a>. Instead, he argues in <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=MCAqomvRYNMC&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">his autobiography</a> that AIDS is a conspiracy of environmentalists, government agencies and scientists attempting to preserve their careers and earn money. This is contrary to decades of published research findings that link AIDS and HIV, and some of best evidence refuting Mullis's AIDS/HIV denial are those thousands of HIV-positive people who, believing Mullis, refuse treatment -- but unfortunately, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/print?id=1386737\">they're dead</a>.</p> <p>Further, undeterred by his lack of expertise or research experience in a number of other research fields, Mullis also shares his opinions about them. For example, he disputes scientific evidence that <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/01/hiv-contrarian-still-publishing-still-wrong/\">chlorofluorocarbons are</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/15/science/scientist-at-work-kary-mullis-after-the-eureka-a-nobelist-drops-out.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\">depleting the ozone layer</a> <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/kary_mullis_on_what_scientists_do.html\">and that industrial waste gases are linked to global climate change</a>. </p> <p>If you wish to learn more, you can find a summary of Mullis's views on AIDS/HIV and climate change in <a href=\"http://www.karymullis.com/pdf/On_AIDS_and_Global_Warming.pdf\">this document</a> posted on <a href=\"http://www.karymullis.com/science.shtml\">his website</a>. Additionally, Mullis elaborates on these topics and discusses some of his other opinions in <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/9167379\">a talk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPETGWDWhNE\">Fireside Chat</a>, both delivered in 2010.</p> <p>Surprisingly, even theoretical and quantum physics have not escaped his omniscient gaze: Mullis disputes the <a href=\"http://www.astralgia.com/webportfolio/omnimoment/archives/interviews/mullis.html\">big bang</a> <a href=\"http://www.karymullis.com/books.shtml\">theory</a>.</p> <p>But Mullis is surprisingly friendly to pseudoscience. In his autobiography, <em>Dancing Naked in the Mind Field</em>, he instructs his reader on how to illuminate a light bulb using brain waves. Mullis also claims to have chatted with <a href=\"http://www.cufos.org/IUR_spring99_addendum.html\">a glowing raccoon that he met at midnight while on his way to the loo</a> then losing the ensuing six hours as a result of an alien abduction. <a href=\"http://www.cufos.org/IUR_spring99_addendum.html\">Although Mullis admits his lack of scientific evidence</a>, he also supports astrology, astral plane travel and reincarnation. </p> <p>After reading this summary, you might suspect that Mullis is a quackpot's quackpot or, as Arthur Herzog wryly observed, an Anything Authority:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The anything authority is one whose credentials in one field are taken as valid for others -- sometimes many others. [...] The trouble with an Anything Authority is not that he takes a position or works for a cause but that he seldom seems to apply the same standards of research and documentation to the field in which he is not expert as he would to his own.<br>(<a href=\"http://books.google.it/books?id=vvnVkmeiv2wC&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=arthur+herzog+%22anything+authority%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=En406og6qM&amp;sig=HsNeZDScqiB4DFbCMuFWu2y8kPY&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q4p0UM6zIczMtAbV_4GACQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA\">The B.S. Factor: The Theory and Technique of Faking It in America</a> by Arthur Herzog.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Similar to chatting with a glowing raccoon, Mullis seems to enjoy messing with people's perception of reality.

  "<p>\"It's been the worst year in living memory,\" says Jonathan Lukies, who farms 288 hectares (720 acres) of arable and fruit orchards near Stansted, Essex. \"It was horrific.\"</p> <p>This year's weather has been a rollercoaster for British farmers that most now just want to forget. With a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/12/hosepipe-bans-drought-water-uk?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">record drought</a> afflicting most of England in the early spring \u2013 one so severe it prompted a series of emergency meetings with government \u2013 farmers desperately needed above-average rainfall to replenish the soil for planting. Their prayers for rain were answered \u2013 but in the worst possible way, with the wettest early summer ever recorded, followed by a near-sunless summer and torrential downpours in many areas late in the growing season.</p> <p>This combination of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/global-warming-washout-summer?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">extreme weather</a> was disastrous for staple crops such as wheat and vegetables, first putting off growth and then washing out crops and preventing them from ripening.</p> <p>\"Starting from Easter weekend, we had a year's rainfall in three months,\" says Lukies. \"That was the killer. I've never seen anything like it, and my father who is in his 60s says he's never seen the like either.\"</p> <p>His views are echoed across the farming community. Guy Gagen, crops adviser at the National Farmers' Union (NFU), says: \"Speaking to farmers who have been in business for decades, they don't remember anything being as difficult as this year. There have been bad years before, of course, but this has been terrible right across the growing season, from beginning to end.</p> <p>\"One of the problems was that it was just so dark \u2013 there was too little sunlight for crops to grow. If you think back, some days in June were like November. That really reduced productivity.\"</p> <p>Every sector of farming has been hit. Arable farmers have seen yields of wheat fall by 14%, according to the NFU, reducing the UK's wheat crop to levels not seen since the 1980s \u2013 before many farmers invested in modern technology such as grain driers. Vegetable growers have suffered, with half the pea crop wiped out across the country. Meat producers, from poultry to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/01/pig-farmers-struggling-npa-survey?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">pig farming</a>, have seen their overheads soar due to the poor global grain harvest raising feed prices. Salad and fruit growers have also had a dreadful year, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/10/rain-douses-appetite-summer-salads?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">fresh produce being thrown away</a> or fetching abnormally low prices during June and July, as people were simply not buying summery foods because of the miserable weather.</p> <p>Prices to consumers are rising sharply as a result of all these factors. That might appear to mean a bonanza for farmers \u2013 at least the food they have been able to grow is now fetching top prices. But most farmers are not profiting.</p> <p>For many arable farmers, one reason is that they hedge their risks on future yields by contracting to sell their grain at an agreed price before the harvest, which gives them a guaranteed income on what they can produce. Lukies was typical, contracting for about two-thirds of his crop in advance. But prices early in the season were low \u2013 about \u00a3150 a tonne. As the harvest came in, prices soared to \u00a3205. Lukies was unable to cash in even on the third he had not sold in advance, as most of his crop was of too poor quality, owing to the weather. Thousands of farmers are likely to have found themselves in a similar bind.</p> <p>For other farmers, such as vegetable growers, any price rises are outweighed by the much lower yields of their crops. \"People have invested money in growing these crops, and seen the yields sinking,\" says James Hallett, chief executive of the British Growers Association.</p> <p>As has been increasingly the case in recent years, the fate of most UK farmers will be dictated by the supermarkets. The \"big four\" have such a huge market share that they can determine the margins farmers receive. They even manage to soak up much of the one source of income farmers can rely on even in tough years \u2013 farm subsidies.</p> <p>An average family of four in the UK was paid \u00a3426 a year in farm subsidies under the EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) in 2009, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and poor people are hit hardest as that represents a higher proportion of their disposable income than for the rich. That figure, amounting to more than \u00a38 on every weekly shop, is likely to have increased since 2009 but no new research has been done. The money is supposed to support hard-pressed farmers. But the stranglehold of the supermarkets means that much of it goes to the big firms' bottom line.</p> <p>That is because the big retailers know how much farmers receive in subsidy \u2013 it is public information \u2013 and can calculate the farmers' cost of production, so that they push down the prices they pay farmers. For thousands of farmers, this means producing food such as milk, poultry and pigs at a loss \u2013 what the supermarkets pay is below the cost incurred. Only the subsidies they receive keep these farmers in business, making them just about profitable enough to carry on.</p> <p>So the subsidies paid by UK households are in effect boosting the supermarkets' profits more than the farmers \u2013 the big retailers can reap higher margins from the food they buy from farmers by paying less than the cost of production, leaving taxpayers to pick up the bill for keeping farmers in business. That is one of the reasons consumers on mainland Europe pay less for their shopping \u2013 the rise of 6.4% to UK consumers' weekly shop is double the EU average.</p> <p>Defra said the government was trying to reform the CAP. However, while the big supermarkets are able to dictate prices, farmers and consumers are likely to continue to be squeezed.</p> <p>Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: \"The CAP is a disaster for Britain, forcing up our food bills and costing taxpayers a fortune in administration \u2013 it undermines the competitiveness of British farmers while cheaper imported food becomes more expensive because of tariffs and quotas. This keeps prices artificially high at a time when so many families are struggling to even put food on the table.\"</p>",
  "<p>Time Out is claiming lapsed readers have returned to the magazine after it went free last month and increased distribution six fold.</p> <p>Project director Greg Miall, who oversaw the relaunch, said the weekly magazine had targeted a circulation of 300,000 by the end of the year, but the decision to abandon its cover price entirely has been such a hit with commuters it has achieved its business mission within three weeks.</p> <p>The magazine, which has been a London institution for more than 40 years, had suffered badly in recent years with circulation halving to 50,000 from its peak in the 1990s.</p> <p>Time Out suffered because of competition from the internet and due to new free rivals in the capital including the weekly magazines Stylist, ShortList, Sport and the London Evening Standard, which went free in 2009.</p> <p>\"It is like we are reclaiming London,\" said Miall, who joined the title in May as launch director to oversee the transition to free distribution.</p> <p>\"What has been amazing is the brand recognition. We've had amazing feedback from the distributors. People passing by the distributor and then stopping and coming back and saying 'Wow, it's Time Out, it's free?'.

  "<p>Five theatre workers have been detained by police in Fife after posing with swastika flags from a production of The Sound of Music outside the local council offices.</p> <p>The group, who are all employees of the <a href=\"http://www.alhambradunfermline.com/\" title=\"The Dunfermline establishment\">Alhambra theatre</a> in Dunfermline, were kept in cells at the local police station for five hours on Wednesday, while the theatre's owner, Bill Fletcher, who was in Edinburgh at the time of the incident, was summoned back for questioning. All five were later released without charge.</p> <p>Fletcher explained that the act had been a \"joke\" protest against the \"bullying\" of council officials, with the intention of using the photographs in the theatre's forthcoming adult pantomime. The flags had just been used in the theatre's production of The Sound of Music, for a scene in which the Von Trapp family perform at a Nazi event in Austria.</p> <p>Officers from Fife police saw the four technicians taking the photos on CCTV and put a stop to proceedings, leading them away in handcuffs.</p> <p>Fletcher <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/police-throw-theatre-workers-in-cells-for-dunfermline-swastika-prank-1-2568034\" title=\"Police throw workers in cells\">told the Scotsman: </a> \"We saw an opportunity to poke fun at the council and took it. These are not banned images and we were using the flag in a satirical fashion.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"It's a great pity that our attempt to have a joke at the expense of the council, in retaliation for years of bullying suffered at their hands, has turned out to have serious consequences for our staff.\"</p> <p>Fletcher accused the council of giving preferential treatment to other venues in the area, saying the Alhambra was \"one of only two theatres in Scotland to receive no council funding\". Last month, he reportedly criticised the council for heavy-handedness after a table and chairs were removed from the pavement outside the theatre.</p> <p>\"We at the Alhambra, over the last six years, have had nothing but harassment from Fife council,\" Fletcher said. \"We've brought a theatre to the town and they do everything in their power to cause us grief.\"</p> <p>Steve Grimmond, Fife council's executive director of environment, enterprise and community, denied the rift, telling the Scotsman: \"We recognise and value what the Alhambra theatre brings to Dunfermline and enjoy a good working relationship and regular contact with them. We are always happy to work with the theatre.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson from Fife constabulary confirmed the incident, adding: \"It was established that no crime had been committed.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's one victory that the US anti-doping agency can never strip from Lance Armstrong: he beat cancer. More than that, he inspired a major cultural shift in how we view the disease and people afflicted with it: they're no longer cancer \"victims\", \"patients\" or \"sufferers\". They're cancer survivors. The disease is no longer to be endured; it's to be fought.</p> <p>In 1997, during his successful treatment, Armstrong established a small foundation, known as Livestrong. The purpose was to fund testicular cancer research. In its first year, it took in less than $250,000. Nine years and seven Tour de France titles later, Livestrong had sold more than 75m $1 yellow wristbands, and had made Armstrong a global hero to millions. But now that Armstrong has been stripped of those Tour titles, the question has been raised: does his charity work somehow make up for his bad behaviour as a sportsman? Is it OK that he cheated, somehow, because (as more than one influential US sports columnist has written) he \"does so much for cancer\"?</p> <p>Last year I made a <a href=\"http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/athletes/lance-armstrong/Its-Not-About-the-Lab-Rats.html?page=all\" title=\"\">thorough investigation of Livestrong</a> for Outside magazine \u2013 what it does, and what it doesn't do. One thing it doesn't do \u2013 contrary to popular opinion \u2013 is fund cancer research, in the sense of guys in white lab coats looking for a cancer cure. Your Livestrong donation will not hasten that cure. It does help cancer patients and their families \"navigate\" the patchy and hostile realms of the US healthcare system. But it also does quite a lot to boost the stature and brand value of one Lance Armstrong. In August 2009, for example, the foundation spent about $7m \u2013 a quarter of its annual spend \u2013 on a Dublin \"summit\" whose main purpose seems to have been presenting Armstrong as a kind of global statesman, on the same plane as his role models, Bono and Bill Clinton.</p> <p>That seems a very long time ago. This week, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/10/lance-armstrong-doping-case-live\" title=\"\">US Anti-Doping Agency (USASA) released about 1,000 pages of evidence</a> and testimony that Armstrong used banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions throughout his Tour de France career. It is gruesome reading. There is no more room for reasonable doubt. In the sporting realm, he is utterly disgraced. Should that opprobrium also extend to Livestrong?</p> <p>Without doubt, Livestrong has helped many people with cancer. There are some good, dedicated people who work there (their PR director certainly deserves a raise after what she's been through this year). And without doubt, Armstrong has inspired many more cancer survivors, just by having survived the disease himself, and triumphing as an athlete. But as we now know, he has also been lying to them, for years. He lies to them still, every time he repeats his tired denials. How is that OK?</p> <p>A year ago, I predicted that Armstrong would lose his Tour titles. I did not foresee, however, the extent to which Livestrong would be enlisted in his defence. Every time there was a new eruption in the doping case, it seemed, Livestrong was launching some sort of new campaign or new \"outpouring of support\" for cancer survivors. Anything to change the subject. His lawyers shamelessly cited Livestrong in their letters and press releases, and even in court filings. On more than one occasion, Livestrong-paid lobbyists were reported to have questioned congressmen and senators about the USADA investigation. Charity funds were apparently being used to help the charity's founder avoid doping sanctions. Again: how is that OK? Why would anyone (but a true believer) ever write them a cheque, ever again?</p> <p>Livestrong may survive this storm. If it does, one would hope that it is because of the public's generosity toward its cancer-stricken fellows, and not because people have suddenly decided, in the 21st century, that poor ethics don't matter any more, so long as the person in question has done sufficient charity work (historical note: the Catholic church tried that during the middle ages, selling indulgences to make up for sins. It didn't work out so well).</p> <p>My analysis of Livestrong's behaviour and its spending, though, leads to one inescapable conclusion. In order to survive, perhaps it needs to strip Lance Armstrong of one more title: chairman.</p>",

  "<p>Hello again to cryptic newcomers! Our aim here at the crossword blog is to remove any anxiety you might feel, and to make every clue crackable.

In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/658\">the second</a>, one part of the wordplay goes inside another, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/apr/19/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-containers\">as we described in an earlier post on \"containers\"</a>...</p> <blockquote> <p>5d <strong>Sloppy</strong> setter's <em>keeping</em> quiet <em>in the East End</em> (5)</p> </blockquote> <p>... and since Nutmeg the setter could refer to himself as \"me\", we put an H-free \"hush\" inside \"my\" for MUSHY.</p> <p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/624\">a clue from Moley</a> where the word which needs to lose an H is given directly in the clue - which is only fair since it forms part of an anagram:</p> <blockquote> <p>17d Test <em>Cockney's</em> hunch <em>about</em> <strong>a horse</strong> (8)</p> </blockquote> <p>We jumble the letters of TEST and UNCH for a CHESTNUT horse. Giddyup.</p> <p>Cockneys, of course, still write down an H when a word begins with one, as in this story from Robert Barltrop and Jim Wolveridge's book The Muvver Tongue:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One Sunday morning some years ago I sat in a bus behind a man who had his little boy of about four on his lap. The child had a picture-alphabet book, and the father was explaining it carefully; when they came to h, the picture was of a hedgehog. The man said: 'that's an edgeog. It's really two words, edge and og. They both start with h.'</p> </blockquote> <p>And so what we're sometimes being asked to do is to imagine how a word sounds rather than just spelling it without an H, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/dec/08/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-soundalikes\">like in the soundalike clues we looked at in an earlier post</a>, and in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/24379\">this clue from Crucible</a>...</p> <blockquote> <p>30ac <strong>Is it raised by suspicious</strong> <em>East End intellectual</em>? (7)</p> </blockquote> <p>... where a Cockney pronunciation of \"highbrow\" gives us the answer: EYEBROW.</p> <h2>So how to spot them?</h2> <p>As you've no doubt noticed, there's a giveaway almost as obvious as the appearance of \"Spooner\" when a clue contains a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/mar/01/cryptic-crosswords-beginners-spoonerisms\">spoonerism</a>: the word \"Cockney\", or something that gives the same sense: \"East End\", \"EastEnders\" and so on.</p> <p>A cunning setter might use \"Bow\" and put it at the beginning of the clue to divert attention from its capital B, but you usually know where you are. And for this reason, Cockney clues, like spoonerisms, are used sparingly.</p> <h2>It's not always that simple</h2> <p>There's usually an H going missing, but not always. The setter Araucaria, for example, enjoys other approximations of Cockney speech, like in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/25376\">this clue</a>...</p> <blockquote> <p>14d <strong>Bird</strong> of <em>rubber in vulgar parlance</em> (9)</p> </blockquote> <p>... where an Estuary pronunciation of \"sandpaper\" (which you rub) gives <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2011/jul/22/prize-crossword-annotated-solution\">the answer</a> SANDPIPER.</p> <p>Here's a tougher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/22204\">one from Gordius</a>, where the wordplay and definition overlap...</p> <blockquote> <p>14d <strong><em>Having two forms</em></strong> <em>of saying \"unintelligent\" in Bow</em> (9)</p> </blockquote> <p>... and \"dim or thick\" might lead you to DIMORPHIC.</p> <p>And of course sly setters know that seasoned solvers are on the lookout for those giveaway words and sometimes use them in a completely different way. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25750\">Here</a>, Paul tempts you to start talking all Albert Square...</p> <blockquote> <p>3d <strong><em>Composition of</em> London air Cockney <em>ultimately</em> <em>inspired</em>?</strong> (3,3,4)</p> </blockquote> <p>...before realising that you should in fact be singing because the answer is the East End music-hall standard ANY OLD IRON. But this is the exception.</p> <h2>And how to enjoy them</h2> <p>Because words like \"Cockney\" usually mean \"look for an opportunity to drop an aitch\", it's always a relief to be able to scan the clues at the start of a solve and find one that will probably yield without too much brainache. </p> <p>For other examples - like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/25724\">Araucaria's use of \"paid paper\"</a> to get you to PIED PIPER - the wordplay is closer to a gag and so if you're in the mood to enjoy a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/dec/08/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-soundalikes\">homophone</a>, you might crack a smile before moving on. </p> <p>Time was, of course, when well-meaning brows furrowed over some speakers' lack of aspiration - witness <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jan/20/archive-1943-extremes-in-spoken-english\">this 1943 Guardian coverage</a> of a Lords debate about the pernicious effects of the BBC and \"the importance of phonetics in connection with democratic education\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Why did we allow children to drop aitches and, what was more extraordinary, put them in where they were not wanted? Why should words like 'paint' be pronounced 'pint', a very good word in another place?</p> </blockquote> <p>In crossword world, though, such concerns have no place. If some people's hands sound like ands, well - that aitchlessness is just another game to play with language. As the French - no fans of leading \"H\"s themselves - say, vive la diff\u00e9rence!</p> <h2>Over to you</h2> <p>One of my favourite Cockney clues is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/25507\">another from Gordius</a>, where again the wordplay and definition are entwined:</p> <blockquote> <p>3d <strong><em>How a Londoner is said to work with this?</em></strong> (6)</p> </blockquote> <p>Newcomers, any questions? And seasoned solvers, do you have any examples which have raised your ARDOUR?</p>",

But, writes Tess Lanning, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research and co-editor of Rethinking Apprenticeships, <a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/rise-in-apprenticeships-under-coalition\" title=\"\">employers are just rebadging low-level workplace training programmes</a>. She writes: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apprenticeship policy under the coalition is still effectively grounded in targets, rather than efforts to tackle the long-standing problem of low demand for skilled workers among employers outside of the traditional apprenticeship sectors.<br>... The lesson is that the targets don't work. Numbers make good press releases but this brings with it the temptation to fiddle the books. Rebadging low-level workplace training programmes does not an apprenticeship make. At a time of high youth unemployment, more high quality routes into good jobs for young people are very welcome. Unfortunately, too much of the growth in apprenticeships appears to add to the stock of low level training programmes for workers in low skilled, low paid jobs with few progression prospects. We need a focus on quality and not quantity.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Essential reading on the government's <strong>housing benefit</strong> proposals from junior doctor Tim Crocker-Buque's blog. <a href=\"http://drtimcb.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/cutting-housing-benefit-for-under-25s-is-indefensible-immoral-and-criminal/\" title=\"\">Cutting housing benefit for under 25s is indefensible, immoral and criminal</a>, he writes, and shares the stories of three young people he's worked with, all of whom claim housing benefit. Crocker-Buque writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can't conceive of George Osborne imagining what it would be like to be a young person living in poverty on an inner city estate, yet somehow he has come to the conclusion that young people see housing benefit as a free perk to get a house of their own. In Tower Hamlets, it certainly doesn't work that way. The stories above are some of the more challenging situations, but are by no means uncommon. Child poverty and homelessness in young people are a blight on the face of London and the shame of a wealthy nation.

  "<p>Have you been wondering why your gardening has been a disaster this year? You're not on your own.</p> <p>Food prices are set to rise after a summer of wet weather has hit harvests. The global price of wheat has risen by 30% over the last year. Potato harvests are down by half in some areas. The NFU's Scottish cereal survey indicated wheat yield was down by 18% from 2011, winter barley yield down 7%, spring barley yield down 18% and winter oilseed rape yield down 26%.</p> <p>Apple growers in England say it's the worst harvest for 12 years and Save the Children reports that food price rises and volatility are the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/10/high-volatile-food-prices-normal?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">\"new normal\"</a>. Shoppers will be affected by higher prices for other crops, with global grain costs hit by American drought and Russian heatwave. The yo-yo flood and drought reflects a society not sure where or how to live and now unable to feed itself properly.</p> <p>This isn't the exaggeration of green miserabilism. New research by consumer group Which? found that the average cost of a shopping bill is now \u00a376.83 per week \u2013 an increase of \u00a35.66 on the previous year.</p> <p>Only three years ago, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, warned that the world faced a \"perfect storm\" of food, water and energy problems, due to global warming and the rising global population. Elements of that perfect storm are here now. Doubters can read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/10/food-price-rise-uk-crop-harvest\" title=\"\">Damian Carrington's summary of recent scientific findings</a> or read the study released by Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance firm, which sees climate change driving increased weather volatility and predicts those influences <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2012/10/10/weather-disasters-climate-change-munich-re-report/1622845/\" title=\"\">will continue in years ahead</a>.</p> <p>It's clear we need to change the way we do food. We need to make food part of the solution not a growing part of the problem of climate change.</p> <p>But we're in for a shock. Cheap food, artificially low cheap food, is going to come under attack. Our manipulated subsidy of sectors of food and farming (beef and dairy) will have to change if we want to retain that particular myth. The new food reality will hit a food economy that's already dysfunctional in terms of diet-related health, ecology (<a href=\"http://www.fcrn.org.uk/fcrn/publications/how-low-can-we-go\" title=\"\">the food we eat accounts for 30% of the UK's carbon footprint</a>) and social justice.</p> <p>We're not going to like this. There's been an undercurrent of soft-denialism that goes something like this. The weather may be changing but it will be good for us here in northern Europe. It's most often heard around soft fruit or vineyards in \"unusual places\" and almost always has a gallows humour to it. I think we'll be hearing a lot less of this as the realities of globalised food and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/10/english-vineyard-scraps-harvest-weather?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">fundamentally altered weather system</a> come to the fore.</p> <p>With this the notion of \"bounty\" or \"plentitude\" that's deeply imbedded in our understanding may be under challenge. The sense of entitlement wrapped up in a lovely jumble of pagan and Christian symbolism that used to roll together into a vague Thanksgiving will come under question. The cornucopia of living in a fertile land. Now we're more likely to expect ceaseless globalised food from the shelves of 24-hour Tescos. Unacknowledged, food just gushes out, endlessly. Doesn't it?</p> <p>We may have broken the cycle of appreciation long ago and will simply wake up shocked and angry that we can't buy lots of very cheap food. That was our birthright, right? Like houses you could make money off or the certainty of banking, cheap petrol so you can drive anywhere, cheap food \u2013 the notion of abundance \u2013 is the next of our pillars of certainty about to be knocked away.</p> <p>What can we do? We may have to change our thinking about how we do food and farming in response to climate change from one of mitigation to adaptation. We definitely will have to change our model of farming from one of vast mono-crop farms which are heavily dependent on external inputs and highly vulnerable to failure, to more diverse and smaller scale models. That has huge consequences for land ownership, tenancy, planning law and urban agriculture. We'll have to look at much shorter supply chains using less energy and routes and networks that are far less vulnerable to failures and shocks through the system than our vast over-extended globalised food system.</p> <p>We should abandon \"yield\" as the sole metric of farming success. It has its twin in the concept of \"growth\" that has driven western economics to ruin. There are other things we can do to drastically reduce waste. We can eat \"ugly food\", we can stop subsidising biofuels, and we can begin the slow process of wrestling the food system back from big farming, the multiples and the handful of companies that dominate our broken food system. Diversity, open source farming and food sovereignty is the key. It's harvest time, but it's going to cost us all.</p>",
  "<p>Bankers risk an \"uncontainable\" political backlash unless they agree to wide-ranging reforms to the financial sector, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/07/paul-tucker-favourite-bank-england\" title=\"\">the favourite candidate</a> to become the next Bank of England governor has said.</p> <p>Paul Tucker, currently its deputy governor, warned that without structural reforms that limit the cost of breaking up failing banks and prevent taxpayer bailouts, bankers would find themselves with few defences against an angry public.</p> <p>Tucker made his comments on Friday in response to demands from senior bankers at an international banking conference that regulators relax strict rules designed to prevent a repeat of the Lehman Brothers crash in 2008.</p> <p>A senior Japanese bank executive said taxpayers should remain on the hook for losses in the event of a crisis, while the one of the top brass at Deutsche bank argued that plans to ringfence the casino arms of major banks from their retail operations would make them less efficient and raise costs for customers.</p> <p>Speaking at the Institute of International Finance in Tokyo, Tucker said it was necessary to guarantee that taxpayers would escape paying again to bailout banks.</p> <p>\"The objective is to get to a point where public money is not used. If there was to be another financial crisis, once we have got through this one, and there was a need to bail out the banks, I think the backlash would be uncontainable,\" he said.</p> <p>Tucker was joined by Thomas Hoenig, a regulator on the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who said many major banks were too big to fail and needed to be broken up.</p> <p>The debate highlights the battle going on behind the scenes at meetings of regulators as they seek to agree rules for global bank regulation.</p> <p>The US has passed the Dodd-Frank Act, while the UK plans to bring in new laws based on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/12/vickers-report-banks-given-until-2019\" title=\"\">a report by Sir John Vickers</a>, who is also understood to have applied to succeed Sir Mervyn King as Bank of England governor. The EU is readying to push through new supervisory rules, though is only just considering a report that considers how to break up banks.</p> <p>Tucker said he believed it was possible for regulators to sit down with senior bankers and agree a method to re-finance them from private sources when they get into trouble, but they must accept public funds are off limits.</p> <p>Nobuyuki Hirano, president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said a taxpayer bailout should remain in the armoury of regulators. He said that without the possibility of taxpayer funds being used to re-finance banks, regulators were tying one arm behind their backs.</p> <p>Anshu Jain, co-chairman of Deutsche's management board, said attempts to ringfence the activities of banks would raise their costs and hit efficiency.</p> <p>Last night another frontrunner to become governor, Lord Turner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/11/lord-turner-fsa-mansion-house-speech-bank-of-england-governor\" title=\"\">criticised the financial sector's conduct in the runup to the financial crisis in 2008</a>.</p> <p>\"In retrospect, it was a fool's paradise \u2013 the band playing oblivious to the dangers ahead,\" he said. \"A lot of apparently very clever people got it very wrong and the ordinary citizen suffered. We have to do better in future.\"</p>",
  "<p>Print still accounts for 70% of the Guardian's revenues, according to its chief executive. Speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network\">Guardian Media Network's</a> Future of Digital Media event, held in conjunction with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS), Andrew Miller said that the yield on digital was still \"way, way lower than newspaper\".</p> <p>\"Digital is fantastic, [with] fantastic opportunities, but only 30% of our revenues come from digital format. So, to say we can sustain a business for a long time with a high level of journalists with this mix of revenue is very, very difficult.\"</p> <p>Miller stressed the importance of GMG's assets other than the newspaper in ensuring its survival. \"Critically, our way of surviving is [that] we've assets outside of the Guardian,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We have a loss-making core newspaper, but it's subsidised by other assets we can draw on when we need to.\"</p> <p>He said that GMG was dealing with the financial challenges facing the Guardian by \"understanding our brand, understanding our audience; we're segmenting people who read the Guardian [\u2026] and working on understanding the audience more clearly to make more money from that audience.\"</p> <p>\"There's a positive side, which is trying monetise the audience,\" Miller said. \"The other side is trying to optimise the economics of the paper.\"</p> <p>He said this latter element involved \"format changes, and price rises, continuing pressure on the cost base.\"</p> <p>Miller said investment was also a part of the company's strategy. \"It's a tricky balance of trying to find the right levels of costs, to continue to invest in new products and innovation as well.\"</p> <p>\"Journalism is very under threat at the moment with the digital transition,\" He said.</p> <p>He described how the Guardian's approach to news gathering and ownership of expertise had changed.</p> <p>\"It's a completely different place we're in now,\" Miller said. \"News organisations 'owning' news just is no longer a sustainable business model.\"</p> <p>He said the Guardian was trying to encourage what he called open journalism. This was a means of finding a way to survive in digital format, he said.</p> <p>\"[The Guardian's] approach about serious journalism; it has to cover more than just a paper, it's about other social media as well,\" he said.</p> <p>The story of the death of Ian Tomlinson, the newspaper seller who died following an incident during the G20 protests in 2009 was \"open journalism at its best\", Miller said, where the Guardian used social media to gather photos and videos to try and then determine what had happened.</p> <p>Miller mentioned the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform\">Guardian's open API</a> (application programming interface) as an important element of its open journalism, as it means \"people can extract the data from our website and play with it and use it.\"</p> <p>He said that approximately three million people engaged with the Guardian website every day. \"It's huge,\" he said. Sixty per cent of this figure comes from outside the UK.</p> <p>The Guardian's head of media and technology, Dan Sabbagh, told the audience that the challenge to be faced was \"to be competitive and relevant in ecology where everybody can be incredibly creative. And it's very thrilling.\"</p> <p>Speaking about the changes brought about by digital for journalists, Sabbagh said that nowadays there were so many different ways to communicate, whereas in the past, five to 10 years ago, a journalist \"would communicate to your readers of [your] paper, and you would be dead to the rest of the world. And that was how newspapers worked.</p> <p>\"Everyone in media just wants to reach people,\" he added, describing the change as \"tremendously exciting and tremendously creative\".</p> <p>However, he said that what had accompanied the positive creative change was \"the utter sense of existential financial despair, which is killing us all. And what you've also seen over the past five to eight years is a complete loss of confidence in media generally, in the financial respect.\"</p> <p>Sabbagh praised the Guardian's ownership by the Scott Trust, and said it was \"a precious thing\" that no rich man told it what to do.</p> <p>He said that in most cases, ownership of newspapers had drifted to what he called a poor football model, where the businesses were funded by \"lively characters\" \u2013 a model that carried with it a certain burden.</p> <p>\"We just have a real disconnect,\" Sabbagh said of the current media environment, \"because creatively it's brilliantly exciting, I must say. And the opportunities are right there, and the arrival of 4G is, I'm absolutely sure, going to be transformative.\"</p> <p>But, he said, \"what we're really struggling with, I think, is business models struggling to keep up. We need to marry our financial commitment to media to our creative commitment.\"</p> <p><em>Padraic Ryan is a journalist working for </em><a href=\"http://icas.org.uk/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>ICAS</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>I first heard the name of Alan Bennett at an Oxford dining table in the late 1950s. I lived in an ecumenical Unitarian college, and one of my fellow-boarders told me he had tutorials with an extraordinary junior history lecturer who did a famous routine as a comic vicar. I saw that for myself when, in August 1960, I was part of the audience at the brilliantly shambolic first night of <em>Beyond the Fringe</em> at the Edinburgh festival. Jonathan Miller, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore all radiated the extrovert exuberance of practised performers, but the eye was constantly drawn to the figure of Bennett, who, with his heavy specs and boyish trim, resembled a sprightly young curate on vacation. Few would have predicted that the shyest of the quartet would end up, half a century later, as a popular playwright and a national institution. Or even a National Theatre institution, with another new play, <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/people\" title=\"\"><em>People</em></a>, opening there on 31 October.</p> <p>In the mid-1960s Bennett was chiefly famous for the sketches and parodies he wrote and performed for TV programmes such as <em>The Late Show</em> and <em>On the Margin</em>. At the time he anxiously disclaimed the title of Swiftian satirist (\"Swift, as far as I know,\" he once wrote, \"never had to come on after the male dancers\"). And indeed it was hard to see any darker purpose behind sketches such as one in which Bennett sashayed on as a camp antique dealer and enthusiastically announced: \"I've just been stripping a tallboy.\" But, at his best, Bennett hinted he might become the Max Beerbohm of the electronic age. One of his most lethally funny sketches (reprinted in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780571232413/writing-home\" title=\"\"><em>Writing Home</em></a>) skewered all those TV documentaries in which pain-filled northern writers return to their roots and are pictured romantically against slag-heaps: \"We were all miners in our family,\" says a ruggedly duffle-coated Bennett. \"My father was a miner. My mother is a miner. These are miner's hands but we were all artists, I suppose, really. But I was the first one who had the urge to express myself on paper rather than at the coalface. But, under the skin, I suppose I'm still a miner. I suppose, in a very real sense, I'm a miner writer.\"</p> <p>That parodic talent found its outlet in Bennett's exhilarating ragbag of a play, <em>Forty Years On</em>, which became an instant hit in 1968 with John Gielgud in the lead. Since then, however, a number of myths have accumulated about Bennett that I would like to puncture. One is that he is essentially a naturalistic dramatist, when he strikes me as someone who restlessly experiments with different forms as if trying to find the perfect vehicle for his ideas. Another myth is that Bennett is what John Sutherland has called one of \"England's cultural teddy bears\" in the manner of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/john-betjeman\" title=\"\">John Betjeman</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/jb-priestley\" title=\"\">JB Priestley</a>. Whatever we have made of him, Bennett's recent work, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/29/theatre\" title=\"\"><em>The History Boys</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/18/alan-bennett-the-habit-of-art\" title=\"\"><em>The Habit of Art</em></a> and the novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/24/smut-unseemly-stories-alan-bennett-review\" title=\"\"><em>Smut</em></a>, suggests a distinctly uncosy talent. And, although Bennett himself has always denied he has any social or political agenda, over-arching themes and patterns certainly emerge from his work. Isaiah Berlin famously divided writers into foxes, who know many things, and hedgehogs, who know one big thing. Bennett, I suspect, is a bit of a hedgehog, with a hint of the prickliness that implies.</p> <p>To start with form, the mad idea that Bennett is a naturalistic writer may have been fostered by his TV plays; although even here people conveniently forget <em>The Old Crowd</em> (1979), which, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121208/never.apologise\" title=\"\">Lindsay Anderson</a>'s production, became a house-warming party stripped of any actual furniture. But from the beginning, Bennett's stage plays have consistently upended theatrical conventions.</p> <p>In the case of <em>Forty Years On</em>, this may have been a matter of convenience, in that Bennett was searching for a form that could contain a number of existing sketches. What he hit on was a complex play-within-a-play-within-a-play. We are supposedly in Albion House watching a school play, in which the memories of a pair of wartime Bloomsberries (essentially Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West) trigger a number of parodic setpieces encapsulating the early 20th century. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/27/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Martin Esslin</a>, reviewing it in Plays and Players, perceptively pointed out the similarities between <em>Forty Years On</em> and Peter Weiss's radically experimental <em>Marat/Sade</em>. Both show history presented by inmates of an institution, both use song as a source of narration, both show a conflict between opposing worldviews: in Bennett's case, between a firmly traditionalist headmaster and his successor, hungry for change. Any idea that Esslin's comparison is far-fetched is scotched by Bennett's own admission that he was partly inspired by a Polish play, <em>The Glorious Resurrection of Our Lord</em>, that he saw at the 1967 World Theatre Season and which featured choirboys singing above a stage-wide screen.</p> <p>But most of Bennett's theatrical work, with the exception of <em>Getting On</em>, is an attempt to escape the comforting paraphernalia of realism. One of my favourite early Bennetts, <em>Habeas Corpus</em> (1973), is a farce shorn of all the usual doors, windows, beds and conventional hiding-places. In both form and content, it strikes me as far more outr\u00e9 than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/orton\" title=\"\">Joe Orton</a>'s <em>What the Butler Saw</em>. What it does is take a group of McGill seaside-postcard stereotypes \u2013 lecherous GP, mountainous wife, flat-chested wallflower, unfired canon \u2013 and propel them onwards and upwards in a spiral of sex and death. It also disproves an old myth by showing that farce can be physically hectic and verbally funny at the same time: \"Have you ever been called to serve the Lord in heathen parts?\" the canon is asked in the midst of the whirling action. \"Well,\" he replies, \"I was for a short time a curate in Leeds.\"</p> <p>Even when Bennett looks as if he is resorting to realism, it turns out to be deceptive. In <em>Enjoy</em>, greeted with total bewilderment in 1980 and transports of delight in Christopher Luscombe's 2008 revival, Bennett shows us a fractious family in the last back-to-back in Leeds. But it transpires that the house is to be transported to a museum as an embodiment of working-class culture and that its occupants are, to a large extent, acting out the roles expected of them by social observers. This reaches its apogee in the scene in which a pretentious neighbour says, after the dad of the house has supposedly died, that \"the first thing to do is lay him out in the customary manner\". As the body is ceremonially stripped and washed, the whole scene becomes a parody of Lawrentian realism that is punctured only when the prostrate figure visibly and vitally stiffens.</p> <p>The idea of Bennett as teddy bear may, I suspect, stem from those TV documentaries in which he explores his Leeds origins or hovers round Harrogate hotel lobbies; perhaps even from his sympathetic reading of children's classics such as <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>. I've only met Bennett on a couple of occasions, but there is clearly a sharp edge beneath the Yorkshire charm. You only have to read his diaries to see that, underneath the wit and humour and sandwich-filled pottering around old churches, there is a deep resentment at what has happened to England in his lifetime and an instinctive distrust, sometimes amounting to deep loathing, of most politicians. Listening, for instance, to Alan Clark and Kenneth Clarke talking on the radio about the arrest of General Pinochet in 1998, he writes: \"Both have that built-in shrug characteristic of 80s Conservatism, electrodes on the testicles a small price to pay when economic recovery's at stake.\"</p> <p>As a playwright, he is also less cosy than he seems. In the most famous of the TV <em>Talking Heads</em> series (another formal experiment), Bennett shows a woman driven by desperate loneliness and frustration to seek sexual consolation in a bed of lentils at the back of a grocer's shop. In <em>Kafka's Dick</em> (1986), in which the famous dead mingle with the inconspicuous living, Bennett attacks the way we turn artists' lives into myths and suggests we have only Kafka's word for it that his father was a repugnant monster. Far from being cuddly, Bennett also consistently questions conventional moral attitudes to man-boy relationships in a way that is undeniably provocative.</p> <p>As far back as <em>Forty Years On</em>, there is a confirmation-class scene that ends in the chaplain making a mild pass at a pupil: the outrage it provokes in the play's headmaster has frequently been repeated in real life, leading to the episode being cut from school productions. Hector, the hero of <em>The History Boys</em>, also habitually gropes his 17-year-old pupil's genitals but is not overtly condemned by his author. I&#xa0;take Bennett's point to be that inspirational teachers are often flawed human beings and that boys of that age are capable of exercising responsibility: indeed he once said in an interview: \"Hector is the child, not them.\" And in <em>The Habit of Art</em> Bennett showed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/wh-auden\" title=\"\">WH Auden</a> relied on the mechanical services of rent-boys and that Britten's art was inseparable from his romantic, if unconsummated, attachment to boys. I don't think for a moment that Bennett is blandly licensing or endorsing paedophilia: what he does is raise disturbing questions, guaranteed to rattle the Mrs Grundys of this world, about its provenance and its possible consequences.</p> <p>Neither settled in form nor conventional in outlook, Bennett is a complex writer. And, although his choice of subject is diverse \u2013 ranging from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/24/madness-of-george-iii-review\" title=\"\">George III's madness</a> to Kafka's physical endowments \u2013 he comes back time and again to certain themes: the matter of England and the nature of art. The two aren't always easily separable, but it's fair to say that the state of the nation, and the quality of its life, is never far from the forefront of Bennett's mind. It often seems as if he is using drama to explore his own contradictory attitudes to the subject.</p> <p>That's certainly true of <em>Forty Years On</em>, which I once described as a piece of radical nostalgia and which gains its vitality from the tension between Bennett's ambivalent attitude to the past. He deftly punctures and parodies Bloomsbury affectation, Buchanite snobbery and the moral cowardice of 1930s Chamberlainite appeasers. Yet at the same time there is something heartfelt, as well as poetic, to the climactic threnody in which the headmaster laments the changing of England: \"The hedges come down from the silent fields. The lease is out on the corner site. A butterfly is an event.\" Not unlike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/johnosborne\" title=\"\">John Osborne</a>, Bennett emerges as a writer who believes in progress but who is irrevocably attached to his country's cultural inheritance; and it's specifically England, rather than Britain, that stirs his deepest sympathy.</p> <p>One way of looking at one's country, of course, is from the perspective of exile, which Bennett does in the rarely revived <em>The Old Country</em> (1977). On one level, the play is about the wistful regret of a traitor, Hilary, who, from the vantage point of his Soviet dacha, deplores the loss of Lyons Corner Houses, changes to the Book of Common Prayer, the decline of the country-house thriller. His sexually duplicitous, establishment brother-in-law reinforces the theme by claiming that it \"is sad to find oneself so often striking the elegiac note when one is by temperament and inclination a modernist\". But Bennett shows another face of England at the play's end, when Hilary is sent home, as part of a spy-swap, while a working-class traitor is left permanently and unhappily marooned in Moscow. Privilege, Bennett implies, still operates even in the world of espionage.</p> <p>But, if nationhood is one of Bennett's persistent themes, so is the nature of art. I see Bennett's whole output as an attempt to demystify art, in the broadest sense, and to suggest that it is neither the exclusive property of a self-perpetuating elite nor something that is an endless source of pain to its practitoners. One of his earliest sketches, <em>Tit for Tatti</em>, is a very funny account of a pilgrim's visit to the Tuscan retreat of the great art collector Bernard Berenson: \"It is twenty years since I had been at I Tatti,\" he cries, which, in Bennett's drawling tones, inevitably came out as \"arty-tarty\". Bennett's whole career has been a campaign against the arty-tarty and the idea that art and literature are available only to the members of a privileged club. In that minor masterpiece, <em>A Question of Attribution</em>, the real sympathy lies not with that Marxist aesthete <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/15/firstchapters.whitbreadbookawards2002\" title=\"\">Anthony Blunt</a>, nor even with the shrewdly perceptive Queen, but with Blunt's modest interrogator, Chubb, who wants to acquire the basics of art appreciation.</p> <p>Bennett also attacks the idea of the artist as the kind of ravaged, tormented genius so often enshrined in biography. That's what <em>Kafka's Dick</em> is really about, since the hero, suddenly appearing in the suburban home of one of his acolytes, turns out not to be the earthly saint he had expected. And it's what <em>The Habit of Art</em> is almost entirely about, since it strips Auden of the grandeur and nobility the actor impersonating him craves and shows Britten to exist in a state of nervous thraldom to the bullying poet. Although not one of my favourite Bennett plays \u2013 too much scaffolding, not enough building \u2013 <em>The Habit of Art</em> does indeed suggest that the work matters more than the life, and that art is the product of persistence, tenacity and application.</p> <p>All that applies to Bennett himself. He may, as I say, have become a bit of an institution, but I hope we can dismiss all the \"national treasure\" nonsense. Through innate talent, wide reading, a certain wry detachment and, above all, an ability to listen to how people talk, he has become a very good, extremely complicated playwright. <em>People</em> is likely to be formally adventurous, faintly disruptive and with something to say about human oddity and the nature of life in our strange little country: what a Bennett character once dubbed \"a valuable site at the crossroads of the world\".</p> <p><em>\u2022 People</em> is at the National Theatre, London SE1, from 31 October to 9 February 2013. <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/\" title=\"\">nationaltheatre.org.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Oil prices could come down over the next five years due to sluggish economic growth around the world and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/09/iraq-world-second-oil-exporter-iea\" title=\"\">rising oil production in Iraq</a> and North America, the International Energy Agency predicts.</p> <p>The organisation, which advises most major governments on energy policy, expects the average import price of oil to fall from $107 a barrel this year to $89 in 2017. Problems in the eurozone had dampened expectations for economic growth, it said. \"Even China, the main engine of demand growth in the last decade, is showing signs of slowing down,\" it noted.</p> <p>Demand will also drop on the back of improvements in energy efficiency, changes in consumer behaviour, and a move away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>As a result, the agency slashed forecasts for growth in demand between 2011 and 2016 by 500,000 barrels a day, from previous forecasts made last December. That would reduce <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/08/oil-prices-volatile-iran-opec-production\" title=\"\">pressure on Opec</a> dramatically, as the cartel would have to produce only 31m barrels per day until 2017 in order to balance global demand \u2013 less than it does at the moment.</p> <p>Technological advances meant supply had grown more than expected in North America; production in Libya has \"defied expectations\", while output from Iraq and Saudi Arabia is very strong, it said.</p> <p>The agency warned: \"This mild outlook is partly deceptive, given exceptional uncertainty about the global economy and heightened regional geopolitical risks.\"</p> <p>Pockets of new supply in the past year have been a buffer against shortfalls elsewhere, it noted. \"Disruptions \u2013 whether caused by political turmoil, unplanned maintenance or extreme weather \u2013 have been relentless and, taken in aggregate, unprecedented in scope.\" The last two years had brought home the reality of geopolitical risk in the Middle East and North Africa as a \"concrete and immediate possibility\".</p>",

The npower increase will affect approximately 3 million customers.</p> <h2><strong>I am not a British Gas or nPower customer \u2013 should I worry?</strong></h2> <p>SSE has already announced a 9% increase in both gas and electricity prices, beginning on 15 October. It is widely anticipated the remaining energy suppliers that make up the \"big six\" will soon follow suit.</p> <p>E.ON has a price freeze in place until the end of the year but has refused to rule out an increase after that; Scottish Power and EDF are expected to apply increases in the next two months.</p> <p>All households should therefore check their tariff and search the market to see if they can save money elsewhere, and consider fixing.</p> <h2><strong>Who is offering the best deals?</strong></h2> <p>The best deals now come from one company, First Utility. Its online variable rate tariff, <a href=\"http://www.first-utility.com/\" title=\"First Utility website\">iSave v12</a>, will cost a typical household \u00a31,054 a year; it's cheapest fixed-rate tariff, iSave Fixed v4, which sets prices until March 2014, costs \u00a31,087.</p> <p>\"Consumers wishing to take advantage of First Utility's offer should switch now,\" says Mark Todd, director of price comparison service Energyhelpline.com. \"It's not clear how long this offer will be around and market predictions show price increases are likely to be imposed by the UK's leading energy suppliers.\" However, First Utility charges a \u00a330 per fuel exit penalty for those who sign up to its fixed tariff but leave before March 2014.</p> <p>The next cheapest fixed-rate deal is the <a href=\"http://www.ovoenergy.com/our-energy/\" title=\"Ovo website\">New Energy Fix</a> tariff from Ovo Energy, at \u00a31,088 a year. It is not available in Scotland and comes with \u00a330 per fuel early exit penalties.</p> <p>Experts advise people concerned about bills to opt for the certainty of a fixed-rate tariff, especially as price rises from other providers are expected.</p> <p>You can compare energy prices on <a href=\"http://www.guardianenergycomparison.co.uk/guardian_editorial\" title=\"Guardian Money deals\">the Guardian's money deals page</a>.</p> <h2><strong>I'm worried about getting into debt as my bills are high</strong></h2> <p>You are not alone. Debt advice charity the <a href=\"http://www.moneyadvicetrust.org/\" title=\"Money Advice Trust\">Money Advice Trust</a> says its National Debtline phone service took 2,403 calls from people with energy arrears in September \u2013 that's a call every six minutes the lines were open.</p> <p>So far this year 16% of people calling National Debtline have energy arrears, a record which eclipses 2011's 13.7% and the 2.7% seen in 2004. Spokesman Paul Crayston says he expects 2012 to represent the biggest year-on-year jump in energy debt calls, both in terms of total calls and proportion.</p> <p>With the UN warning of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/un-rising-food-costs-weather\" title=\"UN warns of rising food costs after year's extreme weather\">food price rises to come</a>, it is clear many will be plunged into debt or face a cold winter.</p> <h2><strong>I'm already struggling with my bills. What should I do?</strong></h2> <p>Gas and electricity companies can cut off your supply in a few weeks if you don't pay them \u2013 no court is involved in this decision \u2013 so these bills should therefore be treated as a priority debt. Contact your provider as soon as possible and ask to pay them every week, every two weeks or every month if that makes things more manageable.</p> <p>If you have arrears, phone or write to the company and ask for a payment arrangement. Be careful not to offer to pay more than you can afford. All fuel companies should agree, under their code of practice, to accept an offer of repayment in instalments at a rate you can manage.</p>",

  "<p>This year, on the face of things, it's been business as usual at the Frankfurt book fair, with some 7,500 exhibitors setting up shop in the gleaming white Messe. But scratch beneath the surface and a tangible unease about the future of the industry is evident: book sales are stagnating, profit margins are being squeezed by higher discounts and falling prices, and the distribution of book buyers is ever more polarised between record-shattering bestsellers and an ocean of titles with tiny readerships. The mid-list, where the unknown writer or new idea can spring to prominence, is progressively being hollowed out. This is bad news not just for publishing but for the culture at large.</p> <p>It's time for a reformation in publishing, and the precepts set out below provide a basis for the creation of a new, healthier book industry. They echo another event that occurred during October in Germany, nearly half a millennium ago: the nailing of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninety-Five_Theses\" title=\"\">Martin Luther's 95 theses to the doors of Wittenberg cathedral</a>. Luther was protesting against the idea that the route to salvation could be secured by payments to those at the top of an ecclesiastical hierarchy. The theses here should have been pinned to the Amazon stand at Frankfurt.</p> <p><strong>1. Publish for readers, not authors.</strong> The 21st-century publishing environment has tipped the balance still further towards the importance of the reader. The <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/25/120625fa_fact_auletta\" title=\"\">garrote that Amazon has applied</a>, using its market share to obtain ever higher discounts from publishers that, in turn, allow price cuts that secure still more customers, is possible because of the behemoth's direct relationship to readers. To break this stranglehold, publishers must start selling direct. The longer-term advantages of using their own customer databases to sell at full price, rerouting the additional revenue into marketing, will outweigh any initial discomfort about eschewing the services of the world's largest booksellers.</p> <p><strong>2. Publish more selectively.</strong> In a recent open letter to Amazon customers touting Kindle Direct Publishing (through which authors sell their books directly to readers), founder Jeff Bezos claimed that the programme produced \"a more diverse book culture\" with \"no expert gatekeepers saying, 'Sorry but that will never work.'\" Bezos evidently regards the function of publisher as obsolete. Publishers will flourish when they are seen as discriminating arbiters of their customers' tastes. Limiting the number of books published will assist in emphasising this vital role of gate-keeper. Publishing successive books by the same author, or books grouped tightly by type or subject, will underscore the publisher's authority as a curator.</p> <p><strong>3. Focus on editing and design.</strong> The new publishing dispenses with a variety of traditional functions: investing in print runs, warehousing, catalogues, chasing payments and processing returns. But other tasks such as editing and design take on additional importance. Ensuring that books are readable and attractive is a vital way for publishers to stay afloat in an ocean of self-published&#xa0;titles.</p> <p><strong>4. Hold no stock.</strong> Print-on-demand remains significantly more expensive than conventional printing. But it means the end of misjudgments about how many books to print. Further savings will be achieved by foregoing warehouse costs and not tying up capital in stock. And, of course, in this new, more efficient system, the environment benefits alongside the publisher's bottom line.</p> <p><strong>5. Publish fast.</strong> For books dealing with current affairs or breaking cultural trends, to say nothing of the publisher's cash flow, the advantages of direct-to-reader digital publishing's faster turnarounds are enormous.</p> <p><strong>6. Keep prices high.</strong> Book prices have been falling steadily, pushed down by retailers, most notably Amazon, attempting to secure greater market share. The arrival of ebooks has added further pressure. If customers don't want a book, they are unlikely to buy it whatever the cost. By the same token, if they can be persuaded that a book is \"essential reading\", then price is unlikely to be a disincentive.</p> <p><strong>7. Hand-sell on the internet.</strong> Rocketing title output, combined with reduced books pages in newspapers, has made traditional review coverage much harder to obtain. The internet can help fill this gap. Video, flash ads, electronic fliers, multiple serialisations and social media \u2013 all present opportunities for reaching potential audiences.</p> <p><strong>8. Sell globally.</strong> For the modern publisher, geographical territory has little meaning, having been replaced by language in the determination of markets. Satellite on-demand printing, increasingly available, means that books can be produced locally and dropped in local postal systems, ensuring cheaper and faster distribution.</p> <p><strong>9. Use real-time information.</strong> For many years publishing enjoyed a consoling period when no one had much idea how a book was doing once it was out in stores. When selling direct to the customer via the internet, reporting of sales figures is exact and immediate. This allows authors access to real-time feedback about performance, a welcome transparency in an industry that has made an art of camouflaging sales figures in sporadic royalty reports.</p> <p><strong>9.5. Recognise the complexity of publishing choice.</strong> Publishing books that customers want to read demands the discernment to recognise an idea as original or a sentence as beautiful. It lies at the heart of successful publishing, old and new, and there is something very reassuring about that.</p> <p>\u2022 Colin Robinson is a founder of the New York-based independent publisher<a href=\"http://www.orbooks.com/\" title=\"\"> OR Books</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Reading the shocking <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/deadly-fungus-ash-tree-imports\" title=\"\">news about ash die-back</a>, the disease that has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/07/disease-killing-denmarks-ash-trees\" title=\"\">now affected most of Denmark's ash trees</a> and many of those across the rest of northern Europe, I was reminded that when we lose our wildlife we lose some of our stories.</p> <p>The death of a species, especially a species as significant as the ash, punches a hole not only in nature, but also in our culture.</p> <p>Throughout northern Europe, the ash tree was associated in pagan thought with the guardianship of life. As <a href=\"http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/mythfolk/ash.html\" title=\"\">Paul Kendall explains on the Trees for Life site</a>, in the mythology of the Vikings (and several other northern peoples), an ash known as yggdrasil or the \"world tree\" was the scaffolding on which the universe was built. It</p> <blockquote> <p>\"grew on an island surrounded by the ocean, in the depths of which the World Serpent lay. This ash tree's trunk reached up to the heavens, and its boughs spread out over all the countries of the Earth. Its roots reached down into the Underworld. A squirrel ran up and down the tree carrying messages from the serpent gnawing at the roots to the eagle in the canopy, and back. A deer fed on the ash leaves and from its antlers flowed the great rivers of the world. A magical goat grazed by the tree, and its udders dispensed not milk but mead for the warriors in Odin's Great Hall. The gods held their councils under the canopy of their guardian tree.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Odin, the king of the gods, hanged himself from the tree to obtain cosmic wisdom. During his vigil, one of his eyes was pecked out by ravens. You can see in this myth, as JG Frazer pointed out in the Golden Bough, an obvious correlate of the crucifixion story.</p> <p>Richard Wagner developed the saga in The Ring of the Nibelung. Wotan (Odin), the one-eyed king of the gods, tore the shaft of his spear from the World Ash Tree (spear shafts were typically made from ash poles). On the shaft were inscribed the holy laws and treaties by which the world and the heavens were governed.</p> <p>The mortal hero Siegfried fights Wotan (his grandfather) and hews the shaft of the sacred spear in two, literally breaking the law of the gods. Wotan then suicidally instructs his warriors to hack down the World Ash Tree and pile its branches around Walhall (Valhalla). At the end of the final opera, Wotan's valkyrie daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde casts a brand onto this pyre, and Valhalla is consumed by flame. The source of life becomes the means of destruction.</p> <p>Children love this story (I find it helps if you skim over the incest and the suttee). But if ash die-back follows the same course as Dutch elm disease, I can imagine telling it one day and being asked what an ash tree is. I see this is as a loss that goes beyond the great sadness of picturing the end of the magnificent, well-used trees I know (some of which have been pollarded or coppiced for hundreds of years), which are laden with both wildlife and human history.</p> <p>If the fungus reaches them, they will, as if on Wotan's instructions, be brought down and hacked to pieces. It feels like a kind of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, a twilight of the gods. There is something of the norse deity about an ancient ash tree, grey and clawing and bearded with lichen.</p> <p>Already, though not as a result of the disease, the cultural significance of the tree has begun to slip from our minds. For example, anyone who has split an ash trunk cannot help but be aware of what ash blonde means. The fresh wood is almost white (it darkens, when it had been seasoned and polished, to a beautiful bright gold). Walking through a chemist's shop a few months ago, my eye was caught by a packet of hair dye labelled \"ash blonde\". The model's hair was a charcoal-grey colour. Ash, it seemed, had been interpreted as fire-ash. It felt like a small but sad impoverishment of the language.</p> <p>Other European nations are now begging Britain to ban imports of ash saplings, so that the tree retains an uninfected stronghold. As ever, when faced with a call to impose even the slightest restrictions on business (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/18/bees-pesticides-neonicitinoids\" title=\"\">think of its failure to ban the class of pesticides that are killing bees</a>), the government has dithered and made excuses, and the fungus is now spreading across the country.</p> <p>One of the effects of ash die-back is what foresters call heart rot: the fungus penetrates into the core of the wood. To me this term is freighted with another meaning.</p> <p><a href=\"http://monbiot.com\" title=\"\">monbiot.com</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 8 November. The main text said that 90% of trees in Denmark had been killed. This is incorrect and has been changed to \"affected\". </p>",
  "<p>As more people <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/feb/03/urbanisation-health-systems?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">leave the countryside for the city in the developing world</a>, many continue to rely on agriculture for a living. At least 800 million people in cities in poor countries practise urban agriculture, from growing vegetables to keeping animals \u2013 from chickens to camels \u2013 often in close confinement in densely populated areas.</p> <p>The close proximity of animals and humans can pose health risks. Zoonoses \u2013 diseases transmitted between animals and humans \u2013 are a health problem that particularly affects the poor in developing countries. <a href=\"http://mahider.ilri.org/browse?type=ilrisubject&amp;value=EMERGING+DISEASES&amp;sort_by=2&amp;order=DESC&amp;rpp=20&amp;etal=0\" title=\"\">New research from the International Livestock Research Institute (Ilri)</a> found that zoonoses and diseases recently emerged from animals (swine flu, bird flu, Sars) make up a quarter of infectious diseases in developing countries, compared with just 0.7% in rich countries.</p> <p>Researchers, however, warn that a draconian approach to urban livestock and informal markets \u2013 where traders are unlicensed and pay no tax, and which lack health and safety rules \u2013 can end up doing more harm than good. Outright bans on livestock in urban areas or informal markets is not the answer, they say.</p> <p>\"Getting rid of informal markets is impossible,\" says Delia Grace, a food safety specialist with Ilri, who is based in Nairobi but was in London last week. \"It forces trading to go underground. In Kampala [Uganda], we found traders who were harassed adopted less good practices, which is no surprise as they have to pay more attention to evading authorities than to hygiene.\"</p> <p>Grace rejects the conventional wisdom that supermarkets are necessarily safer than informal markets. Food in traditional markets tends to be cheaper and fresher \u2013 the food moves quickly. By contrast, food in supermarkets can sit around in cabinets for four or five days and can be subject to power cuts.</p> <p>Ilri experts said studies in east Africa, north-east India and Vietnam came to the surprising conclusion that food sold in formal markets (supermarkets), though commonly perceived to be safer, may have lower compliance with standards than informally marketed food.</p> <p>\"This emphasises that food safety policy should be based on evidence and not perception, and failure to do this may be prejudicial to the poor, who dominate and rely on informal value chains,\" Grace says.</p> <p>She argues that education and training rather than heavy-handed tactics are more effective ways to improve safety in the food chain (from farm to fork). Attempts to improve food and safety through ordering farmers to act is likely to be ineffective, as opposed to bringing onside poor dairy farmers and encouraging them to be \"risk managers\", as was the case in Kampala.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, where poor people often keep chickens under the bed in cramped conditions, one appropriate response would be to suggest they be kept in a wicker cage at a distance from the bed, or in a shed close to home. Other simple approaches that have led to improvements in food safety in Kenya and India (milk), and Nigeria (meat) include the use of wide-necked vessels for milk that are easy to clean, tests for food safety that can be applied by consumers and traders (lactometers to check for added water), and peer pressure (the desire to be seen as a good parent).</p> <p>Ilri experts found that gender was a determining factor in food hygiene. Simply put, women were cleaner than men. A study from Ibadan, the capital of Oyo state in southern Nigeria, found that butchers' associations with more women had better food safety practices and better quality of meat, and there was less gastrointestinal illness among people who ate it.</p> <p>A study in Dagoretti, a district in Nairobi, found women had more exposure to cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease transmitted from cattle to humans through their involvement in milking activities, feeding and watering cattle, and caring for sick household members. But it also identified farm workers \u2013 mostly men \u2013 as a group with higher exposure risk.</p> <p>The message from Ilri is that policymakers should avoid kneejerk responses to health scares \u2013 blocking smallholder access to markets and favouring industrialisation. \"These changes are often based on fear, not facts,\" say Ilri experts. \"Without evidence of risk to human health by informally marketed foods or the best way to manage risks while retaining benefits, the food eaten in poor countries is neither safe nor fair.\"</p>",
