  "<p>Two opposing camps are battling it out for domination of the international contemporary art world. On the one hand, the huge globalised art dealerships catering to the international super-rich \u2013 those individuals so dazzlingly wealthy as to be immune to the economic crisis. And on the other, a vision of art that is politically engaged, historically aware and socially inclusive.</p> <p>That, at least, is the story according to <a href=\"http://www.artreview.com/\" title=\"\">ArtReview</a> magazine, whose annual list of the 100 most important figures in contemporary art, the ArtReview Power 100, is published on Thursday.</p> <p>At the top of the list is the first woman to be accorded the No 1 slot: the Italy- and US-based curator Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev. She was the curator of this summer's <a href=\"http://d13.documenta.de/\" title=\"\">Documenta</a>, the grand-scale art exhibition, regarded as perhaps the contemporary art world's most important event, that takes place in the German town of Kassel every five years.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/811949/why-curator-carolyn-christov-bakargievs-documenta-may-be-the-most-important-exhibition-of-the-21st-century\" title=\"\">Described by one critic</a> as \"the most important exhibition to date of the 21st century\", Christov-Bakargiev's Documenta was seen as setting a fresh agenda for artists, audiences and curators. The \u20ac25m (\u00a320m) <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jun/11/documenta-13-review\" title=\"\">event</a>, which took over the entire city, combined new work by artists including Tacita Dean and Ryan Gander with relics of the destroyed Bamiyan Buddhas, anti-Nazi tapestries from the 1930s, and even experiments devised by the physics department of the University of Vienna.</p> <p>The Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei \u2013 this year at No 3, having been accorded the highest place last year \u2013 also fits into this category of politically and socially aware art according to ArtReview editor Mark Rappolt, thanks to his activism and battle for freedom of expression. So does new entry Pussy Riot, at No 57 on the list. Two members of the feminist-punk collective lost their appeal this week not to be sent to Russian penal colonies. Rappolt also pointed to new entry Theaster Gates (No 56), the African-American artist whose practice is concerned with urban planning, alleviating inner-city poverty and social activism, as well as making objects. These are figures, said Rappolt, who are \"trying to interact with the world rather than waiting for the world to interact with them\".</p> <p>Second, fourth and fifth place on the list, however, are occupied by the macho blast of the world's most dominant art dealers: Larry Gasgosian, Iwan Wirth and David Zwirner. US dealer Gagosian this week <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443294904578050380114780310.html\" title=\"\">added a new Paris space</a> to his already huge portfolio of galleries, spanning Los Angeles, Hong Kong, London, Rome, Athens, Geneva and New York. The new gallery, in the north-east outskirts of Paris, is in the grounds of Le Bourget airport, the most important hub for private aviation in the city \u2013 the billionaire equivalent of providing a carpark. In September, the Art Newspaper <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Grow,+grow,+Gagosian%E2%80%A6/27143\" title=\"\">reported</a> that the combined floor area of Gagosian's 13 premises is set to overtake that of Tate Modern.</p> <p>Despite the global economic crisis, the continued expansion of such high-end galleries reflects, according to Rappolt, the strength of the top end of the contemporary art market, bolstered by the desire among tycoons to \"enter the weird social elite that collecting art creates\". This elite is small but highly international, and this year is registered on the ArtReview list by the meteoric rise of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21551443\" title=\"\">Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani</a>, who has shot up nearly 80 places since last year to No 11 on the list. A daughter of the emir of Qatar, she is the chair of the Qatar museums authority, and is rumoured to have spent, with her family, over \u00a3600m on western art over the past decade, including works by Damien Hirst and Mark Rothko.</p> <p>The highest ranked artist on the list is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/arts/design/gerhard-richter-is-celebrated-with-german-art-shows.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">Gerhard Richter</a>, who celebrated his 80th birthday this year. Regarded as a national treasure in his native Germany, he is also a figure who continues to reinvent himself and to exert influence over younger artists. He is officially the most expensive living artist at auction: last week one of his works, Abstraktes Bild (809-4), from Eric Clapton's collection, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/13/gerhard-richter-painting-record-price\" title=\"\">sold for \u00a321.3m at Sotheby's</a>.</p> <p>The list reflects further trends in the contemporary art world: notably the rising influence of Brazil, and the growing importance of its artists, collectors, dealers and art fairs. A new entry is <a href=\"http://artealdia.com/International/Contents/Profiles/PROFILE_Adriano_Pedrosa_y_sus_visiones_alternativas\" title=\"\">Adriano Pedrosa </a>at No 98, a rising Brazilian curator, who curated a section of this year's Frieze Masters fair in London; and at No 71 is another new entry, Brazilian dealer Luisa Strina. Larry Gagosian opened a temporary space in Rio in September; and Jay Jopling (No 20) who owns the White Cube gallery, is to open a new permanent outpost in Sao Paulo this autumn.</p> <p>The highest-ranked Briton on the list is Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate, who at No 8, has overtaken his opposite number at New York's Museum of Modern Art, Glenn D Lowry, at No 9. Damien Hirst, whose monumental sculpture of a pregnant woman was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19958531\" title=\"\">this week erected</a> in the Devon town of Ilfracombe and who was the subject of a major Tate retrospective this summer, has risen from No 64 last year to No 41.</p> <h2>2012 Name [2011]</h2> <p>1.

  "<p>The NHS could save at least \u00a340m a year if more women were given help to breastfeed for longer, according to a new report.</p> <p>Research by Unicef UK for the first time calculates the cost to the health service of the UK's poor record on breastfeeding. Research has shown that breastfeeding lowers women's risk of breast cancer and protects babies against infections.</p> <p>The report looks at the potential savings to the NHS in five disease areas if women were better supported to start feeding their babies and to feed them for longer: breast cancer in mothers, and gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, ear infections and the life-threatening condition necrotising enterocolitis in babies.</p> <p>If half the women who currently do not breastfeed were to do so for up to 18 months, there would be 865 fewer cases of breast cancer, says Unicef, which would save the NHS more than \u00a321m.</p> <p>If 45% of babies were exclusively breastfed for four months and if 75% of babies in neonatal units were breastfed when they were sent home, more than 3,000 fewer babies would end up in hospital with gastroenteritis, nearly 6,000 fewer babies would be in hospital with respiratory illness, there would be 21,000 fewer visits with babies to GPs for ear infections, and 361 fewer cases of potentially fatal necrotising enterocolitis. The NHS would save more than \u00a317m.</p> <p>Other areas where there would also be savings are in cognitive ability, childhood obesity and sudden infant death syndrome, says Unicef \u2013 probably of more than \u00a36.5m \u2013 but in these and other areas, such as future adult heart disease, the financial implications are harder to assess.</p> <p>\"We know that 90% of women who stop breastfeeding in the first six weeks discontinued before they had wanted to,\" said Unicef UK's deputy executive director Anita Tiessen. \"As a society we are failing mothers and babies, and this new report shows that low breastfeeding rates in the UK are costing the NHS millions of pounds each year, as well as causing untold distress and suffering for families.</p> <p>\"We want to see breastfeeding recognised as a major public health issue from government level through to local children's centres, and appropriate investment and legislation put in place to give mothers a better experience of breastfeeding. The good news for commissioners, planners and decision makers is that our research shows that money invested to help women breastfeed for longer would provide a rapid financial return.\"</p> <p>The lead author of the study, Prof Mary Renfrew from the University of Dundee, said the report was about the impact of breastfeeding on whole populations, not individual women. Its aim is to influence planners and decision-makers within the NHS to get more support for those who would like to breastfeed.</p> <p>\"The UK is a very challenging environment for breastfeeding women,\" she said. \"For any woman to breastfeed, she has to overcome a series of barriers.\" It is hard for women who want to feed their babies when they are out or at work, she said.</p> <p>The \"ambivalence in public discourse\" over breastfeeding did not help, she said.</p> <p>\"Any infant feeding story gets quite contentious. It stirs up a dichotomy between women who want to breastfeed and women who bottle feed. We should make it easier for women to feed their babies however they want, but 90% who stop breastfeeding do so before they want to. We're not pushing against a closed door.\"</p> <p>Although 81% of mothers begin breastfeeding their baby, the dropout rate is high. Figures from 2005, which are the best currently available, show only 48% of babies were getting any breastmilk at six weeks and 35% at six months. Less than 2% are exclusively breastfed at six months, as the Department of Health recommends.</p> <p>Support for mothers from the health service is \"inconsistent and very patchy\", says Renfrew. \"A lot of current health professionals are not well-trained to give advice,\" she said. Women do not necessarily know how to breastfeed if they have never seen anyone doing it and need to be taught. And if a baby is not gaining weight, health professionals may suggest formula milk, rather than attempting to help a woman breast feed more often.</p> <p>Diane Abbott, the shadow public health minister, said government cuts are having an impact on attempts to boost breastfeeding \u2013 particularly in areas where rates are lowest. <a href=\"http://www.ssentif.com/archive/9_jun2012.shtml\" title=\"\">A study by the data organisation SSentif</a> in June showed big variations between primary care trusts. Sandwell in the West Midlands had a drop-off rate in 2010/11 of nearly 65% at 6-8 weeks, from a low breastfeeding initiation rate of 56%. In the same year, it cut spending on maternity and reproductive services by almost 20%.</p> <p>Westminster, which increased maternity spending by 157%, had an initiation rate of 89% and a drop-off rate of just under 7%.</p> <p>\"With all the pressures that hard-pressed families are facing right now, this is a cruel and two-faced attack on the health of British families, with the poorest being hit the hardest,\" said Abbott.</p> <p>An annual week promoting breast feeding nationally has been abolished and a Department of Health advisory committee on breastfeeding no longer meets, she pointed out.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's struggling retail chains are closing their shops at a rate of more than 30 a day across the UK as the economic downturn continues, according to research.</p> <p>Figures show that across the UK embattled retailers closed 32 stores a day in July and August as Britain's high street continued to suffer from the consumer spending slump. That figure is up from 20 a day in the first six months of 2012.</p> <p>High-profile administrations this year of major retailers including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/game-group-to-enter-administration\" title=\"\">Game Group</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/18/peacocks-falls-into-administration\" title=\"\">Peacocks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/16/peacock-past-times-administration\" title=\"\">Past Times</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/09/clinton-cards-administration-retailer\" title=\"\">Clinton Cards</a> helped push the number of closures of town centre chain store outlets to 953 in the first half on a net basis (meaning those closing minus those opening).</p> <p>That compared with 174 in the whole of 2011, according to the study of 500 town centres by the retail data provider Local Data Company (LDC). for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).</p> <p>The figures will spark more concern among campaigners and politicians that Britain's high streets are being abandoned by the retail chains, leading to long-term damage as stores are boarded up and shoppers head to out-of-town centres.</p> <p>After David Cameron appointed the television presenter Mary Portas to come up with solutions to reverse the decline, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/13/portas-high-streets-disapper\" title=\"\">she made 28 recommendations</a>, including setting up \"town teams\" to strengthen the running of high streets.</p> <p>According to today's survey, the south-east was the worst affected area in the first half, with 215 net closures, followed by the West Midlands, with 160, and the south-west, with 129.</p> <p>Shops selling computer games, toys, clothes, gifts, jewellery, cards, posters and furnitures were among the hardest hit in the first six months of 2012. JJB Sports, which is among the retailers to have collapsed in recent months, is to close 133 stores across the country despite a deal to sell 20 to its rival Sports Direct International.</p> <p>Many chains are also pulling out of loss-making sites and putting ambitious expansion plans on hold in an attempt to to weather tough trading conditions.</p> <p>Analysis of July and August 2012 shows that the number of closures has increased to 32 a day as a result of recent administrations.</p> <p>Some shops, however, are bucking the trend. There were 7% more discount stores in Britain in the first six months on a net basis and 11% more payday loan outlets. The research also showed there were 11% more bureaux de change, 5% more convenience food stores, 8% more pawnbrokers and another 1% of charity shops.</p> <p>Separate findings, also from the LDC, earlier this month showed that more town centre independents continue to open than are closing, making up for closures of chain outlets and keeping the vacancy rate from worsening. But only just: a total of 8,181 independents opened and 7,329 closed in the first half of 2012, a net increase of 852 stores.Michael Weedon, deputy chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira), commented: \"Shop vacancies hit one in seven nearly two years ago, but the rate has barely changed since then. With multiples pulling out of towns and internet sales continuing to grow, there has to be something interesting going on to keep that rate steady.</p> <p>\"There is. And, as we saw in 2011, it is the continued net growth in the number of independents that is saving our towns from an even worse vacancy rate. So the good news for all of us remains that independents are still saving the high street by opening shops.\"</p> <p>Mike Jervis, a PwC insolvency partner and retail specialist, said: \"All retailers in distress have too many locations. The insolvencies of Game, Peacocks and Clintons demonstrated this in spades. Relatively long leases, with inflexible terms, have been entered into in a growth phase of the economy which is no longer appropriate. Where over-expansion has already taken place, retailers need to face that reality and formulate a strategic plan, in partnership with landlords not in confrontation with them.\"</p> <p>Matthew Hopkinson, director of the LDC, added: \"This rapid increase in the drawdown of the multiple retailers in the first half of this year is not unexpected. It also has some way to go as consumer spend remains low and the omni-channel environment requires fewer but larger and more 'dynamic' stores.</p> <p>\"The departure of so many larger stores is a major issue for many town centres, especially in secondary centres, where they have for many years been their high street's anchors. A similar slowing in growth of the independents, combined with this multiples drawdown, has significant consequences beyond just driving vacancy rates up for many of these town centres.\"</p> <p>Bill Grimsey, former chief executive of Wickes, Iceland and Focus, and who has just published Sold Out, a book on the future of the high street, said: \"This latest analysis further confirms that retailers in general are in the middle of a perfect storm: too much space accumulated during the boom years, coupled with changing consumer trends to shop more online, whilst real disposable incomes are falling, has created conditions that will perpetuate the demise of the high street.</p> <p>\"The retail sectors bucking the trend reflect the economic environment. It's no surprise that discounters are growing. The growth of the convenience store and online sectors for food retailers will hit profits as these channels are less efficient than their capital-intensive out-of-town superstores.\"</p> <p>He said the government should stop its wasteful \"PR stunts\" to regenerate high streets, and get to the heart of the issue: \"They need to accept that these areas are dying as retail destinations, and communities need an approach that finds alternative uses for these buildings. Much-needed affordable housing would be a good place to start.\"</p>",
  "<p>Who could be against the ladder of opportunity? Even as the political class narrows, it advocates social mobility more fervently. The rhetoric is impossible to contest, which may be because the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n07/stefan-collini/blahspeak\" title=\"\">meaning is so hard to pin down</a>. Every expert has their own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/mar/10/is-social-mobility-dead\" title=\"\">favoured mobility metric</a> \u2013 whether relative or absolute, class- or income-based. The one thing they agree on is that, since climbing the ladder takes decades, the decisions of politicians play out so slowly that they can't be held to account.</p> <p>With the coalition <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/social-security-george-freeze\" title=\"\">hitting poor pockets hard</a>, cynics will say that therein lies the appeal. The social mobility to worry about right now, they will say, is the eviction, upheaval and squalid emergency accommodation which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/15/bed-and-breakfast-families-crisis\" title=\"\">Amelia Gentleman reported on</a> this week. By disrupting schooling, and denying children a decent environment in which to do homework, the cuts will dash some young dreams. It is, however, too gloomy to assume that nothing can be done to level life chances without fresh public money. It is not necessarily a sham for David Cameron and Nick Clegg to claim to care about equality of opportunity as opposed to equal outcomes \u2013 it is a distinct philosophical position. But it can never be a practical proposition until they explain how exactly the state will rebalance its resources to extend a helping hand into disadvantaged communities.</p> <p>Mr Cameron's conference rallying cry of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9600468/David-Cameron-I-want-privilege-for-all.html\" title=\"\">privilege all round</a>, a contradiction in terms if ever there was one, confirms that he is not serious. Previously the PM had undermined Mr Clegg's drive for fairer access to internships by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/8469292/David-Cameron-interview-I-wanted-to-berate-him-but-Dave-won-me-over.html\" title=\"\">announcing he had asked his own neighbour</a> in to do one. Meanwhile, Michael Gove's continual tinkering with English exams suggests that the Conservatives are preoccupied with the youngsters who make the grade, and regard dropouts as an afterthought.</p> <p>The government's Lib Dems, by contrast, can fairly claim to pay attention to the nuts and bolts that could, in theory, make the engine of mobility hum. Vince Cable \u2013 who used a speech on Wednesday to draw attention to the upward mobility in his own story, mobility Mr Clegg cannot match \u2013 lost the political argument on tuition fees, but prevailed on protections for students from humbler homes. The Lib Dems also secured <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/04/schooling-more-for-poor\" title=\"\">a premium</a> for schools with poorer pupils. In a report for the coalition, former Labour minister Alan Milburn is floating a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/13/universities-cash-poor-students\" title=\"\">similar premium for colleges</a>.</p> <p>Mr Milburn advocates the sort of \"aspirational\" policies which promise as much as possible without threatening anyone. But in times which make the zero-sum game of privilege starker, even his agenda may prove too much for the Tories. The Lib Dems are serious about the ladder of opportunity; their difficulty is that the best place to lower it might be through an escape hatch from this coalition.</p>",

He knows one pack intimately. 'I have travelled with them, on foot, in the pack itself, running with them as they hunt. It's a privilege, and it's given me a true insight into their life.' Kim has also witnessed firsthand the many threats that have made African wild dogs endangered, including increased conflict with humans and domestic animals (poachers snares, habitat loss, traffic and disease).

He is one of fewer than 500 wild, critically endangered Sumatran tigers. It was a huge challenge for Steve to photograph one, as those that have escaped poaching and forest clearance are mostly confined to patches of forests or the mountains and are extremely shy. A former tiger hunter, now employed as a park ranger, advised Steve where to set up his camera trap. But the challenge remained to position the remote-control camera and the lights in exactly the right position so the tiger would be lit centre-stage in front of a backdrop of forest habitat. The seemingly unstoppable growth of oil-palm plantations in Sumatra and continuing poaching for body parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine indicate that this subspecies of tiger is destined to become extinct in the wild, as have its Javan and Balinese relatives<br>Photograph: Steve Winter/2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Winter/Action images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397840822\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350410175725/Ice-matters-003.jpg\" alt=\"Veolia: Ice matters\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>The world in our hands award</strong> Winner: Ice matters by Anna Henly (UK) Anna was on a boat in Svalbard an archipelago midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole when she saw this polar bear at around four in the morning. It was October, and the bear was walking on broken-up ice floes, seemingly tentatively, not quite sure where to trust its weight. She used her fisheye lens to make the enormous animal appear diminutive and create an impression of the top predator on top of the planet, with its ice world breaking up . The symbolism, of course, is that polar bears rely almost entirely on the marine sea ice environment for their survival, and year by year, increasing temperatures are reducing the amount of ice cover and the amount of time available for the bears to hunt marine mammals</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Henly/2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397840820\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350410183010/Into-the-mouth-of-the-cai-005.jpg\" alt=\"Veolia: Into the mouth of the caiman\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Behaviour: cold-blooded animals</strong> Winner: Into the mouth of the caiman by Luciano Candisani (Brazil) Motionless but alert, a yacare caiman waits, like a small tyrannosaurus for fish to come within snapping reach, says Luciano. Caimans are usually seen floating passively on the surface. Under the water, it's another story. It is this secret life that has fascinated Luciano ever since he first came face to face with a caiman while snorkelling. Once he had recovered from the shock, he realised that the reptile was neither aggressive nor fearful and that he could approach it. Luciano now regularly documents the underwater life of caimans in the shallow, murky waters of Brazil's Pantanal (the biggest wetland in the world), which contains the largest single crocodilian population on Earth.  Most aren't aggressive, but some individuals can be. The safest way to get close is when they are concentrating on a shoal of fish, says Luciano</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luciano Candisani/2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397840826\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350410191053/Hare-in-a-landscape-007.jpg\" alt=\"Veolia: Hare in a landscape\" width=\"753\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Nature in black and white award</strong> Winner: Hare in a landscape Robert Zoehrer (Austria) This steep, ploughed field, in Burgenland, Austria, with a ribbon of dazzling yellow oilseed rape on the horizon and a swath of green to the side, was just what Robert was looking for.

He'd spent nearly a decade studying and photographing cheetahs in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, and he knew that the female s behaviour meant one thing: a hunting lesson was due to begin. The female moved away, leaving the calf lying on the ground near her cubs. At first, the cubs took no notice of it. But when it struggled jerkily to its feet the cubs natural predatory instincts were triggered, says Gregoire. Each cub gaze locked on to the calf as it made a break for freedom. The lesson repeated itself several times, with the cubs ignoring the calf when it was on the ground and catching it whenever it tried to escape an exercise that affords the cubs the chance to practise chases in preparation for when they will have to do so for real </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregoire Bouguereau/2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397840785\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350410167956/Secret-lives-001.jpg\" alt=\"Veolia: Secret lives\" width=\"702\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Urban wildlife award</strong> Winner: Secret lives by Kai Fagerstr\u00f6m (Finland) About 40 or so years ago, a family of 13 people lived in this cottage in Suomusj rvi, Salo, Finland. They have long gone, but though the building has fallen into disrepair, it is still a winter home to many woodland creatures, including this red squirrel, which lives in the attic. Kai has spent the past 15 years documenting the secret life of such places. Deserted buildings are so full of contradictions, he says. I am fascinated by the way nature reclaims spaces that were, essentially, only ever on loan to humans. He usually starts off with a particular image in mind.

Eve realised that she was looking at reflections of the straight lines of the nearby office block, distorted into moving swirls.

It was the dry season, and they had been gorging on fish trapped in the pools left behind as the water receded from the river. One big alligator had clearly eaten its fill. So I set my tripod and camera up about seven metres and focused on his eyes. Just after sunset, Larry set his flash on the lowest setting, enough to catch the eyeshine in the alligator's eyes. Like cats, an alligator has a tapetum lucidum at the back of each eye a structure that reflects light back into the photoreceptor cells to make the most of low light. The colour of eyeshine differs from species to species. In alligators, it glows red one good way to locate alligators on a dark night. The greater the distance between its eyes, the longer the reptile, in this case, very long</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Lynch /2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

  "<p>The Kremlin is poised to take control of BP's troubled Siberian oil joint venture as the boss of Russia's state-controlled oil company Rosneft flew to London to clinch the deal.</p> <p>BP's partners in the TNK-BP joint venture \u2013 billionaires Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg and Len Blavatnik \u2013 have also agreed to sell their 50% stake to Rosneft for about $28bn&#xa0;(\u00a317bn).</p> <p>At the same time BP is expected to agree a deal this week that will see the British oil giant take a 10-15% stake in Rosneft plus cash in exchange for its half of TNK-BP.</p> <p>Spokesmen for BP, Rosneft and AAR \u2013 the consortium of billionaires \u2013 declined to comment.</p> <p>If the deals go ahead Rosneft will become by far the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, producing 4.5m barrels of oil a day.</p> <p>It will also bring an end to BP's troublesome relationship with the billionaires, which forced Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, to resign as head of the venture and flee Russia during a bitter row in 2008.</p> <p>Igor Sechin, Rosneft's chief executive and a former deputy prime minister of Russia and close associate of President Putin, flew to London on Wednesday, sources said, to seal the deal with executives in advance of BP's sale auction deadline, which expires at 9am on Thursday.</p> <p>Sechin's visit comes after Russia's current deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich told reporters in Moscow that Rosneft had signed a deal to buy AAR's stake in TNK-BP.</p> <p>However, Dvorkovich cautioned that agreement will require government approval. Rosneft could pull out of the deal to buy AAR's stake while snapping up BP's.</p> <p>Analysts said the deal will be beneficial to Putin politically, as it will allow the state to benefit from BP's expertise but not allow the British company a controlling interest.</p> <p>\"This strengthens Putin's national champion,\" Iain Armstrong, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin, told Bloomberg. \"BP will stay in Russia, but perhaps in a more limited way. The Russian oil industry is in a big state of flux.\"</p> <p>Analysts speculated that Rosneft was planning to buy BP's stake in shares rather than cash because it does not have enough available capital to buy out both AAR and BP's stakes at the same time.</p> <p>It was also pointed out that a large cash windfall for BP may be seized upon by US authorities, who are still negotiating with BP over compensation for 2010's Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.</p> <p>Last year AAR rejected a $32bn offer for its half from BP and Rosneft. That came after the billionaires blocked a $7.8bn share swap and exploration deal between Rosneft and BP. Relations deteriorated further, with Fridman quitting as TNK-BP's chief executive in May 2012.</p> <p>The following month BP put its stake in the joint venture up for sale. BP, which is in the process of tidying up its global assets, has been in talks with both AAR and Rosneft about a sale.</p> <p>Sources close to AAR confirmed that the billionaires do not intend to submit a bid for BP's stake, and said BP had informed the billionaires that it expects to receive a bid from another party, which they understand to be Rosneft.</p> <p>The AAR source said the billionaires had attempted to buy a 25% stake from BP, but the suggestion was rebuffed. AAR then began talks with banks to help finance a bid for the full 50% stake. \"[But] by that time, we found that so many key banks were already committed to Rosneft and BP, and could not fund us due to an exclusivity arrangement already in place,\" the source said.</p> <p>TNK-BP hasn't paid dividends on any income this year because it has lacked a full board since December. Management recommended a $4.1bn interim dividend on 2012 profits, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. The board may decide to pay the dividend in the next few weeks.</p> <p>BP's shares closed up 3.75% to 451.7p.</p>",
  "<p>Angela Merkel does not like to appear isolated on the eve of a European summit. And yet this is exactly what Fran\u00e7ois Hollande set out to do in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/francois-hollande-angela-merkel-austerity\" title=\"\">interview</a> to this newspaper and five others today. He suggested Ms Merkel was too preoccupied with domestic policies to give Europe the response it needed in a time of crisis. He demanded Berlin reverse its opposition to the decisions taken at the last summit, and gave short shrift to a German push for a federalised eurozone. To say the French socialist president lacks the bottle it takes to be a leader is to underestimate the determination he displays to put his case across.</p> <p>It is one which an increasing number of eurozone countries and institutions are coming round to. Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, wants to buy Spanish sovereign bonds on condition that Spain activates one of two bailout funds. Most eurozone members want Germany to stick to the deal they thought Ms Merkel had signed up to in June, to use the European Stability Mechanism to break the cycle between weak banks and sovereign debt. And to do all of this by the end of the year whether or not there are elections coming up in Germany. Most, too, belatedly in our view, would agree with Mr Hollande's central assertion that recession is a bigger threat than budget deficits.</p> <p>And yet, for the moment, none of this is happening. The damage that Ms Merkel's foot-dragging is causing is creeping ever closer to her country's borders. Germany's growth rate will be slightly higher than forecast in spring, but next year's will be halved to 1%. If the strongest economy in the eurozone is grinding to a crawl, it should say something. Unfortunately, Ms Merkel could be tempted by the current fragile equilibrium in the money markets to play, again, for time. Already expectations at what will be achieved at this week's summit have been downplayed. The big decisions will come in November instead. Which is perhaps why Mr Hollande launched the broadside he just has.</p> <p>But just one indication of the trouble the eurozone as a whole is in, and the current risk of contagion if Greece goes belly up, is contained<a href=\"http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/cps/rde/xchg/SID-820ABF20-F6D742A4/bst_engl/hs.xsl/index.html\" title=\"\"> in a report</a> which assesses the economic knock-on effect a Grexit would have on everyone else. According to Bertelsmann Stiftung, it would not only suck \u20ac674bn out of the world's leading economies, but if it triggered a Portuguese exit as well, global losses would add up to \u20ac2.4tn, or \u20ac2,790 for every German over eight years. If Spain left, the accumulated per capita losses would soar. If Italy followed, France would lose \u20ac2.9tn, the US \u20ac2.8tn, China \u20ac1.9tn and Germany \u20ac1.7tn by 2020. A global international crisis. So for Mr Hollande to say that we are \"near, very near\" to the end of the crisis is perhaps the closest he came in this interview to being blithe.</p> <p>Mr Hollande has got a limited number of cards to play to strengthen his position with Ms Merkel and he has used two of them already. When he first lined up his interests with Italy's Mario Monti and Spain's Mariano Rajoy, Germany was less than amused, but it has since accepted the need for collective leadership. The second card Mr Hollande played was to stick to the austere fiscal target he inherited from his predecessor. Although few think a French budget deficit of 3% of GDP is feasible next year, the target gives Hollande credibility. The third card \u2013 reforming his country's structural deficit, a task that has eluded all of his recent predecessors \u2013 will take a lot longer, if it happens at all.</p> <p>Other than waiting for disaster to strike, this means Ms Merkel has to move. She will not shift on eurobonds, or the speed with which she has to act, but she might move on the principle of bank recapitalisation. It will be at best an incremental step. The bigger question is the political cost of what is taking place. Bankruptcies, fire sales of state assets and soaring youth unemployment across the southern belt of Europe won't lead to spontaneous outbreaks of Beethoven's Ode to Joy. More like drumming Wotan's descent into Nibelheim.</p>",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 President Obama and Governor Romney raced back to the campaign trail after their alpha-male showdown Tuesday.</strong> Snap polls said Obama \"won\" the debate. CNN's poll said Romney \"won\" the discussion on the economy. We'll see what the polls say next week.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Nearly as many people watched last night's debate \u2013 65.6 million at-home TV viewers \u2013 as watched the first debate, 67.2 million.</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Romney opened up a 48-46 lead among registered voters in Gallup's 7-day rolling average poll.</strong> The governor chalked up a 51-45 lead among likely voters in the poll.

The other is his habit of pressing his advantage too far, seeking a kind of alpha-male moment that can seem bullying instead of strong. (His attempt at a $10,000 bet with Rick Perry was the paradigmatic example.)</p> <p>He gave in to both temptations this time around. The candidates each bickered with CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley about turns and time allotments, but Romney went at it earlier and more often \u2013 sometimes justifiably, but never successfully. He also tried too hard to pre-empt the president\u2019s increased aggression with aggression of his own, which doesn\u2019t work well in a town-hall format, where the candidates are already circling one another like sharks. Invading your rival\u2019s space can make you look hyped-up rather than presidential.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/douthat-obamas-narrow-victory/\">whole thing here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507eca63c0e361310bc6d0d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T15:10:27.227Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president heads to <strong>Iowa and Ohio</strong> today.

But the president's answer was better. Instead of insisting that Romney was like Bush, as might have been expected \u2013 Romney's fantasy to remake the Middle East is vintage Bush \u2013 the president conceded that Romney was different from Bush. Romney, the president said, is more conservative, particularly on social issues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> But the last point I want to make is this. You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform. He didn't call for self-deportation.</p> <p>George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.

There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.</p> <p>They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions. They presented this binder to Governor Romney when he was elected.</p> <p>I have written about this before, in various contexts; tonight I've checked with several people directly involved in the MassGAP effort who confirm that this history as I've just presented it is correct \u2013 and that Romney's claim tonight, that he asked for such a study, is false.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you are in search of ridiculous Internet content, you might start with the Binders Full of Women <a href=\"http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, or the Romney's Binder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder\">Twitter account</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>EXCLUSIVE LEAKED PHOTO OF BINDER #1<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23bindersfullofwomen\">#bindersfullofwomen</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/gHHAA2oD\" title=\"http://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011/photo/1\">twitter.com/Romney_Binder/\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Romney's Binder (@Romney_Binder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-17T02:32:54+00:00\">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ebd46c0e361310bc6d0cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:14:30.536Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Romney's botched argument on Libya</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This was supposed to be the topic on which Romney made a damaging case against Obama's leadership. The case seemed brick-strong.</p> <p>For weeks after the Benghazi attack the Obama administration disseminated a misleading version of events. Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama both said the anti-Islam video produced in California played a role in precipitating the attack. The official version of events described a protest outside the Benghazi mission that gave way to armed assault.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then we were abruptly told there was no protest. It was all made up, and it came out of the secretary of state's mouth. The<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/10/198791.htm\"> US State Department background briefing</a> in a conference call last week described a quiet night that suddenly gave way to explosions. It is self-evident that security at the mission was inadequate, despite official requests for more security support.</p> <p>Romney's argument should have been a strong one. The Obama administration had had to retract similar early inaccuracies in its account of the death of Osama bin Laden. But Romney decided to try to catch the president in what he thought was a misstatement. He jumped out of his chair and nearly charged at Obama. Here's the transcript:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;Governor, if you want to reply just quickly to this, please.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Yeah, I \u2014 I certainly do. I certainly do. I \u2014 I think it\u2019s interesting the president just said something which is that on the day after the attack, he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror. You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror? It was not a spontaneous demonstration?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Is that what you\u2019re saying?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed, Governor.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;I \u2014 I \u2014 I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Get the transcript.</p> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;It \u2014 he did in fact, sir.</p> <p>So let me, let me call it an act of terrorism...</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Can you say that a little louder, Candy? (Laughter, applause.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney hung himself out to dry. Somehow he made the discussion of Libya into a farce that ended with the audience laughing at his expense. You couldn't have predicted that.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> the White House transcript of the president's remarks in the Rose Garden following the Benghazi attack <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/12/remarks-president-deaths-us-embassy-staff-libya\">is here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T15:13:01.596Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507eb9fa58f91d7bbadac7ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:00:26.465Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Do you count yourself among those who don't think it's possible to <strong>declare a debate winner</strong>?

The issue is that many sources also seemed to suggest that, in the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/258396461845315584\">NBC's Chuck Todd</a>, \"Romney seemed to be ready for it.\" That would seem to suggest more of a tie than anything else.</p> <p>The question over whether this narrative becomes a solid Obama victory will likely revolve around video playback of the many confrontations between the candidates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Video playback has changed politics.

Did you watch? It was a humdinger. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>In a confrontational joint appearance, an energized President Obama and a pugnacious Governor Romney went to the mat</strong>, not quite literally, over energy policy, job creation, taxes, trade policy, women's health, Libya and more. The possibility for a knockout punch had the fighters swinging big all night long.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Gone was the halting, listless Obama of the first debate</strong>. He repeatedly lashed out at Romney, starting by calling him an \"oil guy\" and ending by bringing up the 47% when Romney had no more time to speak. The governor sought to repay the president in kind, accusing him of shutting down oil drilling on federal land and personally investing in China. Were voters turned off by all the fighting? Or was the televised smackdown impossible to turn off? The debate went over time and was still going strong at the end.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The supposed debate rules were shredded</strong>. Moderator Candy Crowley asked multiple follow-up questions and performed spot-checks of fact, making for some of the richest exchanges of the night. Most prominently she corrected Romney on Libya, saying that Obama had in fact described the Benghazi attack as an act of terror, over the governor's statements to the contrary. As a result Romney was widely seen as having fumbled the point.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Crowley nobly struggled to enforce time limits</strong>, prompting several moments of babbling cross-talk as Romney, in particular, sought to finish a point or make a last rebuttal. Meanwhile the president gently clung to the mic all night, and he finished with a 3-minute-plus advantage over the governor in speaking time.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The exchanges felt personal</strong>. Romney sought to cross-examine Obama like a prosecutor. Obama accused Romney of being to the right of George W. Bush. The governor accused the president of investing his pension in China.

  "<p>It is probably as far from Atonement, Anna Karenina and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/video/2012/oct/16/brad-pitt-chanel-no-5-video\" title=\"\">the new Brad Pitt advert for Chanel No 5</a> as it is possible to get. Joe Wright, director of all of those, admitted he was \"terrified\" as he talked about one of his next projects, the UK premiere of an epic play charting the rise and fall of the Congolese rebel leader Patrice Lumumba.</p> <p>Wright will direct Chiwetel Ejiofor as Lumumba in A Season in the Congo at the <a href=\"http://www.youngvic.org/\" title=\"\">Young Vic</a>, it was announced last night, marking the actor's first return to the London stage after his award-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/dec/05/theatre.shakespeare\" title=\"\">performance as Othello</a>, four years ago.</p> <p>For Wright, best known for his film adaptations of books including Pride and Prejudice and Ian McEwan's Atonement, 2013 will be the year of his theatrical directorial debut, beginning with Arthur Wing Pinero's late Victorian comic play <a href=\"http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/pl154.html\" title=\"\">Trelawny of the Wells, at the Donmar Warehouse</a>, followed by A Season in the Congo, in July.</p> <p>Wright said: \"I've been wanting for some time to work in theatre, and so I decided to make a concerted effort this year as I've made five films in eight years and I just felt I wanted a different kind of rhythm.\"</p> <p>Wright said the two theatres he liked the most were the Donmar and the Young Vic, so he had approached their respective artistic directors, Josie Rourke and David Lan.</p> <p>\"Quite early on,\" he said, \"David kind of wafted this play under my nose. And I read it, thought 'This is incredible', and then it was, 'No, no, we can't do this: it's far too expensive and ambitious,' and he began sending me wonderful two-handers. Every time I read them, I thought: 'Actually, what I really want to do is A Season in the Congo.'\"</p> <p>That led to Wright's agreeing to cut his cloth accordingly: there are about 50 characters in the play but the director anticipates using eight actors and three dancers, as well as musicians.</p> <p>He also expects to use puppetry, which may reflect his upbringing above the Little Angel puppet theatre in Islington, which his parents set up.</p> <p>Not that that is any preparation, he says: \"It's terrifying, to be honest with you, and it is absolute rubbish to say that because I grew up in a puppet theatre I have any idea how to direct actors in a theatre. I'm terrified. And that is another very good reason to do it.\"</p> <p>A Season in the Congo, by the French writer and politician from Martinique, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, was first performed at the Venice Biennale in 1967. It tells the true story of the 1960 Congo rebellion against Belgian rule, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination\" title=\"\">resulted in the US- and Belgian-sponsored assassination of the charismatic Lumumba</a>.</p> <p>Getting Ejiofor, who starred in BBC2's The Shadow Line last year, was clearly a coup. \"He read the play, we had a chat, and he said yes,\" said Wright. \"It is an amazing role.\"</p> <p>The Young Vic play is very different to his Pinero project at the Donmar, but Wright said the important similarity was that \"both of them would be impossible to do on film. I didn't want to do a piece of naturalism, like \u2013 although it would be wonderful \u2013 an Arthur Miller play; I wanted to do something that was only possible in the theatre.\"</p> <p>He now hopes to criss-cross more regularly between film and theatre work. \"That's my hope, unless the plays are a complete disaster, and then I'll go back to Working Title with my tail between my legs.\"</p> <p>Lan does not think that is likely. He says: \"One thing about Joe's movies is that technically they are incredibly accomplished. I can't think of anybody else who is in love with the play who could handle it as adroitly as I think Joe will.\"</p> <p>The Young Vic's 2013 season will kick off with Feast, a celebration of Yoruba culture written by five playwrights, with Rufus Norris directing.</p> <p>Other highlights include the return of Carrie Cracknell's acclaimed A Doll's House, and more Ibsen in the shape of a new production of An Enemy of the People, renamed Public Enemy, adapted by David Harrower and directed by Richard Jones. A new interpretation by the composer Olga Nuewirth of Alban Berg's unfinished operatic masterpiece will be staged. Neuwirth sets American Lulu in the jazz clubs of the Deep South, against the backdrop of the civil rights movement, and provides a new third act.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2012.

  "<p>Your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/14/stuart-bell\" title=\"\">obituary of Sir Stuart Bell</a> (15 October) refers to \"the Cleveland scandal, in which dozens of children were incorrectly diagnosed as having been sexually abused\". Of 121 cases of suspected sexual abuse of children diagnosed by two paediatricians in Cleveland in the spring and early summer of 1987, just 26 children, from 12 families, were judged by the court to have been wrongly diagnosed. In the remaining cases either the alleged abuser left the child's environment, or parents agreed to protection plans proposed by Cleveland social services, or the children were removed from home.<br><strong>Keith Bilton</strong><br><em>Social Work History Network</em></p> <p>\u2022 The management of child abuse nationwide was for a time put under threat until the Cleveland inquiry's conclusions were published. No doubt Stuart Bell's intervention was a factor in that inquiry being set up. He did speak from the heart but was also shooting from the hip. Other local MPs were more conciliatory. As the Savile affair is demonstrating, those with the loudest voices get heard, while children are not.<br><strong>Dr Simon Currie</strong><br><em>Otley, West Yorkshire</em></p>",
  "<p>The attorney general's feeble attempt to justify his decision to block the disclosure of Prince Charles's confidential letters to ministers is couched in the view that \"disclosure of the correspondence could damage the Prince of Wales's ability to perform his duties when he becomes king\" and that \"it is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the monarch is a politically neutral figure able to engage in confidence with the government of the day, whatever its political colour\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/attorney-general-blocks-prince-charles-letters\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 17 October). This allows the conclusion that the substance of the letters and the monarch's political neutrality have not been reconciled, at least on this occasion. Either the letters have not breached the monarch's political neutrality \u2013 in which case they must be released \u2013 or they have, and this incident makes yet again a powerful case for the establishment of a republic. Charles and the coalition government cannot have their cake and eat it.<br><strong>Dr Dionyssis Dimitrakopoulos</strong><br><em>Department of politics, Birkbeck College, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It seems that Charles is in effect serving a (very long) apprenticeship for his future role. Would it not be more productive if he first discussed these matters with his mother, who could guide him with the benefit of her long experience? This might lead to fewer of his letters being sent to ministers. In turn this should lead to less time being wasted by the various ministers and their staff dealing with his inquiries.<br><strong>Roy McGregor</strong><br><em>Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear</em></p> <p>\u2022 Isn't the attorney general simply allowing Charles to indulge in what social psychologists term \"illusory superiority\"? Many of us are probably guilty of this unbalanced view of ourselves and of our \"fantastic\" importance to the world, but few of us have access to and/or influence on the highest levels of government. Charles's best friend really needs to talk to him, sooner rather than later.<br><strong>Bruce Ross-Smith</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial reflects that Prince Charles's letters to government ministers are \"self-interested and often reactionary\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/prince-charles-letters-cover-up-editorial\" title=\"\">A right royal cover-up</a>, 17 October). But how do we know the tenor&#xa0;and tone of the letters when the attorney general refuses to release them for public perusal?</p> <p>Whether Charles should be writing to ministers expressing his personal views on political matters is a fair question. But we can't have it both ways. The monarchy has shown every sign of responding to the public's call to modernise and be more like the rest of us. We should therefore expect and welcome the prince's interventions as a true sign of healthy public engagement and his concern for issues that concern all citizens. A mature democracy is surely able to cope with the well-meaning rants of the heir to the throne. And when it comes to the environment, Charles is frequently right.<br><strong>Nick Reeves</strong><br><em>Executive director, Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is not the letters' publication that, in Dominic Grieve's words \"would potentially undermine [Charles's] position of political neutrality\", but the actions of Charles himself. His reportedly inappropriate, self-serving meddling is a world away from the disinterested and mature advice of a monarch to a prime minister, and to suggest that these letters are a legitimate part of Charles's \"preparation for kingship\" is to misrepresent the monarch's constitutional role.</p> <p>Publication of the letters might bring home to his future \"subjects\" how ill-prepared the heir is for accession and stimulate some corrective action. No other European monarchy would expect or receive the deference implicit in the attorney general's decision, and it is high time the medieval cobwebs obscuring ours were swept aside.<br><strong>Robin Gill</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 There's something very British about leaving it to our imaginations to guess what the letters were like. The reality would surely be as banal as Camillagate.<br><strong>Zander Wedderburn</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 An admirable editorial.

  "<h2>UK<br></h2> <p>A laid-back former banker, described as one of the outstanding British civil servants of his generation, Ivan Rogers is the most senior EU adviser to David Cameron helping the prime minister weave his way through the minefield of negotiations.</p> <p>Rogers, 52, who cut his teeth as chef de cabinet to the European commission vice-president Leon Brittan in the mid-1990s, was summoned back to government from Barclays Capital in 2011.</p> <p>He was appointed head of the prime minister's European and Global Issues Secretariat after Sir Jon Cunliffe moved to become the UK's permanent representative to the EU.</p> <p>The former Treasury civil servant is the prime minister's formal point man with senior officials in all the main EU capitals. The Downing Street chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, who served in the Brussels cabinet of Chris Patten when he succeeded Brittan in 1999, is also a familiar face in EU circles.</p> <p>Brittan says: \"Ivan affects to be very calm and laid-back. But he is pretty serious-minded. While he was completely loyal to the European commission he was able to maintain good relations with the British government. That was not at all easy. He ran the team very effectively.\"</p> <p>One government source said: \"Ivan has more of a laid-back style than Jon Cunliffe. But he has a phenomenal intellect and powers of analysis. He is good at explaining complicated ideas succinctly. He is also not afraid to speak truth unto power. He will not shout at the prime minister but he will say: 'This is a problem, prime minister.' \"</p> <h2>Germany<br></h2> <p>When German chancellor Angela Merkel speaks to the press after European summits, Nikolaus Meyer-Landrut discreetly takes a step back. But much of what his boss had just negotiated behind closed doors and then announces to the public, Meyer-Landrut has pre-thought and pre-negotiated with his EU counterparts.</p> <p>Since his promotion in early 2011 \u2013 when the 51-year-old career diplomat became the European policy chief adviser to the chancellor \u2013 he has become the main influence on European policy in Berlin. Without his ideas and persistent negotiation skills the European fiscal pact would never have been sealed. Like Merkel, Meyer-Landrut is also convinced that the euro crisis is an opportunity to make Europe more stable \u2013 not by indulging the debt sinners, but through clear and enforceable rules for economic and financial policies.</p> <p>Meyer-Landrut was appointed as Merkel's deputy EU adviser in 2005. That he became one of her closest advisers six years later is probably because both approach political problems in a similar way.</p> <p>Merkel, like Meyer-Landrut, looks at the facts from all angles first, then calculates what is enforceable and what needs to be enforced. He is a committed European, but not a dreamer. He has also spent almost his entire career on European issues \u2013 (unusual for a German diplomat \u2013 working at the German mission to the EU and the Foreign Office. He also instinctively understands the Franco-German axis and, somehow, counts as an honorary Frenchman, having worked for former French president Valery Giscard D'Estaing, and having married a Frenchwoman.</p> <h2>France<br></h2> <p>The Elys\u00e9e Palace's \"Mr Europe\", Philippe L\u00e9glise-Costa, cut his teeth in the team of former foreign minister Hubert Vedrine from 1999-2002, as junior adviser. He was propelled from No 2 at the French mission in Brussels to the team of Europe secretary Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2007. Now 45, he has a reputation for pragmatism and diplomatic agility, and is something of an agnostic on matters of greater European federalism. Ambitious.</p> <h2>Spain<br></h2> <p>He does not give press conferences and is hardly known to the public \u2013 but among Spain's political and economic elites he is known as the \"third finance minister\". Alvaro Nadal, head of the prime minister's economics office, is Mariano Rajoy's sherpa at European summits and the G20. However, he is much more than that.</p> <p>This talented 42-year-old economist is the man who explains the economy to the prime minister. His knowledge of German and his contacts among those surrounding Angela Merkel afford him influence over Rajoy. \"The most German of Spaniards,\" FT Deutschland once called him.</p> <p>Nadal is seen as the man responsible for Rajoy's Europe policies, although he is not exactly in favour of Germany's theses. Nadal, according to various government sources, is convinced it is best to push the Germans to the limit, so that they realise they cannot let Spain fall and therefore ease up on Rajoy. \"He is not a politician. He is a man with firm liberal ideas who will take his theoretical idea to the very limit,\" says a People party insider.</p> <p>Rajoy trusts him absolutely. If you want to know what will happen with the bailout you must talk to Nadal.</p> <p>Nowadays he has shut himself away and only appears in public for key meetings: of Rajoy with Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande or Barack Obama. On such occasions Nadal is there, close to hand.</p> <h2>Italy<br></h2> <p>Mention Henry Morton Stanley and you'll see his eyes light up. Enzo Moavero has a weakness for explorers, and particularly for the Welshman-cum-American who became one of the symbols of the golden age of Equatorial exploration.</p> <p>Moavero collects maps, saying they help him understand political change, the evolution of thought and of people, and the births and deaths of empires and of states. Since taking over as minister for European affairs in the government of Mario Monti, his job has been to forge again the rusted links between Rome and Brussels. He was a natural choice for the post, since he made his career in the European institutions and knows which doors to knock on in the commission, council, and parliament.</p> <p>\"He is the most active [Italian] minister anyone can remember,\" said an MEP. \"Sometimes, he can be long-winded. But the MEPs very much appreciate him\", said one long-time collaborator.</p> <p>Born in Rome in 1954, he finished his education at the College of Europe in Bruges, where he specialised in EU law. Moavero went into the commission where, by the end of the 1980s, he was already a chef de cabinet.</p> <p>In 1993, he was asked by the-then head of the government, Giuliano Amato, to take a post in the prime minister's office, where he remained after Amato was replaced by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. It was during this period that he first met Mario Monti. When Monti was made an EU commissioner at the start of 1995, he chose Moavero to run his cabinet.</p> <p>Moavero stayed on until the start of Monti's second mandate. But in 2000, he was made director general of the commission and then, in 2006, a judge at the court of justice in Luxembourg.</p>",
  "<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-crisis\" title=\"\">economic crisis</a> continues, and social division deepens, the electorate is asking whether any brand of politics has answers profound enough, radical enough, honest enough for the times in which we live. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech1?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">Ed's excellent \"one nation\" party conference speech</a> threw down the gauntlet to the Tories, and set the tramlines for policy renewal.</p> <p>Labour has identified reform of over-mighty markets \u2013 notably in the financial sector \u2013 as a political, economic and social priority. Given the financial crisis, and the need for a structural as well as Keynesian response to double-dip recession, this is smart.</p> <p>Successful economies in the modern world are not sheepish about the power and responsibility of the state. But there is a catch. We need to be reformers of the state to reboot our economy and build a fairer society. We don't just have to get rid of an awful Tory government; we need to change how government works.</p> <p>First, the fiscal crunch requires a different kind of state. The failure of the government's economic policy makes how much less we spend, and how and where we spend it, a core issue. We cannot meet our goals on jobs, health, education, long-term care and tackling poverty without changing the way government goes about its business.</p> <p>Second, the British state remains far too centralised. Around the world, the 40 biggest cities account for 65% of global GDP and 85% of technological innovation. In Britain, the centrally prescribed welfare to work system short-changes the young unemployed. Transport, housing and education are over centralised.</p> <p>Third, an increasingly complex society demands a different kind of state. This includes central government and extends to public services. In a more educated society, people want more power to help themselves.Yet the government's lead clinician for NHS quality and productivity says that we are behind Tonga when it comes to self-management of care by asthma patients!</p> <p>Finally, there is the politics. Despite the financial crisis or the failings of G4S, the public response has not been a flight from free markets to strong states. They are sceptical of both, and want the best of both. Our case depends on reform of government not just defence of government. A reformed state has clear national goals, decentralised power for consumers and staff over budgets and services, and the integration of services around people and across departmental silos. This is the way to free up money and meet the needs of tomorrow rather than yesterday.</p> <p>The commission I chaired on youth unemployment proposed decentralising budgets for training and job search to local commissioning boards at city level. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has proposed decentralisation of responsibility for housing benefit and housing capital spend to cities.</p> <p>Reform requires shifts in spending priority. The IPPR has shown how a 10-year freeze on child benefit could pay for a national childcare service. If our employment rate for women was as high as Denmark then a million more women would be in work \u2013 generating an extra \u00a34.5bn in tax receipts. A new long-term care system requires a new look at how we direct support to older people, and towards younger people planning for retirement.</p> <p>It also means joining up services \u2013 like health and social care \u2013 not fragmenting them.</p> <p>The whole of government needs to contribute to the shared goal of restructuring the British economy. But that means taking on the myth that the Treasury either knows best or can run it all. It just doesn't. In local government, Labour is leading by example. Faced with savage budget cuts, they are doing different, and actually better. In Liverpool the Labour mayor has streamlined 87 local authority business units into seven. In the Cooperative Council network of Labour authorities, residents are being given more power, businesses new incentives, the voluntary sector and private sector engaged as an active partner of smart government.</p> <p>People rightly expect centre-left parties to take on inequalities generated by under-regulated markets. But they want to know the cure is better than the disease. So we need to be as clear about reforms of the state as about reforms of markets. There are huge issues facing advanced western societies. They need strong, strategic government not the minimal state. But that means big change to the structures and systems that were built for the 20th century. Reform of the state will help us govern \u2013 and help us win.</p> <p><em>David Miliband is a Labour MP and former foreign secretary </em></p>",
  "<p>Tottenham Hotspur have thwarted a second attempt by Blackburn Rovers to approach Tim Sherwood over the managerial vacancy at Ewood Park. Sherwood, captain when Rovers won the Premier League in 1995 and now the respected technical co-ordinator at White Hart Lane, ranks high on the short-list of candidates drawn up by Blackburn's global advisor Shebby Singh, managing director Derek Shaw and operations director Paul Agnew.</p> <p>However, their latest request for permission to speak with the 43-year-old has been refused by Daniel Levy. The Spurs chairman is keen to keep Sherwood on the coaching staff at Spurs, although the issue of compensation cannot be discounted, and rejected an initial approach by Rovers within days of Steve Kean's departure on 28 September. Sherwood is believed to be interested in moving into management at Ewood but has given no indication he would push Tottenham into letting him meet the Rovers board.</p> <p>Blackburn do have other candidates in mind with Alan Shearer, Blackpool's Ian Holloway and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer among them. Solskjaer has insisted he will not consider leaving Norwegian champions Molde before their domestic season ends next month.</p> <p>Singh has repeatedly called for patience from Rovers' supporters in his search for Kean's successor, and owners Venky's can ill-afford another managerial mistake, but the club had hoped to have the position filled prior to Saturday's trip to Derby County. Eric Black, the current caretaker manager who is also under consideration for the permanent role, is likely to be in charge at Pride Park. </p>",
  "<p>The Liverpool goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Reina has handed Brendan Rodgers another injury problem having returned from international duty with a hamstring strain. The 30-year-old complained of a sore hamstring after warming up during Spain's World Cup qualifier against France on Tuesday, when he was an unused substitute for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/16/spain-france-world-cup-report?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the 1-1 draw in Madrid</a>.</p> <p>Reina returned to Merseyside on Wednesday and, though the extent of the problem has yet to be confirmed, he is rated doubtful for the Premier League game at home to Reading.

  "<p>Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, has blocked the publication of a raft of correspondence between Prince Charles and ministers in seven government departments.</p> <p>It means that at the moment, we do not know what the prince wrote to the ministers about in those letters which span September 2004 and April 2005.</p> <p>Here is what he has had to say about those departments in the past:</p> <p><strong>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</strong></p> <p>The heir to the throne has a lot of form in venting his views about the environment. They have embraced the plight of rural farmers, GM foods, hunting, and foot and mouth. He reportedly wrote to Tony Blair, then the prime minister, criticising the government for \"destroying the countryside\" and failing to tackle rural poverty and housing. He was reported to have relayed a comment from one farmer, who said: \"If we, as a group, were black or gay, we would not be victimised or picked on.\" He is also alleged to have remarked that if hunting was banned, he might as well leave the country and spend the rest of his life skiing. During the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, Prince Charles is believed to have attempted to prevent the cull of cattle and led the push for vaccination. He has been a vehement supporter of organic food and opponent of GM food.</p> <p><strong>Department of Health </strong></p> <p>The prince is well-known for backing alternative medicine, making his views known as far back as the early 1980s and he set up a charity to promote it. Paul Richards, a former Labour special adviser between 2005 and 2009, has said that behind the scenes lobbying of health ministers by the prince had helped to secure a \u00a31m grant to his charity. He added that the charity, the Foundation for Integrated Health, had organised a reception at Clarence House hosted by Charles and attended by at least one health minister and Tony Blair's health adviser.</p> <p><strong>Department for Children, Schools and Families</strong></p> <p>Another apparent bugbear of the prince. As far back as 1991, he complained about the way English was being used by people: \" Our language has become so impoverished, so sloppy and so limited\u2026 we have arrived at a wasteland of banality, clich\u00e9 and casual obscenity.\" In 2004, it emerged that he had criticised the modern education system, saying: \"What is wrong with everyone nowadays? ... Why do they all seem to think they are all qualified to do things \u2026? \u2026 This is all to do with the learning culture in schools that \u2026 is the result of social utopianism which believes that humanity can begin to genetically re-engineer \u2026 to contradict the lessons of history and the realities of nature.\" The then education minister Charles Clarke was upset, saying that the prince was very old-fashioned.</p> <p><strong>Department for Culture, Media and Sport </strong></p> <p>Prince Charles is fascinated by Britain's links to its built heritage and in 2004 is known to have written to the then chairman of English Heritage, Sir Neil Cossons, to declare himself \"confused and bewildered\" by a developer's plan to demolish derelict market buildings at Smithfield in London and build offices and shops. EH is a quango funded by the DCMS.</p> <p>\"If, as you say (and we all agree!), they make 'a significant contribution to the character and appearance of the Smithfield conservation area and possess great townscape value' then why on earth can they not be listed now?\" Prince Charles wrote on Highgrove House headed letter paper. To ram home his point he underlined \"now\".</p> <p>The DCMS also oversee the listing system which protects historic buildings, a close interest of the prince's. Other matters understood to have attracted his attention in the DCMS portfolio are his concern about the demise in rural skills such as stonemasonary and hedge-laying and the way in which he could help the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, in her role as minister responsible for the bereaved from terrorist attacks including the 9/11 attacks on New York, the 7/7 bombings in London and the Bali bombings.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2012, because the original incorrectly referred to \"the chairman of English Heritage, the late Sir Neil Cossons\".

Resting on a pallet next to a generator perched on an old office chair, it belonged to one of the caravans huddled along the edge of Oak Lane, the road that used to lead to Dale Farm.</p> <p>It was here that one of the biggest \u2013 and most disruptive \u2013 evictions in Britain in recent years played out among chaotic scenes a year ago on Friday. But 12 months on it is clear that the eviction of the unauthorised Travellers' site near Basildon in Essex is far from finished.</p> <p>About 80 families were removed from the site after a decade-long legal battle on 19 October last year, but many have not gone far. Approximately 20 caravans are parked on the road with no running water or mains electricity, and around the same number have squeezed on to the pitches on the legal Travellers' site next door.</p> <p>Only about 10 families have found new pitches elsewhere in the country, according to former residents. \"They've ruined everyone's lives and for what,\" said Noreen Sheridan, speaking inside her own illegally parked caravan. \"A few metres? It cost millions and they have just created a bomb site. We haven't gone anywhere.\"</p> <p>The site that used to house them is now an unlovely wasteland punctuated by carved-up hardstanding and the detritus of the eviction: a sofa with its innards torn out, a smashed ping pong table, an array of broken light-fittings.</p> <p>A small amount of asbestos has been found and dealt with, according to the council, and the Environment Agency is due to report at the end of the month on whether the eviction uncovered pollutants. Tony Ball, the leader of Basildon council, acknowledges that it is far from the greenfield site that was promised by the council and specified by the court order to remove the caravans.</p> <p>But he defended the eviction \u2013 which cost more than \u00a37m, including policing costs \u2013 and promised the land would be returned to a greenfield site. \"We would have preferred not to have to do [the eviction] but it was the right thing to do, as the council has a duty to uphold the law\" he said. \"There is no doubt the site is not how I would like it, it is a bit of a mess, but I am determined that in the future it will become what people recognise as a green field site.\"</p> <p>The Dale Farm site belongs to the Travellers who lived there, but as it was greenbelt land they had no right to live there. Now they may lose the land altogether: Ball insists that once the exact costs have been determined, the council will be pushing to recover the money from the evicted Travellers. If they are unable to pay, the land will be seized.</p> <p>He also insisted the council would continue to push to make sure former residents at the side of the road ended their \"illegal\" encampment and said the council believed many of the unauthorised caravans belonged to new residents who had not lived at Dale Farm. Eviction orders on all roadside caravans have been served \u2013 and ignored. The council is now considering its next move.</p> <p>Morale among former residents is low and many refuse to talk about the day of the eviction, when large teams of bailiffs, backed up by police officers, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/19/dale-farm-eviction-clashes\" title=\"\">broke into the barricaded site at dawn</a> as cars and tyres were set on fire, while masked activists threw missiles at police and locked themselves to gates.</p> <p>\"Dale Farm wasn't much to look at but it was beautiful at heart,\" said 24-year-old Mary Sheridan, whose son is six months old. \"Tony Ball said the eviction would be peaceful but it was like we were in hell. They completely and utterly ruined everyone's lives. My son's life was ruined before it began.\"</p> <p>Others on the site said prejudice against Travellers has got worse since the eviction. One woman, who did not want to be named, described trying to return a faulty buggy to a local shop to be told that refunds did not have to be given to anyone who lived on Oak Lane. She would not let her two-year-old daughter out of the caravan because she feared for her health, she added. \"I'm going through that much disinfectant trying to keep things clean, but the children around here are always getting sick since the eviction. It's horrible.\"</p> <p>Some members of the settled community see things differently. One resident, who did not want to be named, was happy the eviction had gone ahead. \"Of course I'm pleased, everybody around here is, it has gone on for too long,\" she said. \"It is horrible living here and if I could sell and leave tomorrow I would. It must be even worse for them now so I don't know why they don't travel.\"</p> <p>According to Candy Sheridan, a Traveller campaigner and long-term supporter of Dale Farm, it is increasingly difficult for Travellers to travel. At the Conservative conference the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, promised new powers to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/aug/29/traveller-gypsy-unauthorised-sites\" title=\"\">eject Travellers from private sites</a> before they had settled, she said, adding that councils had become emboldened by Basildon's actions. \"Basildon's shameful use of planning law has given the wrong message, essentially that Gypsies and Travellers will not be tolerated here in the same way Roma are not in Europe,\" she said.</p> <p>A planning application is now under way for a small 12-pitch site three miles from Dale Farm at Gardiner's Road, and a decision is expected in November. \"We are saying to Basildon, OK you upheld planning law but what now?\" she said. \"They have to acknowledge the Traveller community in Basildon, not just hope they can erase them with another winter.\"</p>",
  "<p>Prince Charles communicated directly with a senior Labour cabinet minister to explicitly identify what he believed were gaps in public policy, and the government took his views into consideration, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The prince held meetings and corresponded with Tessa Jowell, then culture secretary, about an issue close to his heart: a perceived lack of traditional skills such as stone masonry and hedge laying.</p> <p>Jowell said on Wednesday: \"He was drawing my attention to gaps in provision of apprenticeships in order to renew the skilled rural workforce.\"</p> <p>She said she had agreed with Charles on the matter and that his contributions \"added to\" discussions within government about aiming a strand of the New Deal policy at young people in rural areas where jobs were hard to come by and traditional countryside skills were dying out.</p> <p>Jowell said she welcomed the discussions and stressed: \"Never did he seek to bring undue pressure to bear on any policy but he correctly identified areas for potential new developments.\"</p> <p>Her account of the prince's lobbying follows the decision on Tuesday by the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, to veto the publication of 27 letters between the heir to the throne and ministers responsible for education, business, the environment, the NHS and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Charles has acknowledged he is known as the \"meddling prince\" but Grieve said his decision to veto the release was based on his view \"that the correspondence was undertaken as part of the Prince of Wales' preparation for becoming king\".</p> <p>The Guardian has for seven years been seeking the release, under the Freedom of Information Act, of correspondence between Charles and senior government ministers.</p> <p>Grieve said that any perception that Charles was disagreeing with government policy arising from the publication of those letters \"would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch, because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne he cannot easily recover it when he is king\".</p> <p>Jowell was one of the ministers consulted on Grieve's decision and she said she agreed with keeping the correspondence private and declined to comment on what it contained in her case. Speaking generally, she said she had regular meetings and correspondence with Charles, dealing with three topics: rural skills and unemployment, his drawing school in east London, and the role he could play in helping the bereaved families of terrorist atrocities such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on America in which 68 British citizens died.</p> <p>\"The most you could say is he contributed to a consideration,\" she said. \"Never did he seek to bring undue pressure to bear on any policy but he correctly identified areas for potential new developments. Nothing he ever did was seeking to assert pressure on me and he always went out of his way to make it clear that there was no pressure.\"</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, was also consulted by the government ahead of Grieve's decision but his spokesman declined to comment on whether or not he supported the move.</p> <p>Ruth Kelly, who was Labour education secretary at the time Charles wrote letters to her department, declined to comment on whether she was consulted or if she supported the veto.</p> <p>The veto prompted Republic, the pressure group campaigning for an elected head of state, to launch a new campaign for changes to the Freedom of Information Act \"that will allow the royals to be held accountable for their interference\".</p> <p>\"Grieve has said this is about protecting Prince Charles's impartiality but that impartiality doesn't exist,\" said Graham Smith, Republic's director. \"Charles has made that clear. This decision is about pretending Charles is impartial while he continues to lobby in favour of his own political agenda. If Grieve believes Charles to be impartial then let him prove it by allowing the release of these documents.\"</p>",
  "<p>Twenty million lives have been saved from tuberculosis (TB) over the past 17 years, but the battle against one of the deadliest scourges of mankind is now on a knife's edge, as drug-resistant strains spread, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p> <p>Its annual report shows that a race is on between the spread of deadlier TB strains and the development of new technologies that have the potential to stamp out the disease. Dr Mario Raviglione, director of the WHO Stop TB Department, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The momentum to break this disease is in real danger. We are now at a crossroads between TB elimination within our lifetime, and millions more TB deaths.</p> </blockquote> <p>Huge efforts have been made to defeat TB, which was once thought to have been eradicated in more affluent nations but is now a reinvigorated threat to the whole world. Some 51 million people have been treated since 1995 according to WHO recommendations, which involve six months of antibiotics taken under observation, because of the importance of finishing the course. </p> <p>\"Without that treatment, 20 million people would have died,\" Raviglione added. \"This milestone reflects the commitment of governments to transform the fight against TB.\"</p> <p>The numbers of people falling ill have continued to drop, by 2.2% last year, and the mortality rate has gone down by 41% since 1995. But there were still 8.7m new cases last year and an estimated 1.4m deaths.</p> <p>But the real fear is that the steady progress against TB will not be enough to defeat the resistant strains that have emerged and are now spreading. The report talks of a \"persistently slow response\" to multi-drug resistant TB. Only one in five cases that are thought to exist are being diagnosed worldwide, and unless they are detected and treated, drug-resistant virus will be passed on.<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/30/tb-cases-increasingly-resistant-drugs\"> A paper published by the Lancet medical journal in August </a>found an alarming rate of increase in drug resistant cases.</p> <p>On the positive side, the WHO report says a diagnostic test that can be used in the field and new drugs are on the way, the first of which is expected to become available next year. There are a number of new potential vaccines. The executive summary says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>New or repurposed TB drugs and novel TB regimens to treat drug-sensitive or drug-resistant TB are advancing in clinical trials and regulatory review. Eleven vaccines to prevent TB are moving through development stages.</p> </blockquote> <p>But there is not enough money to pay for the new tools that are needed. The report talks of \"critical funding gaps for research and development\". $2bn a year is needed, but in 2010, the funding gap was $1.4bn.</p> <p>A strongly worded editorial in the Lancet emphasises the danger:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, the approach to tuberculosis control is not returning the kind of impact the world should expect to see. Insufficient attention and funding over several decades have allowed the global epidemic to remain a deep scar on the reputation of global health. </p> <p>And looking ahead, the report warns the situation could worsen and the gains be reversed if the substantial funding gap is not filled. The existing control approach has taken a short-term view with heavy reliance on treatment and cure. But the health systems of many countries have simply been ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of managing tuberculosis, a fact proven by the escalating rates of MDR and XDR disease.</p> </blockquote> <p>It calls on UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon to break the gridlock, by setting up a global commission on TB elimination, which should recommend a fresh strategic approach by September next year.</p>",
  "<p>The imminent badger cull in England is a \"bad deal for taxpayers\", according to an agricultural economist who worked on a landmark 10-year trial examining if culling can curb TB in cattle. The <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovine-tb-impact-assessment.pdf\" title=\"\">government's own impact assessment</a> for the policy concluded that the cull, aimed at curbing rising tuberculosis in cattle, would cost more than it saves.</p> <p>\"Culling has never turned out to be worth it in strictly economic terms,\" said Prof John McInerney, at the University of Exeter. \"It is a good deal for the farmers, but a bad deal for the taxpayers, in strict economic terms.\" He noted his analysis could not account for the social costs of the 26,000 cattle sent to slaughter in 2011.</p> <p>McInerney's analysis is based on the government's initial cost estimates. He found it would cost \u00a31.55m to conduct the government's cull for four years, over an area of 150 square kilometres. If this reduced TB infections in cattle by the 16% ministers hope, this would save only \u00a30.97m in reduced compensation and testing. Taxpayers bear most of the cost, he calculated, particularly due to high expected costs of policing protests against the cull. But farmers get more of the benefit, spending \u00a3215,000 but gaining \u00a3320,000 due to fewer cattle infections.</p> <p>But a spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said the cull would bring economic benefits in the longer term. \"It is of benefit to taxpayers as well as farmers. We will start to see the benefits to when the number of bovine TB infections are starting to fall.\" Defra estimates that on current trends, dealing with TB in cattle will cost \u00a31bn in the next decade. Ministers hope the cull will reduce cattle infections in the cull zones, but many scientists say the cull could actually increase infections. The National Farmers' Union pointed out that dealing with bovine TB has cost \u00a3500m in the past decade.</p> <p>Sources have told the Guardian that the cost estimates for the two pilot culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset have risen from initial estimates. Furthermore, the cull areas are about twice as large as the area used in McInerney's analysis. If the pilot culls show shooting free-running badgers is an acceptable method of killing, then 10 culling zones could be licenced a year, meaning taxpayers will be millions of pounds worse off than if nothing was done. Both sides of the debate say action is necessary, but cull opponents argue that improved measures to prevent cattle-to-cattle infections, better biosecurity and more vaccination are better options.</p> <p>At a press conference on Wednesday on the science of the badger cull, Prof Robbie McDonald, at the University of Exeter and former head of wildlife science at the government's Food and Environment Research Agency, said: \"Managing wildlife to reduce TB in cattle is likely to produce unimpressive results.\" His research <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0039250#pone-0039250-t004\" title=\"\">modelled the impact of the imminent cull</a>, which differs significantly from the landmark randomised badger culling trial. The latter showed culling hard for a many years could reduce TB infections in cattle by 16%. Other research by McDonald showed measure to keep <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028941#top\" title=\"\">badgers out of farm buildings are 100% effective if used</a>, but noted that cattle might still contract TB from badgers in fields.</p> <p>On Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">32 eminent scientists wrote to the Observer</a> calling on the government to abandon the cull. On Wednesday, Prof Rowland Kao, at the University of Glasgow, told journalists: \"It is not principally a science-based policy.\" Prof Christl Donnelly, at Imperial College London and who was a key member of the RBCT team, said neither the cull in England or the preferred vaccination programme in Wales could claim full scientific justification: \"Science cannot be used to give the stamp of approval to either policy.\"</p> <p>But Andrew Praill, president of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, said a cull was required to attempt to control TB: \"The killing of badgers is an unfortunate necessity.\" McInerney said it was ultimately a \"political\" decision.</p> <p>\u2022 The original article said \"McInerney's analysis is based on ... an area of 150 kilometres squared.\" That should have been 150 square kilometres, now corrected.</p>",
  "<p>It used to be that a typical meeting between a business and nongovernmental organisation (NGO) resulted in one of two outcomes: confrontation or a donation. Think Greenpeace versus McDonalds or corporate philanthropic funding to the United Way and Habitat for Humanity.</p> <p>But times are changing.</p> <p>Riding the wave of public-private partnerships and the idea of shared value, NGOs are rethinking their relationship with the private sector to better meet their social missions. Consider how <a href=\"http://www.care.org/\" title=\"\">CARE</a> has helped <a href=\"http://unilever.com/\" title=\"\">Unilever</a> and six other companies increase the reach of their products in Bangladesh through a rural sales network. In the process, almost 3,000 women now have jobs. Teaming up with a local NGO (<a href=\"http://fonkoze.org/\" title=\"\">Fonkoze</a>), <a href=\"http://www.mercycorps.org/\" title=\"\">Mercy Corps</a> has helped provide small business owners with critically-needed disaster insurance in Haiti and a new customer base for insurer <a href=\"http://files.swissre.com/annualreport/the-power-of-transformation/partnerships-community.html\" title=\"\">SwissRe</a>.<a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6115947/k.8D6E/Official_Site.htm\" title=\"\"> Save the Children</a> has helped <a href=\"http://www.pg.com/en_US/index.shtml\" title=\"\">Proctor &amp; Gamble</a> develop new markets for its sanitary products in developing countries. While Proctor &amp; Gamble benefits from Save the Children's awareness-building and demand generation, Save the Children views the partnership as a way to stop dropout rates among young girls in resource constrained settings.</p> <p>FSG and Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School have written extensively about the changing role of business in society under the banner of shared value. As much as we see new opportunities for the private sector to solve many of the world's toughest problems, we realise that, even with great innovation, companies do not reconceive products, improve productivity in the value chain, or build the enabling environment alone. Often, NGO partners (or government and donors) are needed to fill in relationships, knowledge, and resource gaps.</p> <p>Increasingly, NGOs recognise that the people they are trying to serve are also companies' customers and suppliers or live in the communities where businesses operate. This mutual interest, fueled by the private sector's assets, skills, and investment potential (<a href=\"http://www.riotinto.com/\" title=\"\">Rio Tinto</a> spends $85m on training local construction workers in Mongolia, making them a huge investor in education in that country), can help scale NGO impact in sustainable ways.</p> <p>We see NGOs scaling their impact with companies across all three forms of shared value:</p> <p>\u2022 Reconceiving products and markets: the Seattle-based NGO <a href=\"http://www.path.org/\" title=\"\">PATH</a> understands that one of the best ways to dramatically increase access to its single use Uniject syringe is to partner with <a href=\"http://www.bd.com/\" title=\"\">Becton Dickinson</a> in a novel licensing agreement.</p> <p>\u2022 Redefining productivity in the value chain: the <a href=\"http://worldwildlife.org/\" title=\"\">World Wildlife Fund</a> works closely with <a href=\"http://www.walmart.com/\" title=\"\">Walmart</a> on a host of agricultural and other supply chain issues to ensure that high-demand products such as seafood are sourced more sustainably.</p> <p>\u2022 Building local clusters: <a href=\"http://www.technoserve.org/\" title=\"\">TechnoServe</a> is working with the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to help 50,000 farmers in Uganda and Kenya grow and sell fruit for locally-produced <a href=\"http://www.coca-cola.com/en/index.html\" title=\"\">Coca-Cola</a> juices. This marks the trend toward <a href=\"http://www.technoserve.org/press-room/detail/the-coca-cola-company-technoserve-and-the-gates-foundation-partner-to-boost\" title=\"\">three-way shared value partnerships</a> - NGOs, businesses, and donors - coming together to solve a social problem at scale.</p> <p>For some NGOs, shifting from a corporate philanthropy to shared value mindset is difficult. NGOs often lack staff who understand the needs and preferences of business. For companies, NGOs can be daunting to interpret and penetrate as business-specific service offerings are still nascent. Large, international NGOs often position themselves as jack-of-all-trades organisations, making it difficult for companies to pick partners.</p> <p>In the future, NGOs will need to think more strategically about their partnerships with business. NGOs can be much more proactive and analyse their operational assets against the needs of corporations and market their offerings for mutual gain. Organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.mercycorps.org/\" title=\"\">Mercy Corps</a> that are committed to shared value have undertaken a top-to-bottom review of their capabilities and focused in on a few areas such as financial inclusion for smallholder farmers. Such dedication may not usher in the sums of funds from government donors but do offer an alternate and powerful pathway to sustained impact at scale. NGOs will have to balance their resources when confronted with bilateral contracts and grants to ensure sufficient resources and management attention are allocated to shared value initiatives and indeed to explore ways through which to create a confluence between these sectors.</p> <p>None of these trends should lead to the conclusion that business offers a secure ticket to impact for NGOs. Nor will shared value thinking pervade all NGOs. Talk to staff and executives at NGOs and you will hear serious questions about collaborating with the private sector. But the trend toward shared value partnerships is real and growing.</p> <p>NGOs should take the time to investigate their own specific shared value opportunities.</p> <p>Kyle Peterson is managing director, <a href=\"http://www.fsg.org/\" title=\"\">FSG</a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

That, some commentators believe, is a clear signal to Italy to join Spain in seeking help from the EU to draw a line under the euro crisis.</p> <p>Here's some analysis on Blanchard's comments from our economics correspondent Phillip Inman:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The controversial IMF adviser, who recently upset Germany and the UK by announcing that austerity hurt economic growth by more than previously thought, said it was crucial to have a funding plan for both countries.</p> <p>Without a line of credit to Rome from the EU and the IMF, the fear is that Italy will face the same investor backlash as that suffered by Spain. Mario Monti is adamant Italy is in a stronger position, but what is interesting is that Blanchard disagrees.</p> <p>At the IMF's annual meetings in Tokyo last week it was obvious that European leaders were being beaten up verbally behind closed doors over their handling of the Greek/Spain bailout debacle. If Italy becomes another domino after a Spanish bailout the anger could be uncontainable (to use a word adopted by Bank of England deputy Paul Tucker in relation to another banking crisis).</p> </blockquote> <p>Monti has been keeping a rather low profile recently -- letting Mariano Rajoy 'enjoy' the spotlight instead.

  "<p>Dozens of Spitfire fighter planes that were buried by British troops in Burma as the second world war drew to a close are to be excavated after an agreement to dig up the historic aircraft was signed by the Burmese government and an aviation enthusiast from Lincolnshire.</p> <p>After 16 years of searching and lobbying, David Cundall, 62, has signed a deal to recover the lost RAF planes, which are believed to have been packed in crates and hidden by British forces on the orders of Earl Mountbatten shortly before the United States bombed the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.</p> <p>During his visit to Burma in April, David Cameron reached an agreement with President Thein Sein about the recovery of the missing aircraft. The British embassy in Rangoon said the newly signed deal was a chance to work with the new Burmese government \"in uncovering, restoring, displaying these fighter planes\".</p> <p>Excavation work is expected to begin by the end of this month. The number of Mark 14 Spitfires awaiting discovery remains unclear, but Htoo Htoo Zaw, managing director of Cundall's Burmese partner, the Shwe Taung Paw company, said he estimated there were at least 60. Previous estimates have varied between 20 and 36. Even that number would represent a large increase in the global Spitfire population: while 21,000 were built, only 35 remain in a good enough condition to fly.</p> <p>\"This will be the largest number of Spitfires in the world,\" Htoo Htoo told the Associated Press. \"We want to let people see those historic fighters, and the excavation of these fighter planes will further strengthen relations between Myanmar [Burma] and Britain.\"</p> <p>A local newspaper, Myanmar Ahlin, reported that the excavation agreement was signed by Cundall on behalf of his British company DJC, Tin Naing Tun, the Burmese <a href=\"http://www.mot.gov.mm/dca/index.html\" title=\"\">director general of civil aviation</a>, and Htoo Htoo.</p> <p>For Cundall, it is a triumphant end to years of hunting for the fighters. He says he has spent \u00a3160,000 trying to locate the lost treasure, vying with potential rivals for the deal.</p> <p>In April, he claimed he had secured financial backing for the planes' excavation from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/9228910/Its-Spitfires-at-dawn-in-Burma.html\" title=\"\">an anonymous investor</a>, and in August <a href=\"http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/postfeatures/2012/08/17/final-push-in-battle-to-save-mark-x1v-spitfires-65233-31629022/2/\" title=\"\">told the Birmingham Post</a> he wanted to see the aircraft return to the UK. \"Spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes and should not be rotting away in a foreign land,\" he was quoted as saying. \"They saved our neck in the Battle of Britain and they should be preserved.\"</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We are pleased to hear that contracts have been awarded, which mean that the digging up of the Spitfires in Burma can begin. We've always said that we want to see these Spitfires back home in Britain \u2013 perhaps one day even flying over the skies of Britain \u2013 and today's news brings us another step closer to that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nike has severed its connections with Lance Armstrong, finally acknowledging the \"seemingly insurmountable\" evidence that that the seven-times Tour de France winner was a drugs cheat.</p> <p>In a near-simultaneous statement, Armstrong said he would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/17/lance-armstrong-livestrong-cancer-charity\">relinquish his position as chairman of Livestrong</a>, the cancer charity he founded, in order to \"spare the foundation any negative effects\" after a damning report by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), which<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/11/armstrong-usada-sophisticated-doping-scheme\"> concluded he ran a sophisticated doping ring for years</a>.</p> <p>Armstrong's decision to step down from Livestrong allowed Nike to continue to support the initiative. In the US, 98 products bearing the Livestrong name are sold by Nike.</p> <p>Nike \u2013 which initially indicated that it would stand by Armstrong \u2013<a href=\"http://nikeinc.com/news/nike-statement-on-lance-armstrong\"> said in a statement</a> it had been misled by Armstrong and did not \"condone the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs\".</p> <p>The full statement said: \"Due to the seemingly insurmountable evidence that Lance Armstrong participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade, it is with great sadness that we have terminated our contract with him. Nike does not condone the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs in any manner. </p> <p>\"Nike plans to continue support of the Livestrong initiatives created to unite, inspire and empower people affected by cancer.\"</p> <p>Armstrong has been dogged for years by allegations that he cheated his way to his Tour de France titles, while he was lead cyclist with his US Postal Service and Discovery Channel teams. Last week, Usada released a 1,000-page dossier which concluded that what had transpired amounted to \"the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen\".</p> <p>Despite strongly denying the doping allegations, Armstrong elected not to fight Usada's claims, saying he thought the process was unfair.</p> <p>The loss of the Nike deal will come as a financial blow, but stepping down from Livestrong is likely to be more personally damaging. Armstrong, a cancer survivor, set up the foundation in 1997, in order to help inspire others battling the illness. His inspiring story, of recovering from testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain and then winning the world's most famous cycle race, helped the foundation grow from a small operation in Texas into one of the most popular charities in the US.</p> <p>The cyclist insisted he was drug free at a time when doping was rampant in professional cycling. In 2004, the foundation introduced yellow \"Livestrong\" bracelets; more than 80 million were sold, creating a global symbol for cancer awareness and survival.</p> <p>Armstrong, who was not paid a salary as chairman of the Lance Armstrong Foundation, will remain on its board, but his duties will be handed to the vice chairman, Jeff Garvey.</p> <p>\"This organisation, its mission and its supporters are incredibly dear to my heart,\" Armstrong said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Today therefore, to spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career, I will conclude my chairmanship.\"</p> <p>As chairman, Armstrong did not run the foundation's day-to-day operations, which are handled by the Livestrong president and chief executive, Doug Ulman. Ulman had said that Armstrong's leadership role would not change. </p> <p>Armstrong's statement said he would remain a visible advocate for cancer issues. He is expected to speak at Friday night's 15th-anniversary gala for Livestrong in Austin, Texas.</p> <p>\"My family and I have devoted our lives to the work of the foundation and that will not change,\" Armstrong said. \"We plan to continue our service to the foundation and the cancer community. We will remain active advocates for cancer survivors and engaged supporters of the fight against cancer.\"</p>",

Andy recently carried out some work with the trust to help it improve its performance.</p> <p>He says he encourages staff to \"know their numbers\", such as how many operations are due to take place, how many free hospital beds they need to get though a bank holiday weekend etc. His says this helps a team have ownership of their own performance.</p> <p>Jo asked Andy to work with them on a better, more joined up way to deliver performance. She said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were managing our performance entirely in silos.

  "<p><strong>Tesco</strong> shares were lifted nearly 3% on talk it could return \u00a38bn to shareholders over the next six years or so, and suggestions it should abandon its Fresh and Easy stores in the US.</p> <p>UBS analyst Mike Tattersall moved his recommendation from neutral to buy and said:</p> <blockquote> We believe Tesco is recalibrating the manner in which value is delivered to shareholders by lowering capital intensity and focusing on cash generation. This has the scope to drive significant cash returns \u2013 our analysis suggests the company could feasibly buy back almost \u00a38bn of equity and return around 60% of market cap to investors in cash, including dividends, over the period to February 2018. </blockquote> <p>He also suggested Tesco's trading performance in the UK was better than commonly perceived:</p> <blockquote> Overall, we see a credible roadmap over the coming 6-12 months whereby concerns over Tesco's core business are alleviated, releasing pressure on the rating of the shares which is close to 15-year absolute and relative lows. <br> </blockquote> <p>As for Fresh and Easy, he believed shareholders would be pleased to see the back of the business:</p> <blockquote> Although we understand management's desire to give the Fresh and Easy concept every opportunity to prove itself, ongoing disappointments and the apparently insurmountable economics of the model make meaningful value creation a more distant prospect than ever. We argue that Tesco would benefit from exiting the US and believe investors would warmly welcome such a move. </blockquote> <p>Ironically, Retail Week is reporting that Tesco has <a href=\"http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/food/tesco-sells-fresh-and-easy-products-in-uk-stores/5041823.article\" title=\"\">started selling Fresh &amp; Easy branded goods in its UK stores</a>.</p> <p>The news lifted Tesco by 8.4p to 316.3p.</p> <p>Overall global markets were encouraged by hopes of a Spanish bailout, and on relief that Moody's had not downgraded the country's credit rating.

But the miner, in the middle of a drawn out merger attempt with Glencore, said a turnaround in Chile would help the fourth quarter. It also confirmed it had cut 600 jobs in Australia.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> moved 13p higher to 448.35p on hopes of a resolution to its controversial joint venture in Russia.</p> <p>A report suggested that <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/998795/oligarchs-in-talks-on-17bn-tnk-bp-sale\" title=\"\">Russian partner AAR had agreed to sell its own stake to Rosneft</a> for a better than expected $28bn.

This is down from the 9% reported this time last year.

  "<p>There is not a single future of mobility. Transport will vary according to settlement size, geography, culture and the existing infrastructure and services that will evolve to provide future mobility.</p> <p>There tends to be a future view of mobility that centres around high-rise megacities and high-tech transport systems - hover cars, jet packs, railroads in the sky. This view has remained the same for almost a century - but I believe the future is oversold and under-imagined.</p> <p>The world's population is growing and becoming more urban. There are currently seven billion people living on the planet, with just over half in urban areas - but beware the word urban, it has no single definition and can refer to quite small settlements. Only 5% of the world's population live in megacities (using the UN definition of more than 10 million people). In Europe, two thirds of the urban population live in settlements of fewer than 500,000 people.</p> <p>Forecasts for 2050 predict a world population of 9.3 billion, with 6.25 billion (nearly 70%) in urban areas - 1.13 billion in more developed countries and 5.12 billion in less developed countries. That would be more than half the world's population living in towns and cities in less developed countries - these are the people we need to consider most when we think of the future of mobility. How can we make transport safe, efficient and sustainable, while catering for increasing demand?</p> <p>Rather than specific transport modes or solutions, I think of guiding principles for city transport strategies:</p> <p>\u2022 Transport policies are part of urban management and must focus on outcomes of city prosperity and wellbeing for all residents.</p> <p>\u2022 Transport policies must support other policies - economic vitality, regeneration, environmental issues (carbon, air quality, noise), health (active travel), access to education etc.</p> <p>\u2022 Transport planning must be inclusive, taking into account all residents and users - the old, the young, the poor etc.</p> <p>\u2022 There should be less focus on ownership and more focus on accessibility to a good or service - for example car clubs or cycle hire schemes. Such collaborative consumption means that assets - vehicles, urban space - are well-utilised.</p> <p>\u2022 Technology benefits must be harnessed for all users, not just the affluent elite. There is much talk of \"smart cities\" and I think the key question is how can smart mobility help to make urban areas more sustainable and better places to live for all inhabitants?</p> <p>\u2022 Having all aspects of transport under the jurisdiction of one organisation is fundamental to a quality integrated transport system. And ideally all city areas under the governance of a single authority.</p> <p>\u2022 Fundamentally we need to plan for people, not just plan systems. And we need to recognise what drives behaviour. People are not always rational in their decision-making so we need to understand that the heart and the gut can be a greater influence than the mind.</p> <p>Most of all, I think future mobility needs to be flexible - the only certainty is change. We need to make sure that our transport systems can adapt and evolve to serve future generations.</p> <p><em>Susan Claris is associate director at Arup</em></p> <p><em>Susan will be part of the panel for a debate on the future of mobility on 14 November. </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/future-sustainable-transport-solving-global-gridlock?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Sustainable Business will be live streaming the discussion</em></a><em>.

Identifying the \"victor\" is a real challenge: is it policy-based evidence, or evidence-based policy?</p> <p>But having pored through the evidence today, I find it hard to come to any other conclusion that the evidence put forward by the cull advocates - notably Defra and the NFU - just isn't strong enough to justify the current policy. Rather, it seems far too selective and fudged in its approach to be persuasive. Sadly, it bears all the hallmarks of a ministry led by the personal opinions of the politician in charged, as opposed to the expert scientists it consults.</p> <p>Bovine tuberculosis is clearly a harrowing disease for all concerned, but pushing forward with a policy, when so much of the supporting evidence seems weak, tangential and/or cherry-picked, appears ill-advised.</p> <p>My colleague Damian Carrington <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/badger-cull-science-cows-tuberculosis?commentpage=all#block-507ea9e5c0e361310bc6d0be\">summed it up very well</a>: \"No-one knows whether the 16% reduction in cattle infections will materialise: it's a big gamble.\"</p> <p>Indeed, I believe the stakes are too high - and the odds too unsettled - to risk seeing whether this badger cull works in its current form.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ed14458f91d7bbadac7bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T15:48:52.385Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/c.donnelly/\">Christl Donnelly</a>, professor of statistical epidemiology at the <a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/about/institutes/outbreaks/\">MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling</a> at Imperial College London's <a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research/researchthemes/infection/ide/\">Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology</a>, has just sent me her thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>The estimate of a 16% reduction over 9.5 years for a 150sq-km culling area is a calculation (<a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\">pdf</a>) based on RBCT estimates of the benefits observed inside culling areas (during and after culling) and the temporarily increased risks to cattle herds up to <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009090\">2km outside culling areas</a>. This net benefit can be increased as the cull area gets bigger (everything else being equal). For a 300 sq-km area it is roughly a 19% reduction.</li> <li>\"The RBCT provides the best scientific evidence available from which to predict the effects of a future culling policy. Informed expert opinion suggests that the more that a future culling policy deviates from the conditions of the RBCT - e.g. industry versus government led and/or culling methods (such as permitting controlled shooting of badgers in addition to cage-trapping), the more likely it is that the effects of that policy will differ, either positively or negatively, and with potential variability in outcome between areas.\u201d (<a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\">pdf</a>)</li> <li>There is no scientific basis for saying that the use of hard boundaries will make the reduction much bigger because the RBCT used such boundaries where available (see <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081109113737/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/isg/isgrep1.htm#A10\">paragraph 4.12</a>). The only exception would be if a considerable part of the boundary were sea (i.e. a peninsula).</li> <li>Several aspects of the proposed policy have been directly informed by Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) findings. For example, the requirement to have large (at least 150sq-km) culling areas, the requirement to have access to at least 70% of the total land area for culling, and the requirement for culling to be repeated annually.</li> <li>However, the proposal is for a different culling method. Controlled shooting of free-ranging badgers has not been tested. The shooting of badgers after they were trapped in cages (as used in the RBCT) is not being proposed, because it was deemed too expensive for the predicted benefits in terms of cattle incidence. A judgement is then required as to rather this proposed culling is likely to \u2018work\u2019 in the sense of removing at least 70% of badgers (the reduction achieved on average in the RBCT). The risk is that it removes relatively few badgers; then the worst case scenario is not just the loss of the risk reduction observed in the RBCT but the possibility of actually increasing the risk to local cattle herds (such as observed in reactively culled areas of the RBCT).</li> <li>\u00b7Judging whether a 70% reduction has been achieved is very challenging because badgers are <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7400/full/485582a.html\">so difficult to count</a>. A suggestion has been made to trap a number of badgers before the culling, mark them and then count the number of marked badgers which are killed in the subsequent cull. This is a possible approach. However the number of badgers marked will need to be big in order to get a precise estimate. For example, if 100 badgers were marked and 70 of the marked badgers were culled, then the confidence interval would be 60% to 79% with a central estimate of 70%. Whereas if only 50 badgers were marked and 35 of the marked badgers were culled, then the confidence interval would span from 55% to 82%. It is not know what proportion of badgers need to be removed in order to avoid an increased risk due to limited culling success.</li> </ul> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ec6cbc0e361310bc6d0d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:55:31.107Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/esi/people/mcdonald/\">Robbie McDonald</a>, professor of natural environment at the University of Exeter, has been tweeting links to some of the key academic studies related to badge culls/vaccination and bovine tuberculosis...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258564649031700481\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Heres modelling paper comparing vaccination culling and ring vaccination<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Badgers\">#Badgers</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/smc_london\">smc_london</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcpallab\">bbcpallab</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dpcarrington\">dpcarrington</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/PaNCBIfi\" title=\"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0039250\">dx.plos.org/10.1371/journa\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Robbie McDonald (@RobbieAMcDonald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258564649031700481\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:46:30+00:00\">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258567053869469696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>and here is the main paper so far reporting vaccine performance in captive and wild <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23badgers\">#badgers</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/thWAoTYK\" title=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/content/long/278/1713/1913\">rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/content/lo\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Robbie McDonald (@RobbieAMcDonald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258567053869469696\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:56:04+00:00\">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieAMcDonald/status/258578604202536960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-in-reply-to=\"258574842822021120\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dpcarrington\">dpcarrington</a> heres the biosecurity paper <a href=\"http://t.co/5Hi4fmjP\" title=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028941\">plosone.org/article/info:d\u2026</a> When measures are in place theyre 100% effective.

They won't. The purpose is to assess whether or not it is possible to effectively shoot and kill at least 70% of badgers in the given area, and how humane or otherwise the killing methods are. Both NFU and Defra spokespeople have, at times, added to the confusion by giving the impression that there is a scientific efficacy purpose to the killing, which there is not.</p> <p>A group of veterinarians, including our executive director Mark Jones, recently wrote to DEFRA (<a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/badgers_VetLetter_AnimalWelfar_12Oct12.pdf\">pdf</a>) to express their concerns that the pilot culls will inevitably lead to badgers enduring significant suffering. This is due to the likelihood that many will be shot but not killed, fleeing underground where they will slowly and painfully bleed to death. With early cubs being born mid December, as the later pilot continues there is also every chance that newborn cubs will starve to death in their sett if their mother is shot. In the gloom, it will be almost impossible for anyone to differentiate between a male and female badger, let alone a pregnant or lactating one.</p> <p>This is important in answering the question - will the cull work? If one of the main purposes of the cull is to assess the \"humaneness\" of the exercise, then clearly there is every likelihood that it will not work. Humaneness will be assessed by retrieving the carcasses of badgers. This will be simple enough for those animals cleanly shot - their bodies will be above ground. But if many badgers are not cleanly shot, are mortally wounded but die underground, their bodies will never be found and won't therefore form part of the data analysis. That means that precisely those animals who will have suffered the most and for the longest, will be absent from the humaneness assessment and the results will therefore be highly questionable.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The society has also produced this video, featuring <a href=\"http://www.billoddie.com/\">Bill Oddie</a> among others...</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_55z1AgLM_c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_55z1AgLM_c?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ea9e5c0e361310bc6d0be\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:11:01.865Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Opinion</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/damiancarrington\">Damian Carrington</a>, the Guardian's head of environment, has emailed me his opinion on the science behind the badger cull:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The science of the proposed badger cull is complex, but the government's position is clear. They have taken a political decision to extrapolate the data from the landmark decade-long study (the Randomised Badger Culling Trial, or RBCT) in the hope of mounting a badger cull that will curb TB. No-one knows whether the 16% reduction in cattle infections will materialise: it's a big gamble.</p> <p>The crux is that the culling proposed by the government is very different to that in the earlier \u00a350m RBCT. Free-running badgers will be shot, not trapped first, because it is cheaper. The killing period has risen from 12 days to 42 days. And farmers are doing the cull, not the government. All these factors are likely to increase the well-established perturbation effect - that fleeing badgers increase TB infection, not reduce it.</p> <p>The new cull areas are bigger and will attempt to make better use of \"hard boundaries\" such as motorways, in an attempt to reduce perturbation. These might increase the effectiveness of the cull. But there are other issues too: you have to kill most of the badgers to ensure a positive effect on TB, but knowledge on how many there are now is limited. Protests are near certain and if they stop culling early, that is known to be the worst of all outcomes.</p> <p>A striking fact is that even in the government's own impact assessment, its proposed cull will cost much more than doing nothing. That isn't an option of course, given the 26,000 cattle killed last year, the \u00a390m cost and the social costs, but the government claims it is doing all it can on the alternatives of better cattle controls and biosecurity. European Commission inspectors <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb?CMP=twt_gu\">disagree</a>, finding in September 2011 a catalogue of failures in controls and biosecurity, including missed targets on both the rapid removal of cattle with TB and the follow-up of missed tests, and \"weaknesses in cleaning and disinfection at farm, vehicle, market and slaughterhouse levels\". All these problems increase the risk of TB spreading between cattle. Furthermore, 50 years ago bovine TB was virtually eradicated in this country through control measures alone, which were subsequently relaxed, to catastrophic effect.</p> <p>Despite saying they are \"pursuing both cattle and badger vaccination as quickly as possible\", the coalition government cancelled five of the six badger vaccines trials shortly after taking office. The government says \"a&#xa0;consensus view of scientists is that culling badgers can reduce TB in cattle\", which is true but misleading. The consensus is that culling as carried out under the RBCT can reduce TB - no-one knows what the government's very different badger cull will achieve. So, as Defra's former chief scientist, Porf Bob Watson, said to me, it's a matter of judgment.</p> <p>The judgement of every scientist outside of government that I am aware of, including the 32 eminent scientists who called for the cull to be cancelled in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\">letter to the Observer</a>, is that this badger cull is a bad idea. The architect of the RBCT called the new cull \"mindless\". The man who ran the RBCT said it \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/15/badger-cull-government-accused\">could make TB a damn sight worse</a>\".</p> <p>So why is it going ahead? It's back to politics. Some may think it significant that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jun/25/badger-cull-high-court-challenge\">freedom of information requests</a> for communication between the government and the National Farmers' Union were rejected on the basis that they were \"internal communications\".</p> </blockquote>  <p>And Damian has also sent me an addendum in reaction to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/badger-cull-science-cows-tuberculosis#block-507ea67f58f91d7bbadac79f\">my earlier post</a> highlighting the two-page document Defra is citing as its evidence for the cull:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You are right to highlight to the two-page April 2011 document as the entire basis of the government's argument that science backs its cull. Yet those who ran the RBCT say the document does nothing of the sort. A key sentence is \"the more that a future culling policy deviates from the conditions of the RBCT, the more likely it is that the effects of that policy will differ\". As as I explained before, the two culls are very different.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:13:33.561Z\">at 2.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507eaa62c0e361310bc6d0bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T12:54:07.682Z\">1.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a video produced by the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\">National Trust</a> highlighting its badger vaccination programme at its <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/killerton/\">Killerton estate</a> near Exeter in Devon.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYOOpGAVZaY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bYOOpGAVZaY?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ea67f58f91d7bbadac79f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T12:37:57.522Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One thing in particular that is worth highlighting again from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefraGovUK/with_replies\">Defra's Twitter Q&amp;A</a> is the moment that its chief scientist and chief vet were asked to cite the scientific evidence behind their support of the cull. They pointed to this two-page document (<a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\">pdf</a>) on Defra's website, entitled \"Bovine TB - Key conclusions from the meeting of scientific experts, held at Defra on 4th April 2011\".</p> <p>The document itself points, via the <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111030114052/http://sac.defra.gov.uk/2011/02/17/meeting-17th-february-2011/\">National Archives website</a>, to the minutes (<a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111030114052/http://sac.defra.gov.uk/2011/02/17/meeting-17th-february-2011/\">pdf</a>) of the science advisory council to Defra held in February 2011, which is where the various experts discussed the science of the cull. I thought this bit was fascinating, given what we now know the reaction to be:</p> <blockquote> <p>In discussion the following points were made:-</p> <ul> <li>The decision will clearly be very political.</li> <li>Whatever is done, there should be monitoring of the implementation and measuring of the effect.</li> <li>If the decision is to allow culling, expectations will need to be managed; both because there is likely to be an unrealistic view that culling will make a difference in a short time-scale, and also because other, non-culled areas such as the leading edges/boundaries of the wider areas experiencing disease are likely to be unaffected by any potential cull.</li> <li>The decision and subsequent debate could cause potential reputational damage for Defra and its evidence work; there was a discussion about whether this would be the case and how this might be managed.</li> <li>Ministers will make the final decision, whilst the CSA\u2019s role is to unpack all the different scientific issues.</li> <li>Any decision needs to be open and transparent.</li> <li>There was debate around what would happen if the decision was to allow culling, but then things didn\u2019t improve quickly, or farmers opted out \u2013 what that would mean in terms of legal options. There would need to be robust and credible arrangements for monitoring and enforcement.</li> <li>In managing the communications of any decision, care should be taken to recognise the different arguments; acknowledging scientists have multiple voices, and the asymmetry of their views, but recognising that the Government ultimately has to make a decision.</li> <li>Once any decision is taken, it will be interesting on a social science level to see how farmers and other groups respond.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The National Archive webpage for that meeting also contains a much more detailed document (<a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111030114052/http://sac.defra.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SAC-11-05-Bovine-TB-report.pdf\">pdf</a>) setting out the expert's recommendations to Defra based on the best available scientific evidence at that time.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ea0e458f91d7bbadac79c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T12:14:16.516Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Defra's Twitter Q&amp;A</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Defra has now wrapped up its Twitter session with chief scientist Ian Boyd and chief vet Nigel Gibbens.

It seems to be sympathetic with the dilemma facing politicians wishing to be guided by the best available evidence:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In April 2011, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs convened a panel of scientists to review the evidence and advise on whether a cull could work. The scientists, including several who now actively oppose the government\u2019s policy, gave a qualified \u2018yes\u2019. Culling could reduce bovine TB by perhaps 16% over 9 years, the scientists said, but it would be difficult to know if free shooting would work because it differed from the method tested in the previous trial.</p> <p>Partly on the basis of that analysis, the government seems to think that it\u2019s worth a shot. In combination with other techniques, such as increased monitoring and controls on cattle movements, it hopes that the badger cull can bring bovine TB under control. The politicians accept the modest reduction that scientists say the cull may bring, and have adopted scientific recommendations for how best to implement it, such as using rivers and roads as boundaries for their cull areas and setting a 70% target for the number of badgers killed (although knowing when this target has been reached will be difficult, because there has been no census of badger populations).</p> <p>Scientists protest that this decision is still unscientific, because the methods to be used are too different from those of the original trial and because the evidence suggests that they may not work. There is a chance that the cull will have little impact or could even increase the TB rate if improperly conducted.</p> <p>But it is the government\u2019s job to create and implement policy, not to perform science experiments. Politicians must make decisions every day with imperfect knowledge, knowing that many of those choices may turn out to be ineffective. In this case, they feel a need to do something to bring bovine TB under control \u2014 or at least to be seen to be trying to do so. They also face considerable pressure from unhappy farmers who are being told to implement costly biosecurity measures while badgers run free.</p> <p>Politicians all too frequently ignore scientific evidence, or worse still, distort it for their own purposes. The political debates over genetically modified food in Europe and climate change in the United States in recent years hold many examples of such behaviour. The badger issue is more nuanced. Politicians have understood the evidence, have acknowledged this evidence publicly and have made a policy that partially reflects it. Scientists have every right to disagree with the conclusion, but they should reconsider their criticisms of how it was reached.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It has also published an <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/badger-battle-erupts-in-england-1.11595\">accompanying article</a> which sets out an overview of the scientific investigations - and debate - into the linkages between badgers and bovine tuberculosis.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e825f58f91d7bbadac77d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T10:09:54.794Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/badgers-and-bovineTB\">Wildlife Trusts</a> has also sent over its position on the badger cull. It sees vaccinations as the better way forward:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our involvement with this issue over a long period of time has led us to the conclusion that a sustained programme of vaccination, alongside improved biosecurity measures, improved testing and controls on cattle movement would be the best means of tackling bTB.</p> <p>Recent, large badger culling trials have demonstrated projected efficiency in reducing bTB in cattle of just 12-16% (depending on the model) over nine years, leaving at least 84% of the problem. The Wildlife Trusts believe that culling badgers will also make the bovine TB problem worse by dispersing infected badger populations through the perturbation effect.</p> <p>Since 1998, the Government has invested \u00a330 million in developing TB vaccines for cattle and badgers. Applicants to Natural England for a license to cull badgers are asked to consider badger vaccination as part of their proposals. However, there is no clear badger vaccine strategy for England.</p> <p>In the long term it is clear that a vaccine for cattle could play a part in the solution. EU regulations currently prevent one from being deployed in this country, but the vaccine is available and being tested abroad. While the blockages to the cattle vaccine are resolved, there are immediate solutions available that do not involve culling. Improved biosecurity and cattle controls can reduce the risk of infection and transmission. A badger vaccine is available now and The Wildlife Trusts are leading the way on its deployment. Last year Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust became the first NGO to use it, 11 Wildlife Trusts are now working on such programmes, as are other organisations.</p> <p>The Wildlife Trusts are concerned that the current approach to vaccination is piecemeal. Many landowners interested in deploying the badger vaccine have approached their local Wildlife Trust for advice, as the information is not available centrally.</p> <p>We urge the Government to develop a clear strategy for the deployment of badger vaccination to help increase private deployment of the vaccine. A more coordinated approach to badger vaccination would help to increase use of the vaccine by allowing information to be shared more effectively and could also help to reduce to reduce costs to landowners.</p> <p>It is in nobody\u2019s interest to continue with the controlled shooting policy. The Wildlife Trusts\u2019 President Simon King has urged David Cameron to withdraw the controlled shooting licences, help farmers with improved biosecurity, commit to a badger vaccination strategy and push for changes to allow the cattle vaccine. Only then will we be able to get on top of this disease in an effective way.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It has also produced this video of Dr Gordon McGlone, chief executive of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, explaining how its own badger vaccination programme has fared:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edwRBOfopOM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/edwRBOfopOM?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e806258f91d7bbadac77c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T09:54:47.904Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A spokeswoman at the <a href=\"http://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/campaigns/wildlife/badgers/-/article/Pol_BadgersIntroduction\">RSPCA</a>, which supports in the \"<a href=\"http://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/campaigns/wildlife/stop-the-cull\">Stop the Badger Cull</a>\" campaign, has sent me this reaction:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The RSPCA's campaign against the badger cull is science and ethics-based. Thousands of badgers will be killed, many of them healthy, and yet the science showing a cull will be little help to controlling TB in cattle. In fact the best scientific evidence indicates that a cull could actually make things worse rather than better in some areas through a process called perturbation.</p> <p>We believe that the Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB (ISG), which published its final report in 2007, provides the most robust scientific evidence to date. It was the result of painstaking research over nearly ten years, cost the lives of about 11,000 badgers and cost taxpayers \u00a350 million. It concluded that killing badgers could actually increase the spread of bTB in the area around the cull, making matters worse rather than better \u2013 a process called perturbation. It said, \u201cbadger culling can make no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Although subsequent monitoring of cattle TB levels in the cull areas has shown some ongoing reduction the decrease is still very modest. Over nine years the average reduction has only been about 16%.</p> <p>The RSPCA is deeply sympathetic to farmers struggling to cope with the economic and emotional effects of this disease and agrees that action is needed to combat it \u2013 but does not think action is synonymous with culling.</p> <p>Only a tiny minority of cattle who are killed upon a reaction to the bTB test show any clinical signs of the disease and do not suffer as a result of bTB. In reality vastly more dairy cattle in the UK suffer significant pain and discomfort from lameness and mastitis every year, with large numbers also being culled as a result of these common conditions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e7991c0e361310bc6d095\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T09:32:39.933Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com\">National Farmers Union</a> (NFU) has issued a statement by its president Peter Kendal in response to the news that there will be a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/16/badger-cull-commons-debate\">parliamentary debate</a> about the badger cull on 25 October following the successful e-petition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The NFU will listen with interest as the MPs debate this extremely important and complex issue; one which causes misery to farming families in areas where levels of this disease are persistent and high. We hope it gives everyone opportunity to dispel any myths and misunderstanding surrounding TB, explain the science that backs up the government policy and the need to include badgers as part of the solution to ridding our countryside, both for cattle and for badgers, of bovine TB.</p> <p>The NFU supports this science-led government policy because TB is getting worse not better. 34,000 cattle were culled in Great Britain last year alone because they reacted to a TB test. No cattle vaccine is available, and one with the ability to provide near whole herd immunity is years away. Badger vaccine is being used and will continue to be used as part of the package of measures in this policy to try and halt the spread of TB.

  "<p>Jewelled headbands, bow ties, bedhead hair and plaid shirts are all items familiar to the pop landscape these days. They all also have something else in common: their origins on the set of Gossip Girl.</p> <p>The TV series that began in 2007 starts its sixth and final season tonight, and marks the end of a fashion era. Detailing the lives of Upper East Side rich kids such as Blair Waldorf, Serena van der Woodsen and Chuck Bass (as well as the supposedly poor relations, the Humphreys, hanging out in aircraft hanger lofts in Brooklyn) what this crew wore was of as much interest to viewers as the increasingly silly storylines. With a cast wardrobe that regularly featured Yves Saint Laurent, Lanvin and Moschino, there was also space for newer designers such as Mary Katrantzou to be introduced to a global audience. While young fans of the show couldn't afford these clothes, they clamoured for a little of the look. In 2008, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/fashion/08gossip.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">New York Times hailed it</a> as \"one of the biggest influences on how young women spend\". It even made fashion stars of its actors \u2013 Blake Lively, who plays Serena, <a href=\"http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/pub/21publish/f/fashion/chanel-ad-blake-lively_0.jpg\" title=\"\">featured in Chanel adverts</a>, while Dan Humphrey's Penn Badgley <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dkX0pKFsfw\" title=\"\">recently starred in a video of Alexander Wang</a>.</p> <p>The influence of the Gossip Girl look \u2013 ladylike but cool \u2013 was masterminded by Eric Daman, whose credits include working with Patricia Field on Sex and The City. But the power of that glossy look may be fading. \"It was definitely a pre-crash look, but it's about a mash-up now,\" says Katherine Omerod, senior fashion news and features editor at Grazia. \"The unreality of it doesn't chime with the times.\" Omerod points to the increasing influence of street style, and Malcolm Mackenzie, the editor of teen magazine We Love Pop! thinks this will continue for the next generation. \"Our readers probably do watch it but the fashion is a bit high end,\" he says. \"They're much more likely to be influenced by what their friends wear.\"</p> <p>For fashion insiders, however, its very niche-ness made it a must-watch. Post-Sex and the City, where else would you find a YSL bag before it hit the shops, a cameo from American Vogue's Hamish Bowles or a whole episode centred around a Roger Vivier shoe? Newer teen TV like Fresh Meat and Revenge might be taking its place with a more \"real\" idea of what teenagers wear but, with a bit part from Alexa Chung, the return of Blair's headbands and a character who for works for Women's Wears Daily, this last series of Gossip Girl can still count on an audience of front row names. XOXO, Upper East Siders, fashion will miss you, and your outfits.</p>",

But the Obama they wanted to see \u2013 aggressive, quick to paint Romney as a re-run of the worst of the Bush years, flashes of indignant fury that his administration's credibility is being questioned \u2013 may or may not be who those few remaining undecided voters wanted to see. Obama's performance Tuesday night will do wonders for Democratic morale, but we may not see much shift in the tracking poll numbers.</p> <p>CNN's coverage offers a fascinating live response from undecided voters: judging from the twin lines on the bottom of the screen (one for men, the other for women) both candidates did pretty well and voters didn't like it when either man attacked the other. Of course, candidates in races at all levels wouldn't use negative attacks if they didn't work; one wonders if the diving lines indicated the respondents genuinely didn't like the attacks, or whether they've just been conditioned to know they're <em>supposed</em> to express disapproval of them.</p> <p>The snap polls, too, pointed to an Obama win in the marginal-to-modest range: in CBS News' instant poll, 37% said Obama won the debate, 30% said Romney, and 33% said it was a tie. Interestingly, 65% said Romney won on the issue of economy, compared to 34% who said Obama. In CNN's poll of registered voters who watched the debate, 46% said Obama won the debate, 39% said Romney won the debate.</p> <p>Those results indicate it wasn't a bad night for Mitt Romney, and there was little chance he would equal the drubbing he dealt the president in the first debate. But a little more than an hour into the debate, he completely mishandled one of the most potent issues \u2013 how the administration characterized the attack on our diplomats in Benghazi, Libya. He seemed to know it, as his energy slid for the remainder of the debate.</p> <p>Between the questioners at the debate and Frank Luntz's focus group on Fox News, one of the lessons of the night is that very few people who claim to be undecided are genuinely undecided. The early questioner who mentioned that Energy Secretary Steven Chu has said that the overall goal of the nation's energy policy is not to bring down the prices of gas \u2013 no chance he's genuinely undecided. (<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/10/09/dems_don_t_want_lower_gas_prices\">Conservative radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh talked about the issue</a> and mentioned Chu last week.) One woman who asked the candidates about unequal pay for women \u2013 an easy lay-up for Obama to mention the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The majority of Luntz's focus group of allegedly undecided voters loathed Obama's performance, and during a furious denunciation of Obama's presidency, one panelist let slip the term \"bullshitting\" on the air. Are we to believe that guy really doesn't know who he's going to vote for in November?</p> <p>The \"town hall\" debate format has been around for 20 years, and it may be time to consider retiring it at the presidential level. The questioners tend to freeze under the lights; almost all of the queries are variations of \"what can you do for me?\"; the candidates have been conditioned to repeat the questioner's name and emote sympathy&#xa0; to the point of overacting; and way too much attention is paid to the candidates' body language as they get up and down off those high stools.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review and writes the Campaign Spot blog</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Romney's reliance on tired, substance-less talking points was startling'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925060\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, that was unexpected.</p> <p>Going into last night's second presidential debate I fully expected Barack Obama to do better than he did in the first debate in Denver. But what was so surprising was not just how good Obama was (and he was quite good), but how bad Mitt Romney was.</p> <p>It all started with the first question, posed by an undecided college student concerned about his job prospects after graduation. It was a softball, one that a candidate with an even the modicum of an economic plan could knock out of the park.</p> <p>And Romney whiffed on it \u2013 serving up meaningless platitudes like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There was not a single policy offered to support Romney's confidence. For a candidate whose entire candidacy is premised on the notion that he will fix the economy and create jobs, it was a glaring moment. It was like this the entire evening: Romney's lack of specificity and his reliance on tired, substance-less talking points was startling.</p> <p>For example, when asked how he would ensure women received equal pay in the workforce, Romney bragged about hiring women for his administration when he was governor of Massachusetts. It was an answer that reeked of tokenism. On taxes, he continued to offer vagueness about how he'll pay for his 20% across-the-board tax cut. And bizarrely, he cued up Obama to reference his 47% comment by saying he wanted to be president of 100% of Americans. It was like he handed the president the piece of two-by-four with which to hit him.</p> <p>But his worst moment came during a question on Libya when Romney claimed that the president had never called the recent assassination of the US ambassador in Benghazi \"act of terror\". Obama had, in fact, done just that \u2013 a point that moderator, Candy Crowley pointed out, embarrassingly for Romney. But what I found most striking about that particular exchange was what came right before \u2013 President Obama's initial response to Romney:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime. And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.</p> <p>\"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team, would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That's not what we do. That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as commander-in-chief.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This was a very different Obama than the one we saw in Denver \u2013 focused, passionate (but not strident), aggressive (but not obnoxious). On virtually every answer, Obama did exactly what he didn't do in Denver: he defended his record and then opened up a tough line of attack against his opponent. There was nothing more important for Obama to do last night than offer voters a clear contrast between the two candidates. On nearly every question, Obama did just that.</p> <p>It was a strong performance from a candidate whose back was against the wall; but it was one that's effectiveness was matched only by the failure of his opponent.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Guardian and Observer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a>: 'The highlight was Obama's full-throated defense of reproductive rights'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There were flashier moments in the debate \u2013 the Libya fact-check, the oil permits body-space infringement \u2013 but, for me, the highlight of the debate was President Obama's full-throated defense of the idea that reproductive rights \"are not just women's issues, these are family issues, they are economic issues.\" Up until now, even the Obama campaign has been leaning on the \"war on women\" meme as something that is somehow separate from the economy, that \"social issues\" are a kind of marginal voter-persuasion issue \u2013 on par with \"who you would rather have a beer with?\"</p> <p>I've argued before that almost every so-called social issue is wrapped up in economics (marriage equality and social stability help communities thrive, for instance), but contraception has been essential to women's <em>economic</em> equality for, well, probably ever. But <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/26/birth-control-access-womens-wages_n_1380250.html?ref=politics&amp;ir=Politics\">studies of recent history</a> are more concrete:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"About one-third of women's wage gains throughout the 1990s can be attributed to changing laws in the 1960s and 70s that lowered the age at which women could legally access the pill.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not sure if this means that <em>voters</em> will make the connection the president did \u2013 that Romney's policies would potentially undo that progress \u2013 but I'm grateful that at least one of the men on that stage understands what I think most women intuitively do: that when we talk about having control over our bodies, we're also talking about having control over our lives.</p> <p>Also, I've never been in a binder, but I am pretty sure I'd rather be able to sue for equal pay.</p> <p><em>Ana Marie Cox is the Guardian's senior US political columnist</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'The most disastrous exchange for Romney concerned Libya'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925062\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Whatever else can be said, this was a much more spirited Barack Obama in the second debate. The president was much more willing to challenge Mitt Romney on his facts, on his record, and on his career in business.</p> <p>We heard about Bain, the 47%, and outsourcing of US jobs to China. Obama even unfavorably compared Romney to George W Bush, the president responsible for the next highest spending binge.</p> <p>But Romney remained spirited as well. He did not simply allow Candy Crowley to steamroll him and give the president favorable treatment. He contested Obama's most politically damaging claims.</p> <p>Romney was particularly effective in advertising the undeniable distance between the president's 2008 campaign promises and the rather less impressive 2012 record. Obama still was shy on details of what he would do in a second term, aside from continuing to present mediocrity as better than what a Republican would do in office.</p> <p>Yet the most disastrous exchange for Romney concerned Libya, where he concerned himself more with talking points and chest-beating than actual problems with Obama's interventionist approach. Indeed, Obama undermined Romney by unequivocally claiming full responsibility, rather than blaming Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>If that is any indication of how the third and final debate, focusing on foreign policy, will go, then Romney \u2013 the candidate who has appeared to commit himself to arming Syrian rebels, a more hawkish stance toward Iran, and disapproving of the the largely Iraqi-mandate withdrawal from Iraq\u2013 is in serious trouble.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Obama was testy, whiny, overly aggressive'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925063\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The question leading up to the second debate between Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama was \"which Obama will show up tonight?\"</p> <p>The abysmal performance by Obama in the first debate was not something the president's supporters wanted to see repeated. Mitt Romney needed to match his performance from the first debate. Barack Obama needed to do significantly better than he did in the first debate.</p> <p>Both men achieved those objectives. Romney reminded voters of the poor Obama record of these past four years, and was armed with facts, while Obama claimed Romney was not telling the truth, yet did not seem equipped to articulate just where Romney was incorrect.</p> <p>While Obama at least seemed present and possessing a pulse in the second debate, he was testy, whiny, overly aggressive, and even asked for \u2013 and received \u2013 a highly inappropriate level of help and support from the debate moderator. Mitt Romney was presidential, just as he was in the first debate. He had command of the facts, but was repeatedly interrupted by Obama and the moderator.</p> <p>Obama claimed Mitt Romney was untruthful, but could not be not specific. However, Romney clearly and correctly stated that President Obama was, indeed, untruthful in his claims that federal oil production was up. Obama denied it, and the moderator did not step in to call him on it.</p> <p>Obama (and the moderator) also claimed he called the 11 September assassination attack in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans a \"terrorist attack\" the following day in a Rose Garden speech. The transcript does not reveal that specifically, but in the days that followed, President Obama on numerous occasions claimed the attack was due to a video that was deemed insulting to Islam. He has since backed away from those comments and is now denying he made them, as part of his ever-shifting statements on Benghazi. The debate moderator let him get away with that one, too.</p> <p>While Obama likely succeeded in helping to clean up the mess he'd made with his disappointed base, Mitt Romney did not lose anything, and maintains the momentum from the first debate.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nancy-goldstein\">Nancy Goldstein</a>: 'The relaxed, engaging Professor Obama connected the dots'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925064\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/6/8/1307540115667/nancygoldstein_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Goldstein\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mitt Romney isn't entirely to blame for last night's resurgence by Barack Obama. OK, so he was callow and creepy, but no more than usual (it's hard to shake the feeling that both he and Ryan were assembled in a basement). The bottom line is that Obama had a Big Night, one where he hit all his shots.</p> <p>Gone was the dour and pedantic grumpster that sleepwalked through debate one. When a young woman asked how his administration intends to address inequalities in the workplace, particularly around pay, it was the relaxed, engaging Professor Obama who connected the dots, moving easily from mentioning the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act his administration passed in 2009, to making the case that equal pay for equal work has moved from being a \"women's\" or \"family\" issue, to become a key issue for the middle class, period.</p> <p>Romney, who punted when asked earlier this year whether he supported the Ledbetter Act, could only squirm. Worse yet, his longwinded non-response was: a) a <a href=\"http://elections.americablog.com/2012/10/romneys-binder-full-of-women-story-was-a-lie.html\">lie</a>, and b) included the \"whole binders full of women\" comment that has, at last count, inspired over a dozen social media equivalents of cover bands including Tumblr accounts, Facebook pages,websites, and several Twitter feeds, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romneys_Binder\">Romneys_Binder</a> leading the pack at 14,000+ followers.</p> <p>Like all great competitors, last night's Obama read the opposition well and created his own shot. While Romney tried to recover his Just for Men cool after flubbing the Ledbetter question, the president linked women's success in the workplace to healthcare; healthcare to contraception; and contraception (as well as mammograms and screenings for cervical cancer) to Planned Parenthood, which he supports and Romney actively wants to defund. Obama reminded his audience that while his healthcare plan mandates free contraception as part of standard insurance, Romney supports <a href=\"http://www.blogforchoice.com/archives/2012/03/romney-bosses-s.html\">repealing that provision through the Blunt amendment</a>.</p> <p>Obama's move was the debate equivalent of driving past an opponent to the basket, then dunking on him.

  "<p>For anyone diagnosed with cancer, anything but uplifting good news is frightening. And this week's news is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/breast-cancer-cancer\" title=\"\">breast cancer is set to increase exponentially</a>, leaving health services unable to cope. Where does that leave any of us except more frightened?</p> <p>Two things come to mind. The first is that, if a disease is on the increase, so should programmes to treat it be on the increase. The solution is a thought I return to time and again. What is our money spent on? It's tempting to turn to figures for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/trident-nuclear-missiles-savings\" title=\"\">Trident</a>, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/07/usa.iraq\" title=\"\">defence costs squandered in wars started on the basis of lies</a>, for PFI projects that line the pockets of shareholders and executives and leave the taxpayer to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/05/pfi-cost-300bn\" title=\"\">pick up the bill </a>over a period of something like 30 years. Add to the list at your leisure, it is very long. And I think not only of people diagnosed with breast cancer, or any cancer, but of the amazing nurses, the lab technicians, the overworked junior doctors, the hospital cleaners, the GPs, the people who hold our lives in their hands, many of them grotesquely underpaid and overworked, doing their best against an ever-more straitened NHS, to promote health and save lives.</p> <p>The second is that this news might make it much worse for anyone recently diagnosed and finding herself in the waiting rooms in cancer clinics and surgeries, fearing that there won't be enough time for anyone to talk to them, to work out the complexities, to steer them through the choices they might have to make, let alone the fear that funds won't cover the best treatment. Lots of us go to the internet, scanning every website for advice, for help, for reading lists. We hope to find ways to preserve our health and our life. It's a minefield. Bad news like this has something of the dog racing into the flock of birds, sending them whirling in a panic from the danger among them. How to save oneself?</p> <p>And as people recently diagnosed try to get to grips with the cancer landscape by foraging for information online, they are bewildered by the myriad sites offering such varied advice that it's hard to know what to choose or where to go or who to speak to. When it happened to me eight years ago, I did this, and applied as cool a logic to it all as I could muster. I spent money on complementary treatments that many others can't afford. I bought books, made a study of it. I found that a comfort. But all of that costs money and millions don't have the resources. And that's not right either. Then there was the conflicting advice \u2013 eat this not that, do this not that, on and on it goes so that if you aren't as lucky as I have been so far, you might think you somehow didn't get it right. It shouldn't be like that. The diagnosis comes at you like a meteor hitting your core of gravity, and it is never your fault, no matter what you do or don't do, did or didn't do.</p> <p>We are told that one in 3 of us will get cancer at some point in our lives. Breast cancer gets a lot of publicity but there are many cancers and millions of people dealing with the disease. This current scare comes down to resources, to planning and to a human approach to crisis. If we don't establish a better way of distributing wealth, there will be an ever-decreasing budget to pay for the things we value most as part of our common humanity \u2013 our education, our health, our environment \u2013 all of which are treated like beggars at the gate. And while the money and resources are at the heart of what to do about this scare, what is also paramount is having the imagination, the vision \u2013 or actually just the common sense and generosity of spirit \u2013 to recognise that planning begins in the heart as well as the columns of fiscal calculation where life's worth is measured. Spend our money on promoting health, education \u2013 life \u2013 and not on destruction and the furthering of wealth for a few.</p> <p>And so I imagine a different kind of world in which when there is news like this, the headlines aren't predicated on panic and horror but on what will be done to make sure the care is up to date, adequate, accessible, in tune with the increase in prevalence and, if need be, trashing those insanely expensive things we don't need, to pay for the things we do need.</p>",
  "<p>Unilever and Lifebuoy are to bring hygiene education to the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.millenniumvillages.org/\" title=\"\">Millennium Villages</a>, an Earth Institute project that works with nearly 500,000 people in rural villages across 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>The partnership, announced in New York on 15 October, aims to reduce diarrhoeal diseases, promote gender equality, increase school attendance and encourage governments to integrate handwashing with soap into national health and education policy frameworks. The partnership will be focusing on villages in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda.</p> <p>Paul Polman, Unilever CEO said: \"The big issues the world is facing require new approaches, new business models and new partnerships. Responsible businesses must take a more active leadership role. The memorandum of understanding with the Earth Institute partnering Lifebuoy with the Millennium Villages Project, is one such example where working together will enhance our expertise of addressing hygiene in deep rural Africa and enable us to develop more effective solutions to reduce child mortality.\"</p> <p>Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University said: \"Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the two leading causes of under five deaths, accounting for around 30% of children's deaths globally \u2013 more than two million lives lost each year. More than 80% of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Addressing these challenges through improved hygiene is a vital and effective step towards saving lives and achieving the global Millennium Development Goal to reduce the child mortality rate by two-thirds by 2015.\"</p> <p>The partnership supports Unilever's sustainable living plan goal to help more than one billion people take action to improve their health and well-being. Over the past two years, Unilever has successfully changed the handwashing behaviour of 50 million people in Africa and South-Asia, through its soap brand Lifebuoy and partnerships with Population Services International (PSI) and UNICEF established through the Unilever Foundation.</p> <p><em>Copy on this page is provided by Unilever, supporter of the </em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-living\" title=\"\"><em>sustainable living hub</em></a></p>",

The Foreign Office has also urged the Scottish government to provide evidence for its \u201cclaims about the status of an independent Scotland, including its membership of international bodies\u201d such as the European Union, the United Nations, Nato, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In a submission to the Commons foreign affairs committee released today, the Foreign Office also said that independence would create \u201ca UK land border\u201d and \u201charm the Scottish economy\u201d by withdrawing Scotland from the UK\u2019s 14,000 treaties and global network of foreign investors.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Labour has said that David Cameron\u2019s decision to force energy companies to offer customers the lowest tariffs will prove ineffective.</strong> Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, put out this statement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Energy bills have gone up by more than \u00a3200 since this Tory-led government came to power. The government\u2019s last-minute decision to force energy companies to put customers on the cheapest tariff, after most energy companies have already announced price hikes, is an admission that their \u2018do nothing\u2019 energy policy over the last two years has failed.</p> <p>The cheapest deal in an uncompetitive market will still not be a good deal for the public unless we completely overhaul our energy market to break the dominance of the big six energy companies and create a tough new watchdog with powers to force energy companies to pass on price cuts.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, has written to David Cameron urging him to disclose all his communications with Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson to the Leveson inquiry.</strong> (See <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/17/pmqs-cameron-miliband-live-blog#block-507eb48758f91d7bbadac7a9\">2.37am.)</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Lord Carlile, the government\u2019s former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, has told a parliamentary committee that the abolition of control orders has increased the risk from terrorism.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The threat from terrorism, particularly violent Islamism, is roughly the same as it was five years ago. The risk is much more difficult to assess. I believe that the risk is somewhat increased, and I don\u2019t want to exaggerate this, but somewhat increased by the absence of the ability readily to relocate a person, because the freedom of movement of a person enables them to move around the country and meet and communicate with a wider range of people. If somebody is a motivator of violent Islamists then their freedom to move around the country may allow them to motivate more than would otherwise be the case.</p> </blockquote> <p>Deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Osborne, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, told the same committee that control orders were a \u201cvery cost-effective way\u201d of dealing with terrorist suspects. Terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims), the alternative measures introduced by the government, were more expensive, he said.</p> <p>That's all from me for today.</p> <p>I won't be blogging tomorrow.

Alan Johnson demonstrated that whatever a politician\u2019s attributes, those who repeatedly suggest that they\u2019d have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the top job rarely get there. George Osborne\u2019s fate appears tied to that of Mr Cameron. Whether or not his private life could withstand the scrutiny of the Number Ten goldfish bowl, Boris Johnson pledged last week not to return to the Commons until after his second term as mayor ends in 2016. If Mr Cameron fails to win a majority in 2015, the Tory party may need a new leader before then. William Hague, the traditional \u2018if Dave falls under a bus\u2019 candidate, is unlikely to fancy a second stint as leader of the opposition in such circumstances.</p> <p>Mrs May could count on the support this time on a good number of the new Tory women, who think Labour\u2019s next leader is likely to be of the fairer sex and the future at Westminster is female.

This goes further than Labour, which has said that it would force energy customers to offer the lowest tariffs to the over-75s, although Labour has also called for Ofgem to be replaced with a more powerful regulator that would force prices down. As my colleagues Damian Carrington and Juliette Jowit report, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/energy-policy-coalition-green-agenda\">later today Cameron and other ministers will be holding a summit on energy policy.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street has said that Cameron was \u201cappalled\u201d by the racist abuse directed at England players during the Under-21 team\u2019s match against Serbia last night.</strong> A Number 10 spokesman said: \u201cHe was appalled by the scenes that we have seen in Serbia. We are determined to stamp out racism internationally and at home and we are giving our full backing to the FA\u2019s complaint on this issue. Clearly it is for Uefa to investigate this issue but we would expect tough sanctions. If we are going to stamp out racism from football, then it is no good giving derisory fines, as have been handed out in the past.

These changes are being made on the basis of his own personal prejudices rather than developing a curriculum which is fit for children and young people in the 21st century.\u201d And Nansi Ellis, head of education policy and research, at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: \u201cIt\u2019s right that the secretary of state is considering the future of assessment for young people. However, he shows contempt for teachers, pupils and parents by once again discussing this with journalists before talking to those who will be affected by it, or those with the expertise to ensure a changed system works.

Here is what it has filed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron announced today that energy firms will be forced to give customers the cheapest available tariff under new legislation. <br>Amid mounting concern about rocketing fuel bills, the prime minister signalled plans to introduce new laws to tackle the often-confusing array of tariffs. <br>\"I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers,\" he told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions. <br>His intervention follows a string of above-inflation price hikes by major energy companies in recent days.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ed Miliband said that Labour would force energy companies to offer the lowest tariffs to over-75s, but Cameron seems to be going further. </p> <p>I'll post more on this later.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e9c7558f91d7bbadac79b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:54:29.682Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>PMQs Verdict:</strong> David Cameron has said that Andrew Mitchell's behaviour was indefensible and - not surprisingly - he found it impossible to defend at PMQs. That's why Ed Miliband had the upper hand. The BBC has just pointed out that he slipped in his final question, saying that people were losing their jobs (when unemployment is going down - although technically there will still be some people losing their jobs), but that does not matter particularly, because his best soundbite (the double standards one, about the Carlton Club and a night in the cells) quite easily trumps Cameron's best soundbite (a lame one about Labour not having anything to say on the economy).</p> <p>That said, the exchanges were not that damaging to Cameron, and there was nothing in what he said, or in the way Tory MPs reacted, to suggest that Mitchell will have to resign. If anything, judging from the immediate reaction, he may well have passed the moment of most danger.</p> <p>(A conspiracy theorist might point out that this is exactly what Milband wants. Strategically, it is far more useful to Labour to have Mitchell in the cabinet, as a long-term reminder of Tory attitudes to public sector workers, than it would be to have Mitchell resign this week. But does that mean Miliband was somehow \"holding back\"? I doubt it. At PMQs it is hard to calibrate your performance with that degree of precision.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e98c358f91d7bbadac799\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:38:43.377Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cameron says recent figures from the IMF show that there was a 5% structural deficit in 2007.

But frankly, when the welfare bill is spiralling by over \u00a324 billion over this parliament, ministers are wrong to be breaking out the bunting. <br>There are now red flashing lights warning that Britain is becoming a very divided country. <br>Long-term unemployment has risen yet again. The number of young people out of work and claiming benefits for more than a year went up yet again, and three-quarters of Britain has higher unemployment than at the election. More than a third of people out of work have been jobless for more than a year in the clearest sign yet that the Work programme is not doing the job. <br>People in jobs are increasingly having to work part-time or on temporary contracts. There are 1.4 million people who are forced to work part time because they cannot find a full time job. <br>I\u2019m afraid the story is very simple. Those out of jobs are increasingly shut out. Those in jobs are increasingly insecure.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Brendan Barber</strong>, the TUC general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These may be the best figures for some time, but we still need to do much, much better. There are still hundreds of thousands of young people without work, over a million people working part-time who want full time-jobs, and wages are still trailing below inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>David Kern</strong>, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest job market figures are encouraging and support our assessment that the UK economy has returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The level of employment is at a record high, and the fall in the level of inactivity is a positive development, signalling that people are returning to the workforce.</p> <p>The strong trend in the labour market raises questions about the accuracy of GDP figures, which are still showing three consecutive declines over the period to the second quarter of 2012.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That there is mass unemployment, in the sixth year of recession, shows that the Tories and Liberals are following the wrong economic policies.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Dave Prentis</strong>, the Unison general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any fall in unemployment has to be welcome, but there is no room for complacency around these figures. There are still 2.53 million people out of work and a near-record 1.4 million people who are being forced into part-time work when they need the income from a full-time job.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hidden behind the statistics is the stubborn underlying problem of the long-term unemployed, whether it is the 16-to-24 year olds or other groups seeking work. It is those areas that ministers need to concentrate on as a matter of urgency.<br>&#xa0;<br>The economy overall is flatlining, household incomes are being squeezed and demand has been sucked out of the economy.<br>&#xa0;<br>The UK is still in recession, so there is nothing for the government to crow about.</p> <p>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reports that up to 66 people are chasing every retail job and last week when car giant, JLR offered 1,200 jobs, 20,000 people went for them \u2013 this means that there is hardly a jobs\u2019 Eldorado out there.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Chris Goulden</strong> from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While any fall in unemployment is welcome, the main problem for&#xa0;young people looking for work is fundamental \u2013 a major shortage of jobs. We need to ratchet up the quality of supply and demand together in order to have any impact on poverty.</p> <p>Today\u2019s unemployment figures show that 957,000 16\u201324 year olds are unemployed (not including those in full-time education). Despite fluctuations, this remains a long-term high, although \u2013 as cannot be repeated enough \u2013 the upward trend started long before the current recession, as far back as 2004.</p> <p>To get a job in these conditions, young people have to apply quickly and consistently to stand any chance. Even if they do hear back, then chances are that the job will be poorly paid and non-standard hours.</p> <p>Our research, <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/disadvantaged-young-people-work\">published today</a>, shows looking for work for young people is a job in itself. It\u2019s time to increase skills and the number of decent jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Tony Dolphin</strong>, chief economist at the IPPR</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s figures are good news. They show further welcome falls in unemployment, which is good news especially for young people. There has clearly been an Olympic effect. Almost half of the rise in employment across England has been in London and a quarter of new jobs are temporary.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Matthew Oakley</strong>, head of economics and social policy at the Policy Exchange thinktank</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are an encouraging set of figures that emphasise the flexibility of the UK labour market. But we mustn\u2019t be complacent. Most of these new jobs are part-time or temporary and there is still an underlying problem that many people leaving jobseeker's allowance end up back on the dole within a year. To tackle this we must ensure that people moving off JSA think about increasing their hours, taking on more work and considering future jobs. Currently just one in ten part-time workers is looking for another job.</p> <p>Providing better support to claimants by reforming the way jobcentres are incentivised to get people into full time work is vital. So is the need to increase conditions on people - including those in part time and temporary work \u2013 to do all they possibly can to find full time employment and move off benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Walker</strong>, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is good news that unemployment continues to fall, but the number of people that have been out of work for more than a year is growing. More than 45,000 new jobs could be created if the government were to extend the National Insurance contributions holiday and this would go a long way to helping those people find work.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Andrew Sissons</strong>, a researcher at The Work Foundation, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strong job growth seen over the last year is finally beginning to translate into falling unemployment, especially among young people. While a drop in unemployment of 50,000 is relatively modest, the direction of travel is all important. If the economy keeps creating jobs at its current rate, we should begin to see more substantial falls in unemployment, potentially bringing it back under 2.5 million in the coming months.</p> <p>&#xa0;It is particularly encouraging to see youth unemployment falling, with an extra 50,000 young people moving into work, bringing the total back under one million. This suggests that the strength of the labour market is finally beginning to benefit younger workers. However, unemployment and inactivity among young people remains dangerously high, and more work is needed to sustain this trend.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T10:24:05.146Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507e7e7cc0e361310bc6d098\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T09:46:36.941Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today's Guardian politics stories <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/all\">here</a>.

So far, much of the party seems unaware of what\u2019s coming. Blairites, who mistakenly took the leader\u2019s conference speech as a shift to the centre, and Old Labourites, who wrongly detected a swerve to the Left, heard only what they wished to hear ...</p> <p>On welfare, the logic of one nationism would seem to favour a contributory system in which those who pay their dues get the most back. The very fairness of such measures would, some argue, engender compassion. As others protest that such a change would imperil the poorest, a row simmers within the party. On crime, the common good is unlikely to be best served by a Tory crackdown that will drain the public purse, hamper rehabilitation and so make citizens less safe. Will Mr Miliband dare say so?</p> <p>On the clearest part of his prospectus \u2013 muscling in on the conservatism abandoned by the Tories \u2013 Mr Miliband will promise, like a one-man Unesco, to preserve Britain\u2019s heritage and institutions. The danger is that pledges to conserve the NHS may backfire once it becomes clear that destruction, including hospital closures, is the only realistic route to salvation.</p> <p>The sole certainty is that Labour has not got the leader it expected. Blairites wanted a continuity regime, the Left expected reassurance, and the unions hoped for a poodle. All those comfort zones will be vaporised in the white heat of Mr Miliband\u2019s one-nation furnace. Quite what will emerge from the fireball is unclear, but there is no doubting the scope of his ambition.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/10/eds-going-to-tough-with-the-party-how-exactly/\">Mark Ferguson has responded with a post at LabourList, saying that he is sceptical about whether Miliband\u2019s proposals really will upset his party as much as Riddell suggests.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3570338.ece\">\u2022 Alastair Campbell in the Times says politicians must understand the power of social media.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The speed of change is breathtaking. Facebook, founded in 2004, recently recorded its one billionth devotee. YouTube, created in 2005, now has more videos uploaded in one month than three US TV networks created in 60 years.

The number of British people on Twitter \u2014 10 million \u2014 has overtaken the number buying a daily newspaper ...</p> <p>In an era when people believe politicians and journalists less than they used to, they still believe each other.

Liberal democracies can only exist with informed citizens. This is an axiom but one that requires repetition.

Right across the world, the transparency agenda will see journalists as well as citizens gaining access to unprecedented amounts of data. The media has a unique role. Journalists need to engage with this data to expose waste, incompetence and corruption wherever they see it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m issuing a call to arms to the media the world over to hold the feet of government officials and ministers like me to the fire.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/loans/9613729/Loan-firms-wonga-buys-the-ears-of-ministers.html\">\u2022 Tim Ross and Rowena Mason in the Daily Telegraph say Conservative ministers agreed to hold meetings with Wonga in return for payments to the party.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The meetings took place at the Tory Party conference last week despite the new party chairman, Grant Shapps, previously describing the activities of some payday lenders as \u201cobscene\u201d.</p> <p>A Cabinet source privately admitted that \u201cmoneymaking\u201d was a key goal of this year\u2019s conference, with companies paying thousands for exhibition stands and events.

He said that \u201ctransitional protection\u201d, which would be maintained \u201cindefinitely on a cash basis\u201d, would ensure that disabled people did not lose money. And he said they would actually benefit from universal credit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s a confusion going on there between what\u2019s happening to disability living allowance and what\u2019s happening to universal credit. The point about universal credit is that it\u2019s massively helpful to people who have got disabilities in the workplace, because it allows them to take flexible jobs, there\u2019s not the tyranny of the 16-hour rule, they don\u2019t have to worry about fluctuating conditions, they will enjoy much more generous disregards. So, the package as a whole is one of the best things possible for people with disabilities.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve taken the quotes from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p>There are two main items on the agenda for today.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Unemployment figures are published.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> David Cameron and Ed Miliband clash at PMQs.</p> <p>As usual, I'll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.

  "<p>Have you ever noticed that wherever you are in the world, every telephone keypad looks the same? Or wondered why satellites don't crash into each other? Or why you dial 64 to reach New Zealand, but 65 for Singapore? These are some of the mundane but essential logistical achievements of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.itu.int%2Fen%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkPS1MSVqJVle3MAJ6siz-iQ55Bw\" title=\"\">International Telecommunication Union</a>, a specialist UN agency that dates back to 1865.</p> <p>Yet as it gears up for its first global conference in 14 years, the ITU has found itself under unprecedented attack. The first assailant is the powerful US technology lobby. Companies, including Google, are claiming that new ITU proposals would mean internet companies paying hefty fees to local telecoms companies, reigniting historic tensions between US internet giants and incumbent telecoms firms across the world.</p> <p>But that's not the only battle that will be played out this December when the ITU's 193 member states gather in Dubai. Russia and China have been explicit in their goal of taking control of the internet away from the US, while developing countries feel the western technology hegemony is limiting their economic opportunities. With the world's internet population predicted to reach 3.4 billion by 2016, there is everything to play for.</p> <p>The ITU has not helped its case. Suspected by some critics of encouraging the controversial proposals, comments by the eloquent secretary general Dr Hamadoun Tour\u00e9 seem designed to antagonise the US. He told <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/internet-regulation-war-sopa-pipa-defcon-hacking\" title=\"\">Vanity Fair</a> earlier this year: \"When an invention becomes used by billions across the world, it no longer remains the sole property of one nation, however powerful that nation might be. There should be a mechanism where many countries have an opportunity to have a say.\"</p> <p>The reaction to some of these new proposals, or <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/oth/T3F01000001\" title=\"\">ITRs</a>, has been a comprehensive, well-organised and <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/fmr-us-ambassador-david-gross-explains-un-takeover-of-the-internet/\" title=\"\">well-funded campaign</a> by a cabal of <a href=\"http://www.wileyrein.com/professionals.cfm?sp=bio&amp;id=625\" title=\"\">powerful American corporates</a> \u2013 including Google, Microsoft, Cisco, AT&amp;T and Comcast. Much of the resulting media coverage of the ITU, particularly in the US, has ranged from dismissive to aggressive, labelling the low-profile union <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/08/the_united_nations_and_the_internet_it_s_complicated\" title=\"\">obscure</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121004/02262820588/why-you-should-be-worried-about-itus-bizarre-claim-to-have-mandate-over-internet-security.shtml\" title=\"\">irrelevant</a> and exploiting American animosity for the UN.</p> <h2>Expanding profile</h2> <p>Much of the damning coverage has focused on proposed changes to the wording of several ITRs that appear to attempt to expand ITU's remit from telecoms to the internet. Given that the organisation began by co-ordinating telegraph communications and expanded to telephones, mobiles and data, it isn't unreasonable that its members might seek to expand its remit accordingly.</p> <p>But its members also include 700 private-sector organisations, and one of those, the European Telecommunications Network Operators (<a href=\"http://www.etno.eu/\" title=\"\">ETNO</a>), has caused the most contention among the US tech lobby by pushing for a <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57518427-38/eu-telcos-defend-un-internet-takeover-plans/\" title=\"\">proposal</a> that would effectively allow telcos to <a href=\"http://www.internetgovernance.org/2012/06/09/threat-analysis-of-wcit-part-3-charging-you-charging-me/\" title=\"\">charge companies</a> for delivering their content. \"What we want is a pricing model that ensures the revenue of operators and allows content providers to better compete in the market,\" ETNO's chairman Luigi Gambardella told La Repubblica this month. For a player like Google or anybody else delivering media over the net, that could prove very expensive.</p> <p>Google's chief internet evangelist <a href=\"http://research.google.com/pubs/author32412.html\" title=\"\">Vint Cerf</a> has been one of the big guns rolled out to lobby against the proposed regulations, describing the proposal to return to the \"sender pays\" principle as regressive. He claims that model had failed in the telephone world, particularly in developing countries where paying telcos high settlement rates had supposedly funded infrastructure, but instead ended up in the pockets of government treasuries or officials. \"It's the absolute antithesis of the internet where the participating parties on the edge of the network pay for access to it,\" he said. \"Freedom to innovate on the network has been largely a consequence of its economic model and its openness.\"</p> <p>The ad-hoc coalition lobbying against ITU proposals is made up of Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Comcast and AT&amp;T and 10 others, and is chaired by ambassador <a href=\"http://www.wileyrein.com/professionals.cfm?sp=bio&amp;id=625\" title=\"\">David Gross</a>, a lawyer, past chair of several delegations to the ITU, and former government international communications policy coordinator. He represented the group when it testified at a congressional hearing in May. \"[The sender pays proposal] is asking for trouble because it's suggesting the model, a model that is clearly working, would need to be revised for no apparent, real reason, other than the economic benefit of a few carriers,\" he told <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/fmr-us-ambassador-david-gross-explains-un-takeover-of-the-internet/\" title=\"\">Digital Trends</a> in August. \"I will quickly add that my coalition has major carriers, like AT&amp;T and Verizon, and they also think that this is the wrong way to go.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397915180\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350473525589/world-on-iphone-008.jpg\" alt=\"world on iphone\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global pressure: the ITU faces attacks from tech giants and hostile governments.

But make no mistake \u2013 this is absolutely business as usual for a company worth <a href=\"http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG\" title=\"\">$243bn</a> (\u00a3150bn) because the sender pays principle \u2013 which is said to be <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/261863-us-ambassador-warns-internet-fee-proposal-gaining-momentum-abroad\" title=\"\">gaining traction</a> among African and Arab delegations \u2013 would be catastrophic for its business, effectively taxing every interaction with its 700 million or so daily userbase.</p> <p>Add to that the threat posed to Google's income by Facebook's monopoly of social data and related advertising and the trend for \"privatised\" data inside mobile apps, and suddenly Google's mission to \"index the world's data\" seems rather more precarious. No wonder Google has made a campaign for the open web such a priority. This is what Google's chief legal officer, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/about/company/facts/management/\" title=\"\">David Drummond</a>, describes as a \"happy coincidence\". \"We are not ashamed,\" he says, \"to say the open web is good for the world, and happens to create good opportunities for business\".</p> <p>On the other hand, administration and organisation of the internet has been dominated by the US since Arpanet, the precursor to the modern internet, was established between four US universities in 1969, and a handful of US-controlled authorities followed. The biggest point of contention is <a href=\"http://www.icann.org/\" title=\"\">Icann</a>, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees management of internet address. Icann has responded to global pressure by internationalising its management board, though it is still a California-based non-profit. The US has, however, fiercely defended the root zone, the core domain name and numbering system run by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (Iana) \u2013 which remains on contract to the US Department of Commerce managed by Icann. On this, they will go down fighting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397915181\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/2/1343919312614/Internet-map-008.jpg\" alt=\"Internet map\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Circles of influence: tech giants fear hefty fees to telecoms companies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Challenging western dominance</h2> <p>Western dominance is the one of the biggest challenges for developing nations, says <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthigf.org/partners/steering-committee-profiles/alice-munyua/\" title=\"\">Alice Munyua</a>, a researcher and policy development expert, representing Kenya and Africa on forums such as Icann. \"It is a big concern for African governments and stakeholders, and not just because of how the internet is governed, but how it is developed from a commercial and technical perspective,\" she said. \"There is a feeling that we are not able to participate or contribute effectively because of the lack of capacity, skills and resources, so there's a digital divide in terms of access, but also in appropriating the internet for our own development.\"</p> <p>This, she believes, is the reason most African governments are supporting Arab proposals that countries should be compensated, by websites and internet services, for the flow of internet traffic they generate, and that wide-ranging privacy protections be introduced with exceptions for law enforcement.</p> <p>Drummond said he was sympathetic with developing countries who feel excluded from the western-dominated internet industry. \"But the treaty route, and the lowest common denominator approach mandating a certain set of technologies or regulations, is not the way to go.\" Munyua says even finding delegates who understand issues of internet management and governance can be difficult, and that with problems as basic as a unreliable electricity supply, African nations have different priorities when engaging with the ITU.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the ITU, the battle for control is more like a cold war. Russia, backed by several Middle Eastern countries and by China, has pushed for more <a href=\"https://dwmw.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/the-itu-and-the-real-threats-to-the-internet-part-iv-the-triumph-of-state-security-and-proposed-changes-to-the-itrs/\" title=\"\">cybersecurity regulations</a> and for more ITU control of domain names: this follows Russian president Vladimir Putin stating last year that Russia aimed to establish \"international control over the internet using the monitoring and supervisory capabilities of the International Telecommunication Union\". It has mooted cutting off internet access for anyone who threatens network security, called for a new UN body to replace Icann, and campaigned, but failed, with a previous UN proposal to create a cybersecurity code of conduct.</p> <p><a href=\"http://dymaxion.org/\" title=\"\">Eleanor Saitta</a>, technical director of the <a href=\"http://old.immi.is/?l=is&amp;p=FAQ\" title=\"\">International Modern Media Institute</a>, is also a hacker and security consultant. She warns that one of the biggest threats is the increasing militarisation of the internet. Even as the 193 nations of the ITU meet in December, some of those nations will be silently unleashing state-sponsored cyber attacks on each other, as well as surveillance and censorship on their citizens.</p> <p>Occasional reports of this flourishing industry surface; just last month the UK government was moved to block software exports to Egypt after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/09/block-on-exports-surveillance-equipment\" title=\"\">Gamma International</a> admitted selling a product that could remotely copy files, log keystrokes and record video. \"We are seeing governments wanting to get involved in censorship and surveillance and that truly has the potential to break the internet, because it will not function as a network or community where people can collaborate and share,\" said Saitta.</p> <p>America's corporate internet industry has already had to battle on home turf, however. In 2011, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/dec/23/sopa-stop-online-piracy-act\" title=\"\">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> (Sopa) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/18/sopa-pipa-consumption-only-internet\" title=\"\">Protect IP Act</a> (Pipa) proposed significantly expanded power for US law enforcement in identifying and penalising copyright infringement. Google was one of the loudest voices in this lobby, putting its sophisticated Washington policy department to work. The campaign, which saw high-profile sites including Wikipedia and Reddit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/jan/18/1\" title=\"\">black out</a> for a day in protest, has succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jan/20/pipa-vote-shelved-harry-reid\" title=\"\">postponing the legislation</a> for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397915182\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/23/1343060875157/Google--002.jpg\" alt=\"Google \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Public eye: Google's near-monopoly on search is coming under scrutiny. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Google in the dock</h2> <p>But lobbying by Google and its contemporaries against the ITU may well end up backfiring. Google is likely to face an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/15/google-antitrust-microsoft-case\" title=\"\">anti-trust</a> hearing in the US by the end of the year, investigating whether Google gives preferential treatment to its own products in search listings. The European Commission is also building a case against Google; the combination could stop Google expanding its US and UK businesses where Google accounts for 65% and 90% of the respective search markets. The search engine is also fighting a privacy battle against European regulators unhappy at how Google shares data between YouTube, Gmail and its other products. On one hand, Google is preaching for an open web, while on the other operating a virtual monopoly in search.</p> <p>The lobby's arguments on cybersecurity look weaker in the light of America's own Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or Cispa, which was widely condemned by civil rights groups for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/18/cispa-unprecedented-access-internet-privacy\" title=\"\">sacrificing the privacy</a> of its citizens to allow the government to trace hackers. Hot on the heels of Sopa, it was passed by Congress, killed off by the Senate and is now being revisited by the Senate. US defence secretary Leon Panetta claimed this week that the US risked a \"cyber Pearl Harbour\" if it did not resolve its cybersecurity issues. The US government itself was implicated in the development of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/30/state-sponsored-cyber-espionage-prevalent\" title=\"\">Stuxnet and Flame</a> viruses which was intended to derail and spy on the Iranian nuclear programme, and the White House has also claimed it was subject to an attack in October from hackers linked to the Chinese government.</p> <p>With so much to contend with on home turf, why, asks internet governance policy analyst professor <a href=\"http://www.internetgovernance.org/2012/06/09/threat-analysis-of-wcit-part-3-charging-you-charging-me/\" title=\"\">Milton Mueller</a>, is the US technology lobby chucking so much firepower at the declining institution of the ITU? They might do better, he suggests, to focus attention on Icann, pointing out problems with how governments engage with the group on advisory committees.</p> <p>Mueller says: \"We're all 'prepared to fight the ITU' \u2013 but we're ignoring threats that come from Icann, the US government and from nation states. We're not building the kind of new institutions we need to govern the internet and keep it free.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Jemima Kiss will be hosting a </em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/guardianhangouts\" title=\"\"><em>Google+ Hangout on Thursday 18 October at 5pm BST on the battle for the internet</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The Football Association must begin the search for its fourth chairman in five years after David Bernstein failed in a bid to extend his tenure beyond his 70th birthday in May.</p> <p>Since replacing interim chairman Roger Burden in December 2010 in the wake of England's disastrous bid to host the 2018 World Cup, Bernstein is widely considered to have brought stability to the organisation.</p> <p>But he will have to stand down in May 2013, the same month the FA is due to host the Uefa Congress and the Champions League final at Wembley, after the FA Council on Wednesday narrowly voted against an exemption to rules that require the chairman to stand down at 70.</p> <p>Bernstein knew about the rule when he took the job but the FA board agreed that he should stay on for another year before handing over to a successor in the summer of 2014, following the World Cup in Brazil. The FA Council voted against the proposal on the basis it would be \"inappropriate to change known and agreed rules on an individual basis\".</p> <p>Some of those members on the council, which the government has said should be reformed as part of a modernisation process, are older than 70 themselves.</p> <p>\"I respect the decision and I remain committed to fulfilling my responsibilities and to building on what we have achieved over the past two years,\" said Bernstein. \"Next year is a significant one in the FA's history and I look forward to leading the organisation in the months ahead.\"</p> <p>The FA will celebrate its 150th anniversary next year and hosting the Uefa Congress and the Champions League final, for the second time in three years, are the centrepiece of the celebrations.</p> <p>Sir Keith Mills, the Air Miles founder who was deputy chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, has already been discussed in FA circles as a possible successor to Bernstein.</p> <p>Yet the Tottenham Hotspur director, who was instrumental in winning the Games for London, is expected to be in demand. He has also been touted as a possible joint chairman of the quangos Sport England and UK Sport, or a possible chairman of the Premier League when Sir Dave Richards finally stands down at the end of the season.</p> <p>Bernstein's tenure began amid familiar controversy and chaos in the fallout from the FA's failed \u00a318m bid to host the 2018 World Cup.</p> <p>Burden, who had replaced Lord Triesman earlier in the year after the Labour peer had been forced out by a contentious newspaper sting, had declined to stand for the job in protest at the decision.</p> <p>The former Manchester City chairman made a brave but unsuccessful bid to prevent Sepp Blatter being re-elected unopposed as Fifa president in June 2011 and has since attempted to build bridges with the global governing body and, in particular, with Uefa.</p> <p>When his decision to strip John Terry of the England captaincy led to the resignation of Fabio Capello five months before Euro 2012, he received mixed reviews for his handling of the recruitment process before settling on Roy Hodgson.</p> <p>The former French Connection chairman also made careful attempts to begin the process of reforming the FA, if more slowly than many would like, with the addition of two non-executive directors, Heather Rabbatts and Roger Devlin, to the board.</p> <p>Bernstein also had to plot a careful course through the toxic racism rows involving Luis Su\u00e1rez and Terry and presided over the overdue opening of the new \u00a3105m national football centre at St George's Park.</p> <p>One of his few serious mis-steps was the handling of the FA's response to the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, following which the organisation was seen as slow to apologise for its part in the circumstances around the disaster.</p>",
  "<p>It's National Bulk Foods week in the US: an awareness campaign run by the <a href=\"http://www.bulkisgreen.org\" title=\"Bulk is Green Council website\">Bulk is Green Council</a> (BIG). Although this may conjure up visions of super-sized portions, bulk buying isn't about quantity but thrift.</p> <p>\"For us, bulk buying means buying in large quantities from big-box stores like Costco or Walmart in an effort to save money,\" a BIG spokesperson says. \"It also means buying foods from the bulk bins in the bulk foods aisle of a grocery store, and we want to promote this.\"</p> <p>The bulk food aisles are where shoppers can take their own tubs and fill them with dried goods: pasta, cereals, rice, spices. According to BIG, bulk buying organic rolled oats in this way is 219% less expensive than buying organic packaged oats.</p> <p>BIG hopes to encourage more than 1,000 stores to offer further discounts on bulk foods during the week.</p> <p>While the UK does not yet have bulk buy aisles in its supermarkets, there are ways to shop that reduce packaging and maximise how much food you get for your money. Here is our guide to just that, and if you have other tips to share please post them below.</p> <h2>Stock up on wholefoods</h2> <p>In the UK, you can expect to save up to 25% if you buy direct from organic wholesalers such as <a href=\"http://www.Sumawholesale.com\" title=\"Suma website\">Suma</a>. However, while delivery is free, most have high minimum orders (Suma's is \u00a3250) so you will probably need to club together with friends or neighbours to take advantage.</p> <p>With food prices rising, Suma reports a \"significant rise\" in buying groups being set up to share large bulk buy items.</p> <p>Currently, the website is selling a 10kg sack of chickpeas for \u00a316.69. At supermarkets they are usually sold in 500g packets, which cost \u00a31.09 at Sainsbury's and 99p at Tesco. The Suma price works out at 83p for 500g.</p> <p>On organic chopped tomatoes, Suma offers 12 tins for \u00a36.21, or 51p a tin. This compares with 89p at Waitrose and Sainsbury's, 79p at Tesco and 75p at Asda.</p> <p>Also try <a href=\"http://www.Infinityfoodswholesale.co.uk\" title=\"Infinity Foods\">Infinity Foods</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Highlandwholefoods.co.uk\" title=\"Highland Wholefoods\">Highland Wholefoods</a>.</p> <h2>Independent supermarkets</h2> <p>Supermarkets are catching on to our bulk buying habits and offering larger packaged items, but many deals don't stack up.</p> <p>\"Supermarkets are expensive places to shop whether you're buying bulk or not,\" says Joanna Blythman, author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007341429\" title=\"What to Eat website\">What to Eat</a>. \"Supermarket pricing tries to trick consumers into thinking that a larger pack means better value, but that's often not the case. In fact, sometimes the smaller packs work out cheaper.\"</p> <p>However, independent supermarkets and wholefood shops are a different matter. If you're lucky enough to live near <a href=\"http://www.Unicorn-grocery.co.uk\" title=\"Unicorn Grocery website\">Unicorn Grocery</a> in Manchester or London-based <a href=\"http://www.Thepeoplessupermarket.org\" title=\"Peoples Supermarket website\">The People's Supermarket</a> you can save cash by going for the largest pack size.</p> <p>At Unicorn, for example, porridge oats cost \u00a31.19 a kilo, but the store also sells 25kg sacks for \u00a320.75.</p> <p>\"It costs us less to bring a whole sack of oats to the shop floor because we've not packaged it into smaller containers so we can offer a saving,\" says Unicorn's Dvir Newman.</p> <p>If Unicorn shoppers want to buy a whole box of apples or cartons of fruit juice, they're given a 10%-20% discount.</p> <p>Like Unicorn, The People's Supermarket sells its fruit and vegetables loose, so while customers are free to bulk buy 5kg of carrots, others can buy just one.</p> <p>If you do shop at mainstream supermarkets, stocking up on long-life items when there is an offer may sometimes work. Compare prices on MySupermarket.com beforehand and shop with friends to take advantage of three-for-two offers.</p> <h2>Wholesalers</h2> <p>It may not be an ethical choice, but cash-and-carry giants like Costco.co.uk and Booker.co.uk can be money-savers. Costco charges a fee (approximately \u00a325,) but membership is open to many employees as well as business owners. Booker is free but only for business owners and the self-employed.</p> <p>Bulk buys of rice, pasta, fruit juice (and meat, frozen vegetables and cheese if you have the fridge-freezer to store it) can knock your shopping bill down by half, but the downside is storage.</p> <p>Again, not one for ethical shoppers, but Amazon sells bulk buy groceries. Savings vary but can be small: currently, 24 cans of Heinz baked beans are \u00a316.08 (RRP \u00a320.48), whereas they are on offer at Costco for \u00a37.89. Delivery is free but can take a while.</p> <p>There's also online wholesaler <a href=\"http://www.shortersclub.co.uk/\" title=\"Shorters Club website\">Shortersclub.co.uk</a>. There's a wide array of groceries and it's free to join. Large households, which can take advantage of economies of scale, should save money. The minimum order is \u00a340 and delivery is \u00a35.99.</p> <p>At Shorters Club, Tilda wholegrain basmati rice costs \u00a317.27 for 10 500g packs, or \u00a31.72 each. A single pack costs \u00a32.49 at Sainsbury's. Amazon sells Tilda wholegrain in packs of five for \u00a39.70 (\u00a31.94 each).</p> <h2>Don't overdo it</h2> <p>A box load of anything isn't a cheap deal if it's days away from the best before date. Check before you stock up and be realistic about what you'll actually eat.</p> <p>And while most people are unlikely to gorge on porridge oats, the same can't be said for chocolate, nuts, biscuits, cheese and ground coffee. You might find that having more in the cupboard results in you using more, so unless you have good willpower stocking up could prove costly.</p> <p>So there are our tips for buying in bulk.

Scientists have found that our brains are hard-wired to respond strongly to the sound, making us more attentive and priming our bodies to help whenever we hear it \u2013 even if we're not the baby's parents.</p> <p>\"The sound of a baby cry captures your attention in a way that few other sounds in the environment generally do,\" said Katie Young of the University of Oxford, who led the study looking at how the brain processes a baby's cries.</p> <p>She scanned the brains of 28 people while they listened to the sound of babies and adults crying and sounds of animal distress including cats meowing and dogs whining.</p> <p>Using a very fast scanning technique, called <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/kitmitmeg/whatis.html\" title=\"\">magnetoencephalography</a>, Young found an early burst of activity in the brain in response to the sound of a baby cry, followed by an intense reaction after about 100 milliseconds. The reaction to other sounds was not as intense. \"This was primarily in two regions of the brain,\" said Young. \"One is the middle temporal gyrus, an area previously implicated in emotional processing and speech; the other area is the orbitofrontal cortex, an area well-known for its role in reward and emotion processing.\"</p> <p>Young and her colleague, Christine Parsons, presented their findings this week at the <a href=\"http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=annualmeeting\" title=\"\">annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in New Orleans</a>.</p> <p>The study suggests there is something special about the way baby sounds are processed by the brain, said Young. The fact that there was activity in the emotional areas of the brain could mean that the sound of a baby's cries are tagged as important even before our brains have had a chance to fully process them.</p> <p>None of the study participants was a parent or had any particular experience of looking after babies, yet they all responded in the same way, after 100 milliseconds, to the baby cries. \"This might be a fundamental response present in all of us, regardless of parental status,\" said Parsons.</p> <p>The researchers also investigated how a baby's cry might subconsciously affect a person's behaviour as a result of activation of the sub-cortical areas of the brain. These are among the brain's most primitive parts and are important in controlling behaviours such as the fight-or-flight response and other responses that keep us alive in dangerous situations.</p> <p>Parsons tested whether a baby cry somehow switched on such survival responses by asking volunteers to play a game of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole\" title=\"\">whack-a-mole</a>, before and after listening to various sounds including babies, adults and animals in distress.</p> <p>\"They were faster and more accurate after listening to the infant vocalisations. It's almost like we have this improvement in our effort for motive performance immediately after listening to vocalisations that might facilitate care-giving behaviour,\" said Parsons.</p> <p>She added that this subconscious switching of the body into alert mode could explain why a baby crying on a plane can be particularly problematic for anyone who is not the parent. \"When you hear a baby on a plane, you're immediately alert, even if you don't want to hear it,\" said Parsons. \"It's a sound that's very difficult to ignore.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/sustainability/publications/carbon-disclosure-project/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=0912-CDP-2012+social\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">annual report</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.cdproject.net/en-US/Pages/HomePage.aspx\" title=\"\">Carbon Disclosure Project</a> (CDP), published last month, provides a mix of bad and good news.</p> <p>\"Companies continue to invest in emissions reductions, but these are typically short term, cost cutting measures such as energy or resource efficiency, rather than long term capital investments in low carbon technology,\" the report states.</p> <p>In short, companies are pushing the limits of what they can do despite neither regulatory support nor customer demand. They can achieve efficiencies that reduce costs over the short term, but long term efficiencies are simply not achievable without a broader mandate.</p> <p>This is no longer of merely academic interest. In recent weeks, we have had numerous indications that there are fewer paths that will lead to a livable earth. This summer, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/13/arctic-ice-melting-faster.html?cmp=rss\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">Arctic ice disappeared</a> at a rate 50% higher than predicted and may vanish in 10 years. Throughout the northern hemisphere, record droughts, high temperatures and floods have been documented. The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/geo/\" title=\"\">reported</a> last summer that progress had been made on only four of 90 of the most important environmental goals.</p> <p>Because deeper carbon reduction strategies carry higher capital costs and risks, companies on their own cannot take the actions necessary to meet the carbon challenge. As the CDP states, \"82% of [Global 500] companies have set targets to reduce emissions, [but] these are not nearly ambitious enough to achieve governments' goals to limit warming to 2\u00b0C\".</p> <p>A remarkable lack of political leadership regarding sustainability issues forces well-intentioned companies into tight corners. Such firms are able to read the news and see the possibilities ahead, but find it difficult to realise the opportunities in sustainability without supportive market structures and regulations. Further, <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20121004-climate-scepticism-highest-us-britain\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">in the UK and US</a>, customers are much less likely to believe in a causal connection between human action and climate impacts.</p> <p>Indeed, America's inattention to climate change has been described <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/us-presidential-debates-global-warming?newsfeed=true\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">in the Guardian</a> as the \"2012 election's only bipartisan consensus\".</p> <p>America, though dominant, is not alone. Ed Miliband, the British Labour party leader somehow omitted it from his recent speech to the party convention, offering no signals to business regarding how he might differ from David Cameron on the issue. Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, has placed his economic bets on the oil sands and their requisite pipelines rather than on increased research, education and productivity.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/changing-behaviour-scale-that-matters?newsfeed=true\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">recent blog</a>, Oliver Balch pondered over what business could do to get customers to respond to issues that companies find so important. Two prominent business scholars present very different answers to his question. One says people may seem complacent and unresponsive to sustainability initiatives because they don't understand the science. The other shows evidence that people may not trust the science.</p> <p>First, Jon Sterman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has worked for years to help business students and executives to understand the system dynamics of climate change. He believes that people can learn to understand the mechanisms of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. Knowing more about carbon levels will help to drive the behaviour of policy makers, whether in business or government. To this end, he has developed numerous <a href=\"http://climateinteractive.org/\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">simulations</a> that allow users to control few variables and see their impact on sea levels and temperatures. In his view, when leaders understand causal connections, they can drive behaviour through improved regulation and business policy.</p> <p>Andrew Hoffman of the University of Michigan, however, thinks that the problem is lack of a social consensus and has identified <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/climate_science_as_culture_war\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">means</a> by which he thinks one can be developed. In his view, honest brokers can help to interpret science better than climate scientists themselves. Once people understand the statistics of causality better, a consensus can be developed that can drive substantive change. He points to the long battle to change smoking behaviour in response to scientific evidence about the connections between tobacco use and lung cancer. In short, trusted sources can broker or market better ideas until people start choosing better alternatives.</p> <p>Both of these opinions are correct. We need to understand the science and we need to trust it. When you look at the list of the four goals on which UNEP found we have made progress, it is clearer:</p> <p>\u2022 Reducing substances that deplete the ozone layer</p> <p>\u2022 Removing lead from fuel</p> <p>\u2022 Increasing access to improved water supplies</p> <p>\u2022 Boosting research on ways to reduce pollution of the marine environment</p> <p>We understand water pollution, ozone holes and lead poisoning. We believe they exist. We can and do act.</p> <p>Consumers won't buy cold water clothes washing detergent until they understand and believe in the impact of their decisions on the earth. Governments will not invest in high speed rail if they do not see a compelling need to replace congested motorways with carbon-free alternatives. Financial decisions at all levels are being deferred because we don't understand our impact on the climate.</p> <p>Companies who seek to make larger capital investments and gain higher efficiencies may first need to invest in increasing the scientific understanding of investors, employees, customers and regulators.</p> <p>The key is to go micro at the 86 individual targets and figure out narrow, targeted plans for as many as possible that marshal the evidence on cause and effect, tally the costs and suggest a way forward. We will be considering many of these <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/geo/pdfs/geo5/Progress_towards_goals.pdf\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\"\">goals</a> in coming weeks, exploring ways in which companies around the world can be encouraged to progress towards their resolution.</p> <p><em>Alison Kemper teaches management at York University and has worked with the Michael Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School since 2005.

  "<p>Resource cutbacks are putting an increasing strain on the prison system in England and Wales, with a growing current of deaths, attempted suicides and assaults, according to the chief inspector of prisons.</p> <p>Nick Hardwick, in his annual report, says there has been a general improvement in jail conditions, with many prisons responding positively to the government's \"rehabilitation revolution\", but progress has been uneven and is now under threat.</p> <p>He says progress, particularly on safety and providing a decent environment, appears to have stalled as the prison population has risen from 85,400 in March 2011 to 87,531 in March 2012.</p> <p>The chief inspector singles out conditions at Britain's largest prison, Wandsworth, which has a population of over 1,100, saying that its excellent workshop facilities were standing almost empty while inmates were locked in their cells for over 16hours a day when the jail was inspected.</p> <p>The chief inspector also says the growing abuse of prescription drugs behind bars, which has spread from high security jails to mainstream prisons, has become a major concern leading to drug debts, bullying, and the risk of overdose.</p> <p>He also highlights concern about the \"strikingly high\" number of prisoners from a traveller background. They make up almost one in 10 of those being held at Wormwood Scrubs in London and the number is frequently as high as 5% of the population in other jails.</p> <p>The chief inspector says, \"The issue is not how many prisoners can be squeezed into the available cells. The issue is whether there are the resources to hold all detainees safely and securely and do anything useful with them when they are there.\"</p> <p>\"Resources are now stretched very thinly. There is a risk of undermining the progress made in recent years. If a rehabilitation revolution is to be delivered, there is a clear choice for politicians and policy makers \u2013 reduce prison populations or increase prison budgets.\"</p> <p>National offender management service figures show the number of self-inflicted deaths in prison have risen from 54 in 2010-11 to 66 in 2011-12. They also show that incidents of self-harm also rose in men's prisons from 14,768 in 2010-11 to 16,146 this year, and the number of recorded assaults rose from 13,804 to 14,858 over the same period.</p> <p>The chief inspector said these figures were a matter of real concern.</p> <p>\"When we compared survey results for prisons inspected this year with those from their previous inspections, prisoners' perceptions of their safety had significantly worsened in twice as many prisons as those where they had significantly improved,\" said Hardwick.</p> <p>The chief inspector says the past year has seen a shift in emphasis in drug treatment in prisons away from long-term methadone maintenance towards a recovery-orientated treatment approach. This was working well in jails where prisoners were not pressurised to reduce their dosages, but was causing problems in those prisons where there was a non-individualised regime for opiate dose reduction.</p> <p>But at the same time there has been a rapid growth in the abuse of prescription drugs that are not detected under the current mandatory drug-testing regime. He said that \"diverted drugs\", often obtained by bullying or simply stolen from those for whom they were prescribed, were now a problem in the majority of prisons. Mandatory drug testing for the prescription drugs involved, including Tramadol, Gabapentin and Pregabalin, is being piloted.</p>",
  "<p>On 4 October 2012, in rural east Texas, a 78-year-old great-grandmother, Eleanor Fairchild, was arrested for trespassing on her own property \u2026 and I was arrested standing beside her, as we held our ground in the path of earth-moving excavators constructing TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline.</p> <p>Seems there's showdown in Texas \u2013 but, in fact, it's a battle being waged all over the United States. It's being fought by ordinary citizens of all colors, economic strata and political persuasions \u2013 against the world's wealthiest multinational corporations, misinformation and deeply embedded fears. While I'm not a fan of war terminology, in these struggles, war analogies seem to highlight both the crisis at hand and perhaps the solution we seek.</p> <p>Let's face it, we are in times of great crisis: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/06/financial-crisis-25-people-heart-meltdown\">economic crisis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2097720_2097782_2097814,00.html\">overpopulation crisis</a>,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/12/climate-change-business-cdp\"> climate crisis</a>, extinction crisis, <a href=\"http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/7-countries-battling-water-issues/from-melting-glaciers-to\">water crisis</a> and a humanitarian crisis on so many levels. Energy, and how we create it, is a pivotal issue for many of these crises. It has become increasingly clear that we need to move in a different direction, yet as a species, we humans are uncomfortable with, and resist, change \u2013 though we know it is the very nature of life and not only essential, but inevitable.</p> <p>Scientific findings warn us that a switch to <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/09/29/929441/what-america-can-learn-from-australias-new-clean-energy-future-package/\">renewable energy is essential</a> if we are to avert disastrous climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. But since scientific findings and the climate crisis have been so successfully politicized \u2013 and I loathe politics \u2013 I'll leave the horrifying ramifications of the global climate crisis out of this.</p> <p>No matter what political rhetoric you choose to follow, or what course we choose to take with our energy options, there are things we all can agree on. As the second <a href=\"http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id=946\">World Water Forum wisely stated</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Water is everybody's business.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Clean, regenerative energy could provide a way past peak oil and our detrimental fossil fuel addiction \u2013 if we collectively had the will to employ renewables, and addressed the change as urgently as the US did during the second world war when we unleashed our scientific creativity and industrial ingenuity to support the war effort. But there is no escape from peak water. We simply cannot live without uncontaminated water and food.</p> <p>Since we can't make informed choices without being informed, here is an update on the global water crisis: the International Water Management Institute <a href=\"http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml\">projects that by 2025, barely 12 years, two-thirds</a> of the world will live under conditions of water scarcity. As <a href=\"http://www.earth-policy.org/books/pb/pbch2_ss2\">Lester Brown from Earth Policy Institute says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Scores of countries are over-pumping aquifers as they struggle to satisfy their growing water needs \u2026 the USDA reports that in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas \u2013 three leading grain-producing states, the underground water table has dropped by more than 30 meters. As a result, wells have gone dry on thousands of farms in the southern Great Plains \u2026 for fossil aquifers, such as the vast Ogollala under the Great Plains, which do not replenish \u2026 depletion would mean the end of agriculture.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Texas <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/10/texas-drought-2011-record_n_859902.html\">was ravaged by drought last year</a> and the majority of the US suffered extreme drought conditions this year. Brown goes on to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The over-pumping of aquifers is occurring in many countries more or less simultaneously. This means that the depletion of aquifers and the resulting harvest cutbacks will come in many countries at roughly the same time. And the accelerating depletion of aquifers means this day may come sooner than expected, creating a potentially unmanageable situation of food scarcity.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nwf.org/global-warming/policy-solutions/drilling-and-mining/tar-sands/keystone-xl-pipeline.aspx\">complete Keystone XL pipeline project that is proposed</a> would come down across the border from Alberta through six states \u2013 passing right through the Ogallala aquifer \u2013 the source of irrigation water for two-thirds of our nation's farms and ranches. The southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was fast-tracked and is now under construction, <a href=\"http://climate-connections.org/2012/10/11/breaking-news-2nd-tree-sit-erected-as-part-of-tar-sands-blockade/\">would cross</a> through the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer that supplies water for agriculture, industry and fresh drinking water to 10-12 million Texans.</p> <p>Another thing we can all agree on \u2013 as even <a href=\"http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/transcanada-plays-down-keystone-xl-risks-researcher-says/\">TransCanada admits</a>, it's not a question of \"if\" there will be spills, but \"when\".

TransCanada has also spent enormous amounts of PR money putting ads on Oprah's network and the like, in an attempt to rebrand itself as \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/jul/28/oil-tar-sands-canada-ethical\">ethical oil</a>\", insinuating that the Keystone XL pipeline would ensure America receives its oil from friendly Canada, instead of unstable regions elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>But the Keystone XL pipeline has been mischaracterized, and the American people have been misled. Portraying the pipeline as a \"public use\" project carrying crude oil to the US, enables the foreign corporation to take US private property through \"eminent domain\" but for foreign private profit.</p> <p>With no evidence to support those claims, politicians have jumped on this bandwagon to tout the KXL project as a means to enhance US energy security and energy independence. In fact, in a congressional energy and commerce subcommittee hearing, TransCanada refused to support a requirement that KXL oil be sold in US markets. This oil will be sold, most likely for export, on the open market to the highest bidder, most likely India (which itself manufactured the pipeline) or China. What is evident is that the Keystone XL pipeline is a private profit venture, not a \"public use\" project that serves the US national interest. </p> <p>I'll admit we have an uphill battle in fighting a corporation so deeply wedded to the White House (<a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/seo/2012/10/15/texas_landowners_join_environmentalists_for_historic\">both the president and secretary of state</a> have had TransCanada's chief lobbyists direct their campaign efforts). And many of the large NGOs have even put the KXL battle on the back burner until after the elections. But we, the people, fight on.</p> <p>So, this is why I stood with Eleanor in front of heavy construction equipment.</p> <p>Eleanor Fairchild is just one of the brave citizens fighting for our survival. And her story should be told. She made no agreement with TransCanada. They took and bisected her 300-acre farm through a classic example of using eminent domain for corporate, rather than public purposes. Fairchild says that they slashed and burned the old-growth forests on her land, reneging on their promise to set aside the trees for use; that they work all through the night, though they said they would work only until 4pm.</p> <p>She says they intimidate her, telling her she's being watched. They have slapped her with a civil lawsuit and are attempting to brand this great-grandmother as an eco-terrorist. But Eleanor Fairchild is not against oil or pipelines; in fact, her late husband was in the oil business for 50 years. She's against tar sands oil. She is against the contamination of our rare and precious water resources, and our soil for growing food.</p> <p>Make no mistake, we are going through fire. If we just stand there doing nothing, we are going to get burned. But if we accept our ethical responsibility to stand up for each other, and for our life support systems, and if we focus on and work tirelessly for a better future, then that just may be within our reach.</p>",
  "<p>The internet is facing increased threats from intervention that could stifle its unprecedented capacity for social and economic development.</p> <p>As a member of the <a href=\"http://www.iccwbo.org/\" title=\"\">International Chamber of Commerce</a> initiative <a href=\"http://www.iccwbo.org/advocacy-codes-and-rules/special-projects/basis/\" title=\"\">ICC Basis</a>, I firmly believe that governments must work in tandem with the business community to keep the web open for all companies and civil society to engage in legitimate activity, and to capitalise on the positive correlation between internet investment and economic growth.</p> <p>There is general agreement that governance structures should remain dispersed and multi-stakeholder, rather than top-down and controlled by governments. So what is at stake if the internet governance landscape isn't strengthened, and how much value is there in business working to protect the multi-stakeholder approach to the internet policy discussions?</p> <h2>Why improving the internet governance landscape matters to business </h2> <p>The internet was created from the bottom-up, a collaboration built by an \"open, decentralised, peer\", as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/the-internet-we-built-that.html?_r=1\" title=\"\">recently stressed by Steve Johnson in the New York Times</a>. Although initially backed by government financing, the internet was commercialised and enhanced by private corporations, and today, internet innovation derives primarily from business and individual entrepreneurs.</p> <p>It's paramount for discussion of internet governance to be similarly collaborative, with business stakeholders deeply involved in dialogue on all levels.</p> <p>But some governments might try to re-open prior agreements for a dramatic shift in the way the internet is governed in favour of an intergovernmental-led model which excludes or demotes other stakeholder groups and would threaten the openness which has defined the internet from the outset.</p> <p>To protect and preserve the economic and social opportunity made possible by internet investment and innovation, business considers it absolutely crucial that the debate about internet governance be transparent and open to all stakeholders. The internet is a powerful economic force; it has accounted for <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/the_great_transformer\" title=\"\">21% of the GDP growth in mature economies</a> over the past five years and, if internet consumption and expenditures were a sector, its weight in GDP would be <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/the_great_transformer\" title=\"\">bigger than the energy or agriculture industry</a>.</p> <p>So getting internet governance policy approaches right, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks, really matters for business growth and sustainability. It has a direct impact on job creation, economic development, trade and competitiveness \u2013 both for public and private companies, and spanning small to large enterprises. As such, it's key for global business to support policies that demand an open market robustly, to promote innovation and eliminate barriers facing companies looking to invest in new markets.</p> <p>Business itself has produced the innovations in network design and technology which have supported economic growth, and it's also a major \u2013 perhaps the largest \u2013 user of the internet. It's for these reasons that business interests should be at the heart of policy discussion, and why effective government-business co-operation provides the key to strengthening internet governance. The multi-stakeholder approach is a vital mechanism for achieving exactly this.</p> <h2>How the multi-stakeholder model can support business interests </h2> <p>There are a number of models being developed to try to address internet governance issues in fair, collaborative ways. In fact, many of the organisations and forums addressing internet-related issues and their decision-making processes are already multi-stakeholder, including the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (<a href=\"http://www.icann.org/\" title=\"\">ICANN</a>), and the Internet Governance Forum (<a href=\"http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/\" title=\"\">IGF</a>).</p> <p>In adopting this approach, these organisations are affirming the importance of bringing people together from various stakeholder groups as equals to discuss public policy regarding the internet.</p> <p>While the IGF, for example, does not negotiate an outcome, it enables those with policy-making power in both the public and private sectors to be part of an open exchange of information. It has also catalysed dozens of national and regional IGF initiatives.</p> <p>But the multi-stakeholder approach is not without controversy \u2013 both as a theory, and in terms of how it works in practice. As with any form of governance, it must address principles such as representation, transparency, efficiency, and its own level of democracy. Indeed multi-stakeholder institutions such as ICANN and the IGF are constantly seeking to improve their outreach to ensure active and meaningful participation by representatives from all groups \u2013 participants from developing countries, for example.</p> <p>Such representation is essential for this model to be successful, but in recent years we've been witnessing more and more direct affronts to multi-stakeholder governance, paving the way for governments to exercise far more control.</p> <p>This cannot be the alternative. If we want to protect and foster progressive governance, we need to reconsider and revive the concept and practice of multi-stakeholder governance. We should remember that the internet has been an unparalleled success story where a favourable internet governance environment has been the prerequisite for continued investment, innovation and development.</p> <h2>Participation as a foundation for business growth </h2> <p>For democratic governance, maintaining an open and transparent process that encourages participation from a diverse range of actors, including business, is paramount. Co-operation needs to be facilitated and promoted across the whole spectrum of organisations addressing internet-related issues, including those that are private sector-led, multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental. That's why the key to maintaining a robust internet for the future lies in continued enhanced co-operation, both between stakeholders and in business-government liaison \u2013 something which needs to become regularised.</p> <p>But for this interaction between stakeholders to be truly effective, we need to ensure sufficient engagement in the debate. Business has an important role to play in defining the shape of the Internet and our voice should be heard in policy-making discussions. The consequences of not speaking out could mean that changes to the way the internet is governed will not serve the interests of business in the long-term.</p> <p>Now, more than ever, is the time to enrich the debate over participation in internet governance and to highlight the importance of having a representative and inclusive process for debate and decision-making. This will be vital to protecting and promoting the free and open web which business has nurtured, and from which it has thrived.</p> <p><em>Jeff Brueggeman is vice-president public policy at </em><a href=\"http://www.att.com/\" title=\"\"><em>AT&amp;T </em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Last week, the British government <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-uk-gujarat-british-high-commissioner-in-india/1/224383.html\" title=\"\">asked its high commissioner in India to meet Narendra Modi</a>, ending 10 years of international isolation for Gujarat's chief minister. Modi was delighted, of course, immediately tweeting \"God is great\".</p> <p>His industries minister instantly promised to \"fast-track\" British investment projects. But many Indian political parties, including the ruling Congress, parties of the left, and Muslim organisations, have sharply criticised the decision. Ever since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\" title=\"\">massacre of more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, in 2002</a>, Modi has been accused by jurists, secular political leaders and civil society in India, as well as by the governments of many countries, of taking no action to prevent the violence, delaying the deployment of police to protect victims and failing to investigate and punish those responsible for the killings. Despite his repeated denials of each of these accusations, Modi is a potent symbol of militant defiance of secularism and constitutional-democratic principles, and remains greatly feared by Muslims.</p> <p>The decision by the UK to resume contact with him is seen as a cruel blow to the causes of justice for the massacre's victims (which included three British citizens), and of non-discrimination against India's 180&#xa0;million non-Hindus.</p> <p>Up till now, British officials have followed a \"working policy\" of no contact with Modi's government <a href=\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-03-22/india/27849965_1_gujarat-riots-riot-act-uk\" title=\"\">\"because of our concerns over what happened in Gujarat\"</a>. Modi was also refused a visa by the US and EU. Modi's global isolation has helped to sustain domestic civil society pressure to bring the massacre's perpetrators to justice. This in turn encouraged the Indian supreme court to intervene, by asking the Gujarat government to reopen criminal cases closed for \"lack of evidence\", and transferring some trials to Maharashtra.</p> <p>The new British stand has been rationalised on the ground that it would allow the UK \"to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest and to explore opportunities for closer co-operation, in line with the \u2026 objective of improving bilateral relations \u2026\". In reality, it will deepen India's social and political rifts, and strengthen Modi's Hindu-chauvinist <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2218139/BJP-deny-Narendra-Modi-place.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">Bharatiya Janata party, for whose leadership</a> he is making an aggressive bid.</p> <p>Going by background briefings by British officials to the Indian press, the UK is attracted to \"dynamic and thriving\" opportunities in Gujarat, especially in \"business\", \"science\" and \"education\". Gujarat has emerged as a major investment destination thanks largely to the sweetheart deals Modi offers to businesses. Despite booming investments, Gujarat's social indices and poverty ratios remain appalling.</p> <p>Evidently, the Cameron government doesn't want to lose out on Gujarat's business opportunities or support from Britain's prosperous Gujarati businessmen, described by the Foreign Office as \"one of the most successful and dynamic communities in the UK\" \u2013 even if that means sanctifying large-scale violence. The Foreign Office lamely added that it wants \"to secure justice for the families of the British nationals who were killed \u2026 [and] support human rights and good governance \u2026\" That cannot be done by relaxing moral-political pressure on Modi.</p> <p>The 2002 massacre was conducted by Hindu fanatics, who speared and burnt Muslims to death, besides raping hundreds of women. Some particularly ghastly incidents were <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/india/\" title=\"\">documented by Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tehelka.com/story_main35.asp?filename=Ne031107gujrat_sec.asp\" title=\"\">an Indian magazine</a> . A witness told Human Rights Watch that the belly of a pregnant woman was slit open by a mob with swords, and both she and her foetus were torched. At Naroda-Patiya, 97 people were massacred, including 35 children and 32 women, by a mob directed by former minister and Modi confidante <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19432982\" title=\"\">Maya Kodnani</a>, who has just been sentenced to 28 years in jail. Police claim they recorded these cases but could not pursue them because of lack of evidence. This is contested by eye-witnesses.</p> <p>The collective barbaric vengeance against a religious minority couldn't have occurred, <a href=\"http://nhrc.nic.in/disparchive.asp?fno=247\" title=\"\">says India's National Human Rights Commission</a> , without \"a comprehensive failure on the part of the state government to control the persistent violation of the rights to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the people\". Although many more <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8306420.stm\" title=\"\">Sikhs were killed in Delhi after Indira Gandhi's assassination</a>, the state's involvement was far deeper in Gujarat, making it the worst massacre of its kind.</p> <p>The massacre followed riots, which were themselves a reaction to a fire in a train, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4180885.stm\" title=\"\">declared accidental by a railway inquiry</a>, in which 59 Hindus died. According to well-corroborated accounts, including some 40 independent reports, including one by the <a href=\"http://www.sabrang.com/tribunal\" title=\"\">Concerned Citizens Tribunal</a>, composed of former senior judges, Modi had the bodies of the train-fire victims brought over a long distance to Ahmedabad, and displayed in a procession. Unsurprisingly, this provoked violence in Gujarat's charged climate. Modi has denied this, saying that the bodies were taken to a hospital to avoid any tensions, and that the violence was simply a natural \"reaction\" to the train fire.</p> <p>According to independent accounts, denied officially, police stood by as the killing proceeded, and refused to register the crimes properly. The BJP, in power nationally, did not use the constitutional powers they have which could have helped restore confidence. (In India, if there is a breakdown of order in any state, the central government can sack the provincial government and impose its own rule until the situation improves and fresh elections can be held. In March 2002, a majority of Indian parties demanded that Modi be sacked and central rule imposed in Gujarat, but the BJP-led government refused.) Gujarat's climate has remained vitiated ever since, allowing Modi to win two state elections.</p> <p>Modi claims he's innocent and has never expressed remorse for the violence. <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gujarat-narendra-modi-reaches-out-to-muslims-nai-duniya/1/210468.html\" title=\"\">His recent overtures to Muslims</a> are viewed with suspicion.</p> <p>Despite official efforts to shield the culprits, and corrupt or destroy evidence, more than 110 people have been found guilty and sentenced by the courts \u2013 a small fraction of the culprits' number. Some evidence, as in Kodnani's case, was provided by conscientious policemen, including a detailed mobile-phone log that establishes frequent conversations between ministers, Hindu fanatics and police at specific sites.</p> <p>Gujarat's victims have still not received justice. Thousands haven't been rehabilitated. Large numbers have been driven into ghettoes, and effectively disenfranchised within a communally polarised climate. Without justice, there can be no reconciliation or forgiveness.</p> <p>Violence of this scale should be an international concern. It shouldn't be treated lightly simply because India has the trappings of a democracy with free elections. What makes the British decision politically odious is its timing: the Gujarat state election is just two months away.</p>",

<strong>co-operatives</strong></p> <h2>On my radar ...</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Unemployment</strong>. To coincide with the latest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/17/uk-unemployment-falls-lowest-ons\" title=\"\">employment figures</a>, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has published a report looking at the <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/disadvantaged-young-people-work\" title=\"\">challenges facing disadvantaged young people looking for work</a>. Researchers sent 2,000 job applications from fictional candidates with at least five good GCSEs and relevant work experience to 667 real vacancies. They found that even in cities with a strong job market, there were 24 unemployed people chasing each retail vacancy, and 50 for each office vacancy. The JRF's head of poverty, Chris Goulden, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's important we have measures that provide more full-time, decent-paying jobs that can ensure work pays. A lack of success in the jobs market saps confidence, demotivates and leaves a scar across a generation of young people, while part-time, low-pay work traps people in poverty.<br>On the day the latest unemployment statistics are released, this report makes for grim reading for young people. The intense competition shows the main problem is more fundamental - a major shortage of jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong>Food banks</strong>. The Trussell Trust says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/17/charity-food-banks-record-numbers\" title=\"\">record numbers of people have received emergency food</a> from charity food banks across the UK in the last six months. But blogger Niall Cooper argues that <a href=\"http://niallcooper.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/uk-food-crisis-long-term-solutions-not-just-foodbanks-needed/\" title=\"\">long-term solutions are needed</a>. He writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With food prices predicted to rise further and incomes of the poorest stagnant or falling the future is bleak. And all this in a still wealthy country, with supermarket shelves heaving with food. <br>Foodbanks may be a short term necessity, but cannot be the long-term solution. If a UK food crisis is to be averted, concerted action is needed to boost the incomes of the poorest and to hold down the escalating cost of food and other essential goods.<br>But what chance of this in an age of austerity?</p> </blockquote> <p><br>And \"amateur economist\" Frances Coppola examines the Trussell Trust's claim that <a href=\"http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/fix-bureaucracy-for-heavens-sake.html\" title=\"\">benefit delays are partly to blame</a> for the rising number of applications for help. She writes: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>DWP incompetence has been a running sore for a long time now. They simply don't seem to be able to cope with the instability of people's lives - an instability to which the Government is contributing by changing the eligibility criteria for benefits. Chris Mould of the Trussell Trust is in my view absolutely right to call them out on the dreadful effect that late payment of benefits can have on people's lives. People who are dependent on benefits for basic living expenses cannot tolerate bureacratic inefficiency or incompetence that leaves them without money for extended periods of time. They end up in arrears with essential bills, they may lose a place to live, they may even end up unable to feed or warm themselves. And we are not talking about the elderly here: the Trussell Trust make it clear that the elderly are not a large proportion of claimants at the moment. We are talking about working-age people who for whatever reason are unable to find enough work to support themselves and their families.<br>The DWP's response to the Trussell Trust's criticsm is mealy-mouthed. No apology for their inefficiency. No promises to improve the timeliness and accuracy of their claim processing. The tone of their response suggests that they think 80% of claims being turned round within 16 days is good. No it isn't, it's awful. That is one in five claims taking more than three weeks to turn round - and during that time the claimants receive nothing. Not a bean. No wonder the food banks are busy.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Unison, which is campaigning on the <strong>public pay freeze</strong>. The union, along with Unite and GMB, who together represent 1.6m local government workers, across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, is today <a href=\"http://www.unison.org.uk/asppresspack/pressrelease_view.asp?id=2842\" title=\"\">submitting its pay claim</a> to the National Joint Council for Local Government Services, calling for a substantial increase. Unison is asking members to share their stories of how the pay freeze has affected them on Twitter using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Localgovpay2013&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">#localgovpay</a></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Gov.uk</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">new online home</a> for government services and information.

The words that government members use to speak to the public have been satirised from the times of 'Yes Minister' right through to 'The Thick of It'.<br>Designing a policy around 'non-automotive transport systems' really does sound like crap when it's referring to cycling.

  "<p>Does a U-turn in Brussels spell the end for biofuels? There is no doubting that plans to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/biofuels-eu-climate-impact\" title=\"\">revise EU biofuel targets downwards</a> mark a major turning point. While failing to go far enough, the EU executive has nonetheless realised it is imprudent to support, let alone mandate, extra biofuel production. Food prices are volatile and pressures on land are increasing in all regions of the world, causing local communities to fear evictions and many small food producers to be priced out of land markets.</p> <p>The EU has joined a growing consensus, and similar moves from the US would now be welcome: the <a href=\"http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/policy_research/GlobalEthanolCosts.html\" title=\"\">latest calculations</a> show that US ethanol policies have increased the food bills of poor food-importing countries by more than $9bn (\u00a35.6bn) since 2006.</p> <p>But where to next? Should we disavow biofuels altogether? The new starting point should be to put food security first. Globally, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/95153/icode/\" title=\"\">25% of land is already degraded</a>, and the remaining productive areas are subject to ever-greater competition from industrial and urban uses. This is exacerbated by the growth of international trade and investment \u2013 and the emergence of a truly global market in land rights.</p> <p>Governments should therefore manage scant resources in a way that puts food production first \u2013 both domestically and where imported fuels are concerned. But if we are to measure biofuel developments against new sustainability criteria with a \"food security first\" logic, what exactly would this entail?</p> <p>States would need to take into account not only the pressures biofuels can exert on food prices and food-producing land, but also on the structure of agriculture. A subsidy for biofuels is, more often than not, a subsidy for agricultural production models with the biggest economies of scale. About 35% of the 389 large-scale investment acquisitions covered in a <a href=\"http://www.grain.org/article/entries/4026-the-world-bank-in-the-hot-seat\" title=\"\">2010 World Bank inventory</a> concerned agrofuels.</p> <p>But this is not the way things have to be. What if smallholders organised themselves into co-operatives and intercropped biofuel feedstocks with staple crops that were earmarked for local food markets? And what if these smallholders, rather than selling the raw feedstock to refineries at unpredictable market rates, and for little profit, were to rise up the value chain and do the refining themselves?</p> <p>Models of this type, where biofuel production strengthens local food producers and food systems, rather than uprooting them, are few and far between. But in developing countries there are some encouraging signs that the interests of local farmers and food systems are finally being taken into account.</p> <p>Indeed, if biofuels are to have a future, they must think small-scale and local. Small-scale farming delivers the inherent win-win of putting income in the hands of farmers who are themselves among the poorest and most food insecure, while supporting those who have a long-term interest in maintaining \u2013 and not merely exploiting \u2013 the natural resource base. Family farms require positive discrimination, as was noted by the outcome documents of the 2008 International Conference on Biofuels in S\u00e3o Paulo. The revamped mission statement of <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-10-404_en.htm\" title=\"\">EU development aid for food security</a> also pledges to support smallholders at every opportunity. This is the context in which all agricultural development \u2013 for food or fuel \u2013 must be conceived.</p> <p>The best practice cases of small-scale sustainable biofuel production may not be geared for exports. This is more than a coincidence: once the primary interest of agricultural systems becomes the cheap, bulk production of export commodities, the positive outcomes of smallholder engagement and intercropping of local staples are always likely to be lost.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ieep.eu/assets/731/Anticipated_Indirect_Land_Uce_Change_Associated_with_Expanded_Use_of_Biofuels_and_Bioliquids_in_the_EU_-_An_Analysis_of_the_National_Renewable_Energy_Action_Plans.pdf\" title=\"\">Institute for European Environmental Policy</a> (pdf) estimated that, to reach its initial 10% target for renewables in transport fuels, the EU would have had to import 41% of its biodiesel and 50% of its ethanol needs by 2020. So even with lower targets, dependence on imports \u2013 and therefore pressure on the structure of farming systems in the global south \u2013 are always the likely outcome of EU biofuel mandates.</p> <p>Lowering the targets is therefore an insufficient guarantee of sustainability. A new logic must be applied domestically and for imported fuel that actively seeks out win-wins for smallholders and local energy uses, while avoiding any radical reshaping of local agricultural structures. This means robust case-by-case impact assessments that are sensitive to food security.</p> <p>With or without biofuels, many regions are, and will remain, highly reliant on imports to feed their citizens. But if scant productive resources are to be diverted to bioenergy, it should first be asked to what extent local communities are food insecure, whether local resources could not be better used to service local food needs (thus reducing import dependence), what modes of agriculture will be favoured, and whether the current users of this \"marginal\" land, rather than being evicted, could be helped to become less economically marginal through the development of local markets.</p> <p>Politicians should not be shy about asking these questions. Only by doing so will they ensure that a \"food security first\" logic is hardwired into the crucial decisions over how a region should manage its resources.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.srfood.org/images/stories/pdf/otherdocuments/20121016_agrofuels_qa.pdf\" title=\"\">Q and A with Olivier De Schutter: Agrofuels and the right to food</a> (pdf)</p>",

  "<p>Gatwick has declared its intent to push for a second runway and is to start drawing up detailed plans for government approval.</p> <p>The airport says the runway is \"affordable and practical\" and will allow it to compete with its bigger London rival, Heathrow, where any runway expansion has been ruled out for now.</p> <p>Although an agreement prohibits any new runway opening before 2019 at Gatwick, the airport is to start detailed work on the options, to be presented to the government's Davies commission on aviation with a view to getting the go-ahead after the next election.</p> <p>A second runway would increase capacity to 70 million passengers a year and would also mean the construction of a third terminal building.</p> <p>Campaigners warned they would \"fight tooth and nail\" against any proposal.</p> <p>The airport's chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said he believed a new Gatwick runway was the best answer to calls for more capacity in the south-east. He said: \"A third runway at Heathrow won't happen. The Thames estuary won't happen. Stansted is only half full. But Gatwick is tremendously dynamic.\"</p> <p>In the three years since Gatwick was sold by BAA, Wingate said that owners Global Infrastructure Partners had invested over \u00a3650m and set up new routes to China, Korea and Vietnam. \"So we have got wind in our sails, and the time was right to start the detailed work.\"</p> <p>The plans would eventually double the numbers of passengers at the Sussex airport, which believes its current capacity to grow from 34 million to 45 million with a single runway will see it through until the mid-2020s.</p> <p>The timing of the announcement will push Gatwick to the forefront of government thinking on airport expansion, with the commission led by Sir Howard Davies being assembled to give its verdict on possible new runways in 2015.</p> <p>Heathrow claims there can be only one \"hub\" airport in Britain \u2013 an airport that supports enough connecting flights to make long-haul routes possible \u2013 but Gatwick rejects that argument.</p> <p>Wingate said: \"We don't see the world in the same way. For us the question is: how can London connect with the rest of the world? The hub argument says you can't connect with the emerging economies \u2013 well, we've already done it.\"</p> <p>He said facilities would be ready next year for the larger Airbus A380 planes, while Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which make more long-haul destinations feasible, were coming to the airport soon.</p> <p>Gatwick is committed to the agreement that prohibits physical construction of any new runway before August 2019, but will try to formulate detailed plans and secure planning permission as soon as possible.</p> <p>Land has been safeguarded for construction to the south of the runway, where some houses exist among 17 listed buildings, although there are no large residential areas comparable with Sipson, the village threatened by Heathrow expansion.</p> <p>Gatwick will be doing detailed work on environmental impacts such as noise and air quality. While fewer people are directly affected by noise than under the Heathrow flight path, an expanded airport is likely to prompt calls for greater controls and curfews.</p> <p>The airport had always previously officially denied it had plans for expansion, despite publishing a \"masterplan\" in July this year that broached the option of a second runway in the next decade.</p> <p>Wingate said: \"We think we're bringing this option to the table in a timely and proper manner. We have said to [local opposition groups] that if we are to start detailed work then they will be amongst the first to know. That's why we are coming out and saying it.\"</p> <p>Brendon Sewill of GACC, the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign, said: \"The option they have got does not make for a good airport, with no proper space for planes and a new terminal between them [the runways] \u2013 unless they're demolishing part of Crawley.</p> <p>\"We are totally opposed on environmental grounds. I don't believe a new runway will be built until Stansted is full, but it's a long way off.\"</p> <p>\"They're putting their hat in the ring. They've said they want to sell the airport in 2018 so our guess is that they're aiming to keep the price up for when they sell it rather than building a runway.\"</p> <p>Airline industry sources also questioned whether the intent was to elevate the airport's value ahead of a sale.</p> <p>John Stewart of Airport Watch said: \"The local community will fight this proposal tooth and nail. It will be very difficult to get a new runway built anywhere in London and the south-east in this day and age given the level of local opposition that can be expected.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: \"There is absolutely no point in simply scattering new runways randomly around the south-east. What this country urgently requires is a hub airport with several runways.\"</p> <p>Heathrow, likewise, said Gatwick's new runway would not solve the issue of hub capacity. A spokesman said: \"The UK is not short of point-to-point capacity provided by airports like Gatwick. What the UK is short of is hub airport capacity \u2026 the only way to support the frequent and direct long-haul routes that are vital to business and trade.\"</p>",

  "<p>Jacob Susman is frustrated again. Sitting in the bright green conference room of his company's trendy industrial office, overshadowed by the Brooklyn Bridge, he's a clean-cut poster child for the \"green economy\": Since 2007, Susman's OwnEnergy, which installs wind turbines, has grown to be one of the nation's most prominent wind installers. But he's plagued by a recurring nightmare: \"Every few years the industry has to drop everything for six or nine months and focus exclusively on having the credit passed.\"</p> <p>He's talking about the Production Tax Credit, the federal subsidy for renewable energy that gives a 2.2-cent per kilowatt hour break to wind energy producers. Those pennies add up to about <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/business/energy-environment/as-a-tax-credit-wanes-jobs-vanish-in-wind-power-industry.html?pagewanted=all\">$1 billion per year</a>, no chump change for the burgeoning industry. Proponents of wind energy say since its inception in 1992, the PTC has been a crucial driving force behind the industry's rapid growth; critics of the PTC (including the fossil-fuel funded <a href=\"http://www.americanenergyalliance.org/2012/09/pyle-its-time-for-the-wind-ptc-to-end/\">American Energy Alliance</a>) say the industry has had ample time to take off its training wheels (never mind that fossil fuel subsidies historically <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/469723-energy-subsidies.html\">run about 13 times higher</a> than renewables).</p> <p>The subsidy has become a touchstone issue in the presidential campaign for <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/public/EEDaily/2012/08/01/1\">windy swing states</a> like Iowa and Colorado: Mitt Romney has referred to the PTC as a <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/public/EEDaily/2012/07/31/1\">\"stimulus boondoggle\"</a> and vowed to kill it, while President Obama has promised to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/morningenergy/0812/morningenergy557.html\">give the credit</a> his support. Every one to three years, as the PTC reaches its expiration date, it must be taken up, re-debated, re-tweaked, and re-approved by Congress, exposing it to shifting political whims particularly in a general election year where the future party spread is far from certain.</p> <p>The PTC is set to expire at the end of this year, and uncertainty about whether Congress will extend it has led to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/business/energy-environment/as-a-tax-credit-wanes-jobs-vanish-in-wind-power-industry.html?pagewanted=all\">layoffs and much anxiety</a> in the industry. And while 2012 was a big year for wind, with 10 gigawatts installed nationwide by August and another gigawatt predicted by year's end (only 0.9 percent of total new power in the US, but nearly double the wind installed in 2011), projections for 2013 are grim: Estimates range from half to a tenth of that.</p> <p>\"Next year is already going to be a crash year for the wind industry,\" said Michel DiCapua, an analyst with Bloomberg Energy Finance.</p> <p>But what happens next year is only the next iteration of a boom-bust cycle that has been the bane of the US wind industry for over a decade. The PTC has been allowed to expire three times in the past, and the industry has consistently tanked; even the <em>possibility</em> of expiration sends shivers up the spines of everyone from blue-collar factory workers to Manhattan investors. Breaking free of that cycle, Susman and other industry leaders interviewed by <em>Climate Desk</em> agree, is the industry's only hope for sustained long-term growth, and it starts with weaning the industry off the PTC once and for all.</p> <p></p> <p>\"The industry doesn't need the PTC forever,\" Susman said. \"We're ready to start talking about how to phase it down.\"</p> <p>But they still have a ways to go. Thanks to fracking, natural gas prices are through the floor. Although the cost of power from wind has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/469722-2011-wind-technologies-market-report.html\">dropped 90 percent</a> since 1980, some investors are still spooked by the upfront expenses. And aside from a few exceptions, the state-level standards that mandate how much renewable energy must be brought into the mix are too low and thus oversupplied, meaning there's little incentive for utilities to seek out new wind projects. For those reasons, a swath of groups including the <a href=\"http://www.awea.org/newsroom/pressreleases/BICEPrelease.cfm\">American Wind Energy Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/increase-renewables/production-tax-credit-for.html\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> have been pushing hard for Congress to extend the PTC once again.</p> <p>Still, said Andy Bowman of Austin-based wind installer Pioneer Green Energy, \"I do think there's more speculation than there ever has been that this might be the last extension.\" Bowman agreed with Susman that even worse than competing on uneven ground with fossil fuels was being handcuffed to a mercurial legislative process whose sights rarely reach farther than a few years. \"It's miserable,\" he said. \"All the projects we've been working on for the last three years are hanging in the balance.\"</p> <p>Bowman is among the wind industry veterans who have worked through several boom-bust cycles in the past. With just 14 employees, his small company is at the mercy of venture capitalists who are loathe to back any enterprise that lacks long-term stability; the PTC, he said, has never been more than a piecemeal solution.</p> <p>\"The expiration of the PTC casts a long shadow,\" he said. \"Removing it would provide a great deal more certainty, since we wouldn't have this big question mark.\"</p> <p>Industry leaders are counting on a combination of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfinger/2012/07/22/were-headed-to-8-00-natural-gas/2/\">rising natural gas prices</a>, tightening coal regulations, and ever-cheaper and more efficient turbines to give wind the competitive edge it would need to kick the PTC. They're also lobbying for a far-sighted national energy policy that favors wind, and higher targets for states' renewables goals. But it's not clear how long those goals will really take to achieve. So for now, all they can do is cross their fingers for one more shot.</p> <p>\"We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,\" Susman said. \"Wind should be able to stand on its own in a few years.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was first published by Guardian partner, <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/2012/10/big-winds-recurring-nightmare/\">Climate Desk</a></p>",

  "<p>Freshers Week is over for another year \u2013 and not a day too soon. I am not the biggest fan.</p> <p>However, I would not go so far as to say that it is a waste of time either. Let me explain. I am a second-year student, a Muslim from one of the Gulf states. I did Freshers Week last year, embracing something of a go-hard-or-go-home strategy that would probably have landed me in deep, deep trouble back home.</p> <p>If I had to summarise that week in a sentence? Alcohol-fuelled sweat-fest of over-sexualised teenagers.</p> <p>One year on, I still cringe at having gone to one of the dodgy student clubs in London's Piccadilly the first night (note: never again). I was sober: the crush of glistening bodies and the wandering hands of strangers were completely revolting \u2013 but this, apparently, was \"freshers\", and I was determined to enjoy it.</p> <p>I had started the week with admittedly unrealistic ideas of meeting lots of new people and dancing the night away. Oh, how those hopes were dashed. From (not taking part in) pre-lashing to telling the guy I'd danced with all night that I was going home now, without him, Freshers Week was disgusting. Having done it once, I would not do (and have not done) anything like it again. It purports to help new students make friends and have fun; it grossly under-delivers.</p> <p>To me, it felt like Freshers Week catered to a very specific group of students: you needed to be very drunk, you needed to be willing to let (very) loose and you needed to accept the fact that it was the company around you (rather than whatever dump of a venue had been chosen) that made your night fun. Never mind that said company were so intoxicated that there was no way they would remember you, or themselves, or any part of the night, the next morning.</p> <p>So why would I argue that these events are worth keeping?</p> <p>Freshers Week brought my first-ever clubbing experience. I had never been around so much alcohol \u2013 or so many cute guys before. I was presented with a flood of morally challenging temptations. Freshers Week tested my beliefs: by choosing to do certain things and refrain from others, I began to clarify what I really believed in \u2013 and, because of that, I have become a more mature person.</p> <p>Somewhere along the way, for example, I decided that I was not a fan of drinking. To me, the \"I-don't-drink-because-I'm-Muslim\" argument was weak. Let's face it, being in a club and dancing with an attractive guy were not exactly sanctioned by my religion either, but I was doing (and enjoying) them both.</p> <p>Freshers Week forced me to consider the underlying reasons for my sobriety: I did not like the taste of alcohol, it was a calorific investment I was not willing to make, and I did not need to drink to relax and have fun.</p> <p>Freshers Week also forced me to consider, defend to others and justify to myself, such standpoints as why I think it is okay to go out clubbing but not okay to sleep with a stranger (no matter how fit he is).</p> <p>So, while I wouldn't take part in such a thing ever again, I am glad I did it the first time around. Thrust into an environment that was beyond wild, I learned quickly what my boundaries were, what I believed in and why, and how to defend my beliefs.</p> <p>Could there have been other, less messy ways of learning those lessons? Probably. But at least this way, I could also show off to my friends back home, most of whom had chosen to study in North America, that I truly had experienced \"the London life\".</p> <p>\u2022 Alia Malouf (not her real name) is a law student at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Only seven of the papers identified a primary mechanism for the species' disappearance. None showed a simple relationship between species loss and the organism's tolerance of higher temperatures.</p> <p>Despite a wealth of studies describing how species adapted to climate change, by moving to new habitats, for example, Wiens said the details of how climate forces populations into decline were still largely unknown.</p> <p>Writing in the journal, <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspb.2012.1890\" title=\"How does climate change cause extinction?\">Proceedings of the Royal Society B</a>, the researchers describe various ways that climate change can endanger species. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/03/panamanian-golden-frog\" title=\"\">Frogs in Central and South America can suffer when climate change causes fungus to spread more easily</a>; plovers in Britain are affected when higher summer temperatures reduce populations of craneflies, and grey jays in Canada were less likely to survive the winter and breed the following year when warm autumn temperatures caused their food hordes to rot.</p> <p>These subtle shifts in the way species behave may make even small climatic changes dangerous for vulnerable plants and animals, Wiens said.</p> <p>\"If you want to preserve species you need to know what causes them to decline. Do the plants they feed on disappear? Does a competitor move into their range, or a new predator? Or maybe it is just too hot for that species,\" he added.</p> <p>Having analysed papers that linked extinctions to climate change, the researchers repeated the exercise for studies that linked climate change to population declines, and rapid swings in climate to extinctions and declines. In each case, the most common dangers were classed as disruptions in species encounters, such as the loss of symbiotic algae from corals, declines in figs, which damaged fig wasp numbers, and the death of corals leading to a loss of fish that feed on them.</p>",
  "<h2>Favourite phenomenon</h2> <p>Texans outside Austin consider Austinites quite batty. A centre of counter culture (read: hippies) in the state, Austin is also home to all the crazy politicians the citizenry of the state has sent to the State Capitol to represent them.

The real centre of batty activity in Austin is the <strong>Congress Avenue Bridge</strong>, 10 blocks south of the Capitol, and home to about a million actual bats. Every evening a giant cloud of these boogers swoops out from under the bridge to feed on insects, and every evening hundreds of people come out to watch them.

The country has experienced natural and manmade disasters over recent years, including conflict in the Swat valley that displaced around 3 million people, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/aug/13/pakistan-flooding?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">severe flooding in 2010</a> and 2011 that affected millions of people and disrupted development programmes. The country is also devolving federal power to the provinces. \"This suggests that scaling up of the country programme needs to be approached cautiously and with a very active risk management stance,\" said the report.</p> <p>The report welcomed DfID's cash transfer scheme in areas hit by flooding, but \"while its humanitarian projects are well conceived, DfID has only limited engagement at present in building capacity for disaster risk reduction or management, to increase resilience to future disasters\", despite recommendations in 2008 that more needed to be done in this area.</p> <p>The design of the health programme, which trained community midwives in rural areas to support women who are not able to give birth in a health centre, was problematic, as it was competing with an existing network of trained community health workers created under another national health programme. Devolution resulted in the abolition of DfID's partner in the programme, the national Ministry of Health, which meant ownership of the project was unclear. The health programme is now being redesigned.</p> <p>ICAI recommended that DfID encourages more private-sector involvement in delivering health and education services, considers making resilience to natural disasters at household and community level a core part of its programme, and implements agreed standards and procedures to ensure transparency and accountability in budgeting.</p> <p>\"Overall, we found that the DfID Pakistan programme is dynamic and innovative, with a good range of impressive initiatives,\" said Graham Ward, the ICAI chief commissioner. \"DfID has no track record, however, of delivering programmes in Pakistan on the scale that is now contemplated. Delivering aid there also involves considerable challenges, so we believe that the planned programme scale-up needs to be approached carefully.\"</p> <p>The international development secretary, Justine Greening, said she welcomed ICAI's findings. \"The report notes the strong results DfID is delivering to transform the lives of the poorest, especially in education and post-flood relief, despite a challenging operating environment,\" she said. \"The report also raises some important points and highlights specific areas for improvement. We have already completed actions to address many of these areas and work is well under way on addressing those that remain.\"</p>",

  "<p>What future is there for NHS hospitals unable to make ends meet? Many people assume <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/25/nhs-trust-special-measures-debt\" title=\"\">the supposedly \"bankrupt\" South London Healthcare Trust</a>, which runs major hospitals in Bromley, Woolwich and Sidcup, will be handed to the private sector. Some assume it'll be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/private-sector-failing-hospitals\" title=\"\">the first of many</a>.</p> <p>But the private sector is wary. Why take on struggling NHS hospitals? Such takeovers may please a government intent on hacking back the public sector workforce, and a health secretary encumbered with dozens of NHS hospitals too indebted for foundation trust status, but firms see a health sector starved of growth and a tariff system that's become a tool for squeezing costs. They worry about their reputations. And they watch what's happening with Circle, which took over the threatened <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/03/hinchingbrooke-nhs-trust-goes-private\" title=\"\">Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire</a> back in February.</p> <p>To fulfil its side of the deal, Circle, led by the charismatic chief executive Ali Parsa, needs surpluses of \u00a370m over a decade. It would keep 44%. But Hinchingbrooke hasn't made a \u00a31m surplus this century, so aggressive cost-cutting seems inevitable. Now <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hinchingbrooke-hospital-first-privately-run-nhs-1363151\" title=\"\">staff morale and patient satisfaction are falling</a>. By August, according to NHS Midlands and East's measure (\"Would you recommend this hospital to your friends and family?\"), Hinchingbrooke had <a href=\"http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/acute-trusts/hinchingbrooke-health-care-nhs-trust/hinchingbrooke-health-care-trust-slips-down-patient-satisfaction-table/5048871.article\" title=\"\">dropped from sparkling to average</a>.</p> <p>Thriving foundation trusts with international reputations, now under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/02/mandarins-nhs-battle-future-health\" title=\"\">Monitor</a> umbrella, may be tempted into \"partnerships\". Some offer rich rewards. But most NHS hospitals would need financial bait: subsidies, income guarantees or a material undervaluing of the assets.</p> <p>For the present, however, the less glamorous non-acute sector of the NHS \u2013 worth an estimated \u00a315-20bn \u2013 is proving attractive. The principal predators aren't private health providers but global outsourcing companies. Their business model is simple enough: win the tender, take on the staff, shred the management structure and cut costs.</p> <p>It's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/03/private-contracts-signed-nhs-privatisation\" title=\"\">privatisation fuelled by the \"any qualified provider\" regime</a> which, since April, forces NHS commissioners to offer whole services to competition. If there's one field where the outsourcing companies have special expertise, it's competitive tendering. But the process began in earnest two years ago, when primary care trusts were forced to offload the \"provider arms\" that employed community nurses, therapists and others.</p> <p>This year Virgin has already won the contract to run community services in north-west and south-west Surrey (worth somewhere between \u00a3450m and \u00a3650m), and is currently preferred bidder for a \u00a3140m contract for children's services in Devon. Serco, meanwhile, captured a \u00a3140m contract to run community services in Suffolk.</p> <p>What makes community health services such a lucrative proposition? Unlike acute hospitals, there's no effective tariff system: measuring what a district nurse or a physiotherapist actually achieves is more complex than counting hospital \"spells\". Pruning a community team is less visible than closing a hospital. The risks are lower, the profit margins higher.</p> <p>Despite occasional bad press \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/31/serco-gp-service-cornwall\" title=\"\">Serco's out-of-hours GP service in Cornwall </a>has caused a little local difficulty \u2013 the trend is set to continue. Virgin's success in Surrey followed overt pressure from the MP for south-west Surrey on commissioners to expedite the deal. That's Jeremy Hunt, now secretary of state for health.</p> <p>Government's happy. To smooth Virgin's path into Surrey, it found a device to safeguard the prized NHS pension rights of 2,500 staff. Rather than working directly for Virgin Health, they have transferred instead to the employment of <a href=\"http://m.lgcplus.com/5043774.article\" title=\"\">VH Doctors</a> \u2026 a social enterprise.</p> <p>Ah, social enterprise. Many NHS community teams opted in 2011 to form new social enterprises, following the example of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/18/camerons-big-society-rich-surrey\" title=\"\">Central Surrey Health</a>. Lauded by Gordon Brown and David Cameron alike, it's served 280,000 people in Surrey for five years. But its core mid-Surrey contract is up for renewal. In May, the Department of Health was already warning that, unless they improve their \"commercial skills\", social enterprises will lose their core NHS contracts as they mature. The whole \"movement\" could prove no more than a transitional phase. That's unnerving for ministers keen to lure large numbers of local government staff out of state employment.</p> <p>Now GP practices may be the next target. The \u00a315bn NHS primary care budget is juicy enough, but, cajoled and flattered into taking on the entire \u00a365bn NHS commissioning budget, practices now hold the key to even greater riches. Only 2.2% are currently owned by corporates. That may be about to change.</p> <p>GPs thought they'd be in charge, but international health insurers and consultancies wait in the wings to help steer commissioning when, inevitably, it flounders.</p> <p>Did GPs seriously believe they'd be handed control of that much public money?</p>",
  "<p>There is nothing like studying overseas to broaden your horizons, not to mention your CV. Employers are increasingly looking on foreign language skills and familiarity with different cultures as a differentiator when it comes to potential employees.</p> <p>According to the UK Council for Student Affairs there are around 22,000 UK students dotted around the globe doing just this. Not to mention some 400,000 international students studying here in the UK.</p> <p>With the right support in place, studying abroad will allow you to stand out from the crowd when it comes to entering the job market. Here are just a few reasons why students should consider studying overseas:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 To enhance your CV.</strong> When applying for graduate jobs the common denominator is that everyone will have a degree, but the life skills picked up while studying abroad will put you ahead of the competition. The experience will ensure that you are adaptable to new surroundings and cultures, which is not easily learnt in the classroom. This sort of flexibility is vital to many employers.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Improve your language skills.</strong> In today's world of global commerce, knowing how to express yourself in more than one language is becoming an ever increasing necessity. Having to converse in a foreign tongue may at first seem unnerving, but nothing beats learning a new language in the country of its origin.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Gain new contacts and lasting connections.</strong> Who's to say networking should begin when you start working? Studying overseas will introduce you to a host of new experiences and faces. For those looking to work internationally this could be a vital and strategic start to your future career.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Hone your digital skills.</strong> Blogging and tweeting about your travels may seem like a fun and easy way to keep in touch with those at home, but it could also set you on your chosen career path. 02 recently published research showing that the unused d<a href=\"http://news.o2.co.uk/?press-release=young-peoples-digital-skills-valued-at-6-7billion-by-uk-businesses\" title=\"\">igital skills of the one million young people in the UK is estimated to be worth \u00a36.7 billion</a>. Companies value web and social media know-how on a par with new business development and customer acquisition abilities \u2013 suddenly that blog doesn't seem so trivial.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Test your strength of character.</strong> For many students studying abroad may be the first time they have been so far from home. Arriving in a foreign land alone is an intimidating prospect, but without even realising it those who take on the challenge will see their confidence and self-reliance grow.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Change your outlook on life.</strong> The modern workplace is a diverse and ever changing realm. Immersing yourself in a new culture and way of life will allow you to adapt to new situations with pace and undoubtedly make you mentally stronger and wiser.</p> <p>When speaking to students who are considering studying abroad cost is always one of their biggest worries. But this need not be a hurdle. Tuition fees in the UK may be on the rise, but some countries, such as Demark, do not charge international students to study. Meanwhile others, such as the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, come at a fraction of the cost of British study.</p> <p>Then there is the option of part-time work should your visa stipulations allow it; many universities will help organise casual employment for international students. Another option is to apply for scholarships and bursaries. Student information websites <a href=\"http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/ukstudent/funding.php\" title=\"\">UKCISA</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/education/studyingabroad/networking/studyabroad.shtml\" title=\"\">UNESCO</a> are a good place to start when researching funding opportunities.</p> <p><em>Elspeth Brown is the director of </em><a href=\"http://www.onlystudentconcierge.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Only Student Concierge</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Apple should be crimson. As Mitt Romney observed in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-win-second-presidential-debate\" title=\"\">second presidential debate</a>, there are \"even counterfeit Apple stores in China\".</p> <p>In the best-known case, in Kunming last year, the boss had gone to some lengths to kit out the store and staff in line with Apple design. Blue T-shirted employees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2011/jul/21/fake-apple-store\" title=\"\">believed they were working at a genuine branch</a>.</p> <p>The resulting headlines prompted a crackdown and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14503724\" title=\"\">closure of at least a couple of stores for trading without a licence</a> \u2013 but there are plenty more. Not all are masquerading as official Apple outlets, and those that do are not always convincing. It's hard to imagine the company endorsing the cheery slogan at this recently spotted retailer: \"<a href=\"http://twitpic.com/b39r2q\" title=\"\">iPhone 5: because you have more money than sense</a>\".</p> <p>And while Romney claimed the stores were selling counterfeit goods, most are actually selling genuine Apple products \u2013 often grey-market imports from Hong Kong \u2013 Charlie Custer, an editor at <a href=\"http://www.techinasia.com/\" title=\"The technology news site\">Tech In Asia</a>, pointed out.</p> <p>\"Apple is getting the money one way or another,\" he said. People are often too impatient to wait until Apple has approval from Chinese authorities for products to be used on Chinese networks, as well as wanting the lower prices. And Apple has been relatively slow to roll out genuine stores on the mainland.</p> <p>At the same time, the enforcement of rights tends to be spasmodic. \"The intellectual property [situation] is improving, but not as fast as many people would like,\" said Duncan Clark of the BDA China business consultancy, and formerly chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China. \"There are periodic crackdowns, but there's still a long way to go.\"</p> <p>Clark suggested that changing demand might be having more of an impact than curbs on the supply of fakes. \"When it comes to very desirable products, Chinese consumers absolutely know the difference and will pay above the odds to get the real thing,\" he said.</p> <p>The surge in fake Apple stores in large part reflects demand for the genuine products. Custer described the iPhone as \"a perfect status symbol that's still in the price range of a lot of people\"; unlike, say, a Mercedes. White-collar buyers want the real deal.</p> <p>But for the others, there are plenty of products \u2013 and not just phones and gadgets \u2013 that appear to be inspired by Apple. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/chinese-sex-fair-prudishness-liberation earlier\" title=\"Chinese sex fair shows how prudishness and liberation sit side-by-side\">Guangzhou Sex Culture Festival</a> this month, there were \"iPed\" sex toys and, this spring, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/taniabranigan/7351932618/in/photostream\" title=\"Yes, mango-flavoured iPhone 5 icecreams\">\"iPhone 5\" ice creams</a> \u2013 complete with a trademark symbol \u2013 appeared in convenience stores.</p> <p>Even so, the blogger who first found the Kunming store pointed out that Applemania was not a uniquely Chinese phenomenon. Internet users mailed her images of fake stores from around the world, including one in New York.</p> <p>\"It is more of a global issue, but it doesn't create as nice a story as China ripping off Apple stores,\" she told <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/10/17/china-fake-apple-store-blogger-romney-misusing-the-story/\" title=\"Mitt Romney called out on fake Apple store\">the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <p>\"[Mitt Romney] uses it as a shorthand to generate outrage about trade practices in China and as a shorthand that he will be quote-unquote 'tough on China'. It's a somewhat meaningless shorthand. I'm not entirely sure he knows what he's referring to at this point.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>\"All cars are getaway cars\" \u2013 Martin Pawley, <a href=\"http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/dreaming-of-utopia-and-freedom-on-the-unopen-road-to-nowhere/184974.article\">Architects Journal</a></em></p> <p>Cities are designed to fulfil a lot of functions, but fun driving usually isn't one of them. Quite the opposite these days. Escalating traffic levels have strangled the life out of urban roadways, while congestion charges and designated parking have become familiar weapons in the war against personal transport. We're not supposed to enjoy cars, we're supposed to put up with them.</p> <p>Diametrically opposed to this life-sapping philosophy is Need For Speed: Most Wanted, the latest anarchic drive-'em-up from Guildford-based developer, Criterion. The veteran studio has been responsible for some of the best racing games of the last decade, switching from its own Burnout series in 2010 to rescue EA's long running Need For Speed brand. Its interpretation of NFS: Hot Pursuit sold eight million copies and introduced the brilliant Autolog social competition system, which allowed gamers to asynchronously compete for the best times. And now the development team has returned with another NFS offshoot and another scintillating interpretation.</p> <p>Set in and around the sprawling metropolis of Fairhaven, Most Wanted challenges players to become the most notorious illegal racer in town, speeding through a series of illicit driving events, gathering speed points and unlocking mods. Brilliantly, very few of the dozens of licensed vehicles are locked at the start of the game; instead, they're hidden around the enormous map \u2013 if you find them, you can keep them. And you're free to explore the entire open-world environment at your leisure, locating challenges and races en route.</p> <p>So how does a studio go about creating a landscape designed specifically for high speed thrills? \"It's quite an interesting process,\" says creative director, Craig Sullivan. \"We start out talking about the kind of variety we want. So in Hot Pursuit, which was quite different to Most Wanted, we knew we wanted mountains so you could drive in the snow, and we wanted desert so you'd get that Vanishing Point feel. We purposefully didn't have a city because that game was all about going 200mph through rolling beautiful curves. We were also inspired by California, so we wanted beautiful coastlines, forests \u2013 almost a homage back to the original Hot Pursuit games. But with Most Wanted, we knew it had to be based around a city. We kept the coastline, though - it's our job to make something you can memorise, so if you know the coastline is on the south, you can orientate yourself around that\".</p> <p>The next step was to add specific gameplay set-pieces \u2013 an abandoned airfield, a power plant with lots of off road runs \u2013 destination areas for players to discover and experiment with. Then comes the road network, or ribbons as Criterion call it, which links everything together and accommodates the vehicle handling. The underlying ambition is to create a world that looks authentic, but that offers up a range of ridiculous possibilities. \"We've got a 500ft jump that goes across a freeway,\" says Sullivan. \"You don't get many of those in real life, but it's all about staging things so they look like they could exist. I spent a long time skateboarding when I was a kid and I understand the flow of skate parks, the lines you naturally seek out; you take a similar approach when you're driving at speed: with the best open-world games you'll find yourself, not in a funnel, but in a geometry set that feeds itself to you as you travel, which allows you to have a fun time - it's something you can get very wrong, but we'd already done Burnout Paradise so we had experience with exploration\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398091921\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350417530293/mostwanted2.jpg\" alt=\"Need For Speed: Most Wanted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Predictably, the designers are heavily inspired by real cities. During the development of Most Wanted, Criterion sent a group of its design staff to Boston, a historic city with a variety of road surfaces and architectural spaces. \"To build an authentic city, it can't all look pristine and new,\" says Sullivan. \"It needs to look as though it has been constructed over many years. We wanted cobbles, we wanted wide plaza areas and narrow alleys. I'm just about to go on vacation to LA and Hawaii and I know there are things I'll see that will make me think 'that would be cool in a game'. If you find something that looks natural, that looks like it would be fun to drive a car off or through or over, it helps with the design process. We're constantly trying to keep that balance between believability and fun\".</p> <p>Another key element of the Criterion driving experience is handling. The studio is famous for its accessible, exciting driving model, combining real-life physics with elements of classic japanese arcade design, so you get cars that feel authentic, but can still drift over a kilometre of tarmac. \"There are so many little parts that go into making a great driving experience,\" says Sullivan. \"We start out with the raw data from the manufacturers and produce an accurate simulation of what that car is like to drive; Most Wanted contains the most realistic simulation we've ever done - and we could have stayed with that. There are plenty of games out there that are all about simulating how hard it is to drive a car, but we want to go beyond that - it needs to meet your expectations of what a car is like to drive.\" </p> <p>So what does that mean for the coders? \"There's lots of Criterion DNA in there,\" says Sullivan. \"The brakes are a little bit stronger than they are in a real car so you can weave through traffic at speed. We have systems that help you control the drift \u2013 you can get the back end out doing 150-200mph \u2013 I don't know many drivers in the world who could do a 2km drift like that. In our game we have\u2026 they're not really assists, they're smart little systems that allow you to feel like you're really driving that Porsche 911. It feels believable, but it allows you to drive in a cool way\".</p> <p>These systems are the result of Criterion's obsessive approach to development, and it has been this way since the beginning. \"We spent a lot of time back in 2000, talking about the roots of driving games, talking about AM2,\" says Criterion's vice president, Alex Ward. \"That's where we started: we just discussed braking and sliding \u2013 if you don't have those right, you have nothing.\"</p> <p>Both Alex and Craig talk about the endless iteration that goes on at the studio, the compulsion to play and improve. \"We constantly change things,\" shrugs Sullivan. \"Not for the sake of change, but to improve it. Is the game too long, too short, is there enough variety? We're lucky with EA \u2013 they know we change a lot of stuff, but they're not nervous. We iterate the crap out of every game we do, we're always cutting stuff, adding stuff, right to the end. When it gets to the later stages, when the debugging begins, the team just wants people like me out of the office because I'm always tweaking stuff. There's an email I always send out, the subject header is 'just one last change' but no one ever believes that it is. They say 'can we send him on holiday?'\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398091922\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350417621884/mostwanted3.jpg\" alt=\"Need For Speed: Most Wanted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Over the years, though all of this, Criterion has learned one vital lesson: handling is all about flattering the player \u2013 even if they haven't a clue about racing lines, the apex of a curve or brake management, you mustn't tell them that. \"There's a reason you can't turn assists on and off in a Criterion game,\" says Sullivan. \"We're trying to make one experience that allows as many people as possible to have fun. There are a lot of different cars in the game and some of them are hard to drive - we have an Ariel Atom in there and I don't think theres's been one on a Need For Speed game before. It drives like a wasp; it's very quick it corners insanely but it's also very weak, if it touches anything you crash\".</p> <p>I try to interject with another question, but he's off now, breathlessly listing super cars. \"We have Bugatti Veyron in there, the Lamborghini Aventador, we've got the Koenigsegg Agera R in there, which is currently the fastest production car in the world. They all drive in a very different way, but they still have that\u2026 we're influenced by games we've played in arcades: our job as game creators is to make sure that within two minutes of picking up the controller you can drive the car how you want to drive it and nothing seems unfair. You <em>are</em> going to crash at some point but that should make you smile because you know YOU'VE messed up. That's the secret of tight, sweet-spot handling. That's what we always strive to capture\". </p> <p>Criterion has learned something else from the arcades: the importance of inter-player rivalry. Introduced in Hot Pursuit, the Autolog system would show players the times achieved by their friends on every race they attempted. This meant that, even in the single-player mode there was a constant sense of competition, you'd re-try events dozens of times to beat your friends and get to the top of the leaderboard. In Most Wanted that concept is being extended so that almost everything you do in the game can be compared against the activities of your mates. Approach a speed camera, for example, and a little table will pop up showing how fast your friends have shot through it before you. Pull off an amazing jump through one of the game's many billboards, and when your pals approach that same board in their own game, they'll find a poster of your face (taken with the Kinect or Playstation Eye camera if you have one), together with your jump distance.</p> <p>It has proven to be a remarkably popular feature already, and Criterion knows why. \"We always wanted Autolog to change the way people play racing games,\" says Sullivan. \"It was based on stuff we were doing in the office: we'd play Forza or Gran Turismo and we were writing our best times down on a white board, like in Top Gear. And we were like, 'why doesn't the game do this?' So we came up with Autolog and it immediately drove competition around the studio. We had an instance during development where some of the guys in our IT department were playing an event called Vanishing Point; the guy who designed the handling for the cars, Matt Follett, had set an amazing time that nobody could beat - the IT guys attempted it 750 times, they just tried to do it over and over again. Once they'd finally beaten it, they told Matt, who went back in and beat their record first time. He crushed them. They were devastated.\" </p> <p>The Criterion team seems to thrive on these tales of obsession. Alex Ward starts telling me about Burnout Paradise, the team's first open-world title. Some of the brand's fans weren't sure about the game, weren't sure about the move to a gigantic environment. \"We used to get people writing to us saying, you've blown it, I'm not playing this game anymore,\" he says. \"So Matt Webster would ping their telemetry and find out that they'd been playing for 870 hours. We'd write back and say, we're sorry we couldn't entertain you more.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the most important design decision in Most Wanted is the lack of a vehicle progression system. In most racers, you start off with dull everyday vehicles and have to go through a series of races before you start unlocking the really cool sports cars and exotics. But in Criterion's latest - the only cars kept from you are the one's you gain by beating the Most Wanted racers. Everything else is out on the map to discover. </p> <p>How did this come about? \"We have big ideas, but they come at different stages,\" says Sullivan. \"Most Wanted didn't start out as the game you're playing today. We course correct, we change things. We had talked about all the cars being unlocked right at the start of the project, and we spent a bit of time looking at it, but it was a hard problem to solve. So we actually started with a linear progression system. But later, when we had the basics of a game - the races, the cop chases, the open world \u2013 built, we realised we could go back and look at this idea of all the cars being open.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398091923\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350417710518/mostwanted4.jpg\" alt=\"Need For Speed: Most Wanted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For Sullivan, there was a nagging discrepancy at the heart of linear progression: how could you offer an open world, but then restrict access to vehicles? It didn't make sense. \"For the kind of games we're making, especially with Need For Speed, player choice is really important - if you go to Disneyland, they don't force you to go on the rides in a particular order. It might sound weird, but that's how we approach making our games - we don't know what every gamer likes, so we give you lots of things and it's up to you to decide. </p> <p>\"We made closed track games in the past - three or four Burnout games - there's space for that kind of title in the market, but we're focused on pushing the genre forward and we think open worlds and player choice is where it's at. Driving around a track, be it real or fictional, there's only so much we can bring to that: you can improve the visuals - where else is there to go? We want game designs that support new experiences, things that we might not even know we're going to design - we don't want to hem everything in\".</p> <p>Alex Ward is even more bullish in his dismissal of standard racing game progression structures. \"Do you want to drive the Aston Martin right now? The Carrera? Why not? 20 years of driving convention says you can't, but why not? People said the game would have no meaning, but no - put the cars in the world and go drive them. Find the Caterham and take it out. And once you've found it you can switch to it at any time. </p> <p>\"I don't want to make you backtrack around the map. Gaming is changing, this is where we 're going. That's why there's no story in the game - I don't want a story, the game is about me! It's about me and my friends. The stuff we're working on with most Wanted and beyond\u2026 it's like, that's tradition, but fuck it, let's do <em>this</em>. Why can't I drive all the cars? If I buy a DVD I can watch the ending straight away if I like. If DVDs were like games they'd make you watch the Dutch version to get an achievement. But that's the past. Grinding is dead\".</p> <p>So, about the future. What will the new consoles bring? I didn't expect Sullivan to engage with the question, developers can be wary about moving away from the safe ground of their current project. He thinks for a second. \"Even bad games have good graphics these days - it's quite easy to do good graphics,\" he says. \"There are other things to do with the next generation of hardware that developers need to embrace to make a true next gen experience\".</p> <p>What things? \"Look at the last five or six Criterion games: we strongly believe friends are the heart of it all, we know that Autolog is here to stay - all games should be connected. The cross-platform stuff is interesting, lots of platforms talking to each other, gaming everywhere, making the best out of Kinect and cameras. It's about embracing all that. You can't rely on the fact that the graphics will be better. It should be about next generation game design, not just a prettier experience. The same thing happens in movies \u2013 to me The Matrix didn't just look amazing, it was almost like a new experience. Generational change means finding new things to grab your attention\".</p> <p>So we end up talking about where Criterion is going, about this studio's role in the future Sullivan envisages. \"There's still a lot of stuff we want to do with driving,\" he says. \" We <em>will</em> make another Burnout game at some point. Obviously, as we're working on NFS we're thinking of really good ideas that aren't right for this series; there are ideas that we're going to explore with Burnout. And we wouldn't be making NFS or Burnout games if we didn't think the driving genre had a long shelf life and that we could push the boundaries. There's a lot of new stuff in Most Wanted, a lot for people to get their heads around - and sometimes there's only so much explaining you can do - we've reined in some of the ideas we had for this game, they were a little ahead of their time\".</p> <p>Okay, I say, let's imagine you're going to tackle another classic game series, you can take anything you like \u2013 what would it be? \"When we did Burnout Paradise we did some motorbike DLC and now everyone thinks that we're going to do Road Rash at some point,\" says Sullivan. \"I had a lot of fun playing that game, we think bikes are fun. We might make a Road Rash game\u2026. But then we might make a game without vehicles in it. I mean, we made Black, I was the lead designer \u2013 we might make a game about blowing the crap out of each other!\"</p> <p>He pauses and smiles, before pointedly adding, \"but Road Rash seems like a good fit for Criterion\u2026\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Need For Speed: Most Wanted is released for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 2 November</em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/18/rio20-france-agenda-poverty-environment\" title=\"\">Pascal Canfin, the French development minister</a>, is more interested in policies with the potential to help or hurt poor countries than in meeting aid targets.</p> <p>It is an approach that contrasts with the UK where the development debate \u2013 to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/17/faultline-ngos-future-development\" title=\"\">the frustration of some NGOs</a> \u2013 seems overly focused on Britain's pledge to devote 0.7% of its gross national income (GNI) to aid, a target it is due to meet next year.</p> <p>\"Aid is critical, but we need to act in other dimensions such as trade and agriculture,\" said Canfin, who is attending the <a href=\"http://live.eudevdays.eu/agenda\" title=\"\">EU's annual development days</a>. An event that brings together a sprinkling of heads of state \u2013 President Joyce Banda of Malawi is here, ministers, development experts and NGOs, the theme this year is sustainable and inclusive growth for human development.</p> <p>Canfin, who was on a panel on social protection, outlined France's approach to development to the Guardian at the start of the conference on Tuesday. The former MEP, who set up an NGO called <a href=\"http://www.finance-watch.org/\" title=\"\">Finance Watch</a> which pushed for greater transparency in financial flows, said France, where aid makes up only 0.46% of GNI, planned to meet the 0.7% target by putting in 10% of revenues from a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-31/french-lawmakers-pass-budget-bill-including-transaction-tax.html\" title=\"\">financial transactions tax</a>, expected to raise \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn). Legislation pending in November will fix the 10% figure into law.</p> <p>But Canfin's interests and priorities lie elsewhere. He and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande are making a big push for the EU's directives on transparency and accounting, currently making their way through the system. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/19/eu-tougher-transparency-law-extractive\" title=\"\">directives, which were approved by a key parliamentary committee last month,</a> require companies to publish their payments to foreign governments. The move received strong backing from Hollande when he was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Senegal last week.</p> <p>The French leader said he favoured \"real\" transparency, with extractive industries reporting not just country by country but also project by project, without exception. NGOs have been pressing hard on this last point in the belief that high transparency in the accounts of powerful western companies will help lift the \"resource curse\" \u2013 whereby wealth in countries with abundant natural resources remains with a small elite.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/05/africa-mineral-wealth-poverty-world-bank\" title=\"\">World Bank report</a> said that although African countries with natural resources have enjoyed high economic growth \u2013 such as Angola \u2013 there has been little poverty reduction.</p> <p>\"We are very committed with the Nordic countries to these directives; they are our red line,\" said Canfin. \"We want them to be as strong as US standards. That way it will set a 'pre-global standard' and we can go to Japan and China and say 'this is what we're doing'.\"</p> <p>Canfin applauded support for strong transparency rules from Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, last week, saying the UK position is key. \"In the past month, there seemed to be an erosion of support in the UK, so it was important for Clegg to reaffirm British support.\"</p> <p>Canfin is counting \u2013 perhaps overoptimistically \u2013 on the directives leading to more wealth staying in developing countries as they negotiate better deals with western companies. \"This could have a tremendous impact on development, and the budgetary costs to developed countries would be close to zero,\" he said, an acknowledgment of the pressure to cut aid budgets in the west.</p> <p>Elaborating on the theme that aid is just a component of development, Canfin said France would hold a public debate on development policy next month. \"It's a debate we have not had for more than 15 years and it will cover more than aid,\" he said. He praised Britain's efforts to push for greater transparency and public accountability of its aid, adding: \"Aid is one topic of consideration, but we also need to consider other areas \u2013 finance, agriculture and trade.\"</p> <p>On agriculture, particularly the common agricultural policy (CAP), which has been criticised for damaging the interests of poor countries despite reforms that have curbed the worst excesses, Canfin said France \u2013 where farmers have resisted CAP changes \u2013 would push for a \"greener, more sustainable\" EU policy. On trade, he said France was willing to delay a 2014 deadline for completing economic partnership agreements (EPAs). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/12/trade-talks-europe-africa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">EPAs are disliked by poor countries for forcing them to open their markets to competition that they cannot withstand</a>. Canfin said France was willing to change the deadline to 2016, to allow more time to take into account the reservations of developing countries.</p> <p>France's broad approach to development finds favour among some NGOs. \"There are two main approaches emerging to look at the developing framework. One is the traditional aid-centred agenda, and the other is to build a more comprehensive framework looking at the issue of coherent policies, innovative financing, democratisation and human rights,\" said Olivier Consolo of <a href=\"http://www.concordeurope.org/\" title=\"\">Concord</a>, a group of European NGOs. \"Both governments and NGOs need to focus more on this comprehensive framework, looking ahead to the post-2015 agenda, which will also bring into discussion an international sustainable development framework.\"</p>",

It's a bit of a stretch, then, to put The Stranger or The Plague in the same category as Totti's travel guide.

Jaws in book form, so the theory goes, is about infidelity rather than a gigantic shark that swims about the place eating people. Similarly it can be argued that Defender!, Striker! and Sweeper!, written when Bruce was manager of Huddersfield Town, are about murder, the bloodlust of the human condition and the scattered thoughts of a man staring into the abyss rather than football. Unfortunately, in the same way that Jaws really is about a gigantic shark that swims about the place eating people, so Bruce's three books really are about football, and particularly about \"Leddersford Town\" manager \"Steve Barnes\".

(2)</h2> <p><strong>Last week we looked at the players and managers just as happy with their feet on the pedals as they are, or were, with their foot on the ball. This week reader Stig Nygard has pointed us towards two players who went further than just the odd commute. </strong></p> <p>The former Middlesbrough, Juventus, Marseille and Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli had been a fan of cycling as a child, but his interest really took off following Marco Pantani's victory double in the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France in 1998. Ravenelli had met Il Pirate while playing for Juventus \u2013 \"He was prematurely bald, I was prematurely grey, so we got on famously\" \u2013 and his wins in the grand tours were an inspiration.</p> <p>But it was not until his retirement in 2005 that he was able to devote time to his new passion. And in 2008 he and his brother Andrea set up their own racing team, <a href=\"http://www.garminrevolution.it/partners/fabrizio-ravanelli-umbria-cycling-team\" title=\"\">Umbria Cycling Team</a>. \"As you'd expect, I get recognised a fair bit by the other riders,\" <a href=\"http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/mysecretvice/225/article.aspx\" title=\"\">he told FourFourTwo in 2008</a>. \"Everyone's really friendly, though. I'll be chugging along and all of a sudden I'll hear 'Ravanelli, was football not hard enough for you? Why are you putting yourself through all this pain?' They're right, too: I suffer a lot more on a bike than I ever did on the football pitch.\"</p> <p>He claimed at least one amateur victory and has taken on some of the biggest climbs in Europe. \"Last year I went with Caruso to the Swiss border to climb two of the most famous and hardest mountain passes in Italy \u2013 the Passo dello Stelvio and the Mortirolo,\" he said. \"The Stelvio is nearly 3,000m above sea level, and, at the top, we were riding between two vast walls of snow. The jubilation I felt at getting to the summit wasn't dissimilar to winning the Champions League. It's the same rush.\"</p> <p>But one player who would leave Ravanelli trailing in his wake in the mountains, if not on the pitch, is Norway's Knut Anders Fostervold. Fostervold enjoyed an eight-year career with Molde between 1994 and 2002, during which time the club were regular qualifiers for European football. Although his most famous moment will probably remain <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEt8apZZuj0\" title=\"\">this dive against Stabaek</a> (later mimicked by John Carew), in 1999-2000 he captained Molde during their most successful ever run in Europe when they reached the Champions League group stage. The club may have exited the competition after winning only one game and finishing bottom of the group, but Fostervold wore the armband at the Bernab\u00e9u against the eventual champions Real Madrid and that's a claim to fame not many can match.</p> <p>A brief loan spell at Grimsby Town followed in 2000-01 (it's not very fondly remembered at Blundell Park \u2013 \"Capable of playing centre-back, left-back or left wing-back apparently \u2026 sluggish with or without the ball and clumsy in possession\" is the recollection of <a href=\"http://thefishy.co.uk/story.php?id=8315781\" title=\"\">Grimsby fansite, The Fishy</a>) and his career came to an end due to a knee injury in 2002 at the age of 35.</p> <p>For a couple of years Fostervold cycled purely for fun, but in 2004 he began taking the sport seriously. In 2005 he came third in the Norwegian time-trial championship behind current Team Sky coach Kurt Asle Arvesen and future world champion Thor Hushovd. In 2006 he came third again, with Arvesen winning, and in 2007 he beat Arvesen for the first time only to finish second behind Edvald Boasson Hagen, who would go on to win five in a row. Despite the lack of wins in time trials he did at different times hold the Norwegian 10km, 20km and 30km time trial records.</p> <p>He even got the chance to fight for the world title. With Hushovd and Arvesen choosing not to compete in the time trial at the 2006 or 2007 world championships, Fostervold competed as Norway's representative. In 2006 he came 43rd out of 52 and in 2007 51st out of 69, each time finishing around five minutes behind the winner Fabien Cancellara.</p> <p>His VO2 max was, at his peak, registered at 94, the second-highest ever recorded by a Norwegian. But it was his bike-handing ability that held him back from the very top. \"I need to learn how to cycle, I'm a junior,\" he said after the 2006 world championships. He never quite got there, however, and ended his second sporting career in 2009 \u2026 only to begin a <a href=\"http://www.3atlet.no/kan-fostervold-vinne-norseman.4869943-170050.html\" title=\"\">third sporting career in triathlon</a>, finishing <a href=\"https://www.box.com/shared/xqhodrlfys4vczgc9f0b\" title=\"\">sixth in the 2011 Norseman Extreme Triathlon</a>.</p> <h2>CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TEAMS RELEGATED</h2> <p><strong>\"Last season Villarreal competed in the Champions League and got relegated,\" </strong>writes Chris Meli. <strong>\"Has this ever happened before?\"</strong></p> <p>Plenty of times, Chris. A particularly interesting case was the collapse of Romanian minnows Unirea Urziceni, as pointed out by Jake Miller. Unirea finished second in the Romanian League in 2009-10 and enjoyed a solid Champions League campaign in 2010-11 (beating Rangers 4-1 at Ibrox in the group stage) and another second-placed league finish. Defeat in their qualifier against Zenit St Petersburg was the final straw for the chairman Dumitru Bucsaru. Bucsaru, one of Romania's richest men, had bankrolled the club's rise and now he wanted his money back.</p> <p>The Observer picks up the story in 2011: \"Bucsaru launched his exit strategy: selling off the best of the squad and, after defeat to Liverpool in the Europa League, watching the remnants slide to relegation. Last week, authorities confirmed Bucsaru had walked away, leaving behind a shell of a club with a tax debt of \u20ac1.5m. Fixtures and fittings are being sold off to help cover that \u2013 including the turnstiles, listed at \u20ac85k.\"</p> <p>(You can read more about the rise and fall of Unirea Urziceni <a href=\"http://playingthepercentages.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/rise-and-fall-of-unirea-urziceni.html\" title=\"\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://scoutingromania.com/2011/10/27/unirea-urziceni-success-can-kill-you/\" title=\"\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://scoutingromania.com/2011/07/09/remember-unirea-urziceni-well-you-might-as-well-just-forget-about-it/\" title=\"\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://theovallog.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/tyrannical-bucsaru-murders-unirea-urziceni/\" title=\"\">here</a>.)</p> <p>The 2009-10 season was also a fine one for Sampdoria. Under the tutelage of Gigi Del Neri, Giampaolo Pazzini and Antonio Cassano fired the <em>Blucerchiati </em>to fourth spot in Serie A and a place in the Champions League. The Piazza De Ferrari in Genoa saw a party the like of which it had never seen before. The 2010-11 season was not so vintage. Twenty-four hours after securing fourth place, Del Neri left the club for Juventus. Werder Bremen knocked them out of the Champions League in the play-off round with a 5-4 aggregate victory. Pazzini and Cassano followed Del Neri out of the door in the winter transfer window. And a season that began in the Champions League ended in relegation.</p> <p>Chievo suffered a similar fate in 2006-07. The previous season the Flying Donkeys were one of the beneficiaries of Juventus's off-field problems and saw their fifth-place Serie A finish turned into fourth and a Champions League spot. But their European adventure ended at the hands of Levski Sofia in the qualifying round. And on the final day of the season the Flying Donkeys lost at Catania, a result which kept the home side up at Chievo's expense. \"Kiss those asses goodbye,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/28/europeanfootball.sport?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">wrote our very own James Richardson</a>.</p> <p>Several sides have fallen foul of off-field issues. Most recently Rangers competed in the Champions League in 2011-12, only to find themselves dumped down to the Third Division in 2012-13. Similarly, off-field problems saw Juventus, Champions League quarter-finalists in 2005-06, relegated to the second tier for the 2006-07 season. A similar fate befell Milan after the Totonero scandal in 1979-80. And Austrian champions Tirol Innsbruck were beaten in the qualifying round by Lokomotiv Moscow in 2001-02 and despite ending the season atop the Austrian Bundesliga once more, they were relegated two divisions to the regional leagues due to their financial difficulties and began the 2002-03 campaign as WSG Wattens/FC Wacker Tirol.</p> <p>The Danish side Hvidovre began 1974-75 facing (and losing to) Poland's Ruch Chorzow in the European Cup first round and ended it bottom and relegated. It happened again in Denmark in 2000-01, when Herfolge were battered 6-0 by Rangers in the third qualifying round of the Champions League and relegated come the season's end. And N\u00fcrnberg won the German title in 1967-68, were beaten by Ajax in the first round of the European Cup in 1968-69 and ended that season an unfortunate second-bottom of the Bundesliga, <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit69.html\" title=\"\">in one of the closest divisions of all time</a>.</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\"Here in the Basque country,\" </strong>wrote Tim Tregrenza back in those halcyon days of 2006, <strong>\"there are football teams that select only Basque players. Athletic Bilbao is the most famous, but there is also Eibar (in the second division) and other lower league teams. Are there any other clubs around the world who have a similar policy?\"</strong></p> <p>Indeed there are, Tim, with the most famous being Club Deportivo de Guadalajara (also known as Chivas \u2013 Spanish for \"goats\") in Mexico. The most widely supported team in the country, Chivas have fielded only Mexican-born players for a century. Their wealthy owner, the businessman and film producer Jorge Vergara, also owns two other clubs: Costa Rica's Deportivo de Saprissa (recently beaten by Liverpool at the World Club Championship) and US Major League team Club Deportivo Chivas USA. Saprissa only use Costa Rican players, but Chivas USA's original plan to recruit only Mexican players was denied by the MLS's restrictions on foreign players. However, when the expansion side first kicked off in 2005, all but four of the 28 players in their squad were Hispanic; even their Dutch coach Thomas Rongen enrolled in a Spanish language course.</p> <p>Ecuadorian side Club Deportivo El Nacional, from the city of Quito, are another team with a restricted selection policy. According to Wikipedia, \"Nacional is called so because it belongs to the Ecuadorian military and because only players with Ecuadorian nationality are allowed to play on the team. This is why the team is nicknamed Puros Criollos (\"All-Creoles\") or El Equipo Militar (\"The Military Team\").\"</p> <p>The same source also explains the selection policy of Singaporean S-League team Young Lions. \"While the bulk of the squad is made up of members of Singapore's Under-23 team, the club also take in promising young foreign players.

Countless policy pronouncements and political speeches make it clear that, if only we could find ways of working smarter, applying \"lean\" thinking, and being \"transformational\", our concerns about funding constraints, rising demand and gloomy economic predictions would magically disappear.</p> <p>The \"Nicholson Challenge\", named after the NHS chief executive who first sought to map the scale of the financial challenge, suggests the NHS needs to find an average of 4% productivity gains each year from 2012 to 2015. To put this in context, an annual productivity gain of 2% is usually considered realistic for the private sector. What is more, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that the NHS, although theoretically benefiting from ringfenced funding for the next three years, in reality faces a decade of flat funding, once the effects of rising demand, inflation and other cost pressures are taken into account.</p> <p>How are NHS hospitals to respond to this productivity challenge? Earlier this year, the Nuffield Trust published a review of international research evidence about the factors known to have an impact on hospital efficiency. Our report, <a href=\"http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/publications/can-nhs-hospitals-do-more-less\" title=\"\">Can NHS hospitals do more with less?</a>, highlighted the critical role of the following: leadership, management and staff engagement; technology adoption; hospital operational processes; staff productivity; and the external policy environment.</p> <p>One of the review's main conclusions was that, despite a lot of knowledge about the factors that drive hospital efficiency \u2013 such as length of stay, rates of day case surgery, electronic prescribing systems, and streamlined purchasing of hospital supplies \u2013 significant variation persists in the performance of individual hospitals. This evidence indicates the need for forensic analysis of the levels of efficiency of individual hospital services (both cost and quality), coupled with expert support for managers and clinicians who are seeking to address those areas found to be wanting in respect of evidence-based practice.</p> <p>With this in mind, the Nuffield Trust has partnered with the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement \u2013 the body charged with supporting the development of improved management and organisational practice in the NHS \u2013 to mount a one-day conference for senior NHS managers, finance directors and clinical leaders. The conference takes the findings of the Nuffield Trust research and uses case studies of best practice, from the UK and overseas, to explore how hospitals can take practical steps to really do more with less.</p> <p>The conference, some of which will be live-streamed, will cover the experience of improving hospital efficiency in Denmark and Sweden; the development of paperless offices in Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; the move to electronic prescribing at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; and overall hospital efficiency improvement in Wolverhampton and Taunton and Somerset.</p> <p>What we know from international research into hospital efficiency, and what this week's conference will no doubt reinforce, is that there is no magic \"transformational\" golden bullet.</p> <p>What is needed is relentless attention to the detail of basic administrative and management practice, including the purchasing of supplies, organisation of back-office functions, and assessment of the performance of every department, ward and consultant against national and international benchmarks.</p> <p>To do more for less, the NHS needs to get back to basics.</p> <p><em>Judith Smith is head of policy at the Nuffield Trust and is co-chairing the trust's event </em><a href=\"http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/live/how-can-hospitals-do-more-less\" title=\"\"><em>How can hospitals do more with less?

  "<p>I go straight into the subject and in answer to my first question , Bill Adams smiles and says: </p> <blockquote> <p>I'm marching to think about a new future for my kids, and their kids</p> </blockquote> <p><br>He's thought carefully about what it means to him to march on Saturday and he sums it up like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>The government's attitude to reducing the deficit is completely flawed - what they are doing is making things worse. We need to look at how we finance things in this country, our tax system, benefits and welfare. We need a new social contract between business, government and the workforce.</p> </blockquote> <p>Throughout our interview, Adams glances frequently at the picture of his three children on his office wall, one a student and the other two with jobs but not sustainable ones, not good ones. His daughter, who has a history degree, manages a restaurant, but it's not what she wants to do. Every interview she goes to elicits the same response \u2013 not enough experience. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397865603\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350402132080/Adams1.jpg\" alt=\"TUC march\" width=\"460\" height=\"294\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Adams in Leeds, getting ready for Saturday's march in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His son manages a website, making sure the sales are up, and his other son is at still at university. Like millions of parents in Britain, he worries what a decade of austerity will bring for his children. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/about_bbarber.cfm\">Brendan (Barber)</a> has led the opposition to austerity better than any politician. I really believe that Brendan has the right strategies. We're not saying that we won't rebalance the economy but it needs to be done in such a way that gets people paying tax rather than drawing benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>Outside his office there are reminder of the economic crisis. In the heart of the financial sector in Leeds, For Sale and To Let signs hang like bunting and there's a queue outside the job centre. Adams has been involved with the trade union movement since leaving school at 16 to take up an apprenticeship. After years of low paid work,getting up at 5am, 6 days a week, he returned to full-time education in 1989, earning a law degree at the University of Central Lancashire. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397865604\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350402213181/Adams2.jpg\" alt=\"TUC March\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs of recession in the heart of Leeds, England's second biggest financial centre after London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, he jokes, he gets up at six and,works five days a week although I suspect Adams works round the clock. He began as a workplace union rep, then became an education officer and is now the TUC regional secretary of Yorkshire and the Humber.</p> <p>He is deputy chair of his old university where applications dropped by 15% this year. Adams shakes his head and says that no-one believed him when he warned fee increases would deter applications from lower income or working class homes. He wants a new deal for young people: </p> <blockquote> <p>Good jobs they could aspire to or damn good training vocational schemes. <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/about_fogrady.cfm\">Francis O'Grady </a>was right, she's bang on with climate change, green energy,skills and investment for our young people. We should be saying - there's no such thing as dole lad, you turn up here and you're training to be an engineer. That to me is the long term, sustainability.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adams would rein in the worst excesses of the banks and look for ways of providing sound financial help for ordinary people \u2013 there are 25,000 people in Leeds who don't have a bank account. He sees a particular role for the north in this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>New ideas need to come in. There's plenty out there. A British Investment Bank based in the north of England, for instance, would send out a message that says: 'We're not the poor neighbour.' Leeds is the second biggest financial centre in the UK. We've got the right people, the rights skills \u2013 all sorts of people who could take that on. </p> </blockquote> <p>As things stand, he reckons there's virtually an investment strike - not just in the north but across the UK. Billions of pounds that could be used to rebuild the economy are sitting in banks. Adams believes that with investment, the north could develop strong local economies. The appetite for green technology for instance, with some of the biggest polluters in terms of power stations, cement works and chemicals based in the region. The legacy of the north's expertise in heavy industry could breed world leaders in new technologies which merge engineering prowess with scientific advances to create sustainable, well-paid jobs in carbon capture and green energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397865605\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350402298533/adams3.jpg\" alt=\"TUC march\" width=\"460\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The job centre down the road in Leeds.

But a pipeline out to the gas fields in the North Sea which would have reduced carbon by 40% was cancelled when the \u00a31 million cost proved prohibitive. That saddens Adams: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We could have been a world leader in that technology. We've got <a href=\"http://www.forewind.co.uk/dogger-bank/overview.html\">Doggger Bank</a>, wind and wave power \u2013 loads of platforms on which to build the north's economy with good jobs. Not \u00a36-an-hour jobs but work for engineers, technicians and skilled construction staff.</p> <p>A think tank at Leeds city council recently asked: how are we going to get through the next few years without completely dismantling what the council does? One answer is through encouraging civic entrepreneurism \u2013 relocating companies, getting them to come here and invest in the economic front, taking advantage of the special skills that people in Leeds have in abundance - but also putting something back into the community as part of a long term plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adams worries that:</p> <blockquote> <p>A small elite of people own and run so much and outside of that no-one really has any power, any control over national politics, any stake in the companies or organisations that they work for. There is a sense of hopelessness, but I think that has generated a new type of activism as we've seen with Occupy, with student populations getting political again, fighting back on what has happened to them. A lot of unemployed young people are looking to get involved , to change things.</p> <p>I've noticed how across the region so many groups being set up out of dismay and thinking: we can do something if we get together.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What do you think?

We've had 15 000 leaflets printed for Saturday. We're putting on rail and coach travel from York. No mean feat for an organisation that was looking at closure earlier in the year. It's full steam ahead. Unions and grassroots organisations in York are working well together since people got stuck in to get stuff done, get things moving. People are prepared to do that now.</p> <p>We've got more active , and its probably a natural reaction. Where else is there to go as a defence mechanism ? We're the only hope.

He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>With tightening of budgets, they want you to do more with less, they're trying to take certain conditions off you. The cost of living has increased and there's nothing left in our house. You're always skint now when you've got two kiddies.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> By contrast, the Trade Union movement for Clark has:</p> <blockquote> <p>got a good positive feel to it, I feel really optimistic in a historical sense.</p> </blockquote> <p>The feeling is shared by colleagues Reece Gascinski <a href=\"http://www.usdaw.org.uk/\">(USDAW)</a> and John Wilson <a href=\"http://www.yorkdwc.co.uk/\">(York Disabled Workers Co-Operative)</a>. Wilson is a disabled worker who, after <a href=\"http://www.remploy.co.uk/\">the closing of Remploy</a>, was assisted by the GMB to create a workers co-operative. Across the trade union movement, there is disgust at the treatment of the disabled by the current government and every activist I speak to raises the issue of Remploy closures. Wilson says:</p> <blockquote> <p>We thought it was wrong. We fought a number of campaigns and marches to try and get the factory saved because we thought York was a unique case with higher numbers of acutely disabled employed. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397863706\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350405267108/York2.jpg\" alt=\"TUC march\" width=\"220\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In session under the white rose: the revived York & Dstrict Trades Council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nobody listened so Wilson thought he'd try and do something about it. He describes how the <a href=\"http://www.gmb.org.uk/\">GMB </a>and <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/\">UNITE </a>unions raised \u00a360,000 and says:</p> <blockquote> <p>We did a feasibility study on screen printing and woodwork. One of the union guys said: 'I can get some surplus wood.' If timber is a bit warped the companies throw it out so we got about \u00a310,000 of wood given and started from there. The co-operative redeployed 10% of the 53 Remploy workforce who have since been laid off.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wilson says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The thing about Remploy was that people were treated just exactly as if they were in a factory \u2013 with decent wages, pensions, holidays, everything. The factory wasn't just where we worked, it was our whole social life. It was somewhere with people to talk to. We felt that there was somebody that could help and that we were part of a group. We weren't just ignored. That's the saddest part about what is happening now. Some of the ones with learning difficulties are easily isolated from other people. In Remploy they could help do something and feel as though they were important. When Remploy closed they said they would organise meetings and stuff but it didn't happen.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youthfightforjobs.com/\">Youth Fight For Jobs</a>, who are represented on York and District TUC, went to the Remploy factory in Leeds, Wilson said. They found</p> <blockquote> <p>a worker there who'd come along to support a Youth Fight For Jobs event previously. He broke down crying because he was so upset that he could lose his job, and that was his life. What are they going to do? They're going to put these people on disability benefit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wilson is a self-confessed member of the 'old guard' and says:</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't think that people understand that every basic right that people have at work \u2013 from clean running water, to canteens to sick pay to maternity benefits to unfair dismissals - was fought for by working people. It wasn't given to them. When I started work 40 years ago, we didn't have proper doors on the toilets, we didn't have clean running water, we had no masks, no health and safety and people died. I used to work in a foundry where things were swinging around above you. People seem to forget that we didn't even have clean running water to go and drink. I think people sometimes think: what do the unions do for me? But we've helped them every step of the way.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397863707\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350405326757/York1.jpg\" alt=\"TUC march\" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fighting for their factory: the Remploy workers in Leeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br> Reece Gascinski is 20 and a newly-appointed USDAW workplace rep. He came into trade unionism when he realised that students like him who depend on part-time employment to keep their heads above water are:</p> <blockquote> <p>part of a precarious economic group in unstable forms of employment. When I started my job, at the place where I work, me and a number of students were facing the same disciplinary procedures and we didn't know what our rights were. I became a trade unionist to try and encourage younger people to get involved. One of the campaigns that we are running in York is a workers' rights awareness in the student unions to encourage younger people. There is an alternative and there is someone who is standing up for you whether you think you're alone or not.</p> </blockquote> <p>Like every trade unionist, Gascinski has an acute awareness of the impact upon community that austerity is having. He's angry at the effects on his grandmother:</p> <blockquote> <p>Nana's worked her whole life. The pensions she's got is appalling. Since austerity came in she had to choose if she would have the heating on or if she would eat. When you've worked your whole life you deserve better. This is a global crisis and we need a different response.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>He thinks it important that young people take part in the march and stand beside lifelong members like Wilson. Despite his youth, Gascinski believes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the TUC can get public opinion against austerity we can better the system. Its not just about my generation, it's for generations to come.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What do you think?

  "<p>The management consultants have discovered co-operatives, and it seems that they rather like what they've found. McKinsey &amp; Company released its much-heralded report <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/client_service/strategy/latest_thinking/mckinsey_on_cooperatives\" title=\"\">McKinsey on Co-operatives</a> on Tuesday last week (9 October) at the <a href=\"http://www.2012intlsummit.coop/site/home\" title=\"\">international cooperative summit in Quebec</a> where their global managing director Dominic Barton arrived to deliver the findings. \"The time has come for the [cooperative] model to be put forward and celebrated,\" he told his audience. He called for a shift generally in business from \"shareholder value to stakeholder value\" and strongly criticised the short-termism of conventional business, driven by the need to produce three-monthly financial accounts for investors. \"Quarterly capitalism does not lead to good results. The short term pressure is toxic,\" he said.</p> <p>McKinsey's study, commissioned for the <a href=\"http://www.2012intlsummit.coop/site/home\" title=\"\">Quebec conference</a> by the host organisation the Quebec-based financial co-operative <a href=\"http://www.desjardins.com/en/\" title=\"\">Desjardins</a>, claims to be the first in-depth analysis by a major management consultancy of the co-operative model. The report begins by pointing out that co-operative organisations have a significant economic presence in the world today and suggests that, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, there is now a real opportunity for co-operatives to extend their reach. Dominic Barton identified trust in particular as a key advantage for the sector. \"Trust in business generally has been in decline since 1966, except in places like India and China. But when you look at trust in co-operatives, the move has been in a positive direction,\" he said.</p> <p>The McKinsey study begins by challenging the widely held view that co-operatives grow more slowly than their plc competitors. The data published by the firm suggests that co-ops' growth rates are comparable to those in other forms of business, although McKinsey says that the way growth is achieved is different, being primarily focused on their members' current needs than on developing new markets: \"Based on our analysis, we see two primary growth opportunities for co-operatives.</p> <p>First, co-ops should play to their natural strengths and continue to pursue market-share gains by delivering a unique member and customer experience. The other big growth opportunity for co-ops, and probably the one with the most potential, is to more actively pursue opportunities in fast-growing adjacent markets,\" the report claims.</p> <p>McKinsey also scrutinises co-operatives' organisational performance relative to other business models. The study suggests that coops achieve success in employee mobilisation behind a 'sense of higher purpose', and it produces a set of data from north American co-operative banks which show higher levels of customer satisfaction compared with conventional banks. But McKinsey also claims that co-operatives in general suffer when it comes to 'organisational agility' \u2013 or in other words that they move more slowly when it comes to addressing problems or taking up new opportunities: \"Part of this is attributable to less effective performance-management systems and part is \u2013 according to our interviews \u2013 due to the naturally slower pace of democratic decision-making processes,\" the report argues.</p> <p>Another claim is that co-operatives are also lagging behind plcs when it comes to finding and nurturing the human talent they need for success. Co-operatives could learn from commercial competitors in areas such as recruiting from outside their existing workforce, broadening staff experience through job rotation and mobility programmes and extending the experience of management by leadership training. McKinsey praises the Belgian insurance co-op <a href=\"http://www.pv.be/\" title=\"\">P&amp;V</a>, the US Farmers Co-operative and Desjardins for what it says are examples of good practice in this respect.</p> <p>The McKinsey study also scrutinises in more detail three sectors where co-operatives have historically had strong roots, those of banking, retailing and agriculture. It warns, for example, of the potential implications of the rapid growth of online purchases compared with traditional high street shopping.</p> <p>McKinsey's study was subjected to a high-level debate at the Quebec summit from a range of participants including the Nobel prizewinning economist A. Michael Spence from Stanford University and Nigel Vooght, global leader for financial services with consultancy <a href=\"http://www.pwc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">PwC</a>. In general the strongly upbeat tone introduced by Dominic Barton was maintained.</p> <p>Nigel Vooght offered his audience of co-operative business leaders his own strong endorsement of their business model: \"There is a great opportunity for the sector, given the crisis we've been through. There is a flight to quality and security, and cooperatives have a model which is successful,\" he said.</p> <p>The strong British contingent at the Quebec summit are likely to have carried on reading to a later section of the McKinsey study, where the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operative Group's</a> current chief executive Peter Marks is given space in a chief executive round table debate to offer his own thoughts. Marks argues robustly for co-ops to adopt a strong approach to business efficiency and competitiveness. \"There's no point using the cooperative model as a differentiator if your products and services are not as good as those offered by competitors,\" he says. He also takes a swipe at some of the frustrations he clearly feels from the workings of the Co-operative Group's somewhat convoluted democracy: \"I simply do not think that more people will participate in the governance of cooperatives. And yes, I think this situation does threaten the model, the main danger being that when you have only a few people running the show, they might impose their political prejudices on the majority,\" he says. \"I also see those attitudes in our boardroom, with people espousing political views and advocating ideas that contradict the actual commercial interests of the business. I think that this is a flaw in the co-operative model,\" he adds.</p> <p>In general, though, the strong consensus emerging from Quebec would seem to be that co-operatives have a real chance now to improve their business performance and commercial success through actively stressing their co-operative ethical values. McKinsey's Dominic Barton finished his presentation with a comment which he attributed to the influential economist Adam Smith: \"The duty of the entrepreneur is to take care of the society in which they operate.\" He got a strong round of applause from his co-operative audience in response.</p> <p><em>Andrew Bibby is a professional writer and journalist</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The Atlantic ocean off Cornwall and the west coast of Scotland show the greatest promise for generating electricity from the waves that crash around the British Isles, according to new research.</p> <p>The regions came top in <a href=\"http://www.carbontrust.com/media/202649/ctc816-uk-wave-energy-resource.pdf\">a report</a> which maps, for the first time, the sites around the UK with the most potential for wave power. Some of the highest waves, in the Rockall Trough to the west of Scotland, measure up to 29m from crest to trough.</p> <p>Rows of wave \"farms\" up to 1,000km long facing the Atlantic could generate around 11% of the UK's current power generation, the Carbon Trust analysis suggests. While the theoretical resource is as high as 18GW, around 10GW of capacity is more realistic given practical and economic constraints, it said.</p> <p>Stephen Wyatt, the report's author, said: \"The promise is huge. The UK has become the world's proving ground for wave and tidal energy. The potential home market for wave power while significant is even greater abroad. The International Energy Agency have estimated a global market of up to 200GW of marine power by 2050. If the UK were to capture some 15% of this the benefits for the UK economy have been evaluated at \u00a34bn.\"</p> <p>While the technology to harness the renewable source of energy is still at an early stage, it is hoped <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/30/scotland-first-marine-energy-park\" title=\"\">a test bed off Orkney</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/23/marine-power-south-west-england\" title=\"\">a wave \"hub\" off Cornwall</a> will bring it to commercial scale. \"We don't yet have commercial devices that have been built and tested at the scale needed to operate in such hostile and remote environments. But we may not be waiting for too long,\" said Wyatt.</p> <p>The Scottish government, in particular, has talked up the economic and environmental promise of wave power, with first minister Alex Salmond <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/sep/27/wave-and-tidal-power-alex-salmond\" title=\"\">saying last year</a> that the machines will in the next few years move to \"substantial commercial development\". In August, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/28/orkney-green-energy-wave-power\" title=\"\">Scotland launched a \u00a310m competition</a> for wave- and tidal-powered devices. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/20/uk-exporter-wave-tidal-power\" title=\"\">MPs in February said</a> the UK could become a leader exporter of such technology if given significant government backing.</p> <p>The Carbon Trust examined the UK's Exclusive Economic Zone to see which areas had the most energy potential, at the lowest cost. It concluded the best sites could generate electricity at a cost of 20-25.3p/kWh, compared to around 5.5-11p/kWh for gas power and 8-11p/kWh for onshore wind today.</p> <p>The ideal sites were those that offered the best balance between how close they were to shore, water depth and raw wave energy. Wyatt told the Guardian: \"It was surprising that the best sites were so far offshore \u2013 our analysis indicates that it is worth going so far offshore to harness the more energetic waves.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397868686\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350396397664/wave-energy-costs.gif\" alt=\"Wave energy costs\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>I was grateful to be invited to a<a href=\"http://www.charity-works.co.uk/\" title=\"\"> Charity Works</a> event that, among other things, celebrated the achievements of this year's cohort of highly talented individuals completing the<a href=\"http://www.charity-works.co.uk/graduate-management-programme/\" title=\"\"> Charity Works graduate management training programme</a>. It was uplifting to hear the stories of each of those individuals, while they were on the programme, and to share an insight into their ambitions to develop their careers in the charitable and voluntary sector.</p> <p>What was evident, perhaps unsurprisingly, was the passion they all had to apply their talents and skills in order to \"make a difference\", and the sense that they were attracted to work in our sector because of the values base that is what they believe makes us distinct. Equally evident, however, was that for all of them simply applying their talents in order to make a difference was not enough, certainly not enough to ensure that they remained in the sector moving forward. They also wanted to be properly rewarded, to be professionally developed, and to have a sense of the potential for upward career progression.</p> <p>Of course the Charity Works programme is not the only one attempting to attract and develop talented future leaders with a commitment to working in the sector. To name but a few, the <a href=\"http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Clore Social Leadership Programme</a>, the work of<a href=\"http://www.changemakers.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Changemakers</a>, and the course offer at <a href=\"http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/research-and-faculty/centres/cass-centre-for-charity-effectiveness\" title=\"\">Cass Centre for Charity Effectiveness</a> all offer opportunities and development to future leaders. The sector is also not without access to a range of leadership programmes aimed at developing established as well as emerging leaders. Yet there is arguably a growing sense that the sector as a whole is not doing enough to attract talented young people to see it as a career option; and furthermore that it is not doing enough to develop and progress those potential leaders of the future it already has within its workforce.</p> <p>While the fact that, according to <a href=\"http://www.acevo.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ACEVO</a> surveys, the majority of the sector's chief executives are recruited from outside the sector could be welcomed by some as evidence of cross-sectoral fertilisation of skills and expertise, this inevitably has the potential to discourage those younger talented people in the sector from believing that they have the prospect of ever becoming charity chief executives. Indeed, it might even be suggested that they would see it as beneficial to their prospects of such progression to move out of the sector: make your mark elsewhere then return in the relative twilight of your career, perhaps?</p> <p>Does this mean the sector will inevitably lose the talents of emerging leaders to other sectors? Can the sector afford for this to happen at a time when arguably it needs more skilled leaders than ever, able to innovative, develop new business models and steer a path through a period of massive change and threat as well as new but difficult opportunities? Finally, is the lack of attention to the leaders of the future creating a time bomb for the sector, with an ageing workforce, and population of senior leaders/chief executives in particular (<a href=\"http://www.acevo.org.uk/paysurvey\" title=\"\">ACEVO Pay Survey 2011-2012</a>)? Where is the attention to succession planning and longer-term professional development?</p> <p>So if this is a problem, what are its causes?</p> <p><strong>1</strong> A lack of training and development budgets? About 30% of organisations in the sector lack such a budget. Although the<a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Management/article/1145091/Number-paid-employees-voluntary-sector-risen-20000/\" title=\"\"> Labour Force Analysis conducted by Skills-Third Sector</a> suggested recently that there might be signs of spending on training beginning to increase again, budgets have been reduced in response to the financial pressures in the sector, surely a short-sighted and false economy.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> A lack of sufficient challenging entry-level management opportunities for graduates and other talented young people?</p> <p><strong>3</strong> The absence of any systematic promotion of careers in the sector to undergraduates in higher education? Where is the presence of the sector at HE careers fairs? There is no apparent attempt to create parity of esteem for careers in the sector alongside, for example, management consultancy.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Insufficient capacity within existing leadership development programmes within the sector, allied perhaps to the absence of a sufficiently unified approach to the task?</p> <p><strong>5</strong> The innately conservative recruitment practices and appointment decisions of boards of trustees? Might the temptation to go for the \"tried and tested\" chief executive appointment be getting greater as the apparent threats to organisations in the sector grow?</p> <p>Assuming that at least some of these causes are accepted, what might be required as solutions? In no particular order, I would suggest the sector should actively consider:</p> <p><strong>1</strong> How it might look to generate investment to scale existing leadership development programmes to increase capacity. The investment might be in increasing the infrastructure of such programmes or might just require more bursaries for organisations.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> A systematic encouragement to boards of trustees to recruit more young people as trustees, including in particular young talented \"first step\" managers in the sector. Time spent in a governance role is an invaluable leadership development experience.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Recruitment training for boards of trustees.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Giving collective consideration to greater careers promotion to higher education \u2013 a charities undergraduate careers fair?</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Articulating and promoting a career or leadership pathway through the sector, a \"this is what a career pathway in the sector might look like\".</p> <p>Additionally, and perhaps most challenging of all, is the need to consider if the predominant culture or working environment in the sector is as conducive as it could be to producing effective leadership.</p> <p>The sector is, of course, in a situation where it might be argued that it cannot afford to invest time and money in these or other solutions.

  "<p>Senior coalition figures meet on Wednesday for crisis talks about the UK's stalling energy investment program amid growing political concern about the rising cost of customer bills and threats by power station companies to pull out of the UK because of delays.</p> <p>The meeting of what has been dubbed the 'green quad' is expected to set the Conservative-run Treasury against the Liberal Democrat-run energy department, which have been rowing over the issue for months.</p> <p>Sources on both sides of the coalition said that both the prime minister David Cameron and his deputy, the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, were frustated and worried by the continuing dispute, particularly following a series of warnings by major investment companies that they might quit the UK. Just last week seven global electricity and nuclear giants, including Alstom and Mitsubishi, who between them employ tens of thousands of workers, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3561457.ece\" title=\"\">threatened to reassess their investment plans</a> because lack of decision-making and threats to axe key green targets had raised the \"political risk\" of the UK.</p> <p>Cameron and Clegg will meet with the chancellor, George Osborne, and his deputy, the Lib Dem chief financial secretary Danny Alexander - the core quad of top ministers - and Ed Davey, the Lib Dem energy and climate change secretary, for what one senior source warned would be an \"unholy war\" between the Treasury and Davey's department, Decc. The figure, who opposes cutting renewable energy subsidies, said: \"Perhaps Osborne is railing against the climate change act, or perhaps he believes the hype of shale gas.\"</p> <p>A senior Conservative told the Guardian that David Cameron is now personally re-engaging with the green agenda, recognising it as one of the few growing parts of the economy. \"The PM wants to bring the Treasury and Decc on to the same page,\" the source said. \"The Treasury has to sign up to the renewable energy agenda, while Decc has to reassure on costs.\"</p> <p>Clegg on Tuesday acknowledged top level concern about the continuing delays, telling MPs in response to a question about how uncertainty was damaging for investment that: \"This is not just about whether we think it is right for the environment, but about what is right for our economy. The green sector employs close to 1 million people, was growing at about 4% or 5% last year and is one of the few sectors that runs a trade surplus.\"</p> <p>Sources familiar with the negotiations said a likely deal would give the chancellor more leeway on the decision to limit the subsidies that can be charged to energy customers' bills, via an existing power called <a href=\"http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_controlframework_decc.htm\" title=\"\">the levy control framework (LCF)</a>, with a fresh cap currently being negotiated to begin in 2015. In return, Davey would get a new carbon target - to virtually eliminate emissions from electricity generation by 2030 \u2013 written into the energy bill due to be published in early November. That target has had the backing of some major energy companies and the renewable energy industry, and conditional support from the Confederation of British Industry, representing the country's biggest businesses and employers. However, there is growing political pressure over the rising cost of consumer fuel bills - raised again on Tuesday with the powerful consumer group Which? demanding an independent inquiry into whether fuel costs or political policies were pushing them higher and higher.</p> <p>Other negotiating chips on the table include cutting some of the four demonstration plants for carbon capture and storage technology promised in <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/coalition-documents\" title=\"\">the coalition agreement</a>, and the inclusion of pollution from aviation and shipping in the nation's carbon cutting targets.</p> <p>Restricting renewable subsidies via the LCF could mean the UK would be unable to meet its legally binding target to produce 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 from domestic sources. Renewable energy credits would have to be bought in from abroad to make up the shortfall. But one government adviser told the Guardian: \"That is not a credible strategy. You would need to provide credible evidence for where you would get it from and there is no reason to think there will be countries willing to export.\"</p> <p>Tim Yeo, Conservative MP and chair of the influential House of Commons energy and climate change committee, said: \"You can't have a cap on the levy control framework and guarantee meeting the carbon budgets, because no-one knows what the cost of low-carbon energy will be.\"</p> <p>But Yeo said Davey winning a new 2030 carbon target might be the more significant victory. \"The levy control framework will not be an issue for years\" and could be challenged afresh in future, he said. \"The 2030 target would be a win because it will provide more certainty for investors, which is valuable. But it also a very useful building block towards 2014, when there is a review of the carbon budgets. That is a very dangerous time when the government may come under pressure from Conservative backbenchers one year ahead of an election.\"</p>"
