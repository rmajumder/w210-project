  "<p>This weekend, the British labour movement will be marching in London <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/economy/tuc-21056-f0.cfm\" title=\"\">for a future that works</a>. Two weeks later, in the United States millions of workers and their unions will be mobilising for our national election in critical states such as Ohio, Massachusetts and Wisconsin. These mobilisations may not seem surprising, but behind them lies a serious rethinking of the economic and political strategy on labour issues in both countries.</p> <p>It was the UK and the US that gave birth to the economic ideas and the financial practices that led to the global economic crisis. Five years into the crisis, workers in both countries have paid a terrible price through lost jobs and incomes, while the incomes and assets of the wealthiest in both countries have largely recovered to their pre-crisis levels. But we have learned a few things from this experience.</p> <p>The first is that working people cannot prosper in a financialised economy. The wealth generated by deregulated financial markets and credit bubbles has turned out over and over again to be a dangerous illusion. When the bubble bursts and the illusion fades, financial elites end up holding all the wealth that remains. These elites then have no desire to fund the investments our countries' real economies need to be more globally competitive. In&#xa0;the US, the top 10% have ended up with all the income gains since 1998, and yet pay about 30% of their income in taxes \u2013 less than what the average household in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development#Member_countries\" title=\"\">OECD</a> pays.</p> <p>We have seen both faces of financialisation. We have seen the smiling face of the credit bubble that promises infinite riches \u2013 money enough to pay City and Wall Street bonuses, to fill tax coffers without taxing those bonuses and fund cheap consumer credit that papers over falling wages and rising economic insecurity. And then we have seen the savage face of austerity. In the UK, budget cuts have reversed economic recovery and brought a double-dip recession. In the US, Republican Congressional obstruction in the name of balancing budgets has blocked President Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/sep/09/american-jobs-act\" title=\"\">American Jobs Act</a> and prolonged recession-level unemployment. Austerity is the other side of the credit bubble, because in a financialised political economy the financiers expect to be paid, and have the political power to enforce that expectation, no matter what the cost to the real economy.</p> <p>Last week the International Monetary Fund surveyed the world's major economies and announced that austerity \u2013 cutting back government spending and firing public workers to satisfy bond traders \u2013 was hurting the world economy. Bizarrely, some in the financial press reported the story as if the IMF was calling for more austerity. Fairly read, the IMF report is a warning: austerity is not the way out of the economic crisis but the way into a vicious circle of decline. Find a different approach or expect things to get worse.</p> <p>When the TUC marches on Saturday, and when America's workers vote on 6 November, we are seeking a future that works: positive economic policies for the long term that produce sustained prosperity. We want our countries to move beyond the finance-dominated economies of the past two decades \u2013 we want neither the credit bubble nor the disastrous austerity policies that follow it. Instead, we want policies that build up competitive economies with a diverse base in productive economic activity. The <a href=\"http://www.alaflcio.com/index.cfm?action=article&amp;articleID=8d9a02b7-b629-4176-99fe-a0bc0bf372d5\" title=\"\">AFL-CIO has endorsed President Obama</a> for a second term because we see his economic vision pointing towards a future that works, while Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan represent the political power of the winners in the losing game of financialisation.</p> <p>A future that works requires jobs and workers that have the skills to fill the jobs of the future. That means public investment \u2013 in transportation, education, energy, and telecommunications. Public investment has to be paid for through fair taxes \u2013 starting with a crackdown of tax evasion by big companies and the super-rich and a financial transaction tax so that the people who brought us the crisis pay their fair share of the costs of fixing it. A future that works requires restoring healthy consumer demand, not through credit bubbles but through wages keeping pace with rising productivity. And rising wages requires workers have the right to bargain collective agreements with their employers. Collective bargaining built the American middle class that financialisation and austerity now threatens to destroy.</p> <p>In the US, Professor Jacob Hacker at Yale University has produced a blueprint for a future that works called <a href=\"http://www.prosperityforamerica.org\" title=\"\">Prosperity Economics</a>. It begins with understanding that tackling inequality and unemployment is critical for an efficient, productive economy. Prosperity Economics offers a clear alternative to Wall Street's austerity proposals, which would take the US down the path the UK has followed towards a double-dip recession.</p> <p>In both the US and the UK the labour movement is prepared to work with elected leaders, no matter what party, who are prepared to lead the way towards a future that works, to oppose those who would continue the failed policies that brought us here, and to hold accountable those who would try to have it both ways.</p>",
  "<p>In the weeks since Mark Zuckerberg trumpeted Facebook's growth to 1bn monthly users, there has been a lot of focus on the social network's <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-earnings-targets-are-going-down-2012-10-14http://\">struggle to convince investors of its worth</a>. </p> <p>But if almost daily reports on user privacy are any indication, Facebook should be just as concerned about its relationship with users, who are increasingly miffed about what the site does or doesn't do with their data. </p> <p>On Monday, for example, came a dispatch on <a href=\"http://betabeat.com/2012/10/facebooks-wonky-privacy-controls-now-outing-lgbt-youth-without-their-consent/\">Facebook's labyrinthian suite of privacy controls</a>, and how they still display private information. </p> <p>But the biggest splashes in recent weeks came in the form of alleged privacy breaches within the site: one rumor that Facebook was scanning private user messages to equate conversation with page \"likes\", and another that claimed private messages were being posted to public-facing user timelines. </p> <p>Facebook reps will tell you that such rumors come with the territory of being a hugely popular site; however, the site's historically clunky evolution has meant that the deployment of new features \u2013 the timeline \u2013 and refreshed scrutiny around old mechanisms \u2013 a long-standing technology that analyzes the links sent in private messaging \u2013 has resulted in confusion and, in turn, suspicion. Maybe that's why when more than 625,000 people in Zuckerberg's subscriber base <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100518568346671\">replied to his October 4</a> 1-billion-followers announcement, one theme stuck out among the well-wishes, as illustrated by this message from a user named Neville Unvalla:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mark, while Facebook has transformed our lives over the last few years, the only thing I would ask is to not constantly change your privacy policies and to give users COMPLETE control of their private information!</p> </blockquote> <p>When French media reported in late September that a glitch had made private messages visible on user timelines, the story was quickly picked up in the US. The rumors went global, and though since disproved they persist, almost in the manner of conspiracy theory. </p> <p>Among several users who wrote the Guardian with such allegations (and screenshots) in response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2012/sep/24/facebook-leaking-private-messages\">this story</a> was Caroline Ardrey, 25, a doctoral student at Oxford. <br> \"There are lots of people who are really angry about having their privacy abused, not least me,\" wrote Ardrey. She remains convinced that Facebook invaded her privacy and that of her friends. </p> <p>In a phone interview with the Guardian on October 10, Facebook's Pan-Euro communications manager Iain Mackenzie said a rash of similar allegations arose last year but that they \"didn't gain the same traction\" as recent reports. </p> <p>\"We did a really high priority investigation of it,\" which included a review with the site's engineers, Mackenzie said. \"To have [private messages] publish to [private walls], somebody would've had to make a technological mechanism that was never created.\"</p> <p>Simply put, here's the explanation: people spoke differently on Facebook when Zuckerberg first built it; it was college-kids-only, after all. But when the company cast a wider social net \u2013 employers, parents, distant relatives, far-flung friends \u2013 the tone changed. And not knowing exactly how those old public messages were going to be displayed on public-facing timelines years later resulted in confusion and, later, suspicion that borders on conspiracy theory. </p> <p>\"Facebook doesn't exist in isolation,\" Mackenzie said. \"There are bad things and many good things going on in the online world. It's not surprising that people look at the service that's closest to them and are at least receptive to these myths.\" </p> <h2>'I've got nothing to hide, so it doesn't worry me'</h2> <p>Another topic of scrutiny Mackenzie acknowledges was a recent story that reported that the <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2012/10/04/facebook-confirms-it-is-scanning-your-private-messages-for-links-so-it-can-increase-like-counters/\">content of private Facebook messages is analyzed</a> by the network in order to compute a number score on shares, likes and interactions around a news story, public figure or topic. This is different from liking a Facebook page, which still takes direct user interaction. But a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/50608606\">video posted</a> by Polish programmers showing them gaming the system resulted in Facebook's quick acknowledgment that a bug did in fact exist. </p> <p>Still, analyzing public and private conversations to put a number score on shares and likes around a topic \"has been a part of the platform possibly as long as Facebook has existed,\" Mackenzie added. </p> <p>The problem, it seems, is that the rumors attempting to deconstruct how Facebook uses data haven't historically been met with clarity from the social network itself. The site has long been able analyze, display and, essentially, put a number score on what users say and do, but it takes programmers publicly manipulating the system to address it. And Facebook doesn't actually post users' private messages to public timelines, but whatever reassurance the network has presented on the issue hasn't been enough to completely quell the conversation that continues on about it. </p> <p>More transparency on the network side is needed, but it also must be said that millions of users have overlooked and adapted to the site's many changes without asking the important questions they're asking now. And more importantly, despite their vocal protests, they're not leaving Facebook. In the end, the benefits of human connection outweigh the data users give up. </p> <p>Indeed, users like Ardrey will continue to use Facebook as the site processes even more changes to the platform \u2013 most recently, a fresh attempt at e-commerce with the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/about/gifts\">\"gifts\"</a> platform. The goal here is that the act of buying gifts will become quietly ingrained in Ardrey's user experience, just as messaging and posting and liking things that are important to her have become. </p> <p>For her part, Ardrey is still convinced private messages were displayed publicly, but she feels safe using Facebook for now. </p> <p>\"I don't consider it a risk at the moment,\" she said. \"At the moment, I've got nothing to hide, so it doesn't worry me.\"</p> <h2>Further reading: </h2> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/the-best-reporting-on-facebook-and-your-privacy\">The best reporting around Facebook privacy (ProPublica)</a></p>",
  "<p>I was astonished to read Richard Gott's suggestion that the Cuban missile crisis was \"not quite as serious as it seemed at the time\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/what-cuban-missile-crisis\" title=\"\">Cuba won the missile crisis</a>, 13 October). This is amazing, given the flood of frightening details that have emerged over the years since. To take just one example, it was only decades after the event that the world learned that during the crisis there were Soviet submarines in the Caribbean armed with nuclear torpedoes. In one famous incident, the captain of one of these submarines, being depth-charged by US warships, decided that the third world war had begun, and ordered the use of nuclear weapons. It was only the opposition of his second-in-command, whose consent was required for launch, that prevented the start of global nuclear war. That man's name was Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov, a name that <a href=\"http://peacenews.info/\" title=\"\">Peace News</a> is determined to make as famous as that of the warmongers who brought us to the brink of disaster. This incident was the direct result of the massive naval blockade imposed on Cuba \u2013 unilaterally and illegally \u2013 by US president John F Kennedy, who Gott believes \"behaved in an exemplary manner\".<br><strong>Milan Rai</strong><br><em>Co-editor, Peace News</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Richard Gott fails to mention the reason the Russians wanted to install missiles in Cuba in the first place: because the US had installed nuclear missiles in Turkey, on the border with the Soviet Union. Khrushchev was under pressure to retaliate, to see how the Americans would like having missiles on their border. They didn't, hence the crisis. Gott also fails to mention that Khrushchev agreed to remove his missiles from Cuba only if Kennedy removed his missiles from Turkey, as well as promising that the US would never try to invade Cuba. Which he did, and they haven't, resorting to 50 years of blockade and sanctions instead. The US has never been keen to publicise this agreement \u2013 the American public had to be assured that Khrushchev had \"backed down\", and the US had \"won\".<br><strong>Tony Cheney</strong><br><em>Ipswich, Suffolk</em></p>",
  "<p>I write as the father of a young man who has struggled with heroin, and, from speaking openly with him and his friends, I can vouch that the report by the UK Drug Policy Commission (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/decriminalise-drug-use-say-experts\" title=\"\">Decriminalise drug use, say experts after six-year study</a>, 15 October) accurately reflects the reality among our youngsters. The tragedy is that our legislators have no idea what is going on and show no inclination to inform themselves.</p> <p>My wife and I are a professional couple who brought up two children in a loving and caring way, but were no more able to prevent their enticement into the use of recreational drugs at school than we were able to stop them experimenting with cigarettes and alcohol, neither of which is any less harmful or addictive than ecstasy, cannabis or benzodiazepines.</p> <p>These drugs have become part of the culture of current and future generations of young adults, and they use them because \"Frankly, Dad, it's bloody good fun\". Our son was highly productive, vigorous and unaffected by the occasional use of non-addictive party drugs. His mistake was to experiment with heroin. It nearly ended his life, but with courage and support he managed to detoxify himself and rejoin society with energy and optimism, still using the party drugs.</p> <p>The report clearly distinguishes between party drugs and hard drugs, and this distinction is embedded in the common culture: the use of hard drugs is frowned upon, but because of the sordid way youngsters have to procure the softer ones, they are constantly faced with temptation. We must learn to accept widespread use of the less dangerous chemicals just as we accept moderate use of alcohol, while still reviling drugs like cocaine and the opiates. Emphasising the difference by decriminalising the \"safer\" drugs is far preferable to perpetuating a situation that is self-evidently bankrupt.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022\u2008In this age of austerity, when every penny of public spending must be justified, it is astonishing that the government seems content to squander \u00a33bn a year on its flawed drugs policy. The <a href=\"http://www.ukdpc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Drug Policy Commission</a> is one of a number of respected organisations, including the <a href=\"http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/\" title=\"\">Global Commission on Drug Policy</a>, to call for a rethink. There is growing agreement across the scientific, police and legal professions that we need to move away from prohibition of personal use towards an evidence-based, public health approach.</p> <p>There are also signs of a shift in public opinion. In a <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4416608/.html\" title=\"\">YouGov poll for the Sun</a>, six out of 10 people said they would back trials in which users escape prosecution, but get better medical treatment. More than half wanted all drugs policy options to be reviewed, while more people said they believe crime levels will fall if cannabis use is decriminalised.</p> <p>Politicians need to recognise that the war on drugs has failed. The government should review the 1971 <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents\" title=\"\">Misuse of Drugs Act</a>, with a full cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment to compare its effectiveness in reducing the societal, economic and health costs of drug misuse with alternative approaches.</p> <p>We need a drugs policy based on evidence about what reduces harms, rather than one driven by moral judgments. Only then can we hope to improve the treatment of addiction, prevent drug-related crime and protect communities from the worst effects of drug&#xa0;misuse.<br><strong>Caroline Lucas MP</strong><br><em>Green, Brighton Pavilion; member of the all-party group for drug policy reform</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Illegal status adds to the dangers of drug taking. Instead of buying a joint from a safe outlet, where the toxicity can be monitored, a person who wants to smoke cannabis has to take to the streets and buy it from a dealer, who suggests he or she instead tries ecstasy, crack cocaine, or heroin. Purity of cocaine in the UK has fallen steeply as suppliers cut the drugs with other substances. And several people in the UK have died from a single dose of bacterially infected heroin. Regulation could control the process and greatly reduce the dangers of impure drugs.</p> <p>Then there is the bloody chain back to the original supplier. Countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia and Jamaica have had their economies destabilised by the illegal market while bribery, corruption and conflict have ruled.</p> <p>In the UK we have cut off huge swaths of the population, branding them criminals and creating an underclass who no longer feel part of our society. A sensible policy of regulation and control would reduce burglary, cut gun crime, clear out our overflowing prisons, and raise billions in tax revenues. Drug users could buy from places where they could be sure the drugs had not been cut with dangerous, cost-saving chemicals. There would be clear information about the risks involved and guidance on how to seek treatment. It is time to allow adults the freedom to make decisions about the harmful substances they consume.<br><strong>Dr Kailash Chand</strong><br><em>Stalybridge, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Overall prevalence of drug misuse may not be increased by the proposed decriminalisation of drug possession, but what about the effect on particular vulnerable groups? Will consumption rise in children, and disadvantaged children be particularly affected by the drug use of those around them? What about those suffering from mental disorders? Such people already suffer more than averagely from the malign effects of tobacco and alcohol, and the same seems likely with other substances. The commission should look at the effects across a range of social groups before making such an \"evidence-based\" recommendation. <br><strong>Dr Ben Lucas</strong><br><em>Consultant psychiatrist, London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The UK Drug Policy Commission should have gone the whole hog and suggested putting heroin on prescription, as it was until the late 60s. This would give addicts clean, uncut heroin; decriminalise possession; enable users to stabilise their habits; save vast amounts of NHS and prison expenditure; and put the pushers and drug barons out of business. But governments have never been any good at an evidence-based approach in the face of Daily Mail fury.<br><strong>Fr Julian Dunn</strong><br><em>Great Haseley, Oxfordshire</em></p>",
  "<p>I believe we might have made a mistake: a mistake whose consequences, if I am right, would be hard to overstate. I&#xa0;think the forecasts for world food production could be entirely wrong. Food prices are rising again, partly because of the damage done to crops in the northern hemisphere by ferocious weather. In&#xa0;the US, Russia and Ukraine, grain crops were clobbered by remarkable droughts. In parts of northern Europe, such as the UK, they were pummelled by endless rain.</p> <p>Even so, this is not, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/un-rising-food-costs-weather\" title=\"\">as a report in the Guardian claimed last week</a>, \"one of the worst global harvests in years\". It's&#xa0;one of the best. World grain production last year was the highest on record; this year's crop is <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/161602/icode/\" title=\"\">just 2.6% smaller</a>. The problem is that, thanks to the combination of a rising population and the immoral <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2007/11/06/an-agricultural-crime-against-humanity/\" title=\"\">diversion of so much grain into animal feed and biofuels</a>, a new record must be set every year. Though 2012's is the <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/161602/icode/\" title=\"\">third biggest global harvest in history (after 2011 and 2008)</a>, this is also a year of food deficit, in which we will consume <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/161602/icode/\" title=\"\">28m tonnes more grain than farmers produced</a>. If&#xa0;2013's harvest&#xa0;does not establish a new world&#xa0;record, the poor are in serious&#xa0;trouble.</p> <p>So the question of how climate change might alter food production could not be more significant. It is also extremely hard to resolve, and relies on such daunting instruments as \"<a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2030220\" title=\"\">multinomial endogenous switching regression models</a>\". The problem is that there are so many factors involved. Will&#xa0;extra rainfall be cancelled out by extra evaporation? Will the fertilising effect of carbon dioxide be more powerful than the heat damage it causes? To what extent will farmers be able to adapt? Will new varieties of crops keep up with the changing weather?</p> <p>But, to put it very broadly, the consensus is that climate change will hurt farmers in the tropics and help farmers in temperate countries. A famous <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1569580/\" title=\"\">paper published in 2005</a> concluded that if we follow the most extreme trajectory for greenhouse gas production (the one we happen to be on at the moment), global warming would raise harvests in the rich nations by 3% by the 2080s, and reduce them in the poor nations by 7%. This gives an overall reduction in the world's food supply (by comparison to what would have happened without manmade climate change) of 5%.</p> <p>Papers published since then support this conclusion: they foresee hard times for farmers in Africa and south Asia, but a bonanza for farmers in the colder parts of the world, whose yields will rise just as developing countries become less able to feed themselves. Climate change is likely to be devastating for many of the world's poor. If farmers in developing countries can't compete, both their income and their food security will decline, and the number of permanently malnourished people could rise. The&#xa0;nations in which they live, much of whose growth was supposed to have come from food production, will have to import more of their food from abroad. But in terms of gross commodity flows the models do not predict an insuperable problem.</p> <p>So here's where the issue arises. The models used by most of these papers forecast the effects of changes in averaged conditions. They take no account of extreme weather events. Fair&#xa0;enough: they're complicated enough already. But what if changes in the size of the global harvest are determined less by average conditions than by the extremes?</p> <p>This is what happened in 2012. This is what seems likely to happen in subsequent years. Here's why. A paper this year by the world's leading climate scientist, James Hansen, shows that the frequency of extremely hot events (such as the droughts which hammered the US and Russia) <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/07/30/1205276109.full.pdf+html?with-ds=yes\" title=\"\">has risen by a factor of about 50 by comparison with the decades before 1980</a>. Forty years ago, extreme summer heat typically affected between 0.1 and 0.2% of the globe. Today it scorches some 10%. \"We can project with a high degree of confidence,\" the paper warns, \"that the area covered by extremely hot anomalies will continue to increase during the next few decades and even greater extremes will occur.\" Yet these extremes do not feature in the standard models predicting changes in crop production.</p> <p>If the mechanism proposed by another paper is correct, it is not just extremes of heat that are likely to rise. I've explained this before, but I think it's worth repeating. The jet stream is a current of air travelling eastwards around the upper northern hemisphere. It separates the cold wet weather to the north from the warmer, drier weather to the south. Wobbling along this ribbon are huge meanders called Rossby waves. As the Arctic heats up, the meanders slow down and become steeper. The weather gets stuck.</p> <p>Stuck weather is another way of saying extreme weather. If the jet stream is jammed to the north of where you are, the weather stays hot and dry, and the temperature builds up \u2013 and up. If it's lodged to the south of you, the rain keeps falling, the ground becomes saturated and the rivers burst their banks. This summer the UK and the US seem to have found themselves on opposite sides of stuck meanders, and harvests in both countries were savaged by opposing extremes of weather.</p> <p>This is where we stand with just 0.8 degrees of global warming and a 30% loss of summer sea ice. Picture a world with two, four or six degrees of warming and a pole without ice, and you get some idea of what could be coming.</p> <p>Farmers in the rich nations can adapt to a change in averaged conditions. It&#xa0;is hard to see how they can adapt to extreme events, especially if those events are different every year. Last winter, for example, I spent days drought-proofing my apple trees, as the previous spring had been so dry that \u2013 a few weeks after pollination \u2013 most of the fruit shrivelled up and died. This spring was so wet that the pollinators scarcely emerged at all: it was the unfertilised blossom that withered and died. I thanked my stars that I don't make my living this way.</p> <p>Perhaps there is no normal any more. Perhaps the smooth average warming trends that the climate models predict \u2013 simultaneously terrifying and oddly reassuring \u2013 mask wild extremes for which no farmer can plan and to which no farmer can respond. Where does that leave a world which must either keep raising production or starve?</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@GeorgeMonbiot</em></a></p> <p><em>A fully referenced version of this article can be found at </em><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\"><em>www.monbiot.com</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October to say that the jet stream travels eastwards, rather than westwards</p>",
  "<p>If you see a scientist wandering through St Pancras station looking a bit green, don't assume they've had a dodgy crossing on Eurostar. It's probably jealousy. Work is under way just outside to build <a href=\"http://www.crick.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">the Francis Crick Institute</a>: a research behemoth that looks set to project three London universities into the global superleague for biomedicine. The site will not be ready until 2015, but already the building is casting a big shadow over the rest of the country.</p> <p>The Crick, as it is known in academia, is intended to develop better treatments for diseases by bringing together scientists from different disciplines to study everything from stem cells to influenza. It is also a thundering testament to the power of partnership.</p> <p>The \u00a3630m project brings together University College London, King's College and Imperial College, with investment from three of the biggest public funders in this area. It has had the domino effect of putting considerable pressure on universities outside the capital to form alliances in order to stand a chance of competing. The standard refrain from other vice-chancellors is \"even Oxbridge are terrified of the Crick\".</p> <p>Professor Sir Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, explains: \"Throughout the world concentration of research funding is the name of the game, therefore for the country the Crick is the right solution. But what does that mean for universities outside the south-east? How can you possibly compete as a single institution, whoever you are?\"</p> <p>Arranging marriages between universities is no small task, not least because the game-changing Research Excellence Framework, which will distribute more than a billion pounds of government research cash to universities a year, pits institutions against each other and fuels a climate of intense rivalry. This is further ingrained by the international obsession with league tables. Professor Robert Lechler, vice-president for health at King's College and one of the architects of the Crick partnership deal, is frustrated with these barriers. \"For the first time ever London is seriously at risk of getting its act together, with a real readiness to engage in partnership work, which is incredibly exciting. But there is no real financial incentive. The REF breeds inter-institutional competition when we need collaboration.\"</p> <p>According to insiders, the Crick university union was a long way from love at first sight. The institute was originally intended to be a much smaller-scale merger with the National Institute for Medical Research, and the big London research universities entered a furious competition to win the contract. UCL came out on top as the exclusive partner in 2006. When the original plan ballooned, and King's College and Imperial began campaigning to be included, UCL was reportedly less than enthusiastic about having other institutions muscling in.</p> <p>Lechler is not keen to talk about this troubled courtship. \"At the end of the day it is about trading autonomy for success, and I think we are ready to do that,\" he says. He is determined to move away from the culture of automatic rivalry \u2013 at least within London. \"We've all got a history of poaching and in the run up to the REF it's like the football transfer market,\" he admits. \"However, I have reached the point where if it's an inter-London institutional transfer I question whether there is sufficient reason for them to move. Or could it be a joint appointment?\"</p> <p>However, Sarah Jackson, director of <a href=\"http://www.n8research.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the N8</a>, a partnership between eight big-hitting research universities in the north, including Manchester, Durham and Leeds, is pragmatic about what is achievable. \"You have to acknowledge the reality that this is a very competitive sector, and you won't change that,\" she says. \"Our institutions collaborate in some areas \u2014 where it makes sense \u2014 and compete in others. We are comfortable with that.\"</p> <p>The N8 has had some major successes, including research council funding for a \u00a33.2m high-performance computing centre. Sharing expensive new research equipment has become a key driver for the group, especially since the government slashed capital funding last year. The N8 model is now regarded in government circles as something worth emulating \u2014 but this hasn't happened overnight. Jackson says: \"Partnership takes time to build. You can't write trust into a contract. It has taken us five years to build a relationship where the pro vice-chancellors can be totally honest with me and with each other.\"</p> <p>This is a cautionary message for the M5 partnership, which sprang up earlier this year involving five research universities from the middle of the country, including Birmingham and Lancaster.</p> <p>Until recently Lancaster was planning a major \"federal\" partnership with Liverpool University, but this has been dropped. The official line was that \"transformational benefits\" couldn't be achieved right now. But sources close to the process say the deal collapsed largely because of opposition from staff. As one academic notes: \"It's not a command and control situation. You've got to bring everyone with you.\"</p> <p>Lancaster is continuing to pursue other partnership options, and strikingly its vice-chancellor, Professor Mark Smith, suggested in a recent internal management meeting that Lancaster might consider becoming \"the junior partner\" with a world leading university. This highlights one of the key dilemmas of big university partnerships: someone will inevitably come out on top, and it may not be your institution. As Steve Smith says: \"The issue isn't really money \u2013 it's kudos. If you put in a joint REF submission, for example, how do you divide the credit? How do you convey this to the international league tables? These things worry vice-chancellors.\"</p> <p>The N8 computing centre is a case in point. It is physically based at Leeds, so much of the credit will gravitate there, although Manchester officially won the grant. Luke Georghiou, vice-president for research at Manchester, says: \"There is an element of kudos attached to big equipment and you have to learn to accept that.\"</p> <p>Egos may become less ruffled when a partnership happens across countries. Warwick University has teamed up with Monash University in Melbourne. The deal was three years in the making, while the two leadership teams hammered out issues such as credit sharing and what their priorities should be. But the institutions appointed a joint pro vice-chancellor last month \u2013 something Warwick vice-chancellor Professor Nigel Thrift admits would have been harder to pull off with a partner in his own back yard. \"It wasn't the main reason for choosing Monash, but it does take the pressure off,\" he says. \"You aren't competing in the same arena and that certainly helps.\"</p>",
  "<p>Iran has been asked to persuade the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to implement a ceasefire later this month in tandem with an appeal by the UN to halt the flow of weapons to both sides in the country's bloody conflict.</p> <p>Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy for the UN and Arab League, used a weekend visit to Iran, a loyal ally of Damascus, to appeal for help in securing a ceasefire to mark Eid al-Adha, the four-day Muslim holiday later this month. In Baghdad on Monday he called on the Iraqi government to use its influence, while Nuri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, called for a speedy \"political solution\".</p> <p>Brahimi said a ceasefire would \"help create an environment that would allow a political process to develop\", said his spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi. But Fawzi denied a report that plans were afoot to send a 3,000-strong UN peacekeeping force to Syria, drawn from an existing UN contingent in south Lebanon.</p> <p>EU officials dismissed the idea as far-fetched, because it would first require a durable ceasefire and moves towards a political transition \u2014 both of which have proved elusive over the 19 months of the crisis.</p> <p>It is clearly being discussed, though. Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al Thani, said any such force would have to be \"well-armed\".</p> <p>The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported 69 people were killed in Syria on Monday, mostly in Damascus.</p> <p>Brahimi, who replaced Kofi Annan last month, was due to travel on to the Egyptian capital, Cairo, his latest stop on a regional tour aimed at forging a solution to a conflict which has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives. Last week, the Algerian diplomat met leaders in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, the two Sunni states which have been the biggest supporters of the Syrian opposition.</p> <p>Syria, meanwhile, denied it was using cluster bombs to crush the uprising. Human Rights Watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/14/syria-russian-cluster-bombs-claim\" title=\"\">accused it of using the banned weapons</a> and produced video evidence. Russia denied it had been supplying the munitions to Syria.</p> <p>In Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers announced a 19th round of sanctions to freeze the assets of two Syrian firms linked to chemical and biological weapons programmes and more than two dozen people from Assad's entourage.</p> <p>Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, described the punitive measures as \"a clear warning to those close to the regime that if they back Assad and commit acts of violence and torture against civilians, the international community will hold them accountable\".</p> <p>Diplomats said one new element in the EU's approach was aid to \"civil society\" organisations on the ground inside Syria, part of a shift away from supporting the external opposition. The local co-ordination committees (LCCs) are likely to receive new help, especially in areas that are no longer under the permanent control of the Damascus government. It would, said Hague, \"help build essential capacity to enable a peaceful transition\". New announcements are expected shortly.</p> <p>In another development that highlighted the international complexity of the crisis, the New York Times reported that most weapons supplied to Syrian rebels by Qatar and Saudi Arabia were reaching jihadi-type or Salafi groups rather than the Free Syrian Army, which is backed by the mainstream opposition.</p> <p>A new report by the International Crisis Group, a respected thinktank, found that Syrian rebel groups were playing up their Islamist credentials by growing Salafi-type beards, for example, as a ruse to secure arms from these conservative Gulf-based donors. Groups with no ideological affiliation had begun to adopt the symbols, rhetoric \u2013 and facial hair \u2013 associated with Salafism for that purpose.</p>",
  "<p>The world stood still 50 years ago during the last week of October, from the moment when it learned that the Soviet Union had placed nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba until the crisis was officially ended \u2013 though, unknown to the public, only officially.</p> <p>The image of the world standing still is due to <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60676/lawrence-d-freedman/the-week-the-world-stood-still-inside-the-secret-cuban-missile-c\">Sheldon Stern</a>, former historian at the John F Kennedy Presidential Library, who published the authoritative version of the tapes of the ExComm meetings where Kennedy, and a close circle of advisers, debated how to respond to the crisis. The meetings were secretly recorded by the president, which might bear on the fact that his stand throughout the recorded sessions is relatively temperate, as compared to other participants who were unaware that they were speaking to history. Stern <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/sidebars/2012/05/robert_caro_s_new_history_of_lbj_sidebar_3_.html\">has just published</a> an accessible and accurate review of this critically important documentary record, finally declassified in the 1990s. I will keep to that here. \"Never before or since,\" he concludes, \"has the survival of human civilization been at stake in a few short weeks of dangerous deliberations,\" culminating in the Week the World Stood Still.</p> <p>There was good reason for the global concern. A nuclear war was all too imminent \u2013 a war that might \"destroy the Northern Hemisphere\", President Eisenhower had warned. Kennedy's own judgment was that the probability of war might have been <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/10660-in-hiroshimas-shadow\">as high as 50%</a>. Estimates became higher as the confrontation reached its peak and the \"secret doomsday plan to ensure the survival of the government was put into effect\" in Washington, described by journalist Michael Dobbs in his <a href=\"http://www.michaeldobbsbooks.com/1/post/2012/08/cold-war-humor.html\">recent, well-researched bestseller</a> on the crisis \u2013 though he doesn't explain why there would be much point in doing so, given the likely nature of nuclear war. Dobbs quotes Dino Brugioni, \"a key member of the CIA team monitoring the Soviet missile build-up\", who saw no way out except \"war and complete destruction\" as the clock moved to One Minute to Midnight \u2013 Dobbs' title. Kennedy's close associate, historian Arthur Schlesinger, described the events as \"the most dangerous moment in human history\". Defense Secretary Robert McNamara wondered aloud whether he \"would live to see another Saturday night\", and later recognized that \"we lucked out\" \u2013 barely.</p> <p>A closer look at what took place adds grim overtones to these judgments, with reverberations to the present moment.</p> <h2>'The most dangerous moment'</h2> <p>There are several candidates for \"the most dangerous moment\". One is 27 October, when US destroyers enforcing the quarantine around Cuba were dropping depth-charges on Soviet submarines. According to Soviet accounts, reported by the <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB75/\">National Security Archive</a>, submarine commanders were \"rattled enough to talk about firing nuclear torpedoes, whose 15 kiloton explosive yields approximated the bomb that devastated Hiroshima in August 1945\".</p> <p>In one case, a reported decision to assemble a nuclear torpedo for battle readiness was aborted at the last minute by Second Captain Vasili Archipov, who may have saved the world from nuclear disaster. There is little doubt what the US reaction would have been had the torpedo been fired, or how the Russians would have responded as their country was going up in smoke. Kennedy had already declared the highest nuclear alert short of launch (Defcon 2), which authorized \"Nato aircraft with Turkish pilots ... [or others] ... to take off, fly to Moscow, and drop a bomb\", <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftruth-out.org%2Fopinion%2Fitem%2F10660-in-hiroshimas-shadow&amp;ei=6op4UKX5Hcml0QX4g4C4CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCLwsylmQR4OW6dN5IDifm3V8Iig\">according to Harvard University strategic analyst Graham Allison</a>, in Foreign Affairs.</p> <p>Another candidate is the previous day, 26 October. That day is selected as \"the most dangerous moment\" by a B-52 pilot, Major Don Clawson, who piloted one of those Nato aircrafts and provides a hair-raising description of details of the Chrome Dome (CD) missions during the crisis, \"B-52s on airborne alert\" with nuclear weapons \"on board and ready to use\". 26 October was the day when \"the nation was closest to nuclear war,\" Clawson writes in his \"irreverent anecdotes of an Air Force pilot\", Is That Something the Crew Should Know? On that day, Clawson himself was in a good position to set off a likely terminal cataclysm. He concludes that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were damned lucky we didn't blow up the world \u2013 and no thanks to the political or military leadership of this country.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The errors, confusions, near-accidents and miscomprehension of the leadership that Clawson reports are startling enough, but not as much as the operative command-and-control rules \u2013 or lack of them. As Clawson recounts his experiences during the 15, 24-hour CD missions he flew \u2013 the maximum possible \u2013 the official commanders \"did not possess the capability to prevent a rogue crew or crew-member from arming and releasing their thermonuclear weapons\", or even from broadcasting a mission that would have sent off \"the entire airborne alert force without possibility of recall\". Once the crew was airborne, carrying thermonuclear weapons, he writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It would have been possible to arm and drop them all with no further input from the ground. There was no inhibitor on any of the systems.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>About one-third of the total force was in the air, according to General David Burchinal, director of plans on the air staff at Air Force headquarters. The Strategic Air Command, technically in charge, appears to have had little control. And according to Clawson's account, the civilian National Command Authority was kept in the dark by SAC, which means that the ExComm \"deciders\" pondering the fate of the world knew even less. General Burchinal's oral history is no less hair-raising, and reveals even greater contempt for the civilian command. According to him, Russian capitulation was never in doubt. The CD operations were designed to make it crystal clear to the Russians that they were hardly even competing in the military confrontation, and could quickly have been destroyed.</p> <p>From the ExComm records, Stern concludes that on 26 October President Kennedy was \"leaning towards military action to eliminate the missiles\" in Cuba, to be followed by invasion, <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/2012/10/10/2366509/archives-to-recount-jfks-cuban.html\">according to Pentagon plans</a>. It was evident then that the act might have led to terminal war, a conclusion fortified much later by revelations that tactical nuclear weapons had been deployed, and that Russian forces were far greater than US intelligence had reported.</p> <p>As the ExComm meetings were drawing to a close at 6pm on the 26 October, a letter arrived from Prime Minister Khrushchev, directly to President Kennedy. Khrushchev's \"message seemed clear,\" Stern writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The missiles would be removed if the US promised not to invade Cuba.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The next day, at 10am, the president again turned on the secret tape. He read aloud a wire service report that had just been handed to him:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Premier Khrushchev told President Kennedy in a message today he would withdraw offensive weapons from Cuba if the United States withdrew its rockets from Turkey.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>These were Jupiter missiles with nuclear warheads. The report was soon authenticated. Though received by the committee as an unexpected bolt from the blue, it had actually been anticipated: \"We've known this might be coming for a week,\" Kennedy informed them. To refuse public acquiescence would be difficult, he realized. These were obsolete missiles, already slated for withdrawal, to be replaced by far more lethal and effectively invulnerable Polaris submarines. Kennedy recognized that he would be in an \"insupportable position if this becomes [Khrushchev's] proposal\", both because the Turkish missiles were useless and were being withdrawn anyway, and because \"it's gonna \u2013 to any man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785051\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350324465025/Cuban-missile-crisis-defe-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cuban missile crisis defense department photo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo released by the US Defense Department on 3 November 1962, illustrating a medium-range ballistic missile site at Sagua La Grande, Cuba. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A serious dilemma</h2> <p>The planners therefore faced a serious dilemma: they had in hand two somewhat different proposals from Khrushchev to end the threat of catastrophic war, and each would seem to any \"rational man\" to be a fair trade. How then to react?</p> <p>One possibility would have been to breathe a sigh of relief that civilization could survive, to eagerly accept both offers and to announce that the US would adhere to international law and remove any threat to invade Cuba; and to carry forward the withdrawal of the obsolete missiles in Turkey, proceeding as planned to upgrade the nuclear threat against the Soviet Union to a far greater one, of course, only part of the global encirclement of Russia. But that was unthinkable.</p> <p>The basic reason why no such thought could be contemplated was spelled out by National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, former Harvard Dean and reputedly the brightest star in the Camelot firmament. The <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/moment.htm\">world must come to understand</a> that \"the current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in Cuba,\" where missiles are directed against us. A vastly more powerful US missile force trained on the much weaker and more vulnerable Soviet enemy cannot possibly be regarded as a threat to peace, because we are Good, as a great many people in the western hemisphere and beyond could testify \u2013 among numerous others, the victims of the ongoing terrorist war that the US was then waging against Cuba, or those swept up in the \"campaign of hatred\" in the Arab world that so puzzled Eisenhower (though not the National Security Council, which explained it clearly).</p> <p>And, of course, the idea that the US should be restrained by international law was too ridiculous to merit consideration. As <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/11/07/362379/noam-chomsky-versus-me/\">explained recently by the respected liberal commentator Matthew Yglesias</a>, \"one of the main functions of the international institutional order is precisely to legitimate the use of deadly military force by western powers\" \u2013 meaning the US \u2013 so that it is \"amazingly na\u00efve\", indeed quite \"silly\", to suggest that the US should obey international law or other conditions that we impose on the powerless: a frank and welcome exposition of operative assumptions, reflexively taken for granted by the ExComm assemblage.</p> <p>In subsequent colloquy, the president stressed that we would be \"in a bad position\" if we chose to set off an international conflagration by rejecting proposals that would seem quite reasonable to survivors, if any cared. This \"pragmatic\" stance was about as far as moral considerations could reach. In a review of recently-released documents on Kennedy-era terror, Harvard University Latin Americanist <a href=\"http://cubajournal.blogspot.com/2010/09/operation-mongoose-us-sponsored.html\">Jorge Dom\u00ednguez observes</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Only once in these nearly thousand pages of documentation did a US official raise something that resembled a faint moral objection to US government-sponsored terrorism.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A member of the National Security Council staff suggested that raids that are \"haphazard and kill innocents \u2026 might mean a bad press in some friendly countries.\" The same attitudes prevail throughout the internal discussions during the missile crisis, as when Robert Kennedy warned that a full-scale invasion of Cuba would \"kill an awful lot of people, and we're going to take an awful lot of heat on it.\" And they prevail to the present with only the rarest of exceptions, as easily documented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785052\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350324764755/John-F-Kennedy-during-Cub-008.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy during Cuban missile crisis, 1962\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president John F Kennedy making his dramatic television broadcast to announce the Cuba blockade during the Cuban missile crisis, 22 October 1962.

It was only recently learned that, six months earlier, the US had secretly deployed in Okinawa missiles virtually identical to those the Russians later sent to Cuba. These were surely aimed at China, at a moment of elevated regional tensions. Okinawa remains a major offensive US military base, over the bitter objections of its inhabitants \u2013 who, right now, <a href=\"http://nation.time.com/2012/09/09/still-no-luck-for-the-v-22-in-japan/\">are less than enthusiastic about the dispatch of accident-prone V-22 Osprey helicopters</a> to the Fukenma military base, located at the heart of a heavily-populated urban center.</p> <p>In the deliberations that followed, the US pledged to withdraw the obsolete missiles from Turkey, but would not do so publicly or in writing: it was important that Khrushchev be seen to capitulate. An interesting reason was offered, and is accepted as reasonable by scholarship and commentary. As Dobbs puts it:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If it appeared that the United States was dismantling the missile bases unilaterally, under pressure from the Soviet Union, the [Nato] alliance might crack.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Or, to rephrase a little more accurately, if the US replaced useless missiles with a far more lethal threat, as already planned, in a trade with Russia that any \"rational man\" would regard as very fair, then the Nato alliance might crack. To be sure, when Russia withdrew Cuba's only deterrent against ongoing US attack with a severe threat to proceed to direct invasion and quietly departed from the scene, the Cubans would be infuriated \u2013 as they were, understandably. But that is an unfair comparison for the standard reasons: we are human beings who matter, while they are merely \"unpeople\", to borrow Orwell's useful phrase.</p> <p>Kennedy also made an informal pledge not to invade Cuba, but with conditions: not just withdrawal of the missiles, but also termination, or at least \"a great lessening\", of any Russian military presence. (Unlike Turkey, on Russia's borders, where nothing of the kind could be contemplated.) When Cuba is no longer an \"armed camp\", then \"we probably wouldn't invade,\" in the president's words. He added also that if it hoped to be free from the threat of US invasion, Cuba must end its \"political subversion\" (Stern's phrase) in Latin America.</p> <p>Political subversion had been a constant theme for years, invoked, <a href=\"http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200412--.htm\">for example</a>, when Eisenhower overthrew the parliamentary government of Guatemala and plunged the tortured country into an abyss from which it has yet to emerge. And the themes remained alive and well right through Reagan's vicious terror wars in Central America in the 1980s. The \"political subversion\" consisted of support for those resisting the murderous assaults of the US and its client regimes, and sometimes \u2013 horror of horrors \u2013 perhaps even providing arms to the victims.</p> <h2>The problem with Castro</h2> <p>In the case of Cuba, the State Department policy planning council explained: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The primary danger we face in Castro is \u2026 in the impact the very existence of his regime has upon the leftist movement in many Latin American countries \u2026 The simple fact is that Castro represents a successful defiance of the US, a negation of our whole hemispheric policy of almost a century and a half.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Monroe Doctrine announced the US intention, then unrealizable, of dominating the western hemisphere. An example of great contemporary import is revealed in Iran scholar Ervand Abrahamian's important <a href=\"http://thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&amp;task=view_title&amp;metaproductid=1868\">recent study</a> of the US-UK coup that overthrew the parliamentary regime of Iran in 1953. With scrupulous examination of internal records, he shows convincingly that standard accounts cannot be sustained. The primary causes were not cold war concerns, nor Iranian irrationality that undermined Washington's \"benign intentions\", nor even access to oil or profits, but rather the demand for \"overall controls\" with the broader implications for global dominance, threatened by independent nationalism. That is what we discover over and over by investigating particular cases.</p> <p>Cuba, too, not surprisingly \u2013 though the fanaticism might merit examination in this case. US policy towards Cuba is harshly condemned throughout Latin America, and indeed most of the world, but \"a decent respect for the opinions of mankind\" is understood to be meaningless rhetoric intoned mindlessly on 4 July. Ever since polls have been taken on the matter, a considerable majority of the US population has favored normalization of relations with Cuba, but that, too, is insignificant. Dismissal of public opinion is, of course, quite normal. What is interesting in this case is dismissal of powerful sectors of US economic power, which also favor normalization, and are usually highly influential in setting policy: energy, agribusiness, pharmaceuticals and others. That suggests that there is a powerful state interest involved in punishing Cubans, as well as the cultural factors revealed in the hysteria of the Camelot intellectuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785053\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350323930816/Fidal-Castro-with-Nikita--008.jpg\" alt=\"Fidal Castro with Nikita Khrushchev in Moscow, 1963\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cuba's Communist leader Fidel Castro with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev during a 1963 official visit to Moscow.

The outcome was not obscure. That evening, in a special CBS News broadcast, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-23/local/me-10523_1_cuban-missile-crisis\">Charles Collingwood reported</a> that the world had come out \"from under the most terrible threat of nuclear holocaust since the second world war\", with a \"humiliating defeat for Soviet policy\". Dobbs comments that the Russians tried to pretend that the outcome was \"yet another triumph for Moscow's peace-loving foreign policy over warmongering imperialists\", as \"the supremely wise, always reasonable Soviet leadership had saved the world from the threat of nuclear destruction.\" Extricating the basic facts from the fashionable ridicule, Khrushchev's agreement to capitulate \"had saved the world from the threat of nuclear destruction\".</p> <p>The crisis, however, was not over. On 8 November, the Pentagon announced that all known Soviet missile bases had been dismantled. And on the same day, Stern reports, \"a sabotage team carried out an attack on a Cuban factory,\" though Kennedy's terror campaign, Operation Mongoose, had been formally curtailed at the peak of the crisis. The 8 November terror attack lends support to Bundy's observation that the threat to peace was Cuba, not Turkey \u2013 where the Russians were not continuing a lethal assault. Not, however, what Bundy had in mind, or could have understood.</p> <p>More details are added by the highly respected scholar Raymond Garthoff, who also had a great deal of experience within the government, in his careful 1987 account of the missile crisis. <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=7zeg81n47GsC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=Raymond+Garthoff+a+Cuban+covert+action+sabotage+team+dispatched+from+the+United+States+successfully+blew+up+a+Cuban+industrial+facility&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N-eskttTFO&amp;sig=QPZucjCqfdly4Wzio7rmkZB1_SA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hBt8UJbnHcWY1AX_04GoAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20Garthoff%20a%20Cuban%20covert%20action%20sabotage%20team%20dispatched%20from%20the%20United%20States%20successfully%20blew%20up%20a%20Cuban%20industrial%20facility&amp;f=false\">On 8 November, he writes</a>, \"a Cuban covert action sabotage team dispatched from the United States successfully blew up a Cuban industrial facility,\" killing 400 workers, according to a Cuban government letter to the UN Secretary General. Garthoff comments that \"the Soviets could only see [the attack] as an effort to backpedal on what was, for them, the key question remaining: American assurances not to attack Cuba,\" particularly since the terrorist attack was launched from the US. These and other \"third-party actions\" reveal again, he concludes, \"that the risk and danger to both sides could have been extreme, and catastrophe not excluded.\" Garthoff also reviews the murderous and destructive operations of Kennedy's terrorist campaign, which we would certainly regard as more than ample justification for war, if the US or its allies or clients were victims, not perpetrators.</p> <p>From the same source we learn further that on 23 August 1962, the president had issued <a href=\"http://http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175430/best_of_tomdispatch%3A_noam_chomsky_on_terrorizing_cuba\">National Security Memorandum No 181</a>, \"a directive to engineer an internal revolt that would be followed by US military intervention\", involving \"significant US military plans, maneuvers, and movement of forces and equipment\" that were surely known to Cuba and Russia. Also in August, terrorist attacks were intensified, including speedboat strafing attacks on a Cuban seaside hotel \"where Soviet military technicians were known to congregate, killing a score of Russians and Cubans\"; attacks on British and Cuban cargo ships; contaminating sugar shipments; and other atrocities and sabotage, mostly carried out by Cuban exile organizations permitted to operate freely in Florida. Shortly after came \"the most dangerous moment in human history\", not exactly out of the blue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785054\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350323559111/Bay-of-Pigs-captured-rebe-008.jpg\" alt=\"Bay of Pigs captured rebels 1961\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Captured Cuban rebels in the wake of the 1961 CIA-backed invasion fiasco at the Bay of Pigs, Cuba.

Ten days before his assassination, he approved a CIA plan for \"destruction operations\" by US proxy forces \"against a large oil refinery and storage facilities, a large electric plant, sugar refineries, railroad bridges, harbor facilities, and underwater demolition of docks and ships\". A plot to assassinate Castro was apparently initiated on the day of the Kennedy assassination. The terrorist campaign was called off in 1965, but \"one of Nixon's first acts in office in 1969 was to direct the CIA to intensify covert operations against Cuba,\" Garthoff reports.</p> <p>In the current issue of <a href=\"http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19003\">Political Science Quarterly</a>, Montague Kern observes that the Cuban missile crisis is one of those \"full-bore crises \u2026 in which an ideological enemy (the Soviet Union) is universally perceived to have gone on the attack, leading to a rally-'round-the-flag effect that greatly expands support for a president, increasing his policy options.\" Kern is right that it is \"universally perceived\" that way, apart from those who have escaped sufficiently from the ideological shackles to pay some attention to the facts. Kern is, in fact, one of them. Another is Sheldon Stern, who recognizes what has long been known to such deviants. As he writes, we now know that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Khrushchev's original explanation for shipping missiles to Cuba had been fundamentally true: the Soviet leader had never intended these weapons as a threat to the security of the United States, but rather considered their deployment a defensive move to protect his Cuban allies from American attacks and as a desperate effort to give the USSR the appearance of equality in the nuclear balance of power.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Dobbs, too, recognizes that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Castro and his Soviet patrons had real reasons to fear American attempts at regime change, including, as a last resort, a US invasion of Cuba \u2026 [Khrushchev] was also sincere in his desire to defend the Cuban revolution from the mighty neighbor to the north.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The American attacks are often dismissed in US commentary as silly pranks, CIA shenanigans that got out of hand. That is far from the truth. The best and the brightest had reacted to the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion with near hysteria, including the president, who solemnly informed the country that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The complacent, the self-indulgent, the soft societies are about to be swept away with the debris of history. Only the strong \u2026 can possibly survive.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And they can only survive, he evidently believed, by massive terror \u2013 though that addendum was kept secret, and is still not known to loyalists who perceive the ideological enemy as having \"gone on the attack\" \u2013 the near-universal perception, as Kern observes. After the Bay of Pigs defeat, historian Piero Gleijeses writes that JFK launched a crushing embargo to punish the Cubans for defeating a US-run invasion, and \"asked his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to lead the top-level interagency group that oversaw Operation Mongoose, a program of paramilitary operations, economic warfare and sabotage he launched in late 1961 to visit the 'terrors of the earth' on Fidel Castro and, more prosaically, to topple him.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/26/specials/schlesinger-robert.html\">phrase \"terrors of the earth\"</a> is Arthur Schlesinger's, in his quasi-official biography of Robert Kennedy, who was assigned responsibility to conduct the terrorist war, and informed the CIA that the Cuban problem carries \"the top priority in the United States Government \u2013 all else is secondary \u2013 no time, no effort, or manpower is to be spared\" in the effort to overthrow the Castro regime. The Mongoose operations were run by Edward Lansdale, who had ample experience in \"counterinsurgency\" \u2013 a standard term for terrorism that we direct. He provided a timetable leading to \"open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" in October 1962.</p> <p>The \"final definition\" of the program recognized that \"final success will require decisive US military intervention,\" after terrorism and subversion had laid the basis. The implication is that US military intervention would take place in October 1962 \u2013 when the missile crisis erupted. The events just reviewed help explain why Cuba and Russia had good reason to take such threats seriously.</p> <p>Years later, Robert McNamara recognized that Cuba was justified in fearing an attack. \"If I were in Cuban or Soviet shoes, I would have thought so, too,\" he observed at a major conference on the missile crisis on the 40th anniversary. As for Russia's \"desperate effort to give the USSR the appearance of equality\", to which Stern refers, recall that Kennedy's very narrow victory in the 1960 election relied heavily on a fabricated \"missile gap\" concocted to terrify the country and to condemn the Eisenhower administration as soft on national security. There was indeed a \"missile gap\", but strongly in favor of the US. The first \"public, unequivocal administration statement\" on the true facts, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=9us4Q9iFI7kC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=Deputy+Secretary+of+Defense+Roswell+Gilpatric+the+US+would+have+a+larger+nuclear+delivery+system+left+after+a+surprise+attack&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zabHQyP8nb&amp;sig=rtgg58Gexy7dL2MafuxpotcQhwo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eip8UNDUOorJ0QWulIGQDA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Deputy%20Secretary%20of%20Defense%20Roswell%20Gilpatric%20the%20US%20would%20have%20a%20larger%20nuclear%20delivery%20system%20left%20after%20a%20surprise%20attack&amp;f=false\">according to strategic analyst Desmond Ball</a> in his authoritative study of the Kennedy missile program, was in October 1961, when Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric informed the Business Council that \"the US would have a larger nuclear delivery system left after a surprise attack than the nuclear force which the Soviet Union could employ in its first strike.\"</p> <p>The Russians, of course, were well aware of their relative weakness and vulnerability. They were also aware of Kennedy's reaction when Khrushchev offered to sharply reduce offensive military capacity and proceeded to do so unilaterally when Kennedy failed to respond: namely, Kennedy undertook a huge armaments program.</p> <h2>In retrospect</h2> <p>The two most crucial questions about the missile crisis are how it began, and how it ended. It began with Kennedy's terrorist attack against Cuba, with a threat of invasion in October 1962. It ended with the president's rejection of Russian offers that would seem fair to a rational person, but were unthinkable because they would undermine the fundamental principle that the US has the unilateral right to deploy nuclear missiles anywhere, aimed at China or Russia or anyone else, and right on their borders; and the accompanying principle that Cuba had no right to have missiles for defense against what appeared to be an imminent US invasion. To establish these principles firmly, it was entirely proper to face a high risk of war of unimaginable destruction, and to reject simple, and admittedly fair, ways to end the threat.</p> <p>Garthoff observes that \"in the United States, there was almost universal approbation for President Kennedy's handling of the crisis.\" Dobbs writes that \"the relentlessly upbeat tone was established by the court historian, Arthur M Schlesinger Jr, who wrote that Kennedy had 'dazzled the world' through a 'combination of toughness and restraint, of will, nerve and wisdom, so brilliantly controlled, so matchlessly calibrated'.\" Rather more soberly, Stern partially agrees, noting that Kennedy repeatedly rejected the militant advice of his advisers and associates who called for military force and dismissal of peaceful options.</p> <p>The events of October 1962 are widely hailed as Kennedy's finest hour. <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/13626/the_next_hiroshima/\">Graham Allison joins many others in presenting</a> them as \"a guide for how to defuse conflicts, manage great-power relationships, and make sound decisions about foreign policy in general\". In a very narrow sense, that judgment seems reasonable. The ExComm tapes reveal that the president stood apart from others, sometimes almost all others, in rejecting premature violence.</p> <p>There is, however, a further question: how should JFK's relative moderation in management of the crisis be evaluated against the background of the broader considerations just reviewed? But that question does not arise in a disciplined intellectual and moral culture, which accepts without question the basic principle that the US effectively owns the world by right, and is, by definition, a force for good despite occasional errors and misunderstandings, so that it is plainly entirely proper for the US to deploy massive offensive force all over the world, while it is an outrage for others (allies and clients apart) to make even the slightest gesture in that direction, or even to think of deterring the threatened use of violence by the benign global hegemon.</p> <p>That doctrine is the primary official charge against Iran today: it might pose a deterrent to US and Israeli force. It was a consideration during the missile crisis as well. In internal discussion, the Kennedy brothers expressed their fears that Cuban missiles might deter a US invasion of Venezuela then under consideration. So \"the Bay of Pigs was really right,\" JFK concluded.</p> <p>The principles still contribute to the constant risk of nuclear war. There has been no shortage of severe dangers since the missile crisis. Ten years later, during the 1973 Israel-Arab war, Henry Kissinger called a high-level nuclear alert (Defcon 3) to warn the Russians to keep hands off <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB98/press.htm\">while he was secretly authorizing Israel to violate the ceasefire</a> imposed by the US and Russia. When Reagan came into office a few years later, the US launched operations probing Russian defenses and simulating air and naval attacks, while placing Pershing missiles in Germany with a five-minute flight time to Russian targets, providing what the CIA called a \"super-sudden first strike\" capability.</p> <p>Naturally, this caused great alarm in Russia, which, unlike the US, has repeatedly been invaded and virtually destroyed. That led to a major war scare in 1983. There have been hundreds of cases when human intervention aborted a first strike minutes before launch, after automated systems gave false alarms. We don't have Russian records, but there's no doubt that their systems are far more accident-prone.</p> <p>Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have come close to nuclear war several times, and the sources of the conflict remain. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons#India.2C_Israel.2C_and_Pakistan\">Both have refused</a> to sign the non-proliferation treaty, along with Israel, and have received US support for development of their nuclear weapons programs \u2013 until today, in the case of India, now a US ally. War threats in the Middle East, which might become reality very soon, once again escalate the dangers.</p> <p>In 1962, war was avoided by Khrushchev's willingness to accept Kennedy's hegemonic demands. But we can hardly count on such sanity forever. It's a near miracle that nuclear war has so far been avoided. There is more reason than ever to attend to the <a href=\"http://www.pugwash.org/about/manifesto.htm\">warning of Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein</a>, almost 60 years ago, that we must face a choice that is \"stark and dreadful and inescapable\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war?</p> </blockquote>",

He told reporters she had not yet been assessed by British medics but said she would not have been brought to the UK at all if her chances recovery were not good.</p> <p>Six days after a gunman clambered into the back of a van full of her classmates and shot her from point blank range, the 14-year-old landed at Birmingham airport after flying by on a special air ambulance from Pakistan. Malala travelled to the UK on her own, but her family may follow later.</p> <p>The Queen Elizabeth hospital is also home to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, the primary receiving unit for military casualties returned from overseas.</p> <p>\"Malala's bravery in standing up for the right of all young girls in Pakistan to an education is an example to us all,\" said the foreign secretary, William Hague.</p> <p>A spokesman for Pakistan's military said the girl would require \"prolonged care to fully recover from the physical and psychological effects of the trauma that she has received\". That is likely to include the partial rebuilding of her skull and \"intensive neuro-rehabilitation\".</p> <p>While in the UK she will also be safe from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the militant group that has claimed responsibility for shooting her and which has vowed to try and kill her again if she recovers. The attempted murder of the young peace activist sparked worldwide condemnation and sent shockwaves through Pakistani society.</p> <p>Politicians have been forced to make strong public stands against the TTP, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets and journalists daring to reflect the public mood have been warned of planned reprisals by militants.</p> <p>Efforts to save the life of a young girl who rose to prominence in 2009 after writing a BBC blog describing the terror of living under Taliban insurgency in Pakistan's Swat valley have already seen her shuttled between hospitals. She was initially airlifted from Swat to Peshawar, where surgeons spent three hours removing a bullet that had become lodged near her spinal cord.</p> <p>Her injury was not instantly fatal because she ducked just before the gunman fired, apparently ensuring the bullet missed much of her brain. She was later moved to a hospital in Rawalpindi, the garrison town close to the Pakistani capital.</p> <p>Although she has been unconscious throughout her ordeal, relying on a ventilator to breathe, she has received bedside visits from some of the most powerful people in the land, including the prime minister and the army chief. The military has described her recovery as satisfactory and said she was able to move her legs and hands several days ago when her sedatives were reduced. It has not said whether she suffered any brain damage or other permanent trauma.</p> <p>Offers of assistance have poured in from across the world, including from paediatric surgeons at Johns Hopkins University's school of medicine in Baltimore, in the US. However, it was decided on Sunday that she should be moved to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.</p> <p>Moazzam Khan, spokesman for the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs, said the decision not to accept the US offer of help had been taken by her doctors for purely medical reasons. \"Several other countries had also offered treatment, and the US was among them,\" he said. \"But due to the conditions of the patient and keeping in view the distance and the hours of travelling Britain was preferred.\"</p> <p>The Queen Elizabeth is one of Britain's 16 major trauma centres specialising in treating severe gunshot wounds and major head injuries. The Foreign Office said the Islamabad government is bearing the costs of transportation and treatment.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, the UN special envoy for global education, launched an I am Malala petition on Monday. \"Today, sadly, 32 million girls are not going to school, and it is time to fight harder for Malala's dream to come true,\" he said. He added he would hand the petition to Asif Ali Zardari when he visited the Pakistani president next month and that it would also be given to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p>Police have arrested at least three suspects in connection with the attack but the two gunmen who carried out the shooting remain at large.</p> <p>The biggest rally yet showing solidarity with Malala was held in Karachi on Sunday with an estimated 10,000 people. Although some politicians have been criticised for not specifically naming the TTP in their otherwise damning statements about the incident, many analysts have been impressed by the resolve of Pakistan's leaders.</p> <p>Last week, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the powerful army chief, released a statement in which he called Yousafzai an \"icon of courage and hope\" and vowed to fight against terror \"regardless of the cost\". There has even been speculation that the current mood of national outrage may lead to military operations to try and clear militants out of North Waziristan, an area near the border of Afghanistan where the US has long demanded action.</p> <p>On Monday however, Rehman Malik, the country's interior minister, said there were no such plans currently.</p>",
  "<p>It is late afternoon in a red-brick house in north Norfolk, and the four Kirk children are squished on to the sofa, still in their school uniforms, discussing the art of fake fighting. \"I&#xa0;fake-punched: I&#xa0;stopped about that far away,\" explains Shaun, his eyes broad and blue, hands held apart to show the proximity of his punch. \"We had to pretend to hit 'em, coz we weren't actually allowed to <em>actual</em> hit 'em, because if we did we'd get into more trouble.\"</p> <p>Stephanie, Robert, Shaun and Katrina Kirk are the four stars of Michael Winterbottom's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149646/everyday\" title=\"\">Everyday</a>, in competition at the London film festival this week. Shot intermittently over five years, it features <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/john-simm\" title=\"\">John Simm</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/03/shirley-henderson-interview\" title=\"\">Shirley Henderson</a> as a couple coping with his imprisonment for theft. As Simm sees out his jail term, we watch Henderson struggling to care for their children: the challenge of making ends meet, the difficulty of providing enough discipline and love, the loneliness of waiting.</p> <p>Key to the film's success is its steady rhythm of repetitions: the family home all dolled up each Christmas, the classrooms, the workplaces, the procession of buses and trains in the long journey to visit Simm, the visiting rooms with their plastic chairs and Formica tables. These airless scenes are interspersed with glorious shots of the Norfolk countryside wheeling through the seasons: rippling wheat fields and broad stretches of sand, poppies, hedgerows. Behind them swells a score by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/dec/25/paul-morley-christmas\" title=\"\">Michael Nyman</a>, a frequent Winterbottom collaborator.</p> <p>The Kirks were first approached in 2007. \"Michael had toured around looking for one small boy around Shaun's age,\" explains Sarah, the children's mother. \"They wanted someone who looked like they could be John's son, and they'd done eight or nine primary schools. We had a letter home from school to say they were doing a short film. Then the school rang up and said they wanted to film Shaun playing in his home environment. They didn't realise until then that I had three other children.\"</p> <p>Six weeks later, the film-makers were in touch to say they wanted to cast all four children. (\"It was Shaun we cast first,\" Winterbottom tells me later. \"He has this amazing face: there's something natural, but also something so expressive. But of course all the children were great.\") Their parents were hesitant. \"We just thought they were weirdos,\" their father, Colin, says bluntly. \"When we first heard about the film I said, 'Does that sound a bit weird or what?' We had to check up on the internet, make sure they were&#xa0;genuine.\"</p> <p>Their fears were allayed when Winterbottom visited to explain what the project would entail, and what he hoped it would produce. \"And they seemed genuine,\" says Colin. \"Just nice people. So I said to the kids, 'Do you want to make a film?' They said 'Dunno.' So I explained what it was about and they said, 'Yeah, all right.'\"</p> <p>Filming began a few months later, with the family home doubling as a location. Winterbottom issued the parents with strict instructions not to redecorate for five years, though they rebelled after two (\"because it was falling to bits,\" says Robert). Sometimes a shoot would last a week, sometimes three or four days \u2013 but they started at 6am and ran late into the evening. Sarah says the children had breaks and plenty of sweets to see them through, but often the camera shows them looking exhausted and tearful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783429\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350318651450/Everyday---Shirley-Hender-010.jpg\" alt=\"Everyday - Shirley Henderson and the Kirk children\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'I was amazed to see myself four years old' ... the Kirk children with Shirley Henderson in Everyday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At times, the children say, they grew frustrated by all the repetition. \"Doing it over and over and over,\" sighs Robert, now 12. \"Once you've done it six times you'd think, that's enough, but they'd do it more.\" Stephanie, 14, nods. \"And it's quite hard,\" she says, \"because you don't have a script, or a set line to say each time.\" Robert recalls how on one occasion he insisted Winterbottom simply stop. \"I told him, 'I've had enough, I want to go to bed,'\" he says. \"'He said, 'One more,' and then he did another three takes.\" The children laugh. \"But Michael knew what he was doing,\" says Stephanie, \"so we shouldn't really&#xa0;interfere. I was a little bit scared of him when I was younger, but now he's just like a mate.\"</p> <p>Some of the most moving scenes cover the sporadic visits to Simm in prison: the early starts, Henderson battling through wind and rain, the children trailing behind her. We see the young Shaun hurling himself at Simm's legs with a sobbed \"Dad!\" Later, an exhausted Katrina sits amid this dark, adult world and bursts into tears.</p> <p>\"Well, I didn't really know what a prison looked like when I was little, so when I first went in I thought: 'scary',\" Katrina says. \"It definitely smelled strange. It smelled damp.\" Then there were the actual prisoners, too \u2013 some of whom worked as extras. She was tired that day, and still only four years old. \"All these people were banging on their cell walls,\" adds Stephanie. \"We were all pretty scared.\"</p> <p>But the prize for on-screen crying has to go to Shaun. His huge blue eyes well up throughout the film, from those prison visits to being made to eat shepherd's pie. \"At first I did actually cry,\" he says, \"but then Michael wanted me to keep on doing it, so then I kept on making myself cry. Michael said to think of something that will upset you. So I just thought of something really, really sad. I just thought and thought, and then the last thing that popped into my head made me start crying. I'm not sure what it was \u2013 I've forgotten.\"</p> <p>\"The great worry of film-making is the impact it will have on the children,\" Winterbottom says. \"But because this was made over a long period of time, I think it's been a good thing for them, too.\" It was only once filming finished that he realised what a large part they had played in the children's lives: \"We visited them perhaps once every six months,\" he says. \"And it's strange, it's like having your own children \u2013 you don't notice them growing up, it's very incremental; time passing in the real world is very different to time passing in the fictional world, where you would cast a different actor for each stage of a boy growing up. But then you watch it back and you realise Shaun was still in nappies when we started&#xa0;filming.\"</p> <p>The children were given few lines and little direction, and as a result have an easy on-screen presence. \"They said, 'Just be yourselves, act natural,'\" Shaun remembers. \"I liked doing it, I found it quite fun.\" For Robert, there was the delight of being encouraged to misbehave: his character dabbles in petty theft, fights, stays out late. \"Michael didn't really explain it,\" Robert says. \"He just said, 'Be naughty.' The naughtiest thing I did was go out to the forest, and I came back really late. I was out till about nine.\" When he does return, he is shown carrying a squirrel he has shot with his father's rifle. \"Some other people shot it,\" he explains. \"I just had to carry it. It felt like a cat, a bit heavy.\"</p> <p>The on-screen bond between Simm, Henderson and the children is tangible; their real-life father says it was strange to see his children refer so easily to another man as 'Dad'. Simm and Henderson visited before filming began. They were nervous to have such famous actors in the house, the children say. \"I had seen Shirley in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/harrypotter\" title=\"\">Harry Potter</a> and John in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0\" title=\"\">Doctor Who</a>,\" Robert says. Simm took the boys out to <a href=\"http://www.wells-guide.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wells-next-the-Sea</a>. \"We went down to the Pop Inn cafe,\" Sarah says, \"where they have little 2p machines, and we bought ice creams.\"</p> <p>Katrina laughed the first time she watched the film, set off by Shaun impersonating Homer Simpson on the big screen. Shaun himself was mesmerised: \"I didn't really know what I looked like when I was young, and growing up and up and up and up,\" he says. \"I was just really amazed to see myself four or five years old.\"</p> <p>Their mother was in floods. \"I cried the whole way through,\" she laughs. \"Colin did as well. And he never cries. But he took a glance at me and saw me with the tissues and it set him off.\" She looks across at Colin standing in the doorway and smiles tenderly. The couple grew up locally, met at a 4 July party at the Crown in <a href=\"http://www.burnhammarket.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Burnham Market</a>, and have been together for 15 years. \"She chatted me up!\" Colin says proudly. \"She said, 'If you want a real woman, come and see me.' Sarah blushes.</p> <p>The experience of filming has changed the children, their parents say. \"I think they're better at lying,\" Colin smiles. \"And you're a bit more confident now, aren't you?\" Sarah says to Katrina. They will not discuss money, \"but they've been made comfortable,\" Colin says. \"Put it that way.\"</p> <p>Winterbottom filmed at the children's schools: shots of lunchtime football, carol concerts, the morning drop-off, the afternoon collection. The children were also allowed time off to attend film festivals. But some of their classmates have been less understanding. \"They didn't believe me [that I was in a film],\" Robert says, with a prickle of frustration. \"I was telling them and they were all like, 'No you're not, no you're not.'\" The children hope that when the film screens this autumn on Channel 4 \u2013 <a href=\"http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2012/everyday\" title=\"\">which part-funded the project as a way of exploring the impact on families of jail time</a> \u2013 they might be vindicated.</p> <p>Already there have been screenings at the <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/telluride-review-michael-winterbottoms-everyday-is-uneven-long-but-emotionally-rewarding-20120903\" title=\"\">Telluride</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149646/everyday\" title=\"\">Toronto</a> film festivals, for which the family got passports and flew for the first time. \"Telluride was lovely,\" says Sarah. \"We had three big bedrooms, and a big spa bath, which you decided to try out, didn't you?\" She nudges Shaun. \"But he mucked it up,\" Katrina giggles. \"He turned it on with all the jets going the wrong way,\" Colin explains.</p> <p>This week they will be in London, and tomorrow will walk the red carpet and try not to get overawed by the crowds and flashing cameras. The children have been practising their autographs. Will their film win the festival's top prize? Robert gives a faint frown. \"Probably,\" he says. \"Probably.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Everyday screens on Channel 4 in November, and at <a href=\"http://www.film4.com/minisite/the-london-film-festival-2012\" title=\"\">the London film festival</a> this week</p>",
  "<p>When I was four and five and six years old we watched the moon landings on TV then waited nervously for the <a href=\"http://moonpans.com/apollo_11/apollo_11_splashdown.jpg\" title=\"\">splashdown</a> and the astronauts' release from their seared capsule with its orange flotation bags bobbing on a white and blue sea. In the same way millions of people watched <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/felix-baumgartner\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner</a>'s astonishing fall through the empty sky on YouTube. In his protective suit the Austrian daredevil looked for all the world like some Apollo astronaut of the 1960s.

He forgot to add, said Marx \u2013 the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. Not that Baumgartner's dive was farce. It was heroic, if not foolhardy. In terms of sheer mad bravery it was stupendous.

It is in essence the same as tumbling <a href=\"http://www.niagarafallslive.com/daredevils_of_niagara_falls.htm\" title=\"\">over Niagara Falls in a barrel</a>. People have always done brave things, and in the early 20th century going over Niagara Falls in a barrel became the leap of choice for publicity-conscious stunt people (first over the top was a woman, in 1901). Yet amazing as such jumps were, did they add to human knowledge and capacity? No \u2013 the first powered flight by the Wright brothers, which was much less spectacular, just off the ground in fact, changed the world in a way stunts do not. The images of this leap look like exploration but actually are mere entertainment.</p> <p>The visual similarity between Baumgartner's record-breaking fall and the feats of engineering audacity that took human beings on to the surface of the moon and then, even in the cash-strapped 1970s, built a landable and reusable spacecraft is cruelly deceptive. Baumgartner's freefall is not the same as the public-funded, state-sponsored efforts of an entire scientific generation that not so long ago sent Neil Armstrong on to the silver dust of the lunar surface. Look closer and the visual image of this 21st century hero is not so 20th century, after all. His helmet has the words Red Bull on it, not a stars and stripes. Indeed, Red Bull logos and inscriptions are all over his space suit.</p> <p>The confusion between a publicity stunt and the great space missions of the last century is fully intended by the sponsor, to judge from images of what it calls \"Mission Control\" at Roswell, New Mexico. Mission Control is written in big letters on the wall with all those echoes of white-shorted bespectacled geeks getting Apollo 13 safely home. But again the none too subtle visual give-away: this is <a href=\"http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1378894.ece/ALTERNATES/s510/Red+Bull+Stratos:+Mission+Control\" title=\"\">Red Bull Stratos Mission Control</a>, says the sign. Not Nasa after all.</p> <p>Seeing the earth from Baumgartner's helmet is spectacular and sad: wondrous to see this orb as the astronauts saw it, amazing that he is so high he can see the planet as a planet, but sad because he is plummeting back. All he has done is stretch gravity's elastic a bit further. What happened to breaking it entirely?</p> <p>The epic state spending that sent serious missions to the moon is a thing of the past. As Baumgartner prepared for his stunt, the space shuttle, relic of an age when in Apollo's wake space exploration seemed destined to become ever better, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/uk-usa-space-idUSLNE89E00C20121015\" title=\"\">was being ferried to its final resting place in a Los Angeles museum</a>. Today, private money pays for record-breaking achievements that come nowhere near the optimism of Nasa's golden age. Is exploration still a marvel <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17503395\" title=\"\">when James Cameron can buy his way into the record books</a>?</p> <p>The digital age is not an age for astronauts. Google the words \"Moon landings\" and one of the most popular search phrases offered is \"moon landings faked\".</p> <p>So in place of true exploration we idolise this pseudo-astronaut: the man who fell to earth, with style.</p>",
  "<p>Today is <a href=\"http://blogactionday.org/\" title=\"\">Blog Action Day</a>, an annual event that aims to unite the world's bloggers by asking them to post about the same issue on the same day to raise awareness and trigger global discussion. The topic for 2012 is 'the power of we'. A common prejudice around blogging and social media is that it's all about 'me'. Critics often dismiss blogs either as <a href=\"http://nickpiombino.blogspot.co.uk/2004/01/blogging-and-narcissism-from-never.html\" title=\"\">narcissistic</a> (\"we're not interested in that discussion now; <a href=\"http://butterflyhunt.tumblr.com/post/631798474/oh-deja-vu-on-social-media-and-narcissism-redux\" title=\"\">been there, done that</a>\") or as so-called <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.211.8065%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&amp;ei=2jJ8UOSmLIOc0QW36YDABQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHY4gIYNg1Him_P2609wrSefhxw1g\" title=\"\">echo-chambers</a>.</p> <p>On the contrary, I would argue that blogging and social media empower the individual to have a voice and that this voice only becomes meaningful when it addresses, listens to and engages with others.</p> <p>I have blogged before about finding Twitter <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2011/sep/12/twitter-revolutionise-academia-research\" title=\"\">a unique tool for engagement while completing my PhD</a>. More recent phenomena, such as <a href=\"http://hastac.org/blogs/ernesto-priego/2012/01/14/youre-not-alone-tweetyourthesis-or-academic-social-networking-empowe\" title=\"\">the #tweetyourthesis tag,</a> remind PhD students they are not alone in their often isolated scholarly life. On the Networked Researcher site, Julio Peironcely also wrote about how blogging and social media <a href=\"http://www.networkedresearcher.co.uk/2012/10/04/loneliness-as-a-phd-student/\" title=\"\">can help PhD students fight loneliness</a>.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is Jean Paul Sartre's belief that hell is other people. In academic life (as in other professional paths), collective work can often take longer or become more complicated than one would personally wish. At a time when there are more post PhD graduates than paid jobs for existing PhDs, and in a profession that correlates traditional notions of originality with hierarchical authority or reputation, collaboration might seem counterintuitive \u2013 an obstacle to individual success.</p> <p>As technologies that enable collective and remote collaboration, blogging and social media often clash with paradigms of individual success and privilege (by definition, privilege depends on the lack of privilege of others). But for me, blogging's innate 'power of we' is synonymous with collegiality \u2013 the cooperative relationship between colleagues.</p> <p>Blogging and social media in higher education and academic research offer plenty of examples of successful and positive collective action. Projects such as the <a href=\"http://uvenus.org/\" title=\"\">University of Venus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/\" title=\"\">Transcribe Bentham</a>, <a href=\"http://hastac.org/\" title=\"\">HASTAC</a>, <a href=\"http://humanistica.ualberta.ca/\" title=\"\">4Humanities</a> and <a href=\"http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/\" title=\"\">Digital Humanities Now</a> are evidence that scholars are happy to experiment with, and redefine, paradigms of scholarly communication, authority and originality. Academics are collaborating remotely via these spaces, often across different time zones and often in spite of difficult personal and institutional circumstances in which digital scholarship is still not officially recognised or rewarded.</p> <p>Instead of seeing an academic colleague as a potential professional competitor, threat or even enemy, the power of we in academia means seeing them as potential collaborator and even friend. Blogging means believing, sometimes against discouraging evidence, that there's strength in numbers, and that collective intelligence and collaboration are quickly becoming the default mode of 21st century research.</p> <p><em>Ernesto Priego is a freelance researcher affiliated with the </em><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/\" title=\"\"><em>UCL Centre for Digital Humanities</em></a><em> and also coordinates </em><a href=\"http://www.comicsgrid.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Comics Grid, Journal of Comics Scholarship</em></a><em> \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ernestopriego\" title=\"\"><em>@ernestopriego</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The current Scottish folk renaissance has centred on inventive instrumentalists who can&nbsp;switch easily between genres, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.karinepolwart.com/\" title=\"\">Karine Polwart</a> has brought the same sense of the unexpected to her songwriting. She's a cool, thoughtful singer who is remarkable mostly for her&nbsp;lyrics, her ability to mix stories and&nbsp;memories with a sometimes epic sense of time and history, and flashes of&nbsp;anger.</p> <p>She started with Cover Your Eyes, a drifting piece that developed into a furious attack on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/10/donald-trump-scotland-golf-course\" title=\"\">Donald Trump's controversial golf development on the&nbsp;Aberdeenshire coast</a>, and ended with the threat that the haar, the Scottish sea mist, will take its revenge. Then she moved on to&nbsp;songs about death, with Strange News examining&nbsp;her thoughts on the passing of a young cousin, followed later by We're All Leaving, a song she contributed to the <a href=\"http://www.darwinsongproject.com/artists-karine-polwart.html\" title=\"\">Darwin&nbsp;song project</a>, which considered the impact of his daughter's death on Charles Darwin's work. Then there were stories of nature and childhood, and an epic history of St Paul's cathedral in London, inspired by&nbsp;the Occupy movement.</p> <p>The least memorable songs were the&nbsp;most conventional. Five More Sleeps&nbsp;deals with her time on tour, talking to her young children on Skype,&nbsp;while her finale was a cheerfully&nbsp;unlikely treatment of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCfRcgoPxTw\" title=\"\">Billy Bragg's A New England</a>, with ukulele backing from her brother Steven.</p> <p>On her new album, Traces, some songs were marred by over-lush production work, but here Polwart was&nbsp;backed by her own Indian harmonium&nbsp;and guitar, and her sympathetic four-piece band that included exquisite backing vocals&nbsp;and accordion from Fair islander Inge Thomson. Her one solo piece proved that she has the potential to become another Scottish folk celebrity.</p>",
  "<p>Shortly after 10pm on 18 June 1994, Ireland were 1-0 up against Italy in the opening match of the 1994 World Cup. at the Giants Stadium in New Jersey. The second half had just kicked off, and inside the Heights Bar at Loughinisland, 21 miles south of Belfast, all eyes were on the television. The bar is tiny: there were 15 men inside, and it was packed.</p> <p>Aidan O'Toole, the owner's 23-year-old son, was serving. \"I heard the door open and then I just heard crack, crack, crack and felt a stabbing pain inside me,\" he recalls. \"I just ran. It was instinctive. I didn't know what was happening but I knew I had to get away.\"</p> <p>Others inside the bar turned when the door opened and saw two men in boiler suits, their faces hidden by balaclavas. One of the intruders dropped to one knee and fired three bursts from an automatic rifle. Barney Green was sitting with his back to the door, close enough for the gunmen to reach out and tap his shoulder had they wished. He took the first blast, with around nine rounds passing through him before striking other men. Green, a retired farmer, was 87.</p> <p>Green's nephew, Dan McCreanor, 59, another farmer, died alongside him. A second burst killed Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, who was at the bar, and Adrian Rogan, 34, who was trying to escape to the lavatory. A third burst aimed at a table to the right of the door missed Willie O'Hare but killed his son-in-law, Eamon Byrne, 39. O'Hare's son Patsy, 35, was also shot and died en route to hospital. Five men were injured: one, who lost part of a foot, would spend nine months in hospital.</p> <p>O'Toole returned to the bar from a back room after hearing the killers' car screech away. A bullet was lodged in his left kidney and a haze of gun smoke filled the room. But he could see clearly enough. \"There were bodies piled on top of each other. It was like a dream; a nightmare.\"</p> <p>Most of the victims had been hit several times. Thirty rounds were fired, and some had passed through one man, ricocheted around the tiny room, then struck a second. Adrian Rogan's father pushed his way into the bar and whispered a short prayer in his son's ear, knowing he was not going to survive.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughinisland\" title=\"\">Loughinisland</a> had been scarcely touched by the Troubles. A village of 600 or so people, where Catholics and Protestants had lived side by side for generations, none of its sons or daughters had been killed or hurt before, and none had been accused of terrorist offences. It is not a republican area \u2013 many of its Catholic inhabitants were so uninterested in politics that they did not vote even for the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) \u2013 and Protestants often drank at the Heights. Only by chance were no Protestants killed or wounded that night.</p> <p>Ninety minutes after the attack, a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), telephoned a radio station to claim responsibility.</p> <p><strong>Police promises</strong></p> <p>Despite years of death and destruction in Northern Ireland, people around the world were shocked by the slaughter at the Heights. The Queen, Pope John Paul&#xa0;II and Bill Clinton sent messages of sympathy. Local Protestant families visited their injured and traumatised neighbours in hospital, expressing shock and disgust.</p> <p>The police told the victims' families they would leave no stone unturned in their efforts to catch the killers and bring them to justice.</p> <p>The morning after the killings, the gunmen's getaway car, a red Triumph Acclaim, was found abandoned in a field seven miles from Loughinisland. The farmer who spotted it called the police at 10.04am. The recovery of such a vehicle was quite rare during the Troubles \u2013 paramilitaries often torched them to destroy forensic evidence \u2013 and police were soon at the scene to take possession. There was no forensic examination of the area around the car, however.</p> <p>A few weeks later, workmen found a holdall under a bridge a couple of miles from where the car had been found. Inside were three boiler suits, three balaclavas, three pairs of surgical gloves, three handguns, ammunition and a magazine. Not far from the bridge, police found a Czech-made VZ-58 assault rifle, which scientists confirmed was the weapon used to kill the men at the Heights.</p> <p>The same weapon had been used the previous October<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/catholic-shot-dead-in-ambush-attack-on-workmen-in-minibus-seen-as-loyalist-warning-to-workers-at-shorts-aerospace-factory-1510516.html\" title=\"\"> in a UVF attack on a van carrying Catholic painters to work</a> at Shorts aircraft and missile factory in Belfast, in which one man died and five others were wounded.</p> <p>In the months that followed the Loughinisland shootings, nine people were arrested and questioned. All nine were released without charge. A 10th was arrested and released the following year, and two more suspects were arrested for questioning a year after that, all released without charge. The police repeatedly assured the families that no stone would be left unturned.</p> <p>Emma Rogan was eight years old when her father, Adrian, was killed at the Heights. \"I was told that these bad men came into the bar, and that my daddy was dead. I didn't really know what they meant.\"</p> <p>As she grew up, she had no reason to doubt the police when they said they were doing everything in their power to catch the killers. \"We didn't question the police: that's what this area is like. If they said they would leave no stone unturned, you took that at face value.\"</p> <p>By the time the 10th anniversary of the killings came around, Rogan was anxious to learn more about her father's death, and hear of any progress the police had made. A series of meetings was organised between senior investigators of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the victims' relatives, and later more information emerged when the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland <a href=\"http://www.policeombudsman.org/Publicationsuploads/Loughinisland%20statement.pdf\" title=\"\">published a report in 2011</a> on the investigation. Relatives of the dead men came to the conclusion, as Rogan puts it, that \"they had treated us like mushrooms, keeping us in the dark for years and feeding us whatnot\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403913414\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/12/1350057259661/A-memorial-plaque-in-the--001.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial plaque in the room where six men were murdered at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland\" width=\"320\" height=\"268\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial plaque in the room where six men were murdered in a 1994 Loyalist attack on the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, County Down, Northern Ireland.

The morning after the killings, a Belfast police officer was asked to call at this person's home. The officer did so, but found the man was out. The officer then recorded the time of his visit as 9.30am - 34 minutes before the farmer had rung police to tell them he had discovered the car.</p> <p>Some time between 11am and noon, a second police officer \u2013 a detective with no connection to the murder inquiry \u2013 telephoned the second person in the ownership chain, and asked him to come to the local police station to give a statement. How this detective came to know that the car had passed through this man's hands is unclear. What is known, however, is that a statement was given, and that a note was attached to it, saying that the individual who gave it could be contacted only through the detective who took it.</p> <p>The Loughinisland families argue this amounts to evidence that the person who gave this statement \u2013 one of the people involved in supplying the car used by the killers \u2013 was a police informer.</p> <p>The Guardian has interviewed this man. He is Terry Fairfield, and today he runs a pub in the south of England. Fairfield confirms that he was a member of the UVF at the time, but denies he was a police informer. He says he did subsequently receive several thousand pounds from the detective, for helping him take a firearm and some explosives out of circulation. He accepts that being invited to attend a police station, rather than being arrested, was highly unorthodox. The detective says he had known Fairfield for years and contacted him after hearing of the Loughinisland shooting, but that only members of the murder inquiry could decide whether to arrest him.</p> <p>A second man, who is widely suspected locally of having been in the getaway car, and who is also alleged to have been an informer, has also told the Guardian that he has never been arrested.</p> <p>The families also question the failure to take samples from some of the people arrested for questioning. The Guardian understands that at least five of the men arrested in the months after the shootings were not fingerprinted before being released without charge. No DNA swabs were taken from either of the two people arrested in 1996.</p> <p>One man, Gorman McMullan, who has been <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/50616601/Sunday-World-also-Gagged-by-Northumbria-Police-Top-Cops-Gag-Newspaper-What-the-hell-have-have-Chief-Superintendent-Chris-Thomson-Temporary\" title=\"\">named as a suspect in a Northern Ireland newspaper</a>, was arrested the month after the shootings and released without charge. He was one of the people who were released without being fingerprinted and no DNA swab was taken. McMullan firmly denies that he has ever been to Loughinisland or that he was ever in the getaway car, and no further action was taken against him in connection with the shootings. He acknowledges however that he was \"involved in the conflict\".</p> <p>The police admitted to the families at one of their meetings that they had handed the getaway car to a scrap metal firm to be crushed and baled. They said this had been done because the vehicle was taking up too much space in a police station yard. That decision means it can never again be tested for comparison with samples taken from any new suspects.</p> <p><strong>Families' disbelief</strong></p> <p>Emma Rogan and Aidan O'Toole cannot believe that the destruction of the car or other failings in the investigation were an accident. They believe that this is evidence of police collusion. \"They knew exactly what they were doing,\" Rogan says.</p> <p>The families lodged a complaint with the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland. When the ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, published <a href=\"http://www.policeombudsman.org/Publicationsuploads/Loughinisland%20statement.pdf\" title=\"\">his report</a>, it contained mild criticism of an investigation that displayed \"a lack of cohesive and focused effort\". To the anger of the families, it refused to state whether or not police informants were suspected of involvement and appeared to gloss over the forensic failures. It concluded that the destruction of the car was \"inappropriate\", rather than evidence of corruption or collusion.</p> <p>The report was widely condemned in Northern Ireland. Hutchinson agreed to leave his post, and his successor is now reviewing the report. There will be no examination of the arms shipment, however, as the ombudsman's remit extends only to the police, not the army.</p> <p>Much of the suspicion about British involvement in the 1987 arms shipment revolves around <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/apr/17/guardianobituaries.northernireland\" title=\"\">Brian Nelson</a>, a former soldier who joined the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in the early 70s. In 1985, Nelson offered himself as an informant to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Research_Unit\" title=\"\">Force Research Unit</a> (FRU), a covert unit within the army's intelligence corps that recruited and ran agents in Northern Ireland. He quit the UDA the following year and moved to Germany with his wife and children. The FRU, operating with the approval of MI5, approached Nelson in Germany and persuaded him to return to Belfast to rejoin the UDA as an army agent.</p> <p>For the next three years, Nelson was paid \u00a3200 a week by the government while operating as the UDA's intelligence officer, helping to select targets for assassination. He informed his army handlers in advance of attacks: only two were halted, while at least three people were killed and attempts were made on the lives of at least eight more.</p> <p>A detailed account of this extraordinary operation appears in <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/collusion/cory/cory03finucane.pdf\" title=\"\">a report on the loyalist killing of the Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane</a> that Peter Cory, a retired Canadian supreme court judge, prepared at the request of the government in 2004. An FRU report from July 1985 discloses that the army paid Nelson's travel expenses when he travelled to Durban in South Africa that year to make initial contact with an arms dealer. \"The [British] army appears to have at least encouraged Nelson in his attempt to purchase arms in South Africa for the UDA,\" Cory concludes. \"Nelson certainly went to South Africa in 1985 to meet an arms dealer. His expenses were paid by FRU. The army appears to have been committed to facilitating Nelson's acquisition of weapons, with the intention that they would be intercepted at some point en route to Northern Ireland.\"</p> <p>Nelson is said to have told the FRU that the UDA possessed insufficient funds at that time to purchase any arms. \"The evidence with regard to the completion of the arms transaction is frail and contradictory,\" Cory says. As a result, \"whether the transaction was consummated remains an open question\".</p> <p>In July 1987, the funds to purchase a large consignment of weapons were secured with the robbery of more than \u00a3325,000 from a branch of Northern Bank in Portadown, 30 miles south-west of Belfast. The proceeds of the robbery were to be used to purchase weapons that were to be split three ways between the UDA, the UVF and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Resistance\" title=\"\">Ulster Resistance</a> (UR), a paramilitary organisation set up by unionists in response to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.</p> <p>What happened next is described by a former senior employee with South Africa's Armscor, a man who was intimately involved in the plot to smuggle the weapons into Northern Ireland. According to this source, officials in South Africa introduced a senior figure within UR to one of the corporation's representatives in Europe, an American arms dealer called Douglas Bernhardt.</p> <p>In October 1987, Bernhardt is said to have flown to Gatwick airport for a face-to-face meeting with a senior UDA commander, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McMichael\" title=\"\">John McMichael</a>, after which couriers carried money from the bank raid, in cash, to Bernhardt's office in Geneva.</p> <p>Bernhardt was not told where the money had come from, according to the Armscor source. \"When you get that sort of dirty banknote, you don't ask,\" the source says. Bernhardt obtained a bank draft which was then sent to an arms dealer in Beirut, who had obtained the weapons from a Lebanese militia.</p> <p>As the operation progressed, according to the Armscor source, Bernhardt would regularly call his UR contact at his place of work. This man would then call back from a payphone, and they would talk in a simple code, referring to the weapons as \"the parcel of fruit\". At each stage, Bernhardt is said to have been told that the arrangements needed to be agreed by McMichael and by his intelligence officer \u2013 Brian Nelson. \"Everything had to be run by the head of intelligence.\"</p> <p>Bernhardt is said then to have travelled by ship to Beirut, where arrangements were made to pack the weapons into a shipping container labelled as a consignment of ceramic floor tiles. Bills of lading and a certificate of origin were organised, and the weapons were shipped to Belfast docks via Liverpool.</p> <p>\"There were at least a couple of hundred Czech-made AKs \u2013 the VZ-58,\" the Armscor source recalls. \"And 90-plus Browning-type handguns: Hungarian-made P9Ms. About 30,000 rounds of 7.62 x 39mm ammunition, not the 51mm Nato rounds. Plus a dozen or so RPGs, and a few hundred fragmentation grenades.\"</p> <p>Sources within both the police and the UVF have confirmed that one of the VZ-58s was used at Loughinisland.</p> <p>According to the Armscor source, the UR member who dealt with Bernhardt was Noel Little, a civil servant and former British soldier. Now in his mid-60s and living quietly in an affluent Belfast suburb, Little denies this. \"My position is that I wasn't involved,\" Little says. But he adds: \"I would deny it even if I was.\"</p> <p>Little confirms, however, that he was a founder member of UR, and a central figure within the organisation at the time that the weapons arrived in Belfast. He also appears to possess detailed knowledge of the way in which the arms were smuggled and distributed.</p> <p>The weapons arrived in Belfast in December 1987, a few days before McMichael was killed by an IRA car bomb. Early in the new year, they were split three ways at a farmhouse in County Armagh. The UDA lost its entire slice of the pie within minutes: its share of about 100 weapons was loaded into the boot of two hire cars that were stopped a few minutes later at a police roadblock near Portadown. The three occupants were later jailed, with their leader, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Payne\" title=\"\">Davy Payne</a>, receiving a 19-year sentence.</p> <p>The following month, police recovered around half the UVF's weapons after a tip-off led them to an outhouse on the outskirts of north Belfast. Fairfield says he recalls being shown what remained of the UVF's new arsenal, in storage at a house in the city that was being renovated. \"I made the mistake of touching one,\" he says, adding that this could result in him being linked to the October 1993 killing outside the Shorts factory.</p> <p>Little was also arrested, after his telephone number was found written on the back of Payne's hand. \"John McMichael had given it to him, in case he got into any trouble in Armagh,\" Little says. \"I lost three-quarters of a stone [4.75kg] during the seven days I was questioned. The police put me under extreme psychological pressure.\" Eventually, he was released without charge.</p> <p>Little says that while UR redistributed a few of its weapons \u2013 \"there were some deals around the edges\" \u2013 most of its consignment was kept intact.</p> <p>\"They were never used. They were for the eventuality of the British just walking away \u2013 doing an Algeria \u2013 after the Anglo-Irish agreement was signed.\" As far as he is aware, the consignment has never been decommissioned.</p> <p><strong>Dramatic arrest</strong></p> <p>The following year saw Little arrested again, this time in France, in dramatic fashion. He had travelled to Paris with two fellow loyalists, James King and Samuel Quinn, to meet Bernhardt and a South African intelligence officer operating under the name Daniel Storm. Officers of the French security agency, Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST), seized the three Ulstermen and the South African in a raid on a room at the Hilton International, at the same moment that Bernhardt was being grabbed in the foyer of the H\u00f4tel George-V, and lifted bodily, according to one witness, out of the building and into a waiting car.</p> <p>The five had been caught red-handed attempting to trade stolen parts from the sighting system of a ground-to-air missile that was under development at the Shorts factory. The apartheid regime wanted to use the parts in the development of its own missile for use in Angola, where its ground forces were vulnerable to attack by Cuban-piloted MiGs. \"This deal was about speed,\" says the Armscor source. \"If you've got Cuban-piloted jets whacking your troops in border wars, you don't have the luxury of saying: 'We'll have a research programme over time.' You've got to speed up the R&amp;D.\"</p> <p>Storm was set free after claiming diplomatic immunity, while the others were interrogated in the basement of the DST's headquarters in the 15th arrondissement. \"I was slapped about a little,\" says Little. \"But not too much.\" The DST told Bernhardt it had listened in on a meeting the previous night, through a bug in the chandelier of the room at the George-V where the men had gathered. \"They knew all about the fruit code used in 1987,\" the Armscor source says. \"They thought the talk about pineapples was a huge joke. They must have been monitoring the phone calls. And they knew all about Lebanon.</p> <p>\"My guess is that the British were intercepting those phone calls. But the British didn't get all the weapons. How much did they know in advance? Why didn't they move more quickly? Maybe they were perfectly happy to have that material \u2026 sort of 'arrive', and put into the hands of the loyalists. Christ knows, the IRA had had enough of their own shipments, everywhere from Boston to Tripoli.\"</p> <p>Noel Little also suspects the British turned a blind eye to the 1987 arms shipment. \"It is a theory I can't discount,\" he says. \"Brian Nelson was inserted into the UDA as an agent, he wasn't a recruited member. Ho w could he know about it and not tell his handler?\"</p> <p>Little believes that his attempt to hand over stolen missile technology to Armscor in Paris \u2013 straying into \"secrets and commerce\", as he puts it \u2013 would have been a step too far for the British authorities, obliging them to tip off the French.</p> <p>After eight months on remand, the four men were brought to court charged with arms trafficking, handling stolen goods and terrorism-related conspiracy. Bernhardt told the court that he had helped arrange the Lebanese arms deal for loyalist paramilitaries in 1987. The four were sentenced to time served and fined between 20,000 and 100,000 francs (\u00a32,000-\u00a310,000 then).</p> <p>Brian Nelson was finally arrested in January 1990 after John Stevens, then deputy chief constable of Cambridgeshire, had been brought in to investigate collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. While awaiting trial, Nelson wrote a journal in which he recounted his time as an army agent inside the UDA. \"I was bitten by a bug ... hooked is probably a more appropriate word. One becomes enmeshed in a web of intrigue, conspiracies, confidences, dangers ...\"</p> <p>After flying to Durban in 1985, he wrote, his South African contacts had asked whether he would be able to obtain a missile from Shorts. Two years later, while talking about the South African connection with \"Ronnie\", his FRU handler, he had been told that \"because of the deep suspicion a seizure would have aroused, to protect me it had been decided to let the first shipment into the country untouched\". Nelson added that \"Ronnie\" assured him that the arms consignment would be under surveillance.</p> <p>In 1993, an intelligence source told the BBC that this had happened: the consignment had indeed been under surveillance by a number of agencies, but the wrong port was watched, with the result that the weapons slipped through.At Nelson's eventual court appearance, a plea deal resulted in Nelson being jailed for 10 years after he admitted 20 offences, including conspiracy to murder. Murder charges were dropped. More than 40 other people were also convicted of terrorism offences as a result of the Stevens investigation. They did not include any of the intelligence officers for whom Nelson worked.</p> <p>Stevens' investigation team was well aware of concerns surrounding the importation of the weapons. Members of the team talked to former Armscor officials in South Africa, but concluded that an investigation into the matter was so unlikely to produce any results as to be fruitless. However, a senior member of the inquiry team says he believes it feasible that the UK authorities could have been involved in bringing the weapons into Belfast \u2013 or at least turned a blind eye. \"It's not at all far-fetched,\" he says.</p> <p>By the time of the Loughinisland massacre, loyalist gunmen with access to the Armscor arsenal were killing at least as many people as the IRA. Czech-made VZ-58 assault rifles were used in many of the killings. A few weeks after the shootings at the Heights Bar, the IRA<a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/docs/ira31894.htm\" title=\"\"> announced a ceasefire</a>.</p> <p>Many in Northern Ireland are convinced that the importation of the Armscor weapons, and the large numbers of killings that followed, contributed greatly to the IRA's decision. Among them is Noel Little, who says: \"There's no doubt that that shipment did change things.\"</p> <p>Increasingly, the IRA was forced to defend itself against attacks by loyalists, it was diverted into targeting loyalist paramilitaries rather than police officers or soldiers, and it came under pressure from nationalists as more and more Catholic people were slaughtered. To Little's way of thinking, the Armscor weapons \"tipped the balance against the IRA and eventually forced them to sue for peace\". And while he accepts \u2013 and says he deplores \u2013 the slaughter of innocent people at Loughinisland and elsewhere, he adds: \"Innocent bystanders are killed in every war.\"</p> <p>Six weeks after the IRA's announcement, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q80jDS8MbE\" title=\"\">loyalist paramilitaries announced</a> their own ceasefire.</p> <p>With the Loughinisland families no nearer to discovering the truth about the deaths of their loved ones following publication of the ombudsman's report, they embarked on their civil actions against the Ministry of Defence and the police in January this year. A letter of claim sent to the MoD says the claim is based in part on \"the army's knowledge of and facilitation of the shipment\", while one sent to the Police Service of Northern Ireland says the claim arises from a series of failings, including \"closing off investigative opportunities\" and \"the destruction of vital evidence\".</p> <p>Their lawyer, Niall Murphy, says: \"The experience of these six families demonstrates that the current mechanisms for truth recovery do not work.\"</p> <p>Rogan and O'Toole remain tormented by the events of June 1994. \"The people who died in this room didn't know anything about the Troubles, and yet they were slaughtered,\" says Rogan. O'Toole, who still has a bullet lodged in his kidney, becomes emotional when he walks into the Heights Bar. \"It's guilt,\" he whispers. \"They died in here, while I was keeping the bar.\"</p> <p>Both say they are angered even more by the evidence of inaction and failure that they have discovered in recent years, and by the signs of collusion that have slipped slowly to the surface, than they are about the killings themselves.</p> <p>And after 18 years, both use the same phrase to describe the way they believe their friends and relatives were regarded, both by the gunmen and by those institutions they looked to for protection: \"They were expendable.\"</p>",
  "<p>Around 1.8 million people die from diarrhoeal diseases every year. Nine out of ten of those are children under five. India's poor know only too well the tragedy behind these statistics. Over 1,000 under-fives die every day in the world's second most populous country from diarrhoea-induced dehydration.</p> <p>What can be done about it? Well, quite a lot as it happens. It doesn't take expensive vaccinations or cutting-edge medicine to prevent diarrhoea. Soap does the trick just fine. Handwashing before cooking and eating and after going to the toilet dramatically reduces the likelihood of diarrhoeal diseases. It sounds simple, but awareness of the health benefits of regular handwashing remains staggeringly low in a country like India.</p> <p>What's needed is a wholesale behaviour change. In the run-up to <a href=\"http://globalhandwashing.org/ghw-day\" title=\"\">Global Handwashing Day</a>, Guardian Sustainable Business convened a panel of experts to identify how companies can best contribute to mass culture-change campaigns. On hand with their views were: Sarah McDonald, global director for sustainability at Unilever; Myriam Sidibe, Lifebuoy global social mission director; Clement Chauvet, Unicef; Mark Eddleston, founder of World Hygiene Programme; James Ayers, programme implementer at Population Services International; Elynn Walter, WASH in schools director for WASH Advocates; Malini Mehra, founder and CEO of the Delhi-based Centre for Social Markets; and Katie Carroll, coordinator for the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPPHW).</p> <h2>Access</h2> <p>Whether it's condoms in the case of HIV or mosquito nets in the case of malaria, material access to preventative solutions is often critical. Not so with diarrhoea. Yes, infrastructure is vital. Proper sewage systems, adequate distribution of clean drinking, descent toilets and the like help reduce diarrhoeal disease. Of that, there's no doubt. Yet one of the most effective preventative measures of all - soap - is generally available. Hindustan Unilever, the Indian subsidiary of consumer goods company Unilever, has pioneered the sale of smaller, more affordable units of its products. Couple this with rural distribution programmes like <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/careers/insideunilever/oursuccessandchallenges/shaktiprogrammeindia/\" title=\"\">Shakti</a>, and availability in low-income communities is no longer the barrier it once was. The idea of subsidising soap supplies for public health campaigns is therefore not only unnecessary, but potentially counter-productive, argued WASH's Elynn Walter. Subsidies, after all, have a habit of eventually running out.</p> <h2>Education, education, education</h2> <p>It's not access to soap that's the issue, it's knowing when to use it. More important still, it's getting into the habit of using it. All agreed that habits start young. Better to create good behaviours from the off, than seek to change bad ones later. That puts schools squarely at the centre. School rules can be invaluable, pointed out Katie Carroll of handwashing advocacy group PPPHW. Group handwashing before meals, for instance, \"can be institutionalised in schools\". Beware of possible backlash, however. When schools in New York tried to insist on nutritional food in public school cafeterias, some pupils rebelled and began swapping their veggies for junk food, noted Malini Mehra of the Centre for Social Markets.</p> <p>Education doesn't stop at the school gates. Parents have a role too. Sarah McDonald, Unilever's global director for sustainability, pointed to lessons from her firm's teeth-brushing campaigns. \"Good old sticker charts\", where parents notch up their children's good practices, can work a treat, she suggested. Rewards help drum in the message. Unilever provides parents with a downloadable contract, which they sign with their children, who then receive a prize if they brush their teeth consistently for three weeks.</p> <h2>Social marketing</h2> <p>Several panellists highlighted the need to leverage corporation's marketing muscle. \"We need to 'sell' these behaviours the same way we would 'sell' soap or any other packaged good items\", argued James Ayers of Population Services International. The parallel is not precisely identical. Mainstream marketing focuses on clinching a sale. Social marketing, on the other hand, needs to spark a behaviour change too. That's harder than it first seems. \"It is not enough to just say to people that their health will improve\", argued Unicef's Clement Chauvet. The message has to be in some way \"transformational\" too. Take mobile phones. People suddenly went from having a fixed line or no line (as in the case of most of rural India) to instant communication anytime, anywhere.</p> <p>\"Triggers\" too: social marketing folk omit them at their peril. A classic example cited by the World Hygiene Programme's Mark Eddleston is the stickers that certain manufacturers put in soap packets. These can then be stuck beside sinks as \"cues\" for handwashing. \"Getting prompts as close to the point of use as possible is key\", he added. Myriam Sidibe, global mission director for Unilever soap brand Lifebuoy, agreed. It sounds obvious but critical to prompting handwashing is having soap and water \"visually present\" in the same place. Timing and context shouldn't be overlooked either, said McDonald. Think flu season or monsoon, for example. Unilever soap brand Lifebouy has developed an Early Warning System to identify periods when germs are most prevalent and to communicate \"there and then\" with consumers.</p> <h2>Directing the herd</h2> <p>Herd theory has preoccupied behavioural scientists for decades; and public health experts have proved attentive students. \"People are essentially 'pack animals'\". That observation by Ayers kicked off considerable debate. Looked at negatively, no-one likes to be different from the herd. 'Name and shame' strategies (think of the lists in train stations for those found travelling without a ticket) play to this logic.</p> <p>At a social and a psychological level, however, positively appealing to people's desire to be part of a herd is where the true power really lies. \"Affiliation (like disgust) is a powerful motivator\", noted Eddleston. In behavioural change terms, that means making the new behaviour attractive and normal. Educational entertainment - so-called \"edu-tainment\" \u2013 ticks the normalising box. Unicef India has first hand experience. It recently produced a soap opera series that drop-fed information about basic health. Of the estimated 140 million people that saw it, an impressive 96% knew about water-born diseases. The figure stood at 79% among non-viewers.</p> <p>As for attractiveness, celebrity power cannot be overlooked. Unilever, for instance, features national cricket hero Wasim Akram in the materials for its \"Little Doctor' school programme. \"He's in the ad, does the jingle [and] does appearances at the best schools [for handwashing]\", said McDonald. Alongside their undoubted Pied Piper power, stars need to take on a Bob-the-Builder role too. \"Rather than just talking about handwashing\", concluded Mehra, \"celebs [might] actually help build toilets.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>At 19 and with no Premier League experience Wilfried Zaha is still worth more than \u00a311m \u2013 except the Crystal Palace winger is going nowhere unless a \"special\" offer is received according to his manager, Dougie Freedman.</p> <p>Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal all eye Zaha while Sir Alex Ferguson has bitter experience of his abilities after tearing up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/30/manchester-united-crystal-palace-carling-cup\" title=\"\">Manchester United last November in Palace's 2-1 win </a>in a Carling Cup quarter-final.</p> <p>Zaha is from the same production line that produced Victor Moses, who was sold for only \u00a32.5m to Wigan Athletic two years ago, before Chelsea bought him this summer for \u00a39m. But Moses' move to Lancashire was a firesale with Palace in administration under their former owner, Simon Jordan.</p> <p>Zaha is protected by a five-year contract and Palace's current proprietors have denied he can be bought in the January transfer window. This echoes Freedman, who has known the player since he was 14. He says: \"The arrangement I've got with the club is that I will let Wilfried and his family know when I can't develop him any longer \u2014 and I will also let them know which club for him to go to.\"</p> <p>Zaha should start for the England Under-21s against Serbia on Tuesday evening as Stuart Pearce's side attempt to reach the 2013 European Championship, taking a 1-0 lead into the play-off's second leg. But the Ivorian-born Zaha first splashed across the back pages with that dazzling performance at Old Trafford last season.</p> <p>After terrorising Fabio da Silva with runs from a wide left berth that got the Brazilian booked after constant fouling, the right-back limped off with a hamstring problem. A fine evening closed with Zaha's skill winning the free-kick eight minutes into extra-time from which Glenn Murray scored the winner.</p> <p>Four goals in Palace's last two Championship games, the 2-1 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers and the 4-3 victory over Burnley, have firmed up interest from the coterie of elite clubs, though Freedman's stance was emphasised by Steve Browett.</p> <p>The co-chairman, writing on a club forum as CPFC2010, said: \"I can assure you that Wilfried is not 'for sale'. We hope that he'll be playing Premier League football next season. For us. Even if that doesn't happen, he's only 19 and still learning his trade in surroundings where he is comfortable and happy. He's on a five-year contract and we really don't need the money.\"</p> <p>The former Palace manager, Paul Hart, who handed Zaha a 10-minute debut in a 2-1 defeat to Cardiff City in March 2010, says: \"I was very fortunate because I brought Dougie Freedman in with me [as assistant] and Dougie was aware of the young players who were around. We were looking for somebody to sit on the bench. We decided to give him a chance and weren't disappointed.</p> <p>\"He's a lovely lad, very quiet and reserved, and got on with it: the minute he went on the pitch he wasn't fazed and he took to it like water. I don't think anyone's surprised at the way he's progressed the last couple of years.\"</p> <p>Hart, who is now Charlton Athletic's academy director, believes Zaha has the pace and strength required to thrive at the top. \"I do. I think he's got great attributes \u2013 he's still got a lot to learn, I imagine he would say that, but there's enough of a basis there to say he could do very well. In the short time from April, when I last saw him, to September [playing against the senior Charlton side] there was a definite difference. He's grown from a young man's body into a man's body. He was more muscular.\"</p> <p>Freedman, a Palace player from 2000-08 before returning under Hart, says: \"My relationship with Wilfried Zaha is a little different. We're talking about a kid I've known for four or five years and who has been in my squads for a long time, so it's going to have to be something special for us to even consider selling him.</p> <p>\"He's away now with the England under-21 squad and it's good for him to see a different environment, how different players work.\"</p> <p>In training for the <a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/videocentre\" title=\"http://www.thefa.com/videocentre\">Under-21s</a> before the Serbia game Zaha, who is the youngest of eight brothers and who has been at Palace since he was 12, beat two players then smashed the ball home to display a sharpness and style first honed in Abidjan's ASEC Mimosas academy, whose other former pupils include Didier Drogba and Yaya Tour\u00e9.</p>",
  "<p>These are the reasons why nine-year-old Rana does not like her new home. The bedroom she shares with her mother has no window. The room is too small to fit two beds, so they have to share, and there's only room to do her homework if she clears all her mother's housing documentation from the tiny square table, squeezed between the bed and the wall. During the night, she can hear the occupants of the bed and breakfast's other rooms stamping up and down the stairs, occasionally followed by the police, so she lies in bed wondering who they are and what is going on.</p> <p>Most worrying is the woman in the room next door who attacked her mother a few weeks ago, after a quarrel about leaving the doors open to go and use the kitchen. The assault was so violent (scratches, hair torn out and slaps to the face) that her mother had to spend the night in hospital, accompanied by Rana. The neighbour remains in the bed and breakfast, and Rana and her mother have responded by no longer using the communal kitchen. Instead they buy food from KFC and McDonald's.</p> <p>\"When we had our own flat, I loved that kind of food, I wanted to eat it every day. But now we eat it every day, I don't want to eat it any more,\" she says. She has taped a poster with a picture of ponies and foals, garlanded with flowers, above the table, but the room remains unhomely, a small space crammed with overflowing suitcases and belongings balanced on top of each other because there are no shelves to store things on.</p> <p>By contrast, her mother, Mina, feels lucky to be here, because \u2013 despite the broken furniture, the damp mattress in the kitchen, propped up by another tenant near the window to dry, and the terrifying neighbours \u2013 the place is at least close enough to her daughter's school to make the daily commute there possible.</p> <p>This year there has been a dramatic surge in the number of families being housed in B&amp;Bs, with figures from the <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\" title=\"National Housing Federation\">National Housing Federation</a> showing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/sep/17/homeless-families-bed-and-breakfast\" title=\"a 44% increase over the past year\">a 44% increase over the past year</a>. For families with children, the rise has been even sharper \u2013 an increase of 60%, according to the homelessness charity Shelter. Almost 4,000 families are now living in hostels, and the most dramatic rise is in central London.</p> <p>The image of families living for extended periods in B&amp;B hostels became familiar in the early 1990s, but for a decade their use has declined due to a concerted effort by politicians conscious that this method of housing people is not only extremely insecure and very damaging for children, but also very expensive for the councils paying the bills.</p> <p>There is no enthusiasm from councils for housing families in B&amp;Bs, with shared cooking and bathroom facilities, but because of a chronic shortage of cheap housing, particularly in London, there is little alternative. Guidance that B&amp;B accommodation is not suitable for&#xa0;families with children and should only be used in extremis, for no longer than six weeks, is widely breached, because councils have nowhere to move people on to.</p> <p>Shelter says these B&amp;B figures are the coal-mine canary, which point to simmering crisis in the low-income housing system. The rise in families being housed in B&amp;Bs runs parallel with the rise in homelessness, up by 26% in the past two years. It's almost unheard of for a family to be allowed to become homeless on the streets; B&amp;Bs are relied on to prevent that from happening. These figures show how many families are that close to the brink.</p> <p>\"When these numbers start to go up dramatically, it is a real sign that there are pent-up problems across the entire system,\" Toby Lloyd, from Shelter, says. \"The number of homeless families is going up very fast, as a result of a perfect storm of problems in the system. Bed and breakfasts are the last resort for housing homeless families.\"</p> <p>Rana and Mina (who, like most people interviewed for this piece, asked for their real names not to be printed in case any suggestion that they might be complaining rebounds on them in the council's housing office) are living in this bed and breakfast, as a direct result of changes to the housing benefit system.</p> <p>The precise thinking of Mina's previous landlord is not clear, but she was charging \u00a3500 a week for the two-bedroom flat in St John's Wood in north London, paid for by housing benefit, when a new housing benefit cap was introduced, which would have reduced the maximum payment available to Mina to \u00a3290. Rather than waiting for her tenant to fall into arrears, the landlord gave her notice to leave earlier this year.</p> <p>If these figures sound enormous, they need to be set in the context of the London property market to be understood. In the last decade, as investors globally have sought stability in the UK housing market, a property boom has rippled from the most expensive houses in Knightsbridge down to the cheapest flats in Newham, pushing up private rents. The coalition's introduction of a housing allowance cap was based on the theory that by capping the amount available to housing benefit recipients, landlords would drop their rents and renegotiate lower contracts with tenants. But because the rental market in the capital remains so buoyant, what appears to have happened instead is that families like Mina's have been evicted and made homeless.</p> <p><a href=\"http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rports2011-2012/rrep798.pdf\" title=\"Research shows\">Research shows</a> that around a third of all landlords renting to housing benefit tenants are thinking about ending their contracts, amid fears that their tenants will no longer be able to pay the rent, after the cap already introduced, and ahead of a second overall benefit cap, due to come into force in April 2013. Because fewer people are able to get mortgages to buy their own homes, the private rental market is booming, and landlords in central London know they will have no difficulty in renting elsewhere to less uncertain tenants.</p> <p>A refugee from Iran who has lived in London for many years, Mina used to work in a cafe but now has arthritis in both knees; she walks with difficulty and does not work. There was nowhere else she could afford to move to in the vicinity of her daughter's school, so she asked the council for advice. They&#xa0;told her she needed to be formally evicted by bailiffs, made homeless by the landlord, and only then would they be able step in to give her emergency help.</p> <p>Mina was out when the bailiffs came, so Rana and a family friend had to move everything out of the flat \u2013 another alarming experience for the then eight-year-old, who says the bailiffs looked like police officers and were very unfriendly. First they were housed in a hostel in east London, but it was impossibly far from the school, and a kind Westminster housing office took pity, Mina says, and rehoused them. Despite the six-week limit, they have been here for seven weeks already, and have been given no information about when they might be moved.</p> <p>\"The people are quite frightening here. There's shouting all night long,\" Rana says. When her daughter leaves the room, Mina says she thinks a lot of the other tenants have mental health problems, some are drug addicts and some have recently left jail. \"When she goes to bed, she says: 'Mum, I am not happy',\" Mina says.</p> <p>Mina understands that the government has to save money, but wonders if they need to target people like her, who have long-term roots in the area. \"I've had the same GP for 20 years, the same hospital. All my daughter's friends are here. Are we meant to change all these things?\" she asks. \"Suddenly they've changed all the rules. They are playing with people. They are messing around with people's lives. It's a lot of stress for a single mother.\"</p> <p>She has told her daughter not to tell her school friends that they are living in a room in a bed and breakfast, sharing a bathroom with 10 other families. \"No one in school knows. I told the teacher we had to move, but she doesn't know I'm living in this tiny room,\" Rana says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397779776\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350319396356/Bed-and-breakfast-grotty--008.jpg\" alt=\"Bed and breakfast grotty kitchen\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kitchen in a south London B&B. Photograph:  David Levene for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaigners in the housing sector are despondent at the rise in B&amp;B numbers. David Orr, chief executive of the NHF, says: \"What's so frustrating is that people in the sector have been working very hard indeed to get the numbers down to almost zero. There was an economic argument \u2013 that this was an inefficient use of public money \u2013 but governments of both colours understood that this was just an appalling way to bring up children.\"</p> <p>The \"inexorable rise in bed and breakfast numbers\" over the past eight quarters has been depressing to witness, he adds: \"It feels like years of work are going down the drain.\"</p> <p>He points to the change in housing benefits as a possible cause. Housing systems are fantastically complex, but if the system is working properly, families who become homeless should be quickly moved from \"emergency accommodation\" (B&amp;Bs) into \"temporary accommodation\" \u2013 usually private properties rented by the council to house the homeless \u2013 theoretically less expensive and more secure than hostels. Because the numbers of homeless are rising, there is less temporary accommodation available and with landlords increasingly nervous about housing tenants who claim benefits, reducing the available stock, and more people are being pushed into B&amp;Bs. \"There is some evidence that landlords who were [taking] housing benefit tenants, are no longer prepared to take people on housing benefit, perhaps because they realise the risk of them going into arrears,\" Orr says.</p> <p>In this context, B&amp;Bs tend not to be places that budget tourists having a mini-break in England would want to end up in, but are hostels whose business model is built on housing the homeless. \"They are often overcrowded, poorly managed and very poor quality. Often they are closed between 9am and 4pm, so residents are evicted during the day. We are talking about places that most tourists would not want to stay in,\" Orr says.</p> <p>It's not clear that the rising B&amp;B figures will attract tremendous public sympathy. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/sep/17/british-social-attitudes-historic-data\" title=\"The British Social Attitudes survey\">The British Social Attitudes survey</a> published last month confirmed what has been increasingly obvious over the past few years \u2013 that there is a marked decline in popular support for the size of the benefit bill, and little desire for the government to spend more on welfare. Traditionally during recessions there has been an empathetic surge of support for more spending on welfare, but now only 28% of people think this. Labour has begun to echo the Conservatives' talk of benefit caps.</p> <p>Housing is an emotive subject because most people are struggling to pay rent, or a mortgage, making life-altering decisions about where to live based on how much they can afford to spend \u2013 so making the case for the state to be subsidising large chunks of rent for other people to live in London does not instantly elicit sympathy. If you're in any doubt about this, just glance below to read the comments that inevitably follow pieces on this theme.</p> <p>But there has always been a subsidised housing system to help people on low incomes. The problem in London is that rents have grown so extortionate, out of kilter with the cost of living anywhere else in the country that the costs required to support people to stay in the areas where they have roots now seem unfathomable to anyone who has not had recent contact with the London housing market. Campaigners constantly have to make the point that this is not a reason for stopping offering support to people.</p> <p>This housing crisis affects people who are working, as well as those who are not. Helena Carroll, who works in accounts, spent two nights in a bed and breakfast in west London last month with her seven-year-old daughter, and was so horrified by the experience that she left and is sleeping now on friends' sofas, in rotation. This has led to tensions between friends because it's not easy to embrace two more people into a home without tempers becoming strained, but she finds it easier than returning to the bed and breakfast.</p> <p>She was evicted from her flat in Hammersmith in August, probably also the victim of the incoming benefit cap. She works 25 hours a week, earning around \u00a3800 a month, and paid part of her own rent, but is unable to afford to live in the part of London where she grew up, and where her daughter has always lived, without state support.</p> <p>The room at the B&amp;B was filthy. It had no window, just a small skylight, there was blood on the duvet sheet and the kitchen was encrusted with dirt, she says: \"I wouldn't put my daughter in a position of living in that kind of squalor.\" A couple in the next door room spent the night screaming at each other, and one of them was sick. Every noise was audible through the thin wall. \"I wouldn't have minded if my daughter had been a small baby, and she wasn't aware of what was going on, but she was awake, shaking in bed.\"</p> <p>The uncertainty has upset her daughter. \"She has been teased a bit. They were saying, you're homeless. She was very confused, and asking: 'What's homeless?' All she wants is her own bedroom.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Abdul has been living in a string of bed and breakfasts with his wife and 18-month-old son since June 11, when they were evicted from their home in Maida Vale, north London, where he has lived for 11 years since he arrived as a refugee from Syria.</p> <p>They are currently in a tiny room in Southall, sharing a bathroom with five other families, and the kitchen with 12. The family don't cook, because all their saucepans are in council storage (along with their winter clothes) and it costs \u00a345 every time they access it to get something out. \"I have only these shoes. I didn't know we would be here this long,\" he says. They too are surviving on takeaways \u2013 junk food and sandwiches.</p> <p>It is difficult for him to return to Maida Vale for his carer job, because he can't afford the \u00a310 round trip and the bus journey stretches over an hour and half. The family stay inside a lot, because they don't know the area; there is no garden, and they don't know where the nearest park is. There is barely one step between the end of the bed and the cupboard and four steps between the window and the door, so after 14 weeks, his son is becoming frustrated with the confined space.</p> <p>\"There is a big difference. Before he was very, very quiet. He is always shouting at us. He has energy he can't burn off,\" Abdul says, as his son sings E-I-E-I-O to a plastic truck.</p> <p>\"All my life has been damaged. Everything has changed in my life, everything is broken. Even me and my wife we fight too much,\" he says.</p> <p>Grace, a mental health nurse, has been living in a room with her 16-year-old son, in a white stucco-fronted hotel in west London for five months. In the lobby there is a rack of leaflets advertising musicals and tourist attractions in the West End, but there is no sign of any tourists. Most residents are also victims of the housing crisis.</p> <p>She became homeless when she and her son were thrown out of the flat they were sharing with friends. Her son is at school nearby, but as a newly-qualified nurse earning a salary of \u00a321,000, Grace, who moved from Nigeria over a decade ago, is unable to afford to rent in this part of central London, where she wants to be so that her son can stay in the school where he has begun his A-levels, and so she can easily travel to the hospital where she often works nights and early morning shifts.</p> <p>Despite the disruption of moving into the B&amp;B when he was sitting his GCSEs, her son did extremely well, getting all As and A stars, and has embarked on A-levels with a view to becoming an aerospace engineer. Moving to a part of London where she could think about affording to rent would, she says, both make the night shifts impossible and would unsettle her son's education.</p> <p>The hotel has strict rules controlling residents' behaviour. She is not allowed visitors, so we meet on the doorstep and rush through the rain to a cafe. She is not allowed to use the kitchen after 10pm, which means she can't do any cooking when she gets back late from work, so has taken to eating McDonald's on the bus on the way home. Breakfast, which she has to pay for, is between 8am and 9am, which doesn't often fit in with her shift pattern, so she has to miss it. She worries about her son, alone in the hotel when she is out at work. She doesn't want to be negative about her neighbours, but is conscious of drugs being smoked in the corridors. \"I&#xa0;thought B&amp;s were just for visitors and tourists. I didn't know homeless people went to stay in B&amp;Bs,\" she says.</p> <p>\"The school has told me I really need to support him in his studies. He says he needs a quiet environment to study. At the moment I'm not able to make him regular meals,\" she says. \"My job requires 100% concentration. That patient's life is in my hands. I need to get the drug calculations 100% correct. But I am thinking, is my son safe? I don't know when I'm moving. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm really disturbed and it is affecting my work. Being a nurse is a very demanding job; it is a stressful environment. You need to come back and have a peaceful sleep \u2013 I&#xa0;can't sleep. My son is not happy.\"</p> <p>Her son finds it hard to work in the small room, and she finds it uncomfortable having to ask him to step into the corridor every time she wants to dress or undress. She is also meant to be studying for post-qualification tests as the final part of her nurse's training, but has found it near impossible to set aside the time and space when her son is not working. She knows she should already have been moved out of the B&amp;B, if the council were to meet the six-week target, but she has little information about how long she might have to stay. She sees other families being housed more quickly, because they have a new baby or the mother is pregnant. \"I can't be pregnant at my age \u2013 I'm 48,\" she says.</p> <p>The problem with writing about real people caught up in the changes to the housing benefit system, or the benefit system overall, is that you have to lay them out for scrutiny, for people to observe their decisions and judge whether they think they are justifiable. Why doesn't Grace move out of central London and commute? Why does Mina expect the state to pay for her housing, and why isn't she working?</p> <p>But, whatever you feel about the policy, this is how people's lives are affected when the system nears crisis.</p> <p>It was not possible to talk to anyone responsible for housing in person, but the new housing minister, Mark Prisk, sent an emailed statement, which reads: \"There is no excuse for any family to be stuck in bed and breakfast accommodation, and we have offered support to those 20 councils who between them account for 80% of families in this situation for an unacceptably long time. We've increased the Discretionary Housing Pot to about \u00a3400m over the spending period to help families with the transition to the new, fairer, system of benefits.\"</p> <p>Romin Sutherland of the <a href=\"http://nextdoor.z2k.org/\" title=\"NextDoor project\">NextDoor project</a>, a charity helping people affected by housing benefit cuts believes the system of benefits will not be fairer and argues that capping the housing benefit \"is driving a huge rise in homelessness, which is itself costing the taxpayer many millions. And this doesn't account for the longer term costs of uprooting established communities and dumping them without support in unfamiliar areas that are unable to provide for their needs.</p> <p>\"Instead of capping housing benefit, perhaps the government should be focusing on providing low-cost housing that gives back to the taxpayer over generations, rather than squandering our money on exorbitant rents,\" he says.</p> <p>As she enters the sixth month at the hotel, Grace feels angry at the amount of money being wasted on subsidising her to live there. The weekly rent for the room she shares with her son is \u00a3388, of which she pays \u00a3137 and the council \u00a3251. She is spending around \u00a3125 a week on the expensive, but unavoidable, cost of storage for all her belongings.</p> <p>\"I love being a mental health nurse. I feel I should be given the support I need to help me do the job I love doing,\" she says. \"But I feel that my contribution is not recognised. Key workers used to be prioritised \u2013 nurses, teachers \u2013 but that's not the case now. I believe they are trying to push the underprivileged out from central London,\" she says.</p>",

  "<p>Banks helped push the market higher on hopes that a Spanish bailout could finally be implemented, reducing the cost of the country's borrowings, as well as optimism over Greece's tortuous budget talks with its international creditors. Better than expected results from Citigroup, the latest US bank to update the market, also helped sentiment.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> climbed 4.65p to 236.85 as Ian Gordon at Investec issued a buy note and edged up his price target from 250p to 255p in the wake of the US figures. He said:</p> <blockquote> We have previously argued that the US banks reporting season should act as a catalyst to increase consensus expectations ahead of Barclays' third quarter [update] on 31 October. We were previously around 6% ahead; now, given positive investment bank read-across from JP Morgan/Citigroup, we believe we need to raise our own forecasts too. We move to \u00a31.8bn adjusted profit before tax, leaving us around 10% ahead of consensus (\u00a31.6bn) until other forecasts move up. For Barcap, we are now looking for \u00a32.9bn revenues in the third quarter versus consensus of \u00a32.7bn. </blockquote> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> added 0.62p to 40.32p and <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> rose 34p to 1461.5p. But <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> fell 2.8p to 2681p following news late on Friday that Santander had pulled out of a deal to buy several hundred of the bank's branches.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> managed to hold on to its gains, finishing 12.29 points higher at 5805.61.</p> <p>But mining groups fell back as Goldman Sachs cut its price targets and ratings for a number of companies in the sector to reflect falling commodity prices. These included <strong>Kazakhmys</strong>, down 25.5p at 690p, <strong>Rio Tinto</strong>, 48.5p lower at 2973.5p, and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, 8.5p lower at 1926.5p. <strong>Anglo American</strong> dropped 36p to 1788.5p as Goldman issued a sell rating following the industrial unrest at its platinum mines in South Africa.</p> <p>Meanwhile Finland's <strong>Talvivaara Mining Company</strong> tumbled more than 7%, down 10.8p to 135.4p, after it cut its nickel production target for the second time this year. Numis said:</p> <blockquote> Third quarter production results are mixed but overall negative. The company continues to make progress in some areas and be challenged in others. However, persistent heavy rains continue to impact solution grades and Talvivaara now expects to miss downgraded guidance of 17,000 tonnes, as we forecast. Overall another disappointing update and we remain cautious. We maintain our 100p target price and sell recommendation. </blockquote> <p>Numis had expected production this year of 15,000. Until it cut its target to 17,000 in August the company had forecast output of 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes.</p> <p><strong>BT</strong> dipped 1.7p to 217p after analysts at Barclays moved from overweight to equal weight and cut their price target from 260p to 230p. The bank warned the poor economic environment was likely to have an effect on BT's corporate business, and its recent move into sports broadcasting as it won a package of Premier league matches would increase its cost base.</p> <p><strong>Kingfisher</strong> climbed 7.3p to 275.8p following a positive response to an analysts trip on Friday, while <strong>Kentz Corporation</strong> closed 15.7p higher at 424.7p as Oriel Securities repeated its buy recommendation on the engineering and construction group. On Friday UBS began coverage with a 500p target price, saying:</p> <blockquote> We believe Kentz offers attractive near-term earnings growth and is a low-risk play on increased capital spend, with the flexibility of the business model a buffer against the inherent cyclicality of the resources industry. Fears over mining capex and the performance of UK peers (both overdone, in our view) have left the shares at attractive levels. </blockquote> <p><strong>Rentokil Initial</strong> rose 1.7p to 86.9p following weekend reports that a disposal of its troubled City Link parcels business could on the horizon. Mike Allen of Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> We would view this as good news for investors, especially if exit costs could be minimised. However, we think this scenario is being factored into the share price and maintain a neutral stance on the shares for now ahead of its third quarter trading update on 9 November. <br> In addition, if an exit for City Link can be achieved, then the takeover/break up scenario would also have greater creditability given the strategic fit with the rest of its portfolio. </blockquote> <p>But software and service group <strong>SDL</strong> slid 72p to 568p despite saying trading was broadly in line with expectations, although it also noted a legal dispute with a former shareholder of Trados, which SDL bought in 2005. It said the case was likely to come to court in 2013 but believed it was \"completely without merit.\" Analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> Not for the first time a \"broadly in line\" [update] results in downgrades. We reduce our estimates once again, de-rate the shares and highlight that sentiment will remain 'iffy'. But nonetheless, this a good buying opportunity. <br> We reduce our 2012 earnings per share estimate from 38.2p to 35.2p (let's call it the 'warts and all' approach). We reduce our target price from 667p to 599p. Conscious that 'tech' company buying opportunities are often defined by the 'speed bump' moments, and that the mid\u2013term investment case has not been derailed, we move from hold to buy. </blockquote> <p>Julian Yates at Investec moved from buy to hold:</p> <blockquote> We continue to see SDL as an appealing investment proposition due to its position of strength in multiple growth markets. However to justify a premium rating we believe the company will need to deliver on its growth potential within the technology business as well as the services business. We believe this will likely come through during 2013 as operational execution improves and we will look to revisit our target price and recommendation on evidence of this delivery. For now we move to hold with a target price of 670p. </blockquote>",
  "<p>New Zealand must be in a state of shock at the news that <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/sport/2012/oct/15/martin-crowe-cancer-diagnosis\" title=\"\">Martin Crowe has been diagnosed with cancer</a>, only weeks after he turned 50. It is not only that he was one of the country's finest batsmen. Crowe has retained a high profile since he was forced to retire with knee problems in his mid-30s, whether through launching Cricket Max or marrying a former Miss Universe, and he remained sufficiently fit to have launched a <a href=\"http://www.nzwomansweekly.co.nz/celebrity/celeb-stories/martin-crowes-miraculous-comeback/\" title=\"http://www.nzwomansweekly.co.nz/celebrity/celeb-stories/martin-crowes-miraculous-comeback/\">brief comeback </a>less than a year ago.</p> <p>Crowe, a cousin of the actor Russell whose elder brother Jeff was a regular New Zealand team-mate and is now an international match referee, made four Test tours of England \u2013 mostly struggling as a 20-year-old in 1983, before playing a key role in the team who made history three years later as the first Kiwis to win a Test series in England. He scored a century in the drawn first Test at Lord's, a feat he was to repeat as a 31-year-old in 1994, when his knees were already causing trouble.</p> <p>\"Not that you would have known it,\" reflected Angus Fraser, who led the England attack in that match. \"I think that was the best technical innings I've ever had played against me. Obviously I've been on the wrong end of some memorable innings \u2013 Brian Lara's 375, [Mohammad] Azharruddin's 100 off 83 balls. But in terms of the way the innings was constructed, that was pretty much perfect. Every ball was played on its merits, by a player completely in control of his game.\"</p> <p>Later on that 1994 tour Crowe scored 70 out of 151 in the first innings, and 115 in the second, to secure a draw at Old Trafford. But that was the last of his 17 Test centuries, and little more than a year later he retired.</p> <p>He left especially vivid memories of his batting in Somerset. He first joined them as a 21-year-old for the 1984 season, having toured England the previous year and spent time in the Bradford League and on the MCC groundstaff at Lord's before that. He was so successful in that first year in Taunton that he was named one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year for 1985, with Larry Gomes, Geoff Humpage, Jack Simmons and Sidath Wettimuny.</p> <p>Yet as the essay that appeared in that year's <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154457.html\" title=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154457.html\">Wisden reflected</a>, it had not all been plain sailing. \"At the age of 21, Martin David Crowe, who was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on September 22, 1962, achieved in his first season of county cricket what most cricketers would have considered impossible.</p> <p>\"In terms of cricket, the esteem of colleagues and public respect, he managed to fill, with poise and dignity, the enormous gap left in Somerset's ranks by the absence of Vivian Richards, who was touring with the West Indians. In any context this was a remarkable achievement. Set against the background of a broken thumb and food poisoning, suffered on the New Zealand tour of Sri Lanka, the anxiety to do well in a strange environment, homesickness and a most depressing first month, it was astonishing.\"</p> <p>Crowe suffered five consecutive single-figure failures in the last week in May, and has since admitted to going home to cry. (He has also suggested that having Ian Botham as his first housemate did not help his diet). But he bounced back in June to score 719 runs at an average of 143.8, and ended with 2,600 runs in all competitions.</p> <p>He recalled an especially torrid clash with Andy Roberts, the ferocious West Indies fast bowler who was guesting with Leicestershire, as \"the gutsiest innings I played\" \u2013 although he went on to score a famous century against West Indies in Wellington as New Zealand held the then kings of world cricket at home.</p> <p>The Wisden essay also recounts Crowe's off-field contribution. \"Perceptively observing that some of the younger players needed more purpose and pride in their jobs, he formed the Young Nags Club (uncapped players only, wearing ties and jackets; capped players by invitation). It was a great success. They met regularly at the Nag's Head, a pub near Taunton, to discuss problems, have a meal, levy fines for misconduct on and off the field, and enjoy themselves in a purposeful way.\"</p> <p>He returned in trickier circumstances in 1987 following the departures of Botham, Richards and Joel Garner, but again contributed handsomely with the bat before his back seized up driving south from Old Trafford after a game against Lancashire the following summer. It turned out he had stress fractures of the spine \u2013 he was replaced at Somerset by a young Australian called Steve Waugh.</p> <p>But Crowe recovered from those back troubles, returned to Test cricket and ended with 5,444 runs at a <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/36622.html\" title=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/36622.html\">very healthy average</a> of 45.36 that he has stressed would and should have been more had he not been rushed into the team too soon, and played on a little too long on one leg. Now it is his more serious health concerns that have shocked New Zealand, and cricket.</p>",

However, 3,000 children under the age of five still die every day from diarrhoea alone, making it the second most common cause of child mortality worldwide.</p> <p>There is a simple way to cut the number of deaths further. \"Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective and low cost ways to prevent diseases like diarrhoea and pneumonia,\" said Myriam Sidibe, Lifebuoy Global Social Mission Director. \"We know from clinical research that handwashing with soap at key occasions can reduce the risk of diarrhoea by up to approximately 45%. That means that handwashing with soap could help over 600,000 children reach their fifth birthday every year.\"</p> <p>Through its Hygiene Education programmes in 2010-2011, Lifebuoy has changed the handwashing behaviour of 48 million people. This year, through the continuation of programmes and activities such as Global Handwashing Day, Unilever will reach many millions more as part of its sustainable living goals. These aim to help more than one billion people improve their hygiene habits and make a positive difference to their health and wellbeing by 2020.</p> <p><em>Copy on this page is provided by Unilever, supporter of the </em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-living\" title=\"\"><em>sustainable living hub</em></a></p>",
  "<p>To describe Britain's attitude to food security over the past couple of decades as cavalier is a serious understatement it. In the grand new globalised world you didn't have to grow apples because you could ship them from New Zealand or South Africa. You didn't have to worry about peas or beans , they came from Peru or Kenya. Chicken from Thailand; fish from wherever the latest ocean-hoovering operation was destroying future stocks \u2013 no cause for alarm there. All you needed was a fistful of pounds, and the food would be there to be bought.</p> <p>There had been the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution\" title=\"\">green revolution</a> from the late 1960s that had saved the world from starvation. If supplies ran short, we'd just have to crank up the technology again and all would be well. Food was cheap for Western consumers, and it was assumed that it would keep getting cheaper.</p> <p>In fact, we never actually were in any kind of global food utopia \u2013 even at the best point around 1995 there were nearly 800 million people going regularly hungry in the world, and obesity from inappropriate nutrition, closely linked to the rise of high-fructose corn syrup, trans fats and fizzy drinks, has just kept growing and spreading. And it's become increasingly obvious that agriculture based on petroleum inputs \u2013 for cultivation, spraying and harvest; for fertiliser; for global distribution \u2013 is going to have to change, fast.</p> <p>But mostly that's been regarded in the UK as an unfortunate global problem, something for the Department for International Development to worry about \u2013 and sometimes as almost a positive, as one of the driving factors of the Arab Spring.</p> <p>Yet last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer\" title=\"\"> with British wheat yields being reduced by 14.1% on the five-year average</a>, and the latest global food prices <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/161602/icode/\" title=\"\"> going up by 1.4% in September</a>, the issue has again pushed to centre stage, and close to home.</p> <p>Britain is slowly waking up to the fact that relying on the rest of the world for large amounts of foods we could easily grow ourselves might not be a great idea. Food prices <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/files/defra-stats-foodfarm-food-pocketbook-2012-121005.pdf\" title=\"\">rose 32% (12% in real terms) in the UK between 2007 and 2012</a> while increasing only 13% in France and Germany. The price of fruit has been particularly hard hit.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, with real incomes squeezed, consumption of this key nutritional item has fallen, at the greatest rate among lowest income households. They're already spending around 17% of their income on food With many also in fuel poverty, they're going to struggle to find the extra money that they'll need.</p> <p>Only 23% of our fruit and vegetables come from the UK - or 10% when you just count fruit \u2013 and those imports are only going to get more expensive. That's if they are available at all.</p> <p>It wasn't so long ago that every British city and town was surrounded by market gardens, orchards and dairies. And that's where we need to be \u2013 and can be - again.</p> <p>We need a stable, secure food supply, with a short distance from field to plate. We need to work to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, and cut reduce consumption of meat from livestock few on grain. And we need a decentralised distribution system that's not reliant on a few giant warehouses. That is, not built around a handful of giant, monopolistic supermarkets.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/nine-meals-anarchy\" title=\"\">New Economics Foundation concluded in 2008</a>, we're currently operating a system that's only nine meals from anarchy (PDF). We've got a just-in-time food delivery system, which I saw firsthand when my local Green party in Camden had a pop-up shop during the London election campaign. At least three times a day, an HGV would draw up outside the local supermarket, offloading food that went straight on to the shelves - then straight out the door.</p> <p>Ensuring its people can eat is one of the most basic responsibilities of government. It's time, in its approach to competition law, to planning law, to flood protection, to planning for the future, that our government started to take this fundamental responsibility seriously.</p> <p>If food prices rise sharply, as they're highly likely to do \u2013 fruit, vegetables, and the real basics like bread and butter \u2013 it's the poorest who'll suffer first and worst.</p> <p>But if food supplies become tight, and post-peak oil fuel costs soar, then the impact on Britain's food supply will be felt by everyone. And the government will have to wonder why, in 2012, it was not taking seriously the need to produce food in Britain, close to where it would be eaten.</p>",
  "<p>The third largest mobile operator in the US is falling into Japanese hands, in the latest multibillion deal in an increasingly concentrated industry. Japanese telecoms company Softbank will buy up to 70% of Sprint Nextel for $20bn, giving the US company more firepower to compete with its larger rivals.</p> <p>After days of heated speculation, Softbank said on Monday it would buy $8bn of shares directly from Sprint and an additional $12.1bn of shares in the market. It expects to complete the deal by mid-2013.</p> <p>For Sprint, the deal represents a much-needed injection of cash. The US mobile operator has a debt pile of $14.5bn and is struggling in a market dominated by bigger players. Sprint chief executive Dan Hesse, who will remain chief executive of Softbank's new US subsidiary, New Sprint, said: \"There couldn't be a better time for this infusion of cash.\" He said the funds could be used to grow the business \"both internally and externally.\"</p> <p>Macquarie analyst Kevin Smithen said: \"[It's] not a bad outcome for a company many investors told us was going bankrupt as late as March.\" Sprint's shares have risen 15% since it confirmed it was in advanced talks with Softbank last Thursday.</p> <p>The deal will also transform Softbank \u2013 with about 90m subscribers \u2013 into a global wireless player to rival Vodafone or T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom. The combined group would also benefit from the increased scale in buying handsets and telecoms equipment.</p> <p>But investors were unimpressed, sending Softbank's shares down 20% since the news broke. The biggest concern is the possible debt burden Softbank will be taking on. The Japanese company undertook a leveraged buyout of the Japanese arm of Vodafone in 2006, and still has more than $10bn of debt on its books.</p> <p>Critics add that it would also be entering a market where it has no experience.</p> <p>Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son said he understood that some people considered the move too risky, but said: \"For us to not challenge ourselves may be an even greater risk.\"</p> <p>Son built Softbank into Japan's third-largest mobile carrier by revenue in just a few years, partly by consolidating smaller players.</p> <p>The deal is the biggest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, and is part of a growing trend for business owners keen to expand beyond their saturated market. Japanese companies have been buying overseas assets at a record pace \u2013 spending more than $65bn so far this year, according to data provider Dealogic \u2013 fuelled by a strong yen and cheap borrowing costs.</p>",

  "<p>After the roar of the crowd and the blanket media coverage of a summer dominated by golden moments, the return to reality for Britain's track and field squad was illustrated in the stark lines of the UK Athletics release outlining their future in pounds and pence.</p> <p>A shift in emphasis by UK Sport, the agency that distributes \u00a3312m in lottery and exchequer cash to Olympic sport over the previous four-year cycle, meant that when UK Athletics' selection panel sat down to make crucial decisions around future funding they were now considering medal potential rather than the ability to be among the top eight in the world. So while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/15/paula-radcliffe-loses-national-lottery-funding\" title=\"\">Paula Radcliffe's absence from the list</a> \u2013 fully expected by an athlete struggling with injury and with more than enough money in the bank to fund her latest recovery attempt \u2013 was the most eye-catching, there were other well known names who were culled as eyes turn to Rio in four years' time.</p> <p>The veteran sprinters Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis were among them, as was the European 400m hurdles champion Rhys Williams. UKA's recently appointed performance director Neil Black said Williams, for example, provoked a \"good discussion\" among the selection panel but ultimately illustrated the ruthless formula applied. \"He didn't meet the conditions set for him for this year. Secondly, it wasn't perceived it was possible or likely he would achieve medal-winning performances,\" said Black.</p> <p>Several other familiar names have also seen their funding taken away, including Radcliffe's fellow marathon runner Mara Yamauchi, the former European 800m silver medallist Michael Rimmer, the Commonwealth 1500m bronze medallist Steph Twell, the former world 400m silver medallist Nicola Sanders and the 800m runner Marilyn Okoro.</p> <p>Black said that those on both lists \u2013 the podium funding that guarantees up to \u00a326,000 towards living expenses and brings other medical, nutritional and other support services with it and the podium potential group that guarantees a more modest sum for those targeting 2020 \u2013 now had to demonstrate \"true medal potential now and in the future\".</p> <p>But the rationale also throws up apparent anomalies. While on the one hand saying that medal potential in Rio is the key measure, Black also said that UKA could not discriminate on age grounds while trying to explain why Yamil\u00e9 Aldama, who will be 44 in 2016, remained on the programme. \"She is world indoor champion. The selection panel felt she had a good chance of being able to medal into 2013 and she finished in the top eight in London. We can't discriminate in terms of age.\"</p> <p>Black, who said he was pleased with the quality of applications for the head coach position recently vacated by Charles van Commenee, also addressed the presence on the list of an athlete who had caused the Dutchman no end of headaches. The new performance director said that he had met Phillips Idowu to draw a line under his lengthy stand-off with Van Commenee and the ill feeling that surrounded his injury-hit Olympic preparations.</p> <p>\"We will carry on talking going forward. We both feel really positive about the future. He is a clear medal contender for the future and by virtue of his silver medal at the world championships last year,\" said Black. \"We talked about the future and how we are going to work together. I'm very confident we'll learn from it.\"</p> <p>Black has identified sprinting in general, and the notorious relays in particular, as a key challenge. He is in the middle of a wide-ranging review that will draw on input from current and former athletes and coaches, as well as other sports.</p> <p>There are no female sprinters on the podium list and only one on the potential list. Ironically Jodie Williams, the 19-year-old considered a genuine medal hope for the future, refuses to take lottery funding as she continues to operate outside the system.</p> <p>\"We will have a women's sprint relay programme in the future. There will be some changes in the environment, the culture, the technical and tactical elements of it,\" said Black.</p> <p>Adam Gemili, the 19-year-old 100m runner who came from nowhere last season to reach the Olympic semi-final, is added to the list for the first time. And Robbie Grabarz, the high jumper who lost his funding before recovering to win a bronze medal at the Olympics, returns to full funding.</p> <p>\"It's brilliant to be able to give an example where someone who has come off the list has gone on to achieve. In some ways it does make it easier. But I'm a great realist. They are comfortable with the fact the direction is medals and the responsibility that comes with that,\" said Black.</p> <p>Beyond the individual funding decisions, the challenge for Black and UK Athletics will be to build on a summer that propelled track and field back into the hearts of the British public thanks to a handful of standout individual performances and invest the money of lottery players in improving the breadth and depth of the talent pool.</p>",
  "<p>Ashley Cole is set to return to the England team tomorrow for his 99th cap, and though his rashness in pressing the send button on his mobile has delayed his entry into the exclusive club of national team centurions, there is little doubt the 100th will arrive in one of the upcoming friendlies \u2013 against Sweden or Brazil.</p> <p>Once Cole gets to the 100 mark there are only five players ahead of him in terms of England appearances and at 31, in good form, he should soon be able to catch Billy Wright (105), Bobby Charlton (106) and Bobby Moore (108). While Leighton Baines is playing particularly well for Everton at the moment and has proved himself a reliable deputy for Cole at international level, there seems no immediate need for an overhaul at left-back, and as long as the Chelsea player's ankles stand up to the rigours of playing for club and country he is not too old to be considered a probable for the 2014 World Cup.</p> <p>Chelsea might be trying to break up the old boys' network at the club, but Roy Hodgson has been talking enthusiastically about welcoming back Frank Lampard, and the midfielder is three years older than Cole. Steven Gerrard should also win his 99th cap, and Hodgson's captain, a year older than Cole, is considered a certainty to still be involved when the World Cup in Brazil comes around, so on age grounds alone there are no reasons for calling time on Cole's international career. He did miss matches after leaving Arsenal for Chelsea through knee and ankle problems, and has to receive ice treatment immediately after each game to allow him to recover for the next, yet his form and recent appearance record suggest he is managing the situation.</p> <p>Should Cole play on for England until 2014 he will have David Beckham's outfield record of 115 caps in his sights, and he may even end up with a total approaching Peter Shilton's 125, as in fact could Gerrard. By any standards those would be phenomenal achievements \u2013 just joining the century club is a remarkable enough feat only achieved by iconic players \u2013 though whether the nation would feel like celebrating Cole's elevation to the list of England greats is a moot point.</p> <p>He has never been the most popular of players, in fact he has at times been the most unpopular of players and has heard the Wembley boos to prove it, and that was before his Twitter drollery went global when the FA's commission cast doubt on the reliability of his evidence in the John Terry case.</p> <p>You wouldn't catch Bobby Charlton or Billy Wright making remarks like that when they were still playing, or nearly swerving off the road at being offered a mere \u00a355,000 a week, or turning their back on a referee who was booking him, or any of the other indiscretions that have pockmarked Cole's career and personal life.</p> <p>Generally speaking we want our greatest footballers to be role models to the youngsters that will follow them, not to take pots shots at one with an airgun at the training ground. That's why few begrudged Beckham his century of caps, even if the final total was eked out with cameo appearances as substitute. As a model of how footballers should behave, Beckham was blameless. Cole is just the opposite, yet his century, when it arrives, will be a true one, fully earned and wholly deserved. Cole has not inflated his total by coming on for the last 10 minutes as substitute, nor has he ever been picked because his position as team captain demanded selection when his form did not. Fourteen of Beckham's caps were earned as a substitute. Every one of Cole's 98 has been as a starter.</p> <p>All of them have also been earned by virtue of being the best left-back in the country, and not even Baines would try to argue otherwise. The Cole club career is remarkable too. Winning the European Cup in Munich in May gave him a complete set of medals, as well as the satisfaction of tasting victory in the competition after twice finishing on the losing side in finals. Cole won league titles with Arsenal and Chelsea and his total of seven FA Cup wins is a record, and he also played an integral part in the \"Invincible\" Arsenal team that went through the 2003-04 season unbeaten.</p> <p>If Chelsea are unwilling to offer players over the age of 30 more than a one-year contract his time at Stamford Bridge may be coming to an end, though with both Manchester clubs, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain said to be interested there is no reason to suppose Cole's playing days or association with success are about to draw to a close. If he does leave Chelsea he seems certain to join another high-profile club and such a move would prolong his England career rather than shorten it, unless he reaches the point, as players in their 30s often do, where he has to cut the number of games he plays in order to be able to play at all.</p> <p>At the moment, ankles permitting, he is not at that point. Baines has through necessity played a patient waiting game. He might have a while longer to wait yet. Though Cole will never be regarded as a role model, as a footballer he has few peers.</p>",
  "<p>With so much bad news often reported on the sustainability front, it is important to celebrate good news when it comes along.</p> <p>So it should be welcomed that the CEO of Kingfisher, the world's third largest home improvement company, is pushing for the business community to recognise its responsibilities to society, rather than focusing on merely maximising profits.</p> <p>Ian Cheshire says he will engage with business, commentators, the media and investors in \"sharing the merits of responsible business\".</p> <p>\"There are great examples of how large companies are recognising their responsibilities but much more can be done by big business to restore the public's faith in our corporate sector,\" Cheshire says.</p> <p>At the official launch of the company's latest sustainability vision, <a href=\"http://www.kingfisher.com/netpositive/index.asp?pageid=1\" title=\"\">Net Positive</a>, tonight, Cheshire will outline the practical targets that the FTSE 100 company aims to meet. While the strategy was announced in February this year, it is the first time specific targets have been detailed.</p> <p>The strategy plans to make a net positive contribution across four key areas; energy, innovation, timber and communities. By 2020, it commits to using 100% responsibly sourced timber and paper in all its operations as well as saving 38 terawatt hours of energy for customers and reducing the energy intensity of its properties by nearly half. It also expects to have 4,000 community projects completed by its staff.</p> <p>Cheshire, one of the UK's leading proponents of the 'circular economy', has committed to ensuring that 1,000 of Kingfisher's products have closed loop credentials by 2020. However, this represents only a tiny fraction of its overall range.</p> <p>Evidence that big business has lost the trust of large swathes of the British public is shown in Kingfisher's YouGov poll, which surveyed over 2,180 adults in the UK on the impact companies have on society and the environment.</p> <p>The results show that just under a quarter of those questioned think large companies have a positive effect on their local community and environment, with only 2% strongly agreeing. A slightly higher percentage of 26% believe they have a negative impact.</p> <p>More than half of the people polled said they are sceptical about why companies spend time and money on such measures, believing their motivations are purely to make more money and only 5% believe that it's because they want to help the future of their local community and environment.</p> <p>The survey also shows that there is still very little pressure from consumers for companies to act. More than 40% of the respondents said they would not be more inclined to buy a company's services even if they spent their own money and time on helping their local community or the environment.<br> While it's true to say a similar percentage said they would be more inclined to favour a more responsible company, we know well enough that the number who really would commit to changing their shopping habits would be far lower. What is also worrying from the research results is that most people still associate a company's responsible behaviour with old-style CSR activities such as supporting local schools, rather than dealing with the impacts of climate change.</p> <p>Some 28% said working with schools and youth organisations is the most important activity companies should undertake, while only 16% highlighted helping the environment by offsetting or minimising carbon emissions.</p> <p>The company will also announce an investment in a forestry scheme in partnership with Bioregional and the Sylva Foundation to demonstrate how neglected woodlands can be revived to support stronger levels of biodiversity, reconnect with local communities and encourage jobs and skills in a sector with an ability to provide sustainable products and low carbon fuels.</p> <p>Cheshire said: \"The ground breaking forestry scheme is not just about planting trees, it's about delivering woodland management skills for the future and bringing UK woodland products to market.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>\"Imagine how much easier life can be if you just take what you want,\" speaks my guide, as he leads me out of the island's tribal temple and into another mission of frantic gunplay and machetes in the dark. Far Cry 3 might be a little heavy-handed with the storytelling at times, but the points that it presents are so valid that it barely matters.</p> <h2>Choose your own misadventure</h2> <p>FC3 is a trip \u2013 a power trip, a sightseeing trip, and a head trip. I'm sent out into territory controlled by Vaas, a deranged local warlord and told to kill, and I do. Each mission, contained within the vast open world, is essentially a puzzle as walking into the middle of a gunfight is a surefire way to get killed in short order.</p> <p>Accessing the situation and plotting the best route \u2013 whether that's quiet backstabbing, well-timed distractions, artfully controlled destruction or all three \u2013 is the method for success.</p> <p>I opt for stealth more often than not, as most players will. The combat system is solid and visceral, with ranged weapons acting as a loud counterpoint to the trademark melee takedowns \u2013 catch a guard by surprise, or sneak up on him, and he's as good as dead.</p> <p>I spend minutes sneaking through the undergrowth, hiding behind burnt-out cars and discarded shipping crates, before bursting out and taking the high ground. I stab a sniper in the guts, drag his body behind cover, grab his rifle and free a caged tiger by shooting the lock off its prison \u2013 in the chaos as it tears through its captors, I pick off survivors while they run to safety. I feel powerful, I feel clever, and I feel dangerous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397885217\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2012/10/5/1349437235617/Far-Cry-3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Far Cry 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Far Cry 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This isn't even a story mission \u2013 this is a group of guards defending a base that I came across in the wilderness. FC3 is a hell of a thing.</p> <p>The sudden gifting of power is the game's core theme, shining a harsh light on what first-person shooters have been giving us for years as a matter of course. The protagonist Jason is deliberately, almost painfully an everyman. The opening sequence sees his proficient ex-military brother Grant shot in the neck, Jason frantically trying to stop him bleeding to death by tapping A to apply pressure to the wound, then fleeing into the jungle after he fails to keep him alive. In any other game we'd be taking control of Grant with his wealth of combat experience. Instead, we get his brother.</p> <p>Quite why Jason is suddenly so good at killing people is often questioned, and the unspoken answer to that question is that he's the lead character in an action game. Before the player arrived and took control, he wasn't, and as he meets his friends after he's come under new management (as it were) they note the change, and they're a little disturbed. Jason isn't behaving normally at all. Jason is a violent protagonist because you've made him into one, and the game isn't shy about telling you that.</p> <h2>All grown up<br></h2> <p>I'm given four and a half hours to explore the game, and I brush against maybe a 10th of the enormous map \u2013 moving through it using trucks, cars, hang-gliders and boats but mainly progressing on foot, as driving a car down the large dirt roads that connect settlements attracts the attention of enemy patrols and leads to desperate roadside gunfights.</p> <p>There are echoes of Far Cry 2 here, with the random mobs of machine-gun armed goons who chase you down at every turn. But here Jason can take over the countryside on behalf of the Rakyat, a group of warrior-people who take him into their ranks. With the Rakyat in place, fast-travel points are established and territories fall under their control, making them safe to navigate through.</p> <p>Having spent a fair amount of time on the previous titles, it's clear to see that this is the game that its sequels were supposed to be. Far Cry 1 was a standard first-person shooter stretched out thin; Far Cry 2 was an open-world game with guns, and too many lines of sight for enemies to abuse. Something about the environment, and the movement of the character within it, feels correct.</p> <p>Some bits stick out, of course. Coloured rocks covered in sigils are deposited around the map and unlock access to Trials of Rakyat, kill-frenzy style closed missions with an online leaderboard and prizes available for performing above the odds. Hang-gliders sit unattended on the top of cliffs, ready to be taken and flown between islands. An on-rails grenade launcher section after an escape from a burning mansion feels like every other one you've done before in every other action game. The story, while tight and involving four hours in, hints at something massive and unwieldy just over the horizon.</p> <h2>Down the rabbit hole we go<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397885218\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2012/10/5/1349437166942/Far-Cry-3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Far Cry 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Far Cry 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It would be easy to explain away the jarring elements in this otherwise seamless experience with the central conceit \u2013 that it's just a game, after all, that none of it is real. That's one reading of the story, certainly, and it covers a multitude of sins. But the narrative of the game layers more and more on top of the player, deliberately piling too much weirdness on them until they stop asking questions and just go with it.</p> <p>Jason is going mad \u2013 thanks to stress, and tiredness, and loss, and shock, and the fact that he's frequently drugged into hallucinatory visions. As the line between what's \"real\" \u2013 within the game world, anyway \u2013 and what isn't becomes increasingly blurred, a new boundary emerges: how much of Jason is the player? How do we separate our actions as the character from the character's internal drives? How comfortable do we feel taking pleasure in such violent acts?</p> <p>You don't need to play it as a highfalutin exploration into the nature of control, obviously \u2013 as mentioned above, it's an incredible action game (I'm making a lot of assumptions here based on early play; if it keeps up the pace it's going to be very, very good). But FC3 asks some pretty interesting questions.</p> <h2>Proactive horticulture<br></h2> <p>In a scene that will draw comparison's with the game's spiritual cousin, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIoJnMT3yUI\" title=\"\">Spec Ops: The Line</a> (a PTSD-ridden anti-war shooter released earlier this year) Jason is given a flamethrower by a man who claims to be from the CIA but might just be a conspiracy nut with a lot of professional-looking equipment in his basement. He's told to go and burn down drug plantations to attract the attention of bigger, more important warlords to the island, so he does.</p> <p>As well as burning crops, the flamethrower burns people \u2013 groups of soldiers that might have posed a problem beforehand are now easy pickings, as Jason leaps out from cover and immolates whole squads of them. Combat, always a careful combination of recon and timing, becomes far too easy and there's a jolt of pleasure in that because it's been so difficult beforehand.</p> <p>And then Jason says \"Man, I fucking love this gun!\" to no one in particular, and you realise that Jason's enjoying this as much as you are and you're playing a game while Jason is burning men to death in a drug-field.</p> <p>It's not subtle, but it's there. That's what takes Far Cry 3 from being an excellent videogame into something much more powerful, a comment on a medium that's only now starting to find its feet in the wider world of entertainment. In 10 years, games as revolutionary as this will be old hat. Enjoy it while it lasts.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Far Cry 3 will be released for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 30 November</strong></p>",

The team remotely detached the capsule from the balloon, allowing it to fall back to Earth under its own parachute. It hit the ground 55 miles east of Baumgartner's own landing site. The balloon was deflated via a nylon \"destruct line\", with the lightweight balloon material \u2013 known as the envelope \u2013 falling back to Earth to be gathered and removed by truck. The capsule could, in theory, be used again, but the balloon envelope can only be used once.</p> <p><strong>Why did he not break up, or pass out, when he went supersonic?</strong></p> <p>The precise physiological exertions experienced by Baumgartner's body as he momentarily reached 833.9mph, or Mach 1.24, during his descent are still being studied by his team. One of the jump's key scientific goals was to learn, via a series of monitors on his body, more about what such an experience does to the human body. All we know is that he survived, which proves that pre-jump speculation that his body might explode or disintegrate due to the stresses were ill-founded.</p> <p>Baumgartner himself says that he felt very little as he broke the sound barrier because his insulated suit buffered him from external sounds and forces.</p> <p><strong>What was so special about the suit?</strong></p> <p>Baumgartner's suit and helmet were described by his team as \"his personal life-support system\". The suit was modelled on those worn by pilots of high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, but it had never been tried in a free-fall before Baumgartner started testing it. It had four layers consisting of both \"breathable\" Gore-Tex, and heat- and flame-resistant Nomex. The internal layer was a \"comfort liner\". Next was a \"gas membrane\" that helped to retain air pressure. A \"restraint layer\" then helped to maintain the suit's shape. Finally, the external layer was constructed of Nomex to protect against fire and temperature extremes. It was made by a US company called David Clark that has been making suits for astronauts and high-altitude aviators since 1941.</p> <p><strong>Did he have to fast before the jump? (via </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nessymon\" title=\"\"><strong>@nessymon</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <p>For at least a day before the jump, Baumgartner consumed a \"low-residue, low-fibre\" diet on the orders of his medical team. They wanted his food to pass quickly through his body without any build-up of gas. In a low-pressure environment, the gas might expand and cause him severe internal pain \u2013 a condition known as barotrauma. For the same reason, Baumgartner, much like a deep-sea diver, also \"pre-breathed\" oxygen for two hours before his ascent in the balloon to help reduce the amount of nitrogen in his blood. If his pressurised suit had failed at above 19.2km (the \"Armstrong limit\", where water boils at body-temperature), he would probably have experienced a usually fatal condition known as ebullism \u2013 or the \"boiling\" of the blood \u2013 whereby his body would start to swell painfully within seconds. Baumgartner had a straw inside his helmet to allow him to consume liquids (presumably not a can of Red Bull, his key sponsor).</p> <p><strong>How much sleep did he get before the jump? (via @nessymon)</strong></p> <p>Baumgartner's team built a schedule to ensure he was fully rested. This involved going to bed precisely 12 hours before the ascent for an eight-hour sleep. But due to the hectic schedule on jump day, he was awake several hours before dawn. Baumgartner has said that he likes to draw in a sketchbook as a way to clear his mind before a major jump.</p> <p><strong>What was the biggest danger that Baumgartner faced?</strong></p> <p>His team identified 16 key risks that had to all be overcome for the record attempt to succeed. They included ultraviolet radiation, wind shear, landing impact, extreme temperatures, hypoxia (oxygen starvation), decompression sickness, entering a flat spin during the descent, \"shock-shock interaction\" (an explosive effect when shock waves in the air collide when passing through the sound barrier) and fire aboard the capsule. But the team said two dangers hung over Baumgartner above all others \u2013 a \"breach\" in the suit or capsule, and the accidental deployment of a parachute.</p> <p><strong>How did they know where he would fall?</strong></p> <p>Given that he reached a height of 24 miles above the surface of the Earth, it seems remarkable that he was able to land with such accuracy back on the desert floor in New Mexico. His team later confirmed that his landing site was just 23 miles from where the balloon had taken off several hours earlier. Unlike an astronaut, Baumgartner remained within the Earth's atmosphere so never experienced the planet rotating underneath him as witnessed by anyone actually in orbit. His team waited for the perfect weather conditions when high-altitude winds that might have caused his balloon to drift were at a minimum. Once he exited his free-fall by deploying his parachute, Baumgartner was able to \"steer\" himself to a preferred landing spot. A beacon inside his suit meant his recovery helicopter was able to closely follow him.</p> <p><strong>What next for Baumgartner?</strong></p> <p>\"I'm retired from the daredevil business,\" he said afterwards. \"I want to find a nice decent job as a helicopter pilot. I'll fight fires and rescue people. No e-mails, no phone calls.\"</p> <p><strong>How long will it be before every Tom, Dick and Harry adventure-seeker is queuing up to do this? (via </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18853398\" title=\"\"><strong>bateleur</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <p>The non-reusable balloon used by Baumgartner cost $250,000, with the wider cost to the sponsor Red Bull of the whole record attempt estimated to have cost many millions of dollars. This will put off the vast majority of copycats, but the high-profile stunt is expected to provoke a surge in interest for parachuting.</p> <p><strong>Is he married?</strong></p> <p>A surprising amount of questions on social networking sites seemed to be about his marital status. Bad news, though: Nicole Oetl, his girlfriend, was waiting alongside his parents for news of his safe return.</p>",

  "<p>Mohamed Bashir Sheik has a new reason to hope. The 25-year-old Somali, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/04/entrepreneurs-kenya-dadaab-refugee-camps\" title=\"\">who came to live at the world's largest refugee camp</a> in Dadaab, Kenya, when he was just four, is planning to apply for a place at a university that is due to open next year near to the settlement.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ku.ac.ke/\" title=\"\">Kenyatta University</a> is setting up a campus in Dadaab, which is home to a sprawling complex of camps housing around 470,000 refugees, mainly Somalis who crossed the nearby border to escape the cycles of war and drought in their homeland.</p> <p>Courses in subjects including project management, marketing, finance, and peace and conflict studies will be on offer to refugees and locals in this remote town in north-east Kenya, 90km (55 miles) from the border with Somalia.</p> <p>The site was <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/507570199.html\" title=\"\">inaugurated last week</a>, and the first students are scheduled to enroll in January. Bashir Sheik, a father of three who works for a <a href=\"http://dadabcamps.com/\" title=\"\">website that provides news about the refugee camp</a>, hopes to be among them. \"I want to go to Kenyatta University and study mass communications. I'm going to register,\" he said by telephone from Dadaab.</p> <p>\"I'm a journalist and I've never attended a single training [session] or workshop. I wish to further my career,\" said Bashir Sheik, who is from Kismayo, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kenyan-soldiers-capture-kismayo-somalia\" title=\"\">Somali port city that African Union peacekeepers recently seized</a> from Islamist al-Shabaab militants.</p> <p>Dominik Bartsch, head of operations for the UN Refugee Agency, said the agency would try to forge partnerships with universities and donors to offer scholarships to refugees. \"There is no tertiary education in any refugee site worldwide,\" he said. \"A site was made available and now Kenyatta University has to proceed and put everything in place.\"</p> <p>Bartsch said the university has already allocated two-thirds of its places to refugees, with the rest earmarked for locals. \"The fact that this is straddling the two [communities] is good news,\" he said. Refugees will be able to use their professional qualifications not only to contribute to Kenyan society, but eventually to aid in rebuilding their own country on their return, he added.</p> <p>Josephine Gitome, director of Kenyatta University's Centre for Refugee Studies and Empowerment, said self-sponsored students and those backed by donors are due to start in January. The next batch of students admitted under the <a href=\"http://crs.yorku.ca/bher\" title=\"\">borderless higher education for refugees project</a> will join early next year and will have tuition fees waived.</p> <p>According to Bashir Sheik, some refugees currently try to pursue their studies through correspondence courses with Nairobi-based universities, and some vocational training is also available, but many refugees want \"education on their doorstep\". \"We had more than 5,000 school leavers last year and they don't have anywhere to go for further education,\" he said.</p> <p>The presence of so many Somali refugees in Kenya \u2013 in Dadaab and in Nairobi \u2013 has long been controversial, with Kenyan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/22/kenya-denies-plan-to-close-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">government officials repeatedly calling on international NGOs to repatriate Somalis</a> to safe areas in their homeland. These calls have increased in recent months as African Union peacekeepers, including Kenyan troops, have begun notching up victories against al-Shabaab, whose fighters impose a harsh form of sharia law in the areas of Somalia they control. The peacekeepers, known as Amisom, drove al-Shabaab out of the capital, Mogadishu, last year and have seized a string of towns in the south.</p> <p>Aid agencies have warned that it is too early to talk about sending refugees home, especially given the conflict. Many Somalis in Dadaab have spent all their lives there, raising their children in the camps. This month, <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=6329&amp;cat=press-release\" title=\"\">M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF, or Doctors without Borders) said</a>: \"While Somalia remains embroiled in armed conflict, calls for the repatriation of refugees are grossly premature. Security conditions on the ground do not allow for adequate protection or the secure delivery of humanitarian aid.\"</p> <p>MSF added that more should be done to help the refugees in Dadaab. \"We are seriously questioning the overall level of assistance provided to the refugees,\" said Bruno Jochum, MSF's general director. \"With security conditions worsening, basic services and the provision of aid have been significantly reduced so it is no surprise that refugees are again facing disease outbreaks.\"</p> <p>MSF said there had been cholera cases and an outbreak of hepatitis E in the three camps that make up Dadaab. It called for the immediate resumption of registering new arrivals, and warned that there was \"an alarming lack of shelter and sanitation infrastructure\", with the rainy season about to start.</p> <p>Dadaab was set up in 1991 to accommodate around 90,000 refugees. Yet during last year's famine in Somalia, around 160,000 people came to Dadaab as hundreds of thousands of Somalis fled into neighbouring countries.</p> <p>Rising numbers and a spate of bombings and kidnappings, which forced many relief agencies to reduce their activities, have strained basic services at the camp. In July, eight aid agencies said around 164,000 children \u2013 more than 70% of those in Dadaab \u2013 were not in school. Children who did go to school were attending classes of more than 100 pupils. \"Lack of education and employment opportunities increase the potential for disenfranchised youth to be recruited into militia and banditry,\" <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-07-12/emergency-funds-running-dry-dadaab-worlds-largest-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">the agencies said</a>.</p> <p>Mohamed Hassan Dirige plans to apply for a place at the new campus. Dirige, who teaches at Dadaab, said many school leavers end up teaching younger children in the camp because they lack opportunities for further study. \"The students really need it. They will get opportunities,\" said Dirige, who arrived in Dadaab aged five in 1991, the year that military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in Somalia.</p>",

Presumably aided by crates of their own product, it wasn't a bad day either for the countless sponsorship, media and production staff employed by Red Bull \u2013 the energy drinks brand that conceived, paid for and covered the stunt.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/sebastian-vettel-wins-korea-gp-f1\" title=\"\">A one-two in the Korean GP</a> for the Formula One team they own, followed by an event likely to go down in the syllabus at PR colleges in years to come was the reward for an event that was seven years in the planning. In coming up with innovative new ways to sell heavily caffeinated fizzy water, the brand is also seen as redefining the sports sponsorship market.</p> <p>Sponsorship experts said on Monday that the online frenzy around Baumgartner's leap served to highlight trends that had been emerging for some time, as sponsors moved away from traditional models and towards their own bespoke spectaculars.</p> <p>\"The biggest trend in the last 10 years, and the social internet side of things has merely accelerated it, is that creating your own content has absolutely moved to the top of the agenda. The hackneyed old tickets, hospitality and perimeter boarding model is being left behind,\" said Tim Crow, chief executive of the sponsorship agency Synergy.</p> <p>Major brands have been talking for years about becoming content producers rather than simply paying media and rights owners to advertise or slap their logos on shirts and hoardings. But none have taken it as seriously as Red Bull.</p> <p>Red Bull were an early pioneer, trading in their sponsorship of a Formula One team to buy their own in 2004, for example. A couple of years later they bought the Major League Soccer team that was renamed New York Red Bulls. But most of their investment has been in extreme sport and in building up long-term links with individual athletes \u2013 funding an army of base jumpers, free runners, snowboarders, cliff divers and BMX riders for whom they could create bespoke events and completely control the content around.</p> <p>To take but two examples, they have arranged for Robbie Madison to leap on to the Champs Elys\u00e9es on a motorbike and built a private halfpipe for snowboarder Shaun White and filmed the results. In May the BMX rider Kye Forte conceived an event bringing together 34 of the world's best riders to perform huge jumps against the London skyline in front of 10,000 fans at Alexandra Palace.</p> <p>Red Bull insists that its stunts start with conversations with their athletes \u2013 Baumgartner, who had already leaped from most of the world's tallest buildings, came up with the idea for his space jump seven years ago.</p> <p>Red Bull also conceives entirely new events such as its cliff-diving world series, a global series of stunt plane races through major cities and Crashed Ice, where former ice hockey stars race one another down the sides of mountains and through Alpine towns.</p> <p>Some have, er, flown while others have proved less successful. But Red Bull, through its own magazines and production arm, can also ensure that their events reach the desired audience regardless of whether they capture the imagination of the mainstream media.</p> <p>Red Bull's two Media Houses \u2013 a 100,000 square foot operation in Santa Monica and its HQ in Salzburg \u2013 was not conceived as a loss leader and in the long term is expected to become profitable in its own right. The Red Bull chief executive Dietrich Mateschitz told the US business magazine Fast Company that the concept of investing in events rather than merely sponsoring them was deeply ingrained in the company's culture.</p> <p>\"We have been doing this for 20 years \u2013 now it's called adventure sports, extreme sports, and outdoor sports. Most of the national Austrian champions in those days were personal friends of mine and we spent all our leisure time mountain biking, windsurfing, snowboarding etc,\" he said.</p> <p>\"From the first year onwards, we also started sampling our product with our Red Bull Minis, launched our advertising campaign with our cartoons, and created our first event Red Bull Flugtag.\"</p> <p>The model requires huge, long-term investment and a determination to blur the lines between the investments in sport and music and the company's core product. The key is total control \u2013 recently aided by shifting media models, and the fact they can now broadcast direct to the viewer via the internet.</p> <p>Sunday night's stunt was a perfect illustration of that trend. As the capsule ascended to the edge of space and the tension escalated, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/15/felix-baumgartner-skydive-social-networks\" title=\"\">so the audience watching on YouTube also grew and the chatter on social media got louder</a>.</p> <p>Because Red Bull controlled the production, and broadband speeds and technology have reached a point where watching from anywhere is a reality, by the time Baumgartner was ready to jump there were over 8 million people viewing online. Immediately after he landed safely, Red Bull solicited questions via Twitter and Facebook <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/video/2012/oct/15/felix-baumgartner-skydive-space-video\" title=\"\">to put to the former base jumper</a>.

  "<p>Few kids' films get to open major international festivals: they just don't wield the cineastic clout. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149787/frankenweenie\" title=\"\">Frankenweenie</a> was viewed by some as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/10/frankenweenie-review-london-film-festival-tim-burton\" title=\"\">one dose too many of Tim Burton's goth whimsy</a> with a copout ending. Maybe, though, the film's selection <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/23/tim-burton-frankenweenie-london-film-festival\" title=\"\">as London film festival's curtain-raiser</a> was helped along by one miracle ingredient.</p> <p>A clue as to what this might be lies in another unusual laurel accorded to this animation. The film's global rollout is being accompanied by an elaborate <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5T8AWsCSw\" title=\"\">exhibition</a>, celebrating the physical process that brought it into being. What could account for such attention to mere mechanics? Only one thing: <a href=\"http://www.stopmotionanimation.com/\" title=\"\">stop-motion</a>.</p> <p>Wondrously enough, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxSoPNWkXA0\" title=\"\">Victor and Sparky</a>'s electric adventure was enacted by puppets, repositioned and then photographed 24 times for each second of screen action. Single scenes took a week to put together. The process has hardly changed since <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/first-animated-film/\" title=\"\">The Humpty Dumpty Circus</a> brought a set of toy acrobats to cinematic life in 1897. The effort involved in this kind of film-making is clearly awe-inspiring, but does the outcome justify it?</p> <p>In the upper reaches of the film-loving community, stop-mo is certainly held in high regard. The last children's animation to open the LFF was another product of the practice. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131171/fantastic-mr-fox\" title=\"\">Fantastic Mr Fox</a> was created in the <a href=\"http://www.3mills.com/\" title=\"\">same London studio</a> as Frankenweenie. What with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/aardman\" title=\"\">Aardman</a> and such, the quirky old Brits have a bit of an investment in this exacting craft. Still, attachment to stop-mo extends far beyond Albion's shores.</p> <p>Indeed, this year the process has been enjoying a high-profile revival. Frankenweenie comes in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142794\" title=\"\">The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148980/paranorman\" title=\"\">ParaNorman</a>. Sadly, none of these three films broke the $15m box-office barrier at its American opening, and no stop-mo feature has ever breached the $20m mark. On the other hand, the computer-animated but pretty boring <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149648/hotel-transylvania\" title=\"\">Hotel Transylvania</a> <a href=\"http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hoteltransylvania.htm\" title=\"\">opened at </a>$42m, and looks set to become a substantial worldwide hit.</p> <p>Computer-reliant <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/100880/shrek.2\" title=\"\">Shrek 2</a> has taken $900m globally, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/140033/toy-story-3\" title=\"\">Toy Story 3</a> $1bn. However, the most successful stop-mo film of all time, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/83798/chicken.run\" title=\"\">Chicken Run</a>, has pulled in only $220m. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/128447/coraline\" title=\"\">Coraline</a>, the genre's darling of recent years, has garnered a mere $120m. The public seem less impressed by stop-mo's products than the cineastic upper crust. Not that this bothers some of the latter: they're convinced their preference is aesthetically superior.</p> <p>Burton waxes mystical on the craft to which he devoted his formative years. \"There's an energy with stop-motion that you can't even describe,\" he says. \"It's got to do with <a href=\"http://minadream.com/timburton/Animation.htm\" title=\"\">giving things life</a>.\" He explains: \"Basically it's artists doing it and painting sets and making things. There's something very gratifying about that.\" Clearly he enjoys the process, but this doesn't explain why the rest of us should admire its results.</p> <p>Some people believe stop-motion provides a unique path to the infant imagination. \"To the eyes of a child, <a href=\"http://tomradford.hubpages.com/hub/Tips-on-making-a-stop-motion-film\" title=\"\">it looks like toys coming alive</a>,\" says one fan. Says another: \"Stop-motion animators reimagine ordinary things and transform them, very much like <a href=\"http://blogs.walkerart.org/ecp/2011/02/25/why-we-love-stop-motion/\" title=\"\">the way kids do when they play</a>.\" Maybe, but the Toy Story franchise did a pretty good job of bringing toys to life without recourse to puppetry.</p> <p>Stop-mo, however, is considered wholesome, like eating your greens, and has therefore become a totem for the digital-disdaining classes. Conveniently for them, Frankenweenie also offers darkness, death, science, respect for schoolwork and no unseemly explosions. It's even in black and white; all that's missing is subtitles.</p> <p>The truth is that computerised animation can do anything that stop-mo can (including depicting puppets), but also a great deal more. Like stop-mo, CGI can do peculiar and small-scale; but it can also do vast vistas, amazingly complex interactions and wondrous details like the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=X&amp;tbo=1&amp;rlz=1G1TSEH_ENUK358&amp;biw=994&amp;bih=614&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=qYYP-bdKn8aP8M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.theartsdesk.com/film/brave&amp;docid=nGLenjt5Nb9NOM&amp;imgurl=http://www.theartsdesk.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/mast_image_landscape/mastimages/pixar_disney_brave___merida-1600x1200.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;h=600&amp;ei=BqR5UOn4Huy10QWmloHoCA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=99&amp;vpy=4&amp;dur=5973&amp;hovh=194&amp;hovw=259&amp;tx=185&amp;ty=49&amp;sig=106036587419997064398&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=145&amp;tbnw=176&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=13&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:135\" title=\"\">flowing, carrotty locks</a> of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a>'s Princess Merida. It achieves all this without drawing unwanted attention to its own methodology, as stop-mo always seems to.</p> <p>To bypass its possibilities for what have been called \"animated Barbie dolls\" seems a bit perverse, to say the least. Sometimes the stop-mo fanatics almost seem to admit this. The ParaNorman team actually cheated, <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/ParaNorman-Directors-Explain-Why-Marriage-Stop-Motion-CGI-Great-Thing-32534.html\" title=\"\">weaving elaborate CGI confections</a> around their clumpy models.</p> <p>So why does Hollywood still bother with stop-mo? The answer may come as surprise. In spite of the vast amount of work it requires, it's actually the cheaper route. Remember how we were all promised that computers would strip our lives of exertion and expense? Well, it didn't happen to the movies either. Programming complex effects requires its own armies of still more expensive workers.</p> <p>Frankenweenie may take a lot less at the box office than Hotel Transylvania. But it was made for a mere <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=frankenweenie.htm\" title=\"\">$39m</a>. Hotel Transylvania's budget was well over twice that. This is pretty much par for the course: stop-mo films tend to cost around half as much as their major CGI counterparts. Their upside may be smaller, but they pose less of a risk.</p> <p>So take that, stop-mo snobs. Yours is the low-rent option.</p>",

Brown writes that social media is potentially <a href=\"http://www.blackdogtribe.com/people-like-you/guest-blog-social-media-bad-your-mental-health-mark\">one of the most liberating and useful things</a> that has ever happened to people with mental health difficulties, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Prior to the internet, it had never really occurred to people that the great value of communications technology might be the ability to communicate with people you've never met before. I suppose it had happened in marginal ways, like the popularity of CB radio and phone ins on talk radio. In many ways, communications technology had been all about protecting us from communications with strangers and making sure that we only interacted with people we knew. Now we live in a world where it has never been so easy to get to know complete strangers and to build and make things alongside them.<br>... It always puzzles me that critics of social media seem to think that the opportunity to meet strangers online somehow detracts from the opportunity to meet people in real life. I meet people I've met online in real life all of the time. In fact some of the most rewarding relationships in my life have come from friendships with people that I've met online first.<br> For the first time ever, people with mental health difficulties are finding ways to connect with other people with mental health difficulties both across the country and across the world. On twitter I talk to people every day who are just getting on with life living with a mental health difficulty. None of us are celebrities. Most of us aren't journalists or broadcasters. We're just people sharing bits of our lives that we choose to share with people with whom we choose to share them.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Mehdi Hasan, who has caused a storm with a New Statesman piece in which he argued that it is possible to be <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/2012/10/being-pro-life-doesnt-make-me-any-less-lefty\">pro-life and a lefty</a>.

There'll be a day when society comes to the realisation that 50% of the population can bear children and structures itself favourably around people with dependents.

It also raised fresh questions about the state's ability to tackle militancy. Malala's life was saved by neurosurgeons in a Pakistani military hospital and she has since been in intensive care.</p> <p>Doctors have recommended she be transferred to a UK centre \"which has the capability to provide integrated care to children who have sustained severe injury\", a Pakistani military spokesman said. The flight left Rawalpindi on Monday morning. She is travelling with an army intensive care assistant on a specially equipped air ambulance leased from the UAE and will be treated in Birmingham at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, an NHS hospital with a specialist major trauma centre.</p> <p>The Pakistani government is bearing the costs of transportation and treatment. The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, said: \"Last week's barbaric attack on Malala Yousafzai and her schoolfriends shocked Pakistan and the world. Malala's bravery in standing up for the right of all young girls in Pakistan to an education is an example to us all.</p> <p>\"Malala will now receive specialist medical care in an NHS hospital. Our thoughts remain with Malala and he family at this difficult time.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office said the move followed an offer by the UK government to assist Malala in any way that it could.</p> <p>Malala was shot in the head and neck while she sat with classmates on a school bus as it prepared to drive students home after morning classes in Mingora, a city in the Swat valley, where the army mounted major operations in 2009 to crush a Taliban insurgency. She had become famous after <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7834402.stm\" title=\"\">writing a blog in 2009 for the BBC Urdu service</a> about life under the Taliban insurgency.</p> <p>The Taliban issued a statement claiming it was obligatory to kill anyone \"leading a campaign\" against Islamic law, and warned it would again attempt to kill her if she recovered from her injuries.</p> <p>Police have arrested at least three suspects in connection with the attack but the two gunmen who carried out the shooting remain at large.</p> <p>The biggest rally yet showing solidarity with Malala was held in the southern city of Karachi on Sunday but the response to her shooting has been relatively low key in Pakistan compared with that to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/21/pakistan-asia-muslim-us-protests\" title=\"\">last month's demonstrations against a film produced in the US that denigrated the prophet Muhammad</a>. Government officials have condemned the attack but refrained from publicly criticising the Taliban by name over the attack, in what critics say demonstrates a lack of resolve against extremism.</p> <p>The former UK prime minister Gordon Brown, who is UN special envoy for global education, launched an <a href=\"http://www.educationenvoy.org\" title=\"\">\"I am Malala\" petition</a> on Monday. \"Today, sadly, 32 million girls are not going to school, and it is time to fight harder for Malala's dream to come true,\" said Brown. He said he would hand the petition to Asif Ali Zardari, when he visited the Pakistani president next month, and that it would also be given to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon.</p>",
  "<p>A day trip to Stoke may not be everyone's idea of fun, but a group of analysts who visited <strong>Kingfisher</strong>'s Screwfix operations on Friday seem to have enjoyed themselves.</p> <p>At least that's the conclusion to be drawn from some positive notes on the visit, and a subsequent 2% rise in the retailer's shares. Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said the retailer had fixed its basic problems and was now able to focus on improving its service to customers, including its online system for Screwfix. She said:</p> <blockquote> We were impressed with what we saw, particularly the multi-channel developments at Screwfix and B&amp;Q's steps to becoming the UK's most \"helpful home improvement company\". There are macro-economic concerns for the group in France and Poland but we remain convinced that Kingfisher is well positioned to gain market share and grow profits, thus with the stock trading on 11 times our 2013 earnings per share estimate we remain buyers. </blockquote> <p>B&amp;Q's website is due to be relaunched in the third quarter of next year, and Gulliver said:</p> <blockquote> Although DIY is one retail sector that is relatively protected from the \"online threat\", the internet does bring price transparency and competition in some categories from the likes of Amazon and www.my-tool-shed.co.uk. Kingfisher is well positioned with competitive prices, a suite of own brands, including the new Titan and Site brands, and superior availability and service (at least, that is what they are aiming for). Ultimately though, B&amp;Q intends to reduce the size of its stores on a 5-10 year basis as opportunities arise during the renewal of its existing leases. <br> Our final key takeaway from the trip was that Kingfisher, as market leader, has gone about creating a consortium of global market leaders so that they can be ready for the implementation of the government's various \"Eco\" programs. We think the government is being highly ambitious in expecting 14m households (around 30% of the UK) to have made their homes energy efficient by 2020. Nevertheless, Kingfisher has only invested \u00a320m in this project and the idea of offering a complete package, with its own iQe range of products, is currently unrivalled in the market. </blockquote> <p>Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon also issued a buy note:</p> <blockquote> Kingfisher's investor day provided interesting insights into the growth outlook at B&amp;Q and Screwfix. The former is relatively mature and will benefit from group scale in common ranging and direct sourcing, while the latter still has significant organic growth opportunity and is leading the group's multichannel strategy. While there are some headwinds to overcome, we believe that Kingfisher's long term growth prospects mean that the current valuation of 11.8 times trough earnings is a good entry point. </blockquote> <p>On Screwfix, Dorgan said:</p> <blockquote> Screwfix currently has 240 stores in the UK and believes that it has scope for 420. It targets the small tradesman, where convenience is the prime shopping driver. We found Screwfix's multichannel offer to be particularly appealing \u2013 indeed it is being used as the platform for the group's multichannel strategy \u2013 as it offers multiple buying and fulfilment options. <br> Indeed, a trader can order online and collect in three minutes, which means that his cup of tea doesn't go cold as he waits in the car park.. We estimate that Screwfix will make more money this year than Homebase (\u00a340m versus \u00a314m). </blockquote> <p>Kingfisher's shares are currently 4.8p higher at 273.3p,</p>",
  "<p>The wild Bront\u00eb moors between Yorkshire and Lancashire, home of grouse, golden plover and sturdy sheep, are set to get a new type of visitor: lawyers and investigators from the European commission.</p> <p>For only the third time in its history, <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/news/308781-rspb-raises-concerns-over-natural-england-statement\" title=\"\">the RSPB has laid a formal complaint with the commission against the UK government</a>, claiming that its wildlife and habitat quango Natural England has failed to protect the bleak but hugely important landscape.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f0fQhrG5_ms?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f0fQhrG5_ms\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Investigators from the group, whose 1,075,000 membership is more than double that of all three main political parties, have tramped the 4,382 hectares (10,828 acres) of the <a href=\"https://www.duedil.com/company/04431454/walshaw-moor-estate-limited\" title=\"\">Walshaw Moor estate</a> for the past six months, recording activity to promote grouse-shooting. The moors where Charlotte Bront\u00eb was reminded of her dead sister Emily by \"by every knoll of heather, branch of fern, bilberry leaf and fluttering lark or linnet,\" have been criss-crossed by new or restored tracks, drainage ditches and JCB excavators to help grouse-shooting, images on Google Earth show.<br><br>\"It looks just like corduroy,\" says Tim Melling of the RSPB, pointing out neat patterns of all-terrain vehicle tracks above the infant Hebden Water beck [mountain stream], whose waters also play a part in the growing controversy over the moor. A new campaign group called <a href=\"http://www.energyroyd.org.uk/archives/tag/ban-the-burn\" title=\"\">Ban the Burn</a> has been founded in nearby Hebden Bridge, whose fortune was coincidentally made by corduroy mills, linking grouse moor heather treatment to this year's disastrous floods in the town.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GHfUVfEagJg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GHfUVfEagJg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"You can see why Hebden Bridge is worried,\" says Melling, scrambling over a ditch like a small pond which protects a renovated shooters' track, bright and buttery-coloured with crushed limestone amid the dark sandstone of the area. \"Drainage carries off the moors and the becks can rise very quickly with sort of weather we've been having.\" Direct flooding connection remains unproven but Hebden's centre went under when Hebden Water rose by nearly a metre in four hours <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-18768291\" title=\"\">in July</a>.<br><br>The burn, promoting the growth of new heather in great swaths , is a traditional and lawful grouse-shooting measure. But others prompted action against Walshaw's owner, Richard Bannister, soon after he bought the moor in 2002 from Lord Savile whose family had had it for 150 years. The retail millionaire, who founded <a href=\"http://www.boundarymill.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Boundary Mill</a> stores in nearby Colne, had to pay \u00a333,500 in fines and costs three years later and restore moorland damaged by tracks and spoil.</p> <p>Natural England kept up the pressure when work restarted, but to consternation in the wildlife and landscape world, a second and much bigger legal action <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/14/natural-england-peatland-bog-burning\" title=\"\">was dropped in March</a> and an associated public inquiry into a review of burning consents granted to Savile in 1994 also terminated. The RSPB says that the turnaround is at the heart of its European claim, with no clear or satisfactory explanation for such a complete change of view.</p> <p>Apart from flooding, the key trigger for possible European intervention is the moors' thick and shaggy coat of blanket bog, which looks increasingly mangy as drainage and burning take their toll. Its rich variety of vivid green sphagnum mosses is among the most heavily protected landscapes in the EU and increasingly significant as a natural carbon-capturer as well as acting as a flood-deterring sponge.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w6mKD-BvIaE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w6mKD-BvIaE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Standing by the currently well-behaved Hebden Water in the centre of Hebden Bridge, Dongria Kondh of Ban the Burn says: \"This isn't a remote controversy up on a hilltop where only a few people go. For the sake of all of us, we need to regenerate the blanket bog by stopping burning, blocking the grips (drainage ditches) and revegetating the sphagnum moss and cotton grass. We wholly support intervention by Europe.\"<br><br>Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, says: \"The decision to lodge this complaint has not been taken lightly but Natural England has dropped its prosecution without giving an adequate explanation or securing restoration of the damage. It has also entered into a new management agreement which we consider has fundamental flaws and is probably unlawful \u2013 and would do little if anything to realise the coalition government's ambition to restore biodiversity.\"</p> <p>Natural England defends the new agreement, <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/home_page_-_latest_news/walshawmoor2.aspx\" title=\"\">a 25-year framework which involves \u00a32.5m in public funding for the first decade</a>, as \"providing improved environmental protection for the oors and also allowing the estate to conduct its business activities\".</p> <p>The quango, which is coping with the loss of one-fifth of its budget over four years in the spending cuts, <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/Walshaw_Notice_and_Consent_tcm6-31089.pdf\" title=\"\">says that</a> crucially the plan ends a very wide range of freedoms given to Savile in 1994. \"For the first time, burning activities on the Walshaw Estate will be subject to specific controls. The agreement sets restrictions on the maintenance and creation of infrastructure and an active programme of peat rewetting has also been agreed, so that blanket bog restoration can take place. We are aware that the RSPB has launched a complaint at the European commission and await the outcome before determining what the implications are \u2013 if any.\"</p> <p>Bannister, 51, who has six keepers and uses the moor for shooting parties of friends and business contacts without the usual eye-watering fees, defends his management as in the long tradition of grouse-shooting. He calls the moor his \"passion\" which he wants \"future generations to enjoy and share\" \u2013 the land has open access except on specific areas during shooting. He is <a href=\"http://www.moorlandassociation.org/newsshow.asp?art=138\" title=\"\">also strongly supported by the Moorland Association</a>, the campaign group for moor owners, which sees Walshaw Moor as a test case for blanket bog on about a third of England's 303,500 hectares (750,000 acres) of grouse moor.</p> <p>The controversy also threatens to add to the troubles of the coalition, with campaigners wary of the Conservative wildlife minister, Richard Benyon, a major landowner <a href=\"http://markavery.info/tag/richard-benyon/\" title=\"\">whose hobbies include shooting alongside conservation</a>.

  "<p>There are over 68,000 social enterprises in the UK and in the last twelve months we at <a href=\"http://www.pilotlight.org.uk/\">Pilotlight</a> have seen a significant increase in interest from our partner charities about developing a social enterprise. Cuts to local authority funding for services and the general uncertainty about the funding environment seem to be driving this.</p> <p>It is certainly no coincidence that we are seeing more demand for information about social enterprise at a time when there are key changes to the commissioning process, social investment is taking off and charities providing public services are questioning what impact the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/3/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Public Services (Social Value) Act</a> will have when it comes into play in January.</p> <p>Today we are launching a guide in partnership with <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise UK</a> called <a href=\"http://www.pilotlight.org.uk/news/why-social-enterprise\">'Why social enterprise?'</a> because, although charities are increasingly looking to social enterprise as a solution to their funding problems, we think they need to ask tough questions about their organisation and gain a broader understanding of what social enterprise is before going ahead. Social enterprise may not be right for all charities but by considering all the issues they can be clear about whether adopting a social enterprise approach will give them a more sustainable future and increased social impact.</p> <p>A social enterprise is an organisation that trades for social purpose, meaning that any surplus is reinvested back into the business or the community. So what are the main things to consider before going down this road? Some may be surprised to learn that there is actually no legal definition of social enterprise and no particular legal structure charities must take. Indeed, many social enterprises remain registered charities but the idea of charity as a business, selling services or products to fund a social mission, is not yet part of mainstream thinking for charities.</p> <p>Many of the issues that charities struggle with are around the culture and ethos. Working for an organisation that leverages the skills of senior business leaders to help charities think strategically, I have no issue with the notion that charities need to be managed in a business-like fashion. However many staff and board members can find it a hard transition from being grant funded to selling services or products to generate income. But a social enterprise approach is essentially about finding another income stream to support the activities a charity undertakes as part of its mission. It doesn't mean you have to drop services that won't make money but it is important to know where the surplus will come from to pay for them.</p> <p>Different skills and a different mindset may also be needed to assess the true cost of providing a service and ensuring a profit is made, assuming that profit is needed to support your social mission. This could be positive \u2013 charities don't always stand up for the real value they are providing; this could be an opportunity to do so.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.pilotlight.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Pilotlight</a> we have encountered examples of charities setting up 'separate' social enterprises alongside their charitable organisation, leading to governance and management issues, and others where the ideas were right but the skills and thinking for the business aspect needed to be developed.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.worthunlimited.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Worth Unlimited</a>, a charity working with young people across the UK that are suffering from the effects of poverty and deprivation, came to Pilotlight it was clear they needed help thinking through how their social enterprise was going to develop. In 2010 they had set-up Worth Enterprises as a social enterprise arm of the charity because of an idea to open a bike repair business and a bakery to give young people both work experience and transferable skills. However, fairly quickly, chief executive Tim Evans, says they realised they needed help with the vision for the new enterprise: \"we knew we had a good idea but we were struggling to really think things through and see how our new social enterprise would fit within our organisation. We needed help to develop our ideas and make it work across all our local branches.\"</p> <p>Pilotlight brought together a team of senior business people to coach them and help them think through their social enterprise activity. Tim says part of the challenge was getting staff to buy into the new venture and think in a totally different way: \"We needed our youth workers to switch their mind set to running a business which was a big change for them. Pilotlight helped us with this and got us all thinking more as a business, enabling us to put the structures and processes in place to be successful locally.\"</p> <p>It is vitally important that any new service or product is thought through and planned for strategically before being launched. Social enterprise should not be seen as a silver bullet that will allow the sector to overcome its challenges, or an automatic step for an organisation that has lost its grant funding. Yet the evolving social enterprise sector offers exciting opportunities for charities to innovate and diversify their income, but knowledge, buy-in from stakeholders and planning are critical.</p> <p><em>Gillian Murray is the deputy chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.pilotlight.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Pilotlight</em></a><em>.

  "<p>A controversial American businessman dumped around 100 tonnes of iron sulphate into the Pacific Ocean as part of a geoengineering scheme off the west coast of Canada in July, a Guardian investigation can reveal.</p> <p>Lawyers, environmentalists and civil society groups are calling it a \"blatant violation\" of two international moratoria and the news is likely to spark outrage at <a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/cop11/\" title=\"\">a United Nations environmental summit</a> taking place in India this week.</p> <p>Satellite images appear to confirm the claim by Californian Russ George that the iron has spawned an artificial plankton bloom as large as 10,000 square kilometres. The intention is for the plankton to absorb carbon dioxide and then sink to the ocean bed \u2013 a geoengineering technique known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/18/iron-sea-carbon\" title=\"\">ocean fertilisation</a> that he hopes will net lucrative carbon credits.</p> <p>George is the former chief executive of Planktos Inc, whose previous failed efforts to conduct large-scale commercial dumps near the Galapagos and Canary Islands led to his vessels being barred from ports by the Spanish and Ecuadorean governments. The US Environmental Protection Agency warned him that flying a US flag for his Galapagos project would violate US laws, and his activities are credited in part to the passing of international moratoria at the United Nations limiting ocean fertilisation experiments</p> <p>Scientists are debating whether iron fertilisation can lock carbon into the deep ocean over the long term, and have raised concerns that it can irreparably harm ocean ecosystems, produce toxic tides and lifeless waters, and worsen ocean acidification and global warming.</p> <p>\"It is difficult if not impossible to detect and describe important effects that we know might occur months or years later,\" said <a href=\"http://oceanography.dal.ca/person/John_Cullen.html\" title=\"\">John Cullen</a> , an oceanographer at Dalhousie University. \"Some possible effects, such as deep-water oxygen depletion and alteration of distant food webs, should rule out ocean manipulation. History is full of examples of ecological manipulations that backfired.\"</p> <p>George says his team of unidentified scientists has been monitoring the results of the biggest ever geoengineering experiment with equipment loaned from US agencies like Nasa and the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration. He told the Guardian that it is the \"most substantial ocean restoration project in history,\" and has collected a \"greater density and depth of scientific data than ever before\".</p> <p>\"We've gathered data targeting all the possible fears that have been raised [about ocean fertilisation],\" George said. \"And the news is good news, all around, for the planet.\"</p> <p>The dump took place from a fishing boat in an eddy 200 nautical miles west of the islands of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Gwaii\" title=\"\">Haida Gwaii</a>, one of the world's most celebrated, diverse ecosystems, where George convinced the local council of an indigenous village to establish the <a href=\"http://www.hsrc1.com/\" title=\"\">Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation</a> to channel more than $1m of its own funds into the project.</p> <p>The president of the Haida nation, Guujaaw, said the village was told the dump would environmentally benefit the ocean, which is crucial to their livelihood and culture.</p> <p>\"The village people voted to support what they were told was a 'salmon enhancement project' and would not have agreed if they had been told of any potential negative effects or that it was in breach of an international convention,\" Guujaaw said.</p> <p>International legal experts say George's project has contravened the UN's convention on biological diversity (CBD) and London convention on the dumping of wastes at sea, which both prohibit for-profit ocean fertilisation activities.</p> <p>\"It appears to be a blatant violation of two international resolutions,\" said Kristina M Gjerde, a senior high seas adviser for the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \"Even the placement of iron particles into the ocean, whether for carbon sequestration or fish replenishment, should not take place, unless it is assessed and found to be legitimate scientific research without commercial motivation. This does not appear to even have had the guise of legitimate scientific research.\"</p> <p>George told the Guardian that the two moratoria are a \"mythology\" and do not apply to his project.</p> <p>The parties to the UN CBD are currently meeting in Hyderabad, India, where the governments of Bolivia, the Philippines and African nations as well as indigenous peoples organizations are calling for the current moratorium to be upgraded to a comprehensive test ban of geoengineering that includes enforcement mechanisms.</p> <p>\"If rogue geoengineer Russ George really has misled this indigenous community, and dumped iron into their waters, we hope to see swift legal response to his behavior and strong action taken to the heights of the Canadian and US governments,\" said Silvia Ribeiro of the international technology watchdog ETC Group, which first discovered the existence of the scheme. \"It is now more urgent than ever that governments unequivocally ban such open-air geoengineering experiments. They are a dangerous distraction providing governments and industry with an excuse to avoid reducing fossil fuel emissions.\"</p>",

The other two categories are sustainable economic opportunity and human development.</p> <p>Nigeria was singled out as the worst performer of the four, dropping into the bottom 10 countries in the overall rankings for the first time. The country was ranked 14th out of the 16 countries in west Africa and 43rd out of the 52 countries listed overall. Nigeria was 41st last year and 37th in 2006.</p> <p>Although South Africa, Egypt and Kenya are ranked fifth, 14th and 25th respectively, people's freedom to participate in political processes has declined in each country. Kenya and South Africa have also registered a decline in economic opportunities, while Egypt has shown a significant improvement in this area.</p> <p>\"Given the vast natural and human resources of these four regional powers, these governance results are a concern,\" said Abdoulie Janneh, a board member of the <a href=\"http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Mo Ibrahim Foundation</a>, which has published the index since 2007. \"Each of these countries plays a key role in the economic and political landscape of the continent. To continue to optimally play this role requires a sustained commitment to balanced and equitable governance.\"</p> <p>This year's index examines data from each of the four categories, which are broken down into 14 sub-categories, for each country between 2000 and 2011. It uses 88 indicators drawn from 23 independent data providers from Africa and internationally.</p> <p>Mauritius came top in the overall index, followed by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/oct/10/pedro-pires-african-leadership-prize\" title=\"\">Cape Verde</a>, Botswana and the Seychelles, continuing the same pattern as last year. Somalia was last, a position it has occupied since the index was first published. The country came last in each of the four category rankings. Somalia's overall score has declined since 2006. Tanzania moved into the top 10 for the first time this year, while Liberia, Sierra Leone and Angola registered significant improvements. Sudan and South Sudan were not included this year.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of the index launch, the Sudanese-born philanthropist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mo-ibrahim\" title=\"\">Mo Ibrahim</a> told the Guardian that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/15/mo-ibrahim-rwanda-african-governance-video\" title=\"\">economic success cannot be allowed to overshadow human rights and democratic processes in Africa</a> (video), a continent that has seen steady economic growth over the past 10 years, even during the \"dark days of the financial crisis\". \"What we need in Africa is balanced development. Economic success cannot be a replacement for human rights or participation, or democracy \u2026 it doesn't work,\" he said. \"It worries us a lot when we don't see the trickle-through factor, when gain goes to the top 1% or 2%, leaving the rest behind.\"</p> <p>North Africa is an obvious example of the consequences of ignoring people's needs and rights, he added. \"Literacy in Tunisia is almost 100%. It's amazing \u2013 no country in the region or even in Asia can match Tunisia in education. So we have wonderful human development achievement in education and health, etc. But hundreds of thousands of men and women who graduated from college cannot find work, and not only that but [they] look around and they see an oppressive, corrupt regime. Then you have a volatile mix.\"</p> <p>Rwanda, which has risen two places in the overall ranking, to 23rd this year, is also an example of unbalanced development. Although the country ranks 16th and 11th for human development and sustainable economic opportunities respectively, up from 13th and 17th in 2011, it is 31st for safety and rule of law, down one place from last year and continuing a downward trend since 2006, and 29th for human rights and participation, although this is a rise of one place since last year. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/27/eu-partially-freezes-aid-to-rwanda\" title=\"\">the EU partially froze aid to Rwanda</a> over its alleged support of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/03/drc-m23-rebels-rwanda\" title=\"\">M23 rebel fighters</a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/01/rwanda-drc-why-washington-lost-patience\" title=\"\">the US</a>, Germany and the Netherlands. The UK had earlier suspended budget support over concerns about the country's human rights record. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/06/britain-resumes-aid-to-rwanda\" title=\"\">Britain has since unblocked a portion of this money</a>.</p> <p>Ibrahim said the governments in Kigali and Kinshasa need to be encouraged by their donors and \"friends\" to sit down and talk to solve the crisis. \"I really think Rwanda is not just part of the problem but part of the solution, and what we hope is for the different parties to sit together \u2026 and have constructive discussions,\" he said.</p> <p>Overall, since 2000, governance in Africa has improved. Particular progress has been made in women's rights, said Ibrahim, although he acknowledged there was still a long way to go before gender equality is achieved. \"We're very pleased. This is an area [in which] we're moving forward, but we're coming from a very low base,\" he said. It's easy to introduce new legislation against domestic violence or give women rights over land and in divorce cases, but it's much more difficult to change attitudes and the culture of \"male supremacy\", he said. \"Education helps and the spread of information helps, and courageous, unflinching, uncompromising \u2026 political leadership is also required.\"</p> <p>For the third time, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation decided not to award any one <a href=\"http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/ibrahim-prize/\" title=\"\">the prize for African leadership</a> this year, as no one matched the judges' criteria.</p> <p>The prize recognises and celebrates excellence in African leadership, and provides winners with the opportunity to pursue their commitment to Africa once they have stepped down from office. It is awarded to a democratically elected former African head of state or government.</p> <p>The prize committee said: \"[We] reviewed a number of eligible candidates but none met the criteria needed to win this award. The award is about excellence in leadership. In the first six years the prize committee has selected three very worthy laureates who continue to be an inspiration and whose examples, we hope, will be emulated.\"</p>",
  "<p>Zune failed to take on the might of the iTunes music service, but now Microsoft is back for another bite at the cherry or, more accurately, the Apple. The software company has announced Xbox Music, an all-in-one digital music service that will make 30m tracks available to users via Xbox 360, as well as PCs, tablets and smartphones running Windows 8 or Windows RT.</p> <p>The new platform is split into three strands. A free streaming service will provide ad-supported access to the library, but this will be limited to a certain number of hours after six months. Alternatively, a premium, unlimited, ad-free streaming option is available for \u00a38.99 a month. Customers will also be able to purchase and download any track from the catalogue.</p> <p>Launching on Xbox 360 on Tuesday and other platforms later in the month, the cloud-based service will allow users to synchronise their music across multiple devices. A Smart DJ feature will provide users with recommendations, as well as personalised playlists and instant mixes, while the display shows artist information and discographies \u2013 all reminiscent of the successful Spotify digital music service. Microsoft says it will also be offering a cloud-storage option later in the year so customers can \"scan and match\" tracks they already own, opening them up for free use on the Xbox Music platform.</p> <p>Although Microsoft's Zune music service failed to challenge in the digital music sector, its media player axed in late 2011, the company may be in a stronger position this time. Xbox Music will be made the default music service on Windows 8 PCs when the OS launches on 26 October, giving the corporation a huge potential audience. It will also be an integral part of the redesigned Xbox 360 dashboard when it updates this autumn. Microsoft has noticed that console owners are increasingly using their machines for other forms of entertainment rather than just games. Last year, the company <a href=\"http://www.shacknews.com/article/70104/42-percent-of-us-xbox-live-users-watch-one-hour\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that more than 42% of Xbox owners watched more than an hour of video content a day on their machines.</p> <p>The key proposition with Xbox Music is its pervasive design. With free, subscription and purchase options, as well as artist-based playlist features, it is effectively taking on iTunes and Spotify simultaneously, while also challenging other emerging cloud-based music services such as Google Music and the Amazon Cloud Player. With social sharing features also set to arrive in early 2013, Microsoft is determined to leverage every feature of digital music consumption into the service.</p> <p>\"The launch of Xbox Music is a milestone in simplifying digital music on every type of device, and on a global scale,\" said Microsoft's president of interactive entertainment business, Don Mattrick. And if the future of entertainment consumption is all about seamless cross-platform functionality, it's certainly a step in the right direction. The weakness in the chain, however, is the Windows smartphone platform, still dwindling in a distant third place behind Apple and Android devices.

  "<p><strong>Wolfson Microelectronics</strong> suffered a downturn when Apple said while ago it would no longer use UK company's chips in the later generation iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>But could the fractured relationship be on the mend?</p> <p>According to reports Wolfson has an audio chip in the new adaptor Apple is releasing to connect its new generation products to older docks and devices.</p> <p>Apple's decision to change its connector for the iPhone 5 has proved controversial, annoying customers with the idea they could not hook up old devices to new without paying \u00a325 for the privilege. Third party adapters have appeared to cash in on the situation, but Apple's own Lightening product appears to have more going for it including - according to <a href=\"http://www.abiresearch.com/blogs/missing-adapter/\" title=\"\">a breakdown of the component</a> - the aforementioned Wolfson chip. Peel Hunt analyst Alex Jarvis moved her recommendation from hold to buy and said:</p> <blockquote> An ABI teardown of the Apple Lightning to 30-pin Adapter reveals a Wolfson audio chip (DAC). This is a small part and the volume expectations for the adapter are likely to be low, tens of millions per annum \u2013 noting that third-party adapters are also on the market. <br> However, it is a major positive for Wolfson that it is supplying Apple again. Apple remains a significant revenue opportunity for audio hubs and MEMS microphones in the future and any news that confirms an improving relationship with Apple is positive. It is important for Wolfson to demonstrate that its relationship with Apple is being rehabilitated. </blockquote> <p>Wolfson has responded to the speculation, saying it seeks to do business with all major global consumer electronic brands, but cited customer confidentiality to avoid discussing specific projects:</p> <blockquote> It is relevant to mention that any new customer relationship would normally start with relatively modest projects until confidence is built and the relationship develops. </blockquote> <p>It said it had secured deals with five new smartphone customers this year, and was comfortable with the current market expectations.</p> <p>But hopes of an Apple boost have lifted its shares 6.5p to 208p, up 3%.</p>",
  "<p>The company at the centre of Japan's worst nuclear crisis has acknowledged for the first time that it could have avoided the disaster that crippled the Fukushima Daiichi power plant last year.</p> <p>In a reversal of its insistence that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami\" title=\"\">nothing could have protected the plant against the earthquake and tsunami</a> that killed almost 20,000 people on 11 March, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it had known safety improvements were needed before the disaster, but had failed to implement them.</p> <p>\"When looking back on the accident, the problem was that preparations were not made in advance,\" Tepco's internal reform taskforce, led by the firm's president, Naomi Hirose, said in a statement on Monday.</p> <p>The company could have taken steps to prevent a catastrophic accident by adopting more extensive safety measures, the statement added.</p> <p>Tepco's about-turn came after an independent panel of experts challenged its claim that it could not have foreseen the up to 14m high waves that swept through the plant, knocking out its backup power supply and causing three of its six reactors to melt down.</p> <p>In a damning report released in July, a parliament-appointed panel criticised years of \"collusion\" between Tepco, industry regulators and politicians, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/05/fukushima-meltdown-manmade-disaster\" title=\"\">described the disaster as \"manmade\"</a>.</p> <p>The crisis forced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/japan-nuclear-disaster-fukushima-homes\" title=\"\">evacuation of 150,000 residents</a>, most of whom have yet to return home, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/japan-2040-nuclear-power-exit\" title=\"\">led Japan to announce it would end its reliance on nuclear energy</a>, although it has since dropped its deadline to phase out atomic power by 2040.</p> <p>In a rare moment of introspection, an internal taskforce set up to reform the embattled utility said the firm feared that improvements in safety would highlight the risks to nuclear power plants and encourage the anti-nuclear lobby.</p> <p>\"There was a worry that if the company were to implement a severe-accident response plan, it would spur anxiety throughout the country and in the communities near where nuclear plants are sited, and lend momentum to the anti-nuclear movement,\" the report said.</p> <p>The firm conceded that some suggested safety improvements, such as using multiple power sources and cooling systems, would have required the plant's temporary closure and added to its costs. Acknowledging that previous safety measures were insufficient could have invited lawsuits, it added.</p> <p>The statement said the company should have adhered more closely to international safety standards for atomic facilities, and trained specialist staff in practical disaster response rather than relying on safety drills it dismissed as a \"formality\".</p> <p>Tepco's admission that it was unprepared for the disaster came after the first meeting of an independent advisory committee set up to help the company reform its nuclear operations.</p> <p>\"It is very clear that mistakes were made,\" Dale Klein, the former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission and head of the reform committee, told reporters in Tokyo.</p> <p>\"It is very important for Tepco to recognise the need to reform, and the committee is very anxious to facilitate the reform necessary for Tepco to become a world-class company.</p> <p>\"The committee's goal is to ensure that Tepco develops practices and procedures so an accident like this will never happen again.\"</p> <p>Klein said individual workers at the plant would be expected to challenge the pervading culture of complacency over safety. \"The challenge that Tepco will have is establishing a culture so that every individual understands they are responsible for safety,\" he said.</p> <p>The report noted that Tepco had not made any safety improvements to the Fukushima Daiichi plant since 2002, and had dismissed the possibility of it being hit by a massive tsunami, even though it could not produce supporting data.</p> <p>It had, for example, insisted that Fukushima Daiichi's 5.7m seawall was high enough to withstand a tsunami generated by a large quake in the area, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/29/fukushima-daiichi-operator-tsunami-warning\" title=\"\">despite a warning in 2008 by its own engineers that much bigger waves were possible</a>.</p> <p>Tepco repeated claims it had done everything possible to prevent a disaster as recently as July. Instead, it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/fukushima-inquiry-naoto-kan\" title=\"\">accused the prime minister at the time of the accident, Naoto Kan, of exacerbating the problem by interfering in the firm's response</a>.</p> <p>Tepco has been forced to reform its management and operations after the government saved it from collapse in May, in effect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/09/fukushima-owner-saved-japanese-government\" title=\"\">nationalising it with a 1tn-yen bailout</a>.</p> <p>Despite Japan's plan to phase out nuclear power, Tepco's 10-year business plan includes the need to restart idled reactors, beginning with those at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in northern Japan.</p> <p>But the company denied its admission of culpability and efforts at reform were intended to mollify the public ahead of a quick return to nuclear power generation.</p> <p>\"The reforms are intended to improve our safety culture, and we have no intention to link it to the possibility of resuming the [Kashiwazaki-Kariwa] plant,\" Takafumi Anegawa, a Tepco official, told the Associated Press. \"We don't have any preconditions for our reforms.\"</p> <p>The firm's efforts to restart other reactors received a boost from Barbara Judge, the former chair of the UK atomic energy authority, who said nuclear plants could operate safely \u2013 even in quake-prone countries such as Japan \u2013 provided the right safety measures were in place.</p> <p>\"It's a question of determination of the risks. It's a question of making sure that there is a plan for how to deal with the risks, or the problem, should they eventuate,\" Judge said.</p>",
  "<p>Last week we learned that the council tax freeze is to be extended for another year, a tacit admission by government that the tax system does not work in its current form.</p> <p>The freeze was initially meant to last during 2011 and 2012, with government providing a grant worth a 2.5% rise in council tax to any local council that chose not to implement a raise. Now it has been extended for a third year and there is no reason to imagine it will not be extended further.</p> <p>The financial problem councils face is that inflation has run higher than 2.5% for most of 2010-12. Worse still, the grants are not cumulative, so the council tax base is eroded. In terms of democracy, it has led to a heavily centralised system of control complemented by the capping of council tax at around 3.5%.</p> <p>The system is a largely watered down version of the poll tax, combining the property element of the old rates system with the principle of more individual charging and payment. However, council tax valuations haven't been updated in England since 1993 (they were revised in Wales in 2002) and governments are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11401602\" title=\"\">reluctant to undertake revaluation</a> for fear of a substantial rise in tax which would have a significant impact at the polls. Ironically, this discrepancy was also a problem for the previous domestic rates system.</p> <p>The system also enables <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/mar/09/council-tax-in-it-together-anomalies\" title=\"\">the bizarre situation</a> where Westminster council charges the most valuable properties (Band H) \u00a31,375 in council tax, but Newark charges \u00a31,311 for a terraced house (Band B). Reforms to council tax benefit, which mean that authorities will be able to set the criteria for giving unemployed people money to cover their bill, are likely to exacerbate this problem.</p> <p>So is there an alternative? Both the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) support a local income tax, through which a percentage of centrally raised income taxes (usually between 3% and 4.5%) would be given directly to local councils. The 2007-2011 SNP government attempted to introduce such a scheme in Scotland, but <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish_government_ditches_controversial_local_income_tax_plans_1_828842\" title=\"\">parties were unable to come to an agreement</a> on how to implement it. Moreover, under the devolution settlement, the level of tax <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/06/scotland.counciltax\" title=\"\">would have been set by the Scottish government</a>.</p> <p>Local income taxes are already used in US cities such as <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/services/business_tax_nys_income.shtml\" title=\"\">New York</a> and Philadelphia. In New York, around a 3% tax on the income of residents is paid directly to the city. This solves the issue of tax levels, and therefore revenues, being set centrally. The problem with this model is that as cities, such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-us-canada-15782072\" title=\"\">Detroit</a>, fall into recession or decline tax revenues plummet and local government faces a financial crisis.</p> <p>A land value tax is used in the land-starved area of Hong Kong, as well as parts of Australia and the US. This levies tax against the value of land owned and in the UK is supported by the Green party, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Institute of Fiscal Studies and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Scottish Green Party has published <a href=\"scot.gr/w/LVTplans.pdf\" title=\"\">detailed plans to tax land</a> according to use and value, with empty urban vacant land hit for 10% of its value. This means certain types of land use, for example forestry, could be encouraged and land used more efficiently.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compassonline.org.uk%2Fuploads%2Fdocuments%2FCTP2TheCaseForLandValueTaxationIainMcLean.doc&amp;ei=I8d6T6i2B4bc8AP726i1CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGieoaQVgcR9Us-_9sZy-o6t00uiQ\" title=\"\">A report by left-leaning thinktank Compass</a> argued that land value taxes are well-suited to funding infrastructure as it raises property value.

  "<p>As markets move higher, <strong>BT</strong> is missing out on the buoyancy.</p> <p>The telecoms group is down 2% - a fall of 4.4p to 214.3p - after analysts at Barclays moved from overweight to equal weight and cut their price target from 260p to 230p. The bank warned the poor economic environment was likely to have an effect on BT's corporate business, and its recent move into sports broadcasting as it won a package of Premier league matches would increase its cost base. Barclays said:</p> <blockquote> BT investors have ridden a wave of buoyant fixed line market and cost cutting which has provided three years of material earnings growth and share price outperformance. <br> Some of these themes are set to continue into 2012 - cost cutting and line rental increases - but we believe a worsening macro environment will negatively impact the 50% of BT that is corporate, causing an increasing drag on growth and risk to the revenue outlook. </blockquote> <p>Overall investors were in cautiously optimistic mood at the start of the week, helped by suggestions Spain could finally bite the bullet and ask for a bailout which would reduce its borrowing costs.

  "<p>I remember looking for an internship in the careers guidance building of the University of East Anglia back in 2008. I was in my penultimate year at the university, studying environmental science and international development. I had no previous work experience, no idea about the value of my skills and no clue where to start looking for work.</p> <p>I decided to do an internship because I needed the chance to apply my skills in the workplace and sample working life for the first time. Looking back certain factors ensured the internship worked for me, so here are some of the insights I learned.</p> <p>Before you commit, it is really important to decide what you what to achieve from an internship so you choose the right one for you. I wanted an internship that would stand out on my CV and allow me to make new friends but would not interfere with my university studies. I chose the <a href=\"http://www.step.org.uk/\" title=\"\">STEP London Internship Programme</a> because they place candidates in paid internships for three months over the summer and organise events for their interns to meet each other and share experiences.</p> <p>I was placed with a construction company called <a href=\"http://www.lakehouse.uk.com/\" title=\"\">Lakehouse</a>, an industry I would never have considered looking into. The internship was really inspiring; my role involved taking control of a project. I had to carry out market research to identify new business opportunities within the company's business development team, gaining valuable experience and useful industry contacts.</p> <p>Many people highlight the disadvantages of internships where the interns aren't given challenging or interesting work. An internship should be a mutually beneficial arrangement, where you gain valuable experience and the employer uses your skills to benefit the company. When you are interviewed by a prospective employer, remember it is also your chance to iask them what they have to offer.</p> <p>I was looking for a career direction and to gain confidence in my abilities. My internship gave me the opportunity to try out an industry which I had not previously considered and broadened my horizons. It prepared me for the working environment, which some of my friends have struggled with having gone straight into work from university, enhanced my CV and helped me negotiate future jobs. When the recession was at its worst and I found myself unemployed, having those contacts helped me to find work again.</p> <p>Not everyone has a good experience of internships. However, if you know what you want to achieve from doing one, this will help you to challenge yourself and the employer to make sure you have a worthwhile experience.</p> <p><em>Kate Pierpoint is the director of </em><a href=\"http://www.locallabourhire.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Local Labour Hire CIC</em></a><em> and social enterprise manager of </em><a href=\"http://www.mhdt.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Manor House Development Trust</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The luxury goods market is set to slump this year, with growth more than halving as Chinese shoppers cut back.</p> <p>A report by the business consultancy Bain &amp; Company and the Italian luxury goods trade body Altagamma says Chinese big spenders, the luxury industry's main engine of growth, are showing signs of slowing down. It pointed to the change in government in China and a crackdown on corruption.</p> <p>Global luxury goods sales are expected to grow by just 5% this year to reach \u20ac212bn (\u00a3170bn), compared with 13% last year, at constant exchange rates. The European market is expected to grow by 5%, half last year's rate, with crisis-hit Italy and Spain seeing the biggest declines. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/11/burberry-sales-slowdown?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Burberry has said the super-rich are spending more than ever</a>, while \"aspirational\" middle-class shoppers are being squeezed.</p> <p>Chinese luxury goods sales are set to rise by 8% at constant currencies and 20% at current currencies to reach \u20ac15bn, while last year they climbed 30% on both measures, according to the Bain report.</p> <p>Even so, China has overtaken Japan as the world's largest market, behind the US, and accounts for one in four purchases of luxury goods. Chinese shoppers now make up half of the luxury purchases in all of Asia, and nearly a third of those in Europe.</p> <p>Claudia D'Arpizio, a Bain partner in Milan and lead author of the study, said: \"We are seeing sharp disparities between brands that are not keeping up with the quickening pace of change in the market and those that are adjusting to shifts in tastes and demographics.\"</p> <p>The study found that accessories had become all-important. For the first time, leather goods and shoes have become the largest slice of the market, at 27% of sales. Men are spending more. Younger people are more focused on uniqueness than heritage, 24/7 access rather than exclusivity, and prize entertainment over mere shopping.</p> <p>Leather goods sales are expected to post the fastest growth, of 16%, to \u20ac33bn this year, while watches will be just behind with 14% growth to \u20ac35bn. Shoes and jewellery are seen growing by 13%, to \u20ac12bn and \u20ac11bn respectively.</p>",
  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland shares slumped on Monday morning as analysts warned that the bailed out bank will have to accept a lower price for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/14/rbs-branch-santander-eu-virgin\" title=\"\">the 316 branches it had hoped to sell to Santander</a>.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"Assuming that an alternative sale is agreed, we now anticipate that RBS may ultimately settle for terms \u00a30.5-1.0bn worse than those agreed with Santander in August 2010\". RBS shares fell 3% in early trading although they later recovered to 269p, down around 1%.</p> <p>Santander had agreed to pay \u00a31.6bn for the branches that RBS must sell under conditions imposed by Brussels when it was bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds. Now 81% owned by the taxpayer, the bank said it will \"commence a new process of disposal\" after the sale to Santander fell through.</p> <p>Discussions will be needed with the EU and, speaking to reporters in Tokyo at the IMF meeting, bank officials indicated they might argue to keep the branches.</p> <p>\"The commission has been much more flexible. It used to be a pretty severe regime but they are making different judgments,\" RBS said.</p> <p>Virgin Money \u2013 which took over Northern Rock at the start of the year \u2013 and venture capitalist JC Flowers are among those expected to bid. NBNK \u2013 the bidding vehicle created to bid for a bank \u2013 is losing its chief executive, former Rock boss Gary Hoffman, who is leaving to join insurer Hastings. It had been planning to return cash to its shareholders after failing to bid for the Lloyds branches.</p> <p>RBS is stressing that 98% of the work required to separate the branches has been done despite the delay to the sell-off, which must be completed in the next 15 months under the current timetable.</p> <p>Lloyds is in talks to sell branches to Co-operative Bank but is helping with the financing. Gordon said it was difficult to criticise Santander for pulling out.</p> <p>\"The original terms agreed \u2013 a premium of \u00a3350m to book value \u2013 appeared generous at the time, and even more so in the light of loss-making Lloyds Banking Group's recent 'giveaway' of its mandated 632 branch disposal to the loss-making Co-op. Early speculation cites Virgin Money (and others) as potential alternate bidders, though unless the European commission's terms are materially relaxed, we believe that a loss on disposal of \u00a3500m or more now appears likely,\" said Gordon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/11/direct-line-shares-flotation-strong-start\" title=\"\">RBS last week floated 30% of its insurance arm Direct Line</a> \u2013 a sale also imposed on the bank by Brussels.

Photograph: Charles Fearn/Channel 4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Fearn/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sing for Your Life<br>8pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Can singing help cancer patients battle the disease? This experiment puts together a group of 35 people of all ages who've had treatment for cancer and gives them 12 weeks to rehearse for a performance at the Royal Albert Hall. The result is just lovely. Enthusiastic choir leader Cat Southall admits she has her work cut out with the quality of some of the singers at first, but by the time the Big C belt out Bon Jovi's It's My Life at the gig it really doesn't matter. Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Russell Watson are among their celebrity cheerleaders. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Wonderland: Walking with Dogs<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>If you wanted to make a film in the capital about the emotional bond between dogs and their owners, you'd do worse than pitch up at Hampstead Heath \u2013 the biggest green space in London. In this funny, tough and affecting documentary, Vanessa Engle barks personal questions at assorted dog-walkers, who open up their lives to us; from the recovering alcoholic with a dog called Zen \u2013 \"because he lives in the now\" \u2013 to the woman who says of her dog, \"Luna finds anything: bras, money, anything \u2026\" Pause. \"Goats' heads.\" <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Monroe<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>Possessing maverick tendencies is no bad thing in a neurosurgeon. In fact, it's practically part of the job description. However, a failure of nerve is an entirely different matter, and a glum and moody-looking Monroe is in the grip of doubts following an operation that went catastrophically wrong. Can he snap out of it? Elsewhere, there's post-coital tension between Shepherd and Witney, and newly promoted Springer acts like an idiot. For all its occasional silliness, a medical drama that's a delicate scalpel cut above Holby City or Casualty. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>World War Two: 1942 and Hitler's Soft Underbelly<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Why does so much of Britain's campaigning history in the second world war revolve around north Africa and the much-storied Desert Rats? Professor David Reynolds argues that Churchill's preoccupation with the region had much to do with preserving the arteries of empire, as well as avoiding the sort of direct conflict with the Germans suffered by the Russians that would have led to a politically unpopular bloodbath reminiscent of the Great War. Compelling stuff, marred only by Reynolds's bad imitations of Roosevelt in the narrative. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Sex, Death and the Meaning <br>of Life<br>10pm, More 4<br></h2> <p>Debut of a new series in which Richard Dawkins undertakes a sort of imaginary tour of his ideal world \u2013 one in which humanity has forsaken the worship of unanswerable gods who don't seem to like us much, and committed itself to building a world founded entirely on reason. Dawkins confronts the common \u2013 and altogether wrongheaded \u2013 belief that without religion there can be no morality, asking whether science can indeed provide a basis for an ethical life. The first instalment of his journey takes him from inner-city London to America's Bible belt. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Switch<br>10pm, ITV2<br></h2> <p>Four modern young witches share a house in Camden, north London in this new supernatural comedy-drama. Former EastEnder Lacey Turner stars and Caroline Quentin plays one of the witches' overprotective mums. They struggle to juggle their advertising/physiotherapy careers with being both magic and beautiful. Of course, the Camden witches have a feud going with some posh ones from west London. It's not at all sophisticated or layered in a Buffy way but decent fluff nevertheless. <em>JNR</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648183\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350037809883/The-Great-British-Bake-Of-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Great British Bake Off\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Perkins, Mary Berry, Paul Hollywood & Mel Giedroyc host The Great British Bake Off, BBC2. Photograph: Amanda Searle/Love Productions/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Searle/Love Productions/BBC/Amanda Sear</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Great British Bake Off<br>8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>A nation gripped by soggy bottoms and Mary Berry's wardrobe sits on the edge of its collective sofa for the big final. Baking Bieber-alike John, tank top-wearing James and divo of detail Brendan have made it this far, but they must pull off three complicated technical challenges on the last stretch. Their pastry skills are tested to the limit with a pithivier and the dreaded fondant fancies, followed by the creation of a masterpiece from chiffon sponge. Fridge and pray, people. Fridge. And. Pray. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Fresh Meat<br>10pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>Term two trundles on, with Heather increasingly attached to Kingsley, much to the chagrin of BFF Josie. JP is bedridden with mumps, with Vod the only person who can safely care for him. Howard becomes paranoid about household security after getting mugged for his shoes (or maybe just giving them away to three scary but silent hoodies), leading to new housemate/emotion-vacuum Sabine giving self-defence lessons to the girls. As ever, a huge amount packed into the hour, with not a single sub-plot left wanting. <em>MJ</em></p> <h2>Freddie Mercury: the Great Pretender \u2013 an Imagine Special<br>10.35pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>Queen frontman Freddie Mercury's audience-eating-out-of-his-hand Live Aid performance cemented his reputation as one of rock's great frontmen. But what was the singer like offstage? Surprisingly shy and prone to moments of cattiness, to judge by the interviews in this documentary. For all that the narrative leads up to Mercury's death from Aids \u2013 at a time when prejudice surrounded the condition \u2013 there are plenty of funny moments: recording with Michael Jackson, we learn, was tough on account of Jacko's llama. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Order and Disorder with Jim Al-Khalili<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>As part of BBC4's Big Science week, a film about the story of energy. Or, as they say in TV land: \"How we discovered the rules that govern the universe.\" Here, Professor Jim Al-Khalili does a great job, among other things, of explaining that it is a painfully long process from a scientist having a lightbulb moment to that idea having a genuine effect on the wider world. From Leibniz's idea of the world as a \"living machine\", through to steam power and what we now call \"thermodynamics\", the realisation that energy isn't created or destroyed but instead transferred is a satisfying discovery to watch. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Cuckoo<br>10pm, BBC3<br></h2> <p>Cuckoo extends his sphere of spiritual influence to Ken's father-in-law, after he deduces that a visiting cat is in fact the reincarnation of Ken's dead wife, Debra. Again, everyone bar Ken and Dylan is taken in by Cuckoo's bullshit, perhaps giving the first glimmer that there might not be much else to this likable new sitcom. Cuckoo (Andy Samberg) and Ken (Greg Davies) hog most of the best lines as usual, but the setups humiliating Ken and venerating Cuckoo appear to be treading much the same ground as previous weeks. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>White Collar<br>10pm, Alibi<br></h2> <p>The second season opener finds white-collar criminal Neal Caffrey back in and out of prison as he helps FBI handler Peter Burke solve more \"gentlemanly\" crimes. After the plane explosion that ended the first series, Caffrey is determined to find his girlfriend's killer, but there's a new superthief in town, the Architect, who sends everyone calling cards to tell them they're going to be robbed. It's a silly, far-fetched show, though not without a breezy charm provided by its central characters and enjoyably preposterous crimes. <em>PO'N</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350039384026/Who-Do-You-Think-You-Are--008.jpg\" alt=\"Who Do You Think You Are?

Photograph: Andrew Montgomery/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Montgomery/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Who Do You Think You Are?<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Poking around his family tree tonight is John Barnes, a distinguished footballer for Liverpool and England. The most famous image of Barnes's career, as the introduction reminds us, depicts him backheeling a banana thrown at him by some racist idiot. Barnes always retained preternatural calm in the face of such stupidity, an ability he ascribes to a solid middle-class upbringing: his father was an officer in the Jamaican army. Barnes returns to Jamaica, where his mother reintroduces a family of journalists, trade unionists and agitators \u2013 they sound a genuinely fun bunch. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Welcome to India<br>9pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>This excellent series has taken a positive spin on the challenges facing India's urban underclass. A salutation to resourcefulness and good humour, Welcome to India has uncovered the unlikely opportunities individuals have spotted amid the apparent chaos of their surroundings. This final episode finds more dreams for the future and sacrifices in the present. Prakash aspires to be a film star \u2013 but his family have a more immediate requirement of him. Sujit, meanwhile has devised a way to visit his newborn daughter, hundreds of miles away. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Dallas<br>9pm, Channel 5<br></h2> <p>Josh Henderson plays John Ross with such an artful swagger that it would be easy just to watch 40 minutes of his scheming \u2013 even better is that he doesn't have it all his own way, as his dodgy business partner Vicente is demanding results. Desperate to get the drilling rights to South Fork, he tries to enlist Lucy Ewing's support, while his entanglement with Marta leads to trouble. There are also repercussions for Bobby after his assault on Mitch, and wet blanket Christopher spends the episode trying to deal with Rebecca's bombshell. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Scam City<br>8pm, National Geographic<br></h2> <p>Conor Woodman braves the streets of Buenos Aires to see how travellers are being ripped off by enterprising locals. His knack for charming pickpockets, dodgy taxi drivers and a mistress of seduction means he gets a fascinating insight into the scammers' work. The police think he shouldn't try to find out too much about the people who run the underworld. \"They won't hesitate to shoot you,\" warns one officer, \"then cut you into pieces and put you inside a bin bag.\" Undeterred, Conor eventually tracks down the Artist, the man behind the city's counterfeit money, for an illuminating chat. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>The Final Frontier? A Horizon Guide to the Universe<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Horizon has always done a good job of presenting cosmological theories to the layperson without dumbing them down. So here, as part of BBC4's Big Science week, a special programme looks back at how our understanding of the universe has changed over the past 50 years. Dallas Campbell, a presenter on Bang Goes the Theory, trawls through the Horizon archive for footage that explains the mysteries of the cosmos, including Einstein's concept of space-time, what it's like on alien worlds and why you need extra dimensions to truly understand the universe. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Getting On<br>10pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Return of the dry medical comedy starring and written by Jo Brand, Vicki Pepperdine and Joanna Scanlan, and set in the geriatric ward of an NHS hospital. Kim, Den and Pippa move to ward K2 in St Jude's while their own hospital closes for a possible (but in no way guaranteed) refurb. Meanwhile, Pippa is causing her usual brand of chaos/inconvenience (inchaosvenience?) \u2013 dumping her baggage, figuratively and literally, all over her colleagues. Perfectly judged performances and great writing. <em>JNR</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350039618363/Hunted-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hunted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melissa George as Sam Hunter in Hunted, BBC1. Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Kudos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Kudos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hunted<br>9pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>This spy show is becoming more engrossing. Of course, like Spooks, there are scenes where chiselled operatives navigate knotty plots on futuristic laptops in glass buildings. Still, the mucky business of the job in hand (observing evil Jack Turner as he seeks to win a contract to build a dam in Pakistan) is agreeably gritty. This week Sam is thrown to see old lover/adversary Bernard at the bid meeting \u2013 but not so thrown she can't clobber his goons with a fire extinguisher. But what, pulling back for the bigger picture, is the \"Hourglass\" of the episode's title? <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Hebburn<br>10pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>Despite a few moments when the comic timing isn't quite there as the cast beds in, standup Jason Cook's new sitcom, a kind of Tyne and Wear Royle Family, looks like a winner. The setup is that Jack (Chris Ramsey), now living in glitzy Manchester, visits his working-class folk with a middle-class, Jewish bride, Sarah (Kimberley Nixon), in tow. Trouble is, nobody else knows they're hitched. You know you're in safe hands from the moment mum Pauline (Gina McKee), wanting Sarah to feel at home, makes \"bagels\" by taking an apple corer to some bread rolls. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>My Tattoo Addiction<br>10pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>Exploring the world of ink, this special looks at the walking canvases that are emblazoned with some of the 20m tats currently in existence in the UK. The stories behind these indelible brandings vary from the fascinating to the oddly banal. There's the Ayia Napa rep who has 14 of them, including the website of a booze cruise across his chest. Then there's the tattoo addict with a fondness for face ink and a 67-year-old keen to cover up the racist daubings he had etched in his youth. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Tails You Win: the Science of Chance<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Our lives, as Cambridge maths boffin Professor David Spiegelhalter argues, begin and end at the mercy of chance. Indeed, he notes, your chances as a 21st-century Briton of dying a violent, accidental death today are the same as tossing heads 20 times in a row \u2013 about one in a million. Understandably, much of human endeavour has amounted to an effort to quantify, regulate and eventually overcome chance. Spiegelhalter is an immensely engaging guide to this struggle, meeting seismologists, gamblers, statisticians and others who study the throw of the dice, metaphorical or literal. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Red Dwarf<br>9pm, Dave<br></h2> <p>Following a malfunction with an Ikea-style flatpack (\"I knew those white plastic bits were important!\"), the crew find themselves catapulted back to the year AD23 on Earth, where they must make a 4,000-mile trek to India to find the lemons they'll need to make a battery, and in so doing run into a bearded figure who may or may not be Christ on his travels. There remains a hapless amiability about these comedic timeservers, even if it does feel as if, laugh-wise, we are stranded in 1988. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Wilfred<br>10pm, BBC3<br></h2> <p>Wilfred blames the new scratches on his face on a run-in with a pack of dobermans, or \"dobies\" to use the racist dog term for them. It turns out, to Wilfred's embarrassment, that he was really the victim of a cat attack and he takes his revenge on all local kitties. While goofy plots like this provide the gags, they also help the characters grow in unexpected ways. It's hard to see how Ryan donning a gas mask and making a video threatening felines will eventually make him a better person, but somehow it does; one of the things that makes this show great. <em>PO'N</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350040377102/Stand-Up-to-Cancer-008.jpg\" alt=\"Stand Up to Cancer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stand Up to Cancer, Channel 4. Photograph: Channel 4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Stand Up to Cancer<br>7.30pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>The climax of a week of programming, in which Channel 4 has joined forces with Cancer Research UK for an indisputably noble cause, is a fundraising beano hosted by Alan Carr, Davina McCall and Dr Christian Jessen. Among the attractions are a special chat show hosted by Carr and a charity edition of The Million Pound Drop, interspersed with explanations of the research that the money raised will fund. Also appearing during the week are Kylie Minogue, Tom Daley and the Simpsons, among many others. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Queen of Tigers: Natural World Special<br>9pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>Colin Stafford-Johnson prefers to visit his old friends before they've gone, rather than attend their funerals; friends like Machli \u2013 now infirm and frail, but in her time, the most famous tiger in the world. A feisty fighter and devoted mother, Machli has provided the wildlife cameraman with 30 years of priceless memories: a ferocious Tigger to Stafford-Johnson's Christopher Robin. In this gorgeous-looking film, he returns to India to say his farewells to the Queen of Ranthambore National Park. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Me and Mrs Jones<br>9.30pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>Gemma, the titular Mrs Jones (Coupling's Sarah Alexander), edges further towards an intergenerational clinch with new lodger and her son's friend from travelling, Billy, the dreamy Robert Sheehan from Misfits. Of course, things couldn't go to plan \u2013 and a dustup ensues at a school play, doing little to temper Gemma's perpetual state of flustered embarrassment. The only effective way to distinguish whether Me And Mrs Jones is supposed to be a comedy or not would be to add a laugh track as a rough guide. There are few clues otherwise in this mirthless dreck. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Spy<br>8.30pm, Sky1<br></h2> <p>The second series of this sitcom has intimations of a soap; despite being set in the world of espionage, this takes a back seat to day-to-day romantic and family intrigues. A strong cast is headed by Darren Boyd as Tim, whose precocious son Marcus tonight makes his aggressive bid to become school president. Mark Heap is the hapless headmaster, Miles Jupp plays the appalling Owen and Robert Lindsay also features, looking like Jon Culshaw impersonating Alan Sugar. A running joke involving a hooded interrogee is the highlight of this week's silliness. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>The Choice<br>9pm, PBS America<br></h2> <p>In the blue corner: a president who not only inhaled but also thanked his pot dealer \"for all the good times\" in his senior year book. In the red: well, who? Who can pin down Mitt Romney, the man of whom one-time rival Ted Kennedy quipped, \"I am pro-choice, he's multiple choice\"? As America goes to the polls, here's a two-hour election special from PBS, featuring a run-through of both men's backgrounds, personal hangups and skill sets, plus the usual senate-load of talking heads. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>The Walking Dead<br>10pm, FX<br></h2> <p>The second series was hamstrung by losing showrunner Frank Darabont and beset by budget problems. Judging by this opening episode of season three, matters have improved dramatically, though not for the beleaguered bunch at the show's centre. Zombie herds have kept the group trapped in one area; they need to find somewhere secure to hole up. A nearby prison seems the best bet but it's crawling with the undead. Are criminal zombies worse than the law-abiding ones we've met so far? Hard to tell, but there's plenty of action as the group make their new home zombie-free and meet some intriguing new characters. <em>PO'N</em></p>",

  "<p>Ministers are going \"nowhere near far enough\" in seeking alternatives to the imminent cull of badgers, according the scientist who led the landmark 10-year culling trial that remains the scientific benchmark for the policy.</p> <p>According to Prof John Bourne, stricter measures to stop cows spreading tuberculoisis to other cows are the only way to combat the disease effectively, as they had in the 1960s when TB was virtually eradicated in England. \"Despite some improvements, the government is still going nowhere near far enough with biosecurity\", he said. \"It is not badgers that spread the disease throughout the country; it is cattle\".</p> <p>The most recent European commission inspection of England's biosecurity <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/05/badger-cull-tb-cattle\" title=\"\">uncovered a catalogue of failures</a> , including missed targets in the rapid removal of infected cattle with TB and \"weaknesses in disinfection at farm, vehicle, market and slaughterhouse levels\".</p> <p>Another eminent scientist and former government scientific adviser, Lord Robert May, pointed to vaccination as an important tool in tackling TB, which Welsh ministers have backed after abandoning their cull plans. \"What is particularly irritating is that we have the vaccines in the pipeline, but the commitment to really go in and test them is really not there,\" he said. The coalition cancelled five of the six trials of injectable badger vaccines on taking office.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \"Culling is only one part of the government's approach. We are also strengthening cattle controls to reduce the risk of disease spreading between cattle and increasing surveillance. Vaccination remains a long-term goal and we are investing \u00a315.5m in developing workable vaccines over the next four years.\"</p> <p>Bovine tuberculosis is rising in England and resulted in 26,000 cattle being slaughtered in 2011 and compensation payments of \u00a390m. Environment secretary Owen Paterson has insisted that culling badgers, which can carry TB, is a necessary measure and derided widespread opposition as \"sad sentimentality\".</p> <p>Bourne said: \"The real reason for the cull is that politicians are desperate and I think farmers have been hoodwinked for years.\"</p> <p>He said key differences between his team's methodology and the government's cull, including a very different killing method and much longer killing period, were significant: \"It could make TB a damn sight worse.\"</p> <p>Bourne was one of dozens of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">senior scientists who demanded the \"mindless\" government cull be halted</a> in a letter to the Observer on Sunday and accused ministers of misusing the science. Ministers claimed the science has moved on since the decade-long trial ended in 2007. But Lord John Krebs, the architect of the trial, rejected this: \"That is simply not true.\"</p> <p>Krebs said he was puzzled at the zeal of the National Farmers' Union for the cull: \"Their President Peter Kendall is going to have a lot of angry farmers on his hands in three-four years' time, saying we have spent a lot of money on the cull but we still have TB.\"</p> <p>Kendall said: \"No one, not the NFU, nor the farmers involved, wants to kill badgers. But TB must be stopped from making its relentless march across our countryside. Only by using all of the available tools in the box will we begin to get on top of this terrible disease.\"</p> <p>Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, said: \"This is not a science-based policy, it is just a shot in the dark. The government must abandon the cull.\"</p>",
  "<p>This year's<a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Management/article/1138900/Charity-Pulse-Mood-sector-hits-new- low-workforce-survey-finds/?HAY\" title=\"\"> Third Sector and Birdsong Charity Pulse survey</a> suggests that the third sector is experiencing the worst of times, with respondents indicating that staff morale has plummeted from 43% in 2011 to 29% this year.</p> <p>Given this difficult working environment and the need to deliver more with less, it is helpful to use common sense approaches for engaging people in organisational change and to recognise that people view change differently \u2013 while some see it as a positive opportunity, others fear the unknown.</p> <p>The following are pragmatic suggestions for those leading change. They don't necessarily cost money but they do cost time and self-discipline. But before you read them, remember that it is helpful to use courtesy and common sense; recognise that people react differently to the impact of change and that it's important to communicate clearly and consistently.</p> <h2>Common sense is hugely undervalued and not always that common</h2> <p>Organisational change programmes are often described using theoretical models and management jargon to narrate the process. Most people aren't interested in how clever a change management process is \u2013 they won't hear anything until they can understand what it means for their job or team? Try to keep the change message clear, simple and rooted in common sense.</p> <h2>Use your imagination \u2013 think about how the change process is going to be seen</h2> <p>If it is a difficult change message, try to deliver it in a way that recognises the impact on people first and make sure that you have support in place to take them through the process. How would you feel if you were receiving news that your job is going to change and it's going to have a ripple effect through your personal life? Think about how you would like to hear the message. Adapt your style to your audience but keep the core content of the message consistent.</p> <h2>Treat people with courtesy</h2> <p>Change causes stress \u2013 both for those leading it and those who are the recipients of it. Sometimes the self-discipline of courtesy can fall by the wayside due to haste, fear of delivering a difficult message or just sheer fatigue. Try to remember that small things matter. Some people are very task focused and feel that the niceties of social exchange prior to a meeting is unnecessary, whereas to others this prelude to a meeting is hugely important \u2013 try to gauge your audience and adapt to their needs.</p> <h2>People experience change differently</h2> <p>Some people will be angry \u2013 they will resist and mourn the loss of existing ways of doing things. Some people will be excited \u2013 they will perceive the change as a potentially beneficial opportunity. Irrespective of individuals' perspectives, either positive or negative, people will feel anxious. All of the above are normal responses to change and sometimes occur in a recurring pattern, so people may go through phases of organisational anger or elation. Be prepared to offer a range of support to meet these needs.</p> <h2>People prefer to have information about change in different ways</h2> <p>Some people like facts and figures, specific timelines and key milestones. Some people like the big picture and the story.</p> <p>Some people will like defined structure. Some people will like informal free forums for discussion. Provide information in a variety of formats and ensure that there is a managed way of people being able to ask questions about the information.</p> <h2>Everyone likes to be listened to</h2> <p>Create opportunities for people to express their views \u2013 this may be through team meetings, meetings where all staff are present and of course formal individual or collective consultation meetings if your organisation is restructuring its workforce.</p> <h2>Manage people's expectations \u2013 don't overpromise</h2> <p>In group or individual consultation ensure that people understand that their views will be listened to but not all views can be acted on. Be clear in how you are going to let people know the outcome of the consultation process and ensure that you provide information on what you are going to do and especially what you are not going to do and remember to be consistent in your rationale.</p> <h2>If you don't have anything to say \u2013 don't say nothing</h2> <p>Be visible and keep people informed. As you are going through the change process there will be meetings to decide next steps, for example, reviewing staff's feedback on the change process. This takes time and sometimes it's not possible to reach decisions in the expected time frame \u2013 this is not the time to say nothing as people will anticipate the worst. Say that you haven't yet reached a conclusion/decision but will keep people informed.</p> <h2>Give people time to experiment with the change process</h2> <p>People need time to 'try on' the change \u2013 allow a transition period where people can pilot the change process without fear of getting it wrong. This opportunity for experimentation will give them time to learn, test new ways of doing things and provide valuable organisational learning.</p> <h2>Celebrate the transition end and new start</h2> <p>Sometime is feels safer to let a change transition slip into being without recognising the cessation of the old way of doing things. Give careful consideration to whether the transition from old ways to new ways should be marked with a celebratory event to recognise the valued contribution that people have made to the previous process.</p> <p>And finally, using common sense, courtesy and good communication can support people to accept change and to view what may be perceived as the worst of times to being the best of times.</p> <p><em>Fiona Fisher is a director of <a href=\"http://www.odpartners.co.uk/\">OD Partners</a>, which provides organisational development solutions.
