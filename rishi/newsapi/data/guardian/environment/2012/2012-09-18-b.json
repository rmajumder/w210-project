  "<p>The mass slaughter of millions of farm animals across the world is expected to push food prices to their highest ever levels.</p> <p>As well as hitting consumers' pockets, the predicted 14% jump in food prices will also dash the Bank of England's hopes of pushing inflation down to 2% by next year.</p> <p>Farmers across the world have begun a mass slaughter of their pig and cattle herds because they cannot afford the cost of feed, which has soared following the worst US drought in living memory, according to a report published on Wednesday.</p> <p>Experts at investment bank Rabobank warn that the mass \"herd liquidation\" will contribute to a 14% jump in the price of the average basket of food by next summer.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/18/uk-inflation-falls-despite-fuel-costs\" title=\"\">Office of National Statistics (ONS) said lower food prices had helped bring inflation down to 2.5% in August</a>.</p> <p>That brings it closer to the Bank's 2% target and should help consumers who have seen their spending power shrink as wages fail to match inflation. The Bank expects inflation to ease below the 2% target by early next year, but that could be scuppered by rising food, oil and commodity prices.</p> <p>Rabobank said the slaughter of millions of pigs has already led to a 31% increase in the price of pork and the costs of other meats are also expected to soar as \"US livestock herds are likely to be liquidated at an accelerating pace in the first half of 2013\".</p> <p>Nicholas Higgins, a Rabobank commodities analyst and author of the report, said: \"There will be an initial glut in meat availability as people slaughter their animals to reduce their feed bills. But by next year herds will be so reduced that there won't be enough animals to meet expected demand and prices will soar.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/24/anchovy-price-leap-food-industry-chain\" title=\"\">US farmers, who are suffering from the worst drought since the 1930s, have already reduced their cattle herd to the smallest since 1973</a>.</p> <p>While all meat lovers will be affected by the record-breaking price rises, Higgins said bacon butty fans may suffer the biggest increases because it is easier for farmers to slash and rebuild pig herds that cattle.</p> <p>\"Farmers cut back pigs because they can rebuild them the quickest. Replacement cattle take a lot longer to breed \u2013 a year and a half compared to six months for pigs,\" he said.</p> <p>The report said the mass slaughter of pigs had led to a steep decline in the price of pork for delivery next month, but a 31% increase for pork delivered in July 2013.</p> <p>Because meat and dairy products already account for 52% of the cost of the average global basket of food Rabobank predicts the overall price of the basket will soar to a record 243 on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) index next summer.</p> <p>If Higgins' prediction is correct it will be the highest the index has ever reached and 175% higher than it was in 2000.</p> <p>Higgins said he did not expect a repeat of the 2007-8 food riots in developing countries across the world because most meat is consumed in the west.</p> <p>\"People are less likely to be irate over meat prices when they can switch back to staples \u2013 an option not available in 07/08 due to severe shortages of wheat and rice,\" he said. \"The risk [of riots and social unrest] is still there but it is not as high as 07-08. The prices will hurt here [in the west] more.\"</p> <p>But he said western consumers are unlikely to significantly change their diets or become vegetarian in response to price rises.</p> <p>Higgins said the major danger to global stability was the threat of countries stockpiling supplies. \"We've already seen the first indications of that, with Indonesia hinting it is going to increase corn stock pile levels, South Korea considering a domestic purchasing regime and very strong wheat purchases in Iran disproportionately higher than in its past history.\"</p> <p>While the food price spike is likely to lead to an increase in starvation and malnutrition across the world, global food traders are expecting bumper profits. The multimillionaire head of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business\" title=\"\">Glencore has said the US drought will be \"good\" for the commodities trader because it will lead to opportunities to exploit soaring prices.</a></p>",
  "<p>New car sales in Europe during August were at their lowest monthly level in more than 22 years, according to the latest research.</p> <p>US carmaker Ford was hardest hit, with sales plunging 29% compared with a year ago, as consumers in Italy, Greece and France shunned new cars, recording double digit falls.</p> <p>In the first eight months of the year, the UK was the only major car market to see an increase in sales compared with those in 2011. Analysts are warning that sales will continue to fall as economic uncertainty remains.</p> <p>Just 688,168 new cars were registered last month across the EU, down 8.9% year-on-year, an 11th consecutive monthly fall, indicating a dire year for car sales in continental Europe.</p> <p>By comparison, car sales in the US are increasing, highlighted by General Motors showing record profits last year, although sales are down on pre-recession highs.</p> <p>One in three car sales across Europe are in Germany, but even the EU stalwart saw a slide in sales, down nearly 5%. Sales in France dropped 11%, Italy down 20% and Greece fell 47%, according to industry analyst ACEA, which compiled the data.</p> <p>The organisation revealed that August's registration of new cars was the lowest since records began in 1990. The second-lowest figure was the 700,002 new cars registered in 2010.</p> <p>Ford suffered heavily, down 29%, but was not alone as BMW, Renault, Fiat and Peugeot-Citroen all suffered double-digit sales falls.</p> <p>It means Ford is set to make a $1bn (\u00a3615m) loss in Europe as job security and consumer confidence hit the markets.</p> <p>Nicholas Ziegelasch, global equity analyst at Killik and Co, said: \"Car sales are closely linked to consumer growth and confidence. Unless you know you're going to keep your job and there is growth, you're not going to buy a car.</p> <p>\"The economic situation in different countries appears to be playing out in the figures, with Germany outperforming other countries, while Spain, France and Italy have suffered.\"</p> <p>However, in the US, car sales continue to grow with Fiat, Toyota and Nissan all reporting an increase. In comparison, Fiat, which bought Chrysler in 2009 as part of President Obama's bailout for the US car industry, saw sales drop 18% in Europe.</p> <p>General Motors made a record profit of $7.6bn last year, after shedding 21,000 jobs as part of the bailout. In Europe, car firms were offered incentives to keep plants open.</p> <p>But carmakers are feeling the squeeze with Peugeot announcing plans to cut more than 10,000 French jobs and carry out the country's first car-plant closure in two decades.</p> <p>Fiat, which shut an Italian plant last year, has warned it will close another unless it can build vehicles competitively for US export.</p> <p>A handful of brands increased sales in Europe, including Kia, up 12%, Jaguar Land Rover, up 48% due to strong Land Rover sales, and VW Group, up 1.3%.</p> <p>VW, which owns Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda, has the largest market share in Europe, with 28%, suggesting its rise is particularly impressive.</p> <p>Ziegelasch at Killik said the German company had benefitted from a strong market in the country, with Germans tending to buy a VW.</p> <p>He said: \"The basic trend has been VW taking market share in Europe and across the world thanks to a combination of strong brands \u2013 Audi is now considered as good, if not better, than BMW \u2013 and with their size they are able to share a lot of components.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2012. The original said only the UK had seen an increase in sales n the first eight months of the year compared with 2011. It was the only major car market to see an increase.</p>",
  "<p>Russia has ordered a key US agency to shut down operations as Vladimir Putin continues to crackdown on a protest movement that he maintains was orchestrated by the US state department.</p> <p>The government has given the US agency for international development (USAid) until 1 October to shut its office in Moscow. \"While USAid's physical presence in Russia will come to an end, we remain committed to supporting democracy, human rights, and the development of a more robust civil society in Russia,\" state department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said in a statement.</p> <p>The move appeared to be the latest salvo in the Kremlin's efforts to squeeze a protest movement largely borne of civil society efforts to highlight growing government abuses. In addition to funding health and environment projects, USAid mainly focuses on supporting groups that promote democracy and human rights in Russia.</p> <p>\"We regret this decision by the Russian government,\" a senior Obama administration official said. \"We lament the fact that we will not be able to do the work that we've been proud to do. It's a difficult day.\"</p> <p>Putin, who returned to the presidency in May amid an unprecedented protest movement against him, has reserved particular scorn for Golos, an election monitoring organisation that receives the bulk of its budget from USAid. The group highlighted voting violations during a contested parliamentary election in December, helping bring tens of thousands into the streets as reports and videos of fraud went viral on YouTube and social networks.</p> <p>The administration official remained defiant about US funding of civil society in Russia, saying the order to close the agency \"doesn't mean we've changed our policy of supporting the kinds of actors USAid has supported\".</p> <p>\"Over the coming weeks and months, the Obama administration will look at ways to advance our old policy objectives with new means,\" the official said.</p> <p>The situation could become reminiscent of the drawn out struggle experienced by the British Council, which was forced to shut all its offices outside Moscow in 2007 as relations plunged in the wake of the murder in London of dissident Alexander Litvinenko.</p> <p>About 60% of USAid's $50m budget for 2012 went to groups that promote democracy and human rights \u2013 a sharp increase from the Bush era. The agency first opened in Moscow in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse.</p> <p>Among the nearly 57 organisations that receive USAid funding in Russia are human rights NGO Memorial and anti-corruption group Transparency International.</p> <p>Those groups have already been squeezed. The Russian parliament passed a new law this summer that required all non-governmental organisations that receive foreign funding to brand themselves \"foreign agents\" on all publications and websites and to undergo extra financial checks.</p> <p>Although rumours that the Kremlin was pressuring USAid had long swirled, the government's means of informing Washington appeared sudden. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, first informed Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, of the planned move during a meeting at an economic summit in Vladivostok earlier this month. The foreign ministry sent official notice on 12 September.</p> <p>USAid's 13 diplomats will likely have to leave the country. The fate of the 60 locals that work for the office remains unclear.</p> <p>Officials in Washington see the Russian move as part of the continuing war of attrition by Moscow against groups clamouring for greater democracy. They say it has been clear for some time that the Russian government has been irritated by USAid's support for an array of pro-democracy organisations, civic society groups and human rights activists.</p> <p>Putin has drawn on Cold War stereotypes and conspiracy theories on US involvement in the Arab Spring uprisings to blame the US for encouraging Russia's own opposition movement. Relations have plunged to further lows over Moscow's defiant stance against pressuring the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be here from 7.25pm or so for coverage of Real Madrid v Manchester City. In the meantime, here a preview of tonight's game:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has warned Manchester City that Real Madrid will be \"at our best\" when they face them at the Bernab\u00e9u in their opening Champions League group game on Tuesday evening. The Spanish champions are reeling from a poor start to the season that continued with Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Sevilla, which left them eight points behind the leaders, Barcelona.</p> <p>\"To play against City motivates me as much as playing against Getafe,\" said Mourinho. \"To win the Champions League motivates me like any other match. Motivation is something intrinsic to the job. The conviction is that tomorrow [on Tuesday evening] we will have a team. A determined, compact and solid team. I will try to field the team that I think will show up. Maybe we won't be as relaxed, or filled with the same conviction and confidence we usually have against an opponent like City, coming off a game which was terrible.</p> <p>\"I'm sure we'll be at our best. I could be wrong but that's what I think. The lineup will not be very different [from Sevilla], nor will I try to show any player that they are not in the best condition. It will be the best that I consider to play against an opposition full of players of the highest level. I don't believe I have created doubts. The principal person responsible is me. When my teams win, we win together, and when we lose, I am the one responsible. Before losing to Sevilla I said to the players what I then said in the press conference. For this reason it is not a criticism but a conviction.</p> <p>\"I said it to them before the game. Football is about today and tomorrow, not yesterday. Yesterday is history. I haven't been able to keep my players motivated and concentrated at the top level and that is my fault.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Here are the teams,</strong> although it should be noted that there are claims on Twitter that Uefa has published the wrong line-ups. Could it be that the mandarins accidentally scoffed the real ones somewhere between the canard au pamplemousse and black forest gateau? I'll bring you confirmation asap: in the meantime, it really does seem that Ramo and Ozil have been dropped and Essien and City new boy Nastasic are starting</p> <p><strong>Real:</strong> Casilla; Arbeloa, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo; Khedira, Alonso; Di Maria, Essien, Poor Ronaldo; Higuian<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Antonio, Sergio Ramos, Coentrao, Kaka, Benzema, Ozil, Modric</p> <p><strong>City:</strong> Hart; Maicon, Kompany, Nastasic, Clichy; Javi Gracia, Y Tour\u00e9, Barry; Silva, Nasri; Tevez<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Pantilimon, Zabaltea, Lescott, Dzeko, Kolarov, Aguero, Rodwell</p> <p><strong>Ref:</strong> D Skomina (Svn)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.38pm: So it seems those line-ups are indeed correct. Mourinho, then, is laying down the law and telling certain spoilt slackers that their \"lack of focus\" is not acceptable. As for City, apparently an insider has told ITV that Mario Balotelli has been omitted from the squad for \"technical reasons\".</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>7.44pm: The away end is full, but there are abundant empty seats elsewhere in the stadium, which suggests that the economic woes in Spain mean many people have a good deal more cause to be sad than Poor Ronaldo.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We have go. For of you watching in black and white, Real are in white and City are in black. For those of you watching colour, it's the same. For those of you following only this mbm, Real are naked and City are in pink leather.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Real move quickly down the left, whereupon Ronaldo cuts inside and sends a decent long-range shot several yard wide. The poor guy just can't catch a break ...</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> City haven't shown much so far, just trying to keep it steady early doors. Yaya Tour\u00e9, as ever, has shown a couple of classy touches but it's Real who've had most of the ball.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> A lovely flick by Silva sends Tevez scampering into the danger zone but Pepe hurtles across to snuff out the danger. City are starting to spend a little time in the opposing half.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Fine save! Poor Ronaldo received the ball wide on the left, then bamboozled Kompany with some foot-magic before aiming a low curling shot towards the bottom corner. Hart sprawled himself smartly to tip it behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Poor Ronaldo receives the ball on the left, then cuts inside past Maicon and unleashes another fierce shot that Hart pushes away. At some point City are going to figure out that when he receives the ball on the left, Poor Ronaldo likes to cut inside and shoot ...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> City knock the ball around midfield for a bit, going nowhere ... and then Nastasic tries to chip on forward for Tevez to chase but it's too long and Real get ready to rumble forward anew. \"Real are naked and City are in pink leather?\" gasps Toby Mohr before stammering: \"The important question, Paul, is what are you wearing?\" A confused expression, as ever.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> You get the feeling City will pay for their passiveness sooner or later. Fortunately that time it was Arbeloa who cut in from the wing (right) and shot, and Hart was left with an elementary save.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Silva turns nicely in midfield and darts towards the Real box, with team-mates to either side of him: this is a promising position .... but Silva delayed his pass too long and Marcelo disposseses him.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Hart to the rescue again, as Higuain springs the offside trap but is forced sufficiently wide to have to pass backwards rather than shoot. Ronaldo attempts to find the net from the edge of the area but his shot is deflected into the path of Khedira ... who stabs it over the bar from eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Real are well on top, moving the ball at such speed that City seem sliuggish. Maicon is being given the Bale treatment by Ronaldo.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> The ball is a boomerang to City at the moment: every time they boot it out of their half it keeps coming back, though accompanied by several Real players. Essien it the latest Real player to try his luck, but his 20-yard blast hurtles way wide.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Solid work by Kompany to shunt Higuain off the ball after Nastasic was caught in possession.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Nasri, who has been peripheral at best so far, appears to have pulled a muscle and is hobbling off. He looks unlikely to continue.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> What a chance for City! The imperious Tour\u00e9 strode through midfield and City flood forward in support, and briefly had four attackers versus just two defenders. Alas, Tour\u00e9 pass to Silva was imperfect, forcing the Spaniard to break his stride and giving Real a moment to recover. Pepe charges down Silva's shot at the edge of the box.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Kolarov has been introduced in place of Nasri.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Scandalous miss! Di Maria clipped a superb cross from the right over Kompany's head. Hart, to the defender's anger, chose not to come to meet it, leaving Higuain to stretch out a leg and .... tonk the ball over the bar from five yards!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Ronaldo receives the ball wide on the right, cuts inside Maicon ... and this time Kompany blocks his shot before it reaches Hart.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Di Maria has a pop from 25 yards. It flashes just wide.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> The ref stops play so that he can berate Tour\u00e9 and Khedira for excessive stroppery. \"Looking at the subs it seems certain Barry has to play 90mins,\" moans Richard Hamilton. \"Don't you think this level, and the business end of International football is just too much for him? Nice fella, good pro, just limited in ability.\" Yes. And I take it from your suggestion that there is no alternative on the bench that you don't think Rodwell is better?</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> After looking like they were coming to terms with things, City have let the initiative slip again and Real are well on top. Di Maria slams one wide from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> City have bad Real finishing and fine Hart goalkeeping to thank for a scoreline that is even despite Real dominating for long periods. City have not been awful but not have they been good enough to suggest they can continue holding out unless they find greater cohesion, accuracy and tempo.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time observation:</strong> \"I've just counted the total squad numbers of the 11 City players on the pitch,\" admits Edan Tal. \"It's 190! This is getting silly!\" It certainly is, Edan, it certainly is.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Regarding Gareth Barry. </strong>\"Ask any City fan if they'd have wanted Barry to start today, and the answer would have been a resounding yes,\" thunders Daniel Green. \"We've leaked goals this season, and it is due to Barry's absence. When we won our last 6 games to win the league Barry was a critical part of the XI we used weekly. He is slow and isn't flashy, but then again neither was Dietmar Hamann. Only people who don't watch City regularly fail yo see how important he is to us.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> City get the second half under way.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Maicon gets farther forward than he ever did in the first half ... but his cross from the right is feeble.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Poor Ronaldo receives the ball wide on the right ... and you know the drill. But Nastasic knows it now too, so he came across to help out Maicon and prevent the Portuguese from shooting. So instead he shunted ball sideways to Di Maria, whose shot from the right is deflected wide.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong>Tour\u00e9 sets Kolarov racing in behind the Real defence down the left ... this is a great opportunity .... but instead of crossing, Kolarov runs all the way out of play. Oh dear.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Javi Garica booked after some helter-skelter midfield action sparked by Tour\u00e9 losing the ball. Garica didn't deserve to see yellow mind: he won the ball back off Khedira fair and square.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>54 min: </strong> Garcia nods over from a corner, Pepe having applied enough pressure to prevent him from getting a proper connection on it.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Poor Ronaldo receives the ball on the right ... and gain City double up on him, Kompany helping out Maicon. But down-on-his-luck Ronaldo has support too, with Marceloa providing an overlap. PR gives him the ball and Marceloa fires a brilliant low cross across the face of goal. Higuain, however, was dawdling so Clichy was able to clear under no duress. \"Someone should point out to Daniel Green that Dietmar Hamann did a bit more than just occupy space in front of the central defenders and knock the ball six yards sideways every now and then,\" bellows Nick Smith, doing the pointing out himself. \"Why did Rafa want to replace Alonso with Barry? Its the biggest mystery in football... I miss Xabi.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> City nod off while Real take a quick corner. THen Pepe is allowed to receive a cross unmarked on the far side of the box: he even has time to miscontrol it and do a fancy twirl before firing the ball across the face of goal. Again Clichy is on hand to bash it clear. \"I throw a very dark cloud over Daniel Green's impassioned defence of G. Barry,\" barks Sasu Laaksonen. \"The City fans I know understand there's a big difference between the Premier League football and CL/International football. And while they would not mind seeing Barry starting a game against Stoke, there's no way they would want him to lumber v Real Madrid. And yes, I am a Finn....but there's a rapidly growing City contingent here too.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Bang! Marcelo fires a cracking shot inches wide from 20 yards. City are on the rack here ...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Respite for City as Varane chops down Silva to concede a freekick near the Real corner flag (the one to the right of their goal, if you must know). And that's Silva's last contribution to the game, as Mancini takes him off to throw on Dzeko.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Marcelo goes close with yet another blast from distance.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 0-1 City (Dzeko 69')</strong> Now there's a sucker punch! That was mildly reminiscent of Fernando Torres' goal for Chelsea gainst Barcelona last season, although the chance was created not by a mighty punt forward but by a trademark burst by Tour\u00e9, who collected the ball off Tevez and stormed past two and drew the last defender before knocking the ball into the path of Dezko. The Bosnian cantered towards the box and slotted the ball past Casillas from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Hart comes to meet a corner but misses it. Happily for him, Varane heads over from close range. Meanwhile, Mourinho is poised to make two substitutions ...</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> That's another dangerous break by City, who have three attackers versus four defenders. Tevez has Dzeko to his right and Kolarov to his left. He goes for the Serbian option ... and Kolarov forces a decent save from Casillas with a shot from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Real subtitutions:</strong> The cavalry arrive in the persons of Benzema and Modric, with Higuain and Khedira leaving.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>City substitution: </strong>Maicon off, Zabaleta off.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Modric's first involvement sees him nick in to steal the ball off Kolarov as he embarked on another run.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 1-1 City (Marcelo 76')</strong> A superb strike by Marcelo, who did what Poor Ronaldo has been attempting to do all night: after receiving the ball on the right, he cut inside and curled a sumptuous shot into the top corner from 20 yards. And on that note, could people please stop referring to Ashley Cole as the best left-back in the world?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> This is fun. The match has an engagingly hectic feel to it, with both sides going for the win.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Ozil, who came on for Essien earlier on, is becoming a menacing influence for Real, probing tantalisingly on the edge of the City box. Real's latest attach yielded a corner, with Hart then having to produce solid saves from first from Varane and then from Alonso.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Real are establishing a base camp at the rim of City's box. Modric has a pop from there but it's straight at Hart.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> A fine break by Tevez and Kolarov relieves the pressure and results in a corner for City. Poor Ronaldo heads the corner clear but City regain the ball and circulate it smartly before winning another corner.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 1-2 City (Kolarov 86')</strong> Kolarov sends a curling freekick from the right towarads the back post. Defenders and attackers go for it ... but all miss it (or maybe Alonso got a slight nick to it) and it bounces into the corner of the net! That's what's called putting the ball into a dangerous area with vicious intent. Nasri's injury has turned out to be a blessing of sorts, since Kolarov has made a difference since replacing him.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 2-2 City (Benzema 87')</strong> Way to kill City's celebrations quick smart! Di Maria went on a jagged run down the right and then pinged the ball into Benzema, who turned away from Nastasic and fired a low shot into the net from the edge of the box!</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> This game is far from finished: Real threaten a winner with a lightning break and quickfire passes. Benzema cuts the ball back to Poor Ronaldo, who could put Di Maria through on goal but elects to have a good himself, and Hart pushes his 20-yard drive to safety.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 3-2 City (Happy Ronaldo 90')</strong> Ronaldo received the ball on the right, cut inside and sent a swirling shot past Hart and into the net! Kompany appeared to duck under the ball before it bounced just in front of the keeper, who reckons the centreback should have cut it out. Ronaldo, meanwhile, scampers off to milk the adulation of the jubilant crowd.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> City will be sick. Twice they were in front and twice they let their lead slip quickly and sloppily, and then were sunk by a late winner than Ronaldo had been rehearsing all night. It was not a spectacularly high-quality game but it sure had its moments, and a pleasantly chaotic and positive vibe in the second half, in particular.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p>Reaction from Joe Hart: \"It's not on. You can't go 2-1 up and lose. It's not on. We only have ourselves to blame.\"</p>",
  "<p>British farmers can't produce pigs as cheaply as the Poles, or cattle feed as cheaply as the Brazilians, or milk as cheaply as the Americans, or fruit as cheaply as the Spanish, and if they can't pull their socks up, the market dictates, they will just have to go. According to a recent survey by the <a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Pig Association</a>, about 100 small- to medium-sized pig farmers are likely to quit this year \u2013 which is 10% of them. We are<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/20/dairy-farmers-asking-fair-days-pay\" title=\"\"> losing dairy farmers</a> by the score every month. Horticulture has long since gone by the board (whatever happened to \"<a href=\"http://www.visitkent.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the garden of England</a>\", aka Kent?). Only about 1% of people in Britain now <a href=\"http://www.ukagriculture.com/statistics/farming_statistics.cfm?strsection=Labour%20Force\" title=\"\">work on the land</a>.</p> <p>But it's the same everywhere. The traditional farmers of Africa and Asia are urged to give up growing food for their own people and raise commodity crops for us, in exchange for our money, which we make by banking. Of course farms should be as big as possible to achieve economies of scale, and labour must be reduced to cut costs, so most of the existing small farmers, men and women, must go. Hundreds of thousands have <a href=\"http://www.foodfirst.org/node/1626/print\" title=\"\">committed suicide</a> in India, but most flee to the cities to join the estimated billion rural exiles who now live in urban slums (almost a third of the urban population of the country).</p> <p>Objective data, of the kind that the scientists and economists who advise the powers-that-be claim to base their ideas upon, suggests that the new ways aren't working \u2013 not, at least, if we feel that the job of agriculture is to produce good food. Worldwide, 1 billion people of the present 7 billion are chronically undernourished, while another billion are chronically overnourished \u2013 such that according to an article in Nature in May the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7398_supp/full/485S14a.html\" title=\"\">world population of diabetics now exceeds the combined population of the US and Canada</a>, and almost all because of diet. Damage to the world at large is huge. Mainly because of industrial farming, half of all species on Earth could be extinct by the end of the century. Agriculture occupies 40% of the planet's land, but its pollution endangers creatures everywhere, including the seas, where farming run-off is destroying the coral reefs.</p> <p>But the corporate-government complex that runs our lives is committed to the all-out financial competition of the neoliberal global market. So British farmers in British conditions in a British social context are head to head with peasant Africans and US mega-corporates and Ukrainian grain barons (or would be were it not for the EU subsidies) \u2013 while farming as a whole must compete for investment with cars, weapons, casinos and hair-dressing.</p> <p>If British farmers can't produce more cash in the short term than the Poles or the Brazilians (or the corporates who are billeted in their countries) then they just have to go. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/cap.html\" title=\"\">Tony Blair's government just a few years ago </a>seriously mooted that British farming should go the way of its mining. It may seem hard, even vile, but, as Lady Thatcher assured us all those years ago, \"there is no alternative\" \u2013 and all British governments since, even those with \"Labour\" in the title, have taken this as gospel. The strangely-titled <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/\" title=\"\">National Farmers Union</a> is firmly committed to big business.</p> <p>The deep trouble is the huge clash between morality, biological reality, and the present economy. Until and unless we bring the three into line, we are bound to be in trouble. More than that, we need to acknowledge that morality (what is good) and biological reality (what is necessary and possible) must lead, and the economy must be secondary. As <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes </a>said many decades ago: economics must \"take the back seat\" and we should focus first on \"our real problems, of life and human relations, of creation, and of behaviour and religion\".</p> <p>If we don't acknowledge the moral obligation to provide good food for everyone without wrecking the rest, then what does morality mean? There is no excuse for the present failure \u2013 for sound biological thinking shows that good food for everyone should be eminently possible. But report after report \u2013 the kind governments and big organisations choose to override \u2013 tells us that the best way to ensure that everyone is well fed, sustainably and securely, is through farms that are mixed, complex and low-input (quasi-organic). These must be labour-intensive (or there can be no complexity), so there is no advantage in them being large scale. Such farms are traditional in structure, but they need not be traditional in technology. They would benefit from good technologies and science.</p> <p>But the small-to-medium mixed farms that could feed us well and provide good jobs are absolutely at odds with the modern perceived imperative to maximise wealth. To survive in the fight for profit, skilled labour must be replaced with big machines and agrochemistry; the husbandry must be simplified \u2013 monoculture rules \u2013 and all must be done on the largest possible scale. Although industrial farming doesn't feed everybody, has led to mass unemployment and the poverty and despair that go with it, and is wrecking the fabric of the world, it must prevail because it produces piles of short-term cash for the people who are calling the shots.</p> <p>We need to turn things round and fast. And we means us, all of us \u2013 ordinary Joes, because the governments and corporates who run the world, and their attendant experts and intellectuals, are not going to. The standard ways to bring about change are by reform or revolution \u2013 but reform is too slow and today's politicians and the big business they are beholden to cannot change course. Revolution is too chancy and too dangerous.</p> <p>So we need the third route \u2013 renaissance: build something better in situ. In effect, a people's takeover. All over the world individuals and communities are starting small mixed farms of the kind the world really needs, while others are starting small shops and farmers' markets and delivery services to serve those new farms. Thousands of organisations worldwide are seeking to promote and co-ordinate these efforts.</p>",
  "<p>Of the controversies at London Fashion Week, the emergence on Sunday of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/sep/16/lady-gaga-philip-treacy-london-fashion-week?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Lady Gaga </a>in what appeared to be several pelts, hot on the heels of a spat with <a href=\"http://www.peta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Peta</a>, was \u2013 as fashion folk are wont to say \u2013 something of \"a moment\". And yet, as Gaga wears her nonchalance about skin on her sleeve, so a good many British designers seem equally blas\u00e9: among them, <a href=\"http://uk.burberry.com/store/\" title=\"\">Burberry</a>, <a href=\"http://www.viviennewestwood.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Vivienne Westwood</a> and <a href=\"http://www.alexandermcqueen.co.uk/alexandermcqueen/en_GB\" title=\"\">Alexander McQueen</a>. Where once fur was confined to a few picketed outlets, now it can be found from haute to high street.</p> <p>In the last few years there has been a renaissance in the fur industry. The global trade is now worth $15bn (\u00a39.2bn), with pelts reaching record prices at auction. In the UK sales increased by more than 30% between 2010-2011. Where once skin provoked shudders, so now many merely shrug. And yet an angry and vociferous contingent continues to exhibit a knee-jerk antipathy towards fur, while happy to consume milk, meat and leather.</p> <p>Given today's tight industry regulation, can we take it that the same reasons that make mink a desirable material for coats gives said creatures more protester appeal than, say, a cow? Are antagonists simply favouring fur-ball cuteness over bovine plodding? The answer is that \"fur isn't necessary\", in a way that suggests steaks and lattes to be among culture's essential pillars.</p> <p>Personally, I have long been a pelt-wearing vegetarian. My decision to renounce flesh almost 30 years ago was motivated by macroeconomic concerns rather than any big-eyed Disney considerations. Since then, I have also developed distaste for intensive dairy farming. Of meat, milk and fur, it is only the latter that I have found necessary, weathering winters in Russia, Norway, Chicago and back in Blighty.</p> <p>This \u2013 forgive me \u2013 foxes people. By the laws of reflex liberalism, those of my ilk are not supposed to \"do skin\". And yet, like the non-paint-hurling majority, I am wary of an animal rights lobby that refers to medical testing as a \"holocaust\", terrorises scientists and their families, and would prohibit pets. To compare their activism to that of suffragettes or anti-Nazi protesters is reverse anthropomorphism at its most obscene.</p> <p>Hostility to fur feeds off antagonisms regarding class, money and misogyny. Modish male lefties may sport leather jackets with impunity, but woe betide the rich bitch in mink. Like hunting, fur inspires hatred because it is associated with the wealthy. It is also embroiled in the usual metropolitan disdain for rural matters. We may like to visit the countryside, but urbanites show scant regard for how its human or animal populations can be sustained.</p> <p>The fur trade provides income for thousands in remote regions where there can be little alternative employment. Even within the EU, the value of farmed fur products amounts to \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn), generating 60,000 full-time jobs. And, like many luxury products, fur is enjoying a good recession.</p> <p>It is in no way perverse to suggest that the industry is also beneficial for animals, in the sense that culling can regulate and thus secure populations \u2013 as deer culling does in Britain. Members of the fur trade have been supporters of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES\" title=\"\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a> since its inception. And the <a href=\"http://www.wearefur.com/\" title=\"\">International Fur Trade Federation </a>has been a voting member of the <a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/\" title=\"\">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> since 1985. As so often in (regulated) farming and hunting, the interdependence between humans and animals maintains species.</p> <p>Moreover, in an age of \"slow\", eco, sustainable fashion, in which heritage has become the watchword, fur can boast an ancestry of 100,000 years. It is a natural, renewable, biodegradable resource. Farmed mink are fed with leftovers otherwise destined for landfills, providing oils for waterproofing and organic fertilisers. In contrast, most fake furs are made from petroleum-based products derived from non-renewable resources. There is a tradition of fur being handed down and restyled through generations, rather less so with fast fashion substitutes.</p> <p>One of the depressing things about contemporary life is the way in which individuals are expected to subscribe to \"domino\" opinions \u2013 if one holds one view, one is assumed to uphold a series of others \u2013 rather than a set of nuanced beliefs. For those who maintain the latter, vegetarianism may even issue from the same source as pro-fur sentiment: a concern for the sharing of resources that considers both humans and animals.</p>",
  "<p>Binyamin Netanyahu's appearance on <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/16/13895630-israeli-pm-tries-to-strike-more-neutral-pose-in-us-election?lite\">Meet the Press</a> this weekend was telling. </p> <p>Interviewer David Gregory called him the \"leader of the Jewish people\". That's certainly how the Israeli prime minister would like to see himself, and he wouldn't be the first.</p> <p>Israeli leaders have long claimed the mantle of voice of the Jewish people around the world and protector of the Diaspora. Part of that is rooted in the idea of Israel as a safe haven, and the desire of every Israeli government to draw in new citizens. A few years back, Ariel Sharon tried to tell Jews in France that they were so <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/02/opinion/le-israel2\">persecuted</a> they needed to move to Israel for their own protection. This at a time when Hamas and Islamic Jihad were blowing innocents to pieces in Jerusalem restaurants and on Tel Aviv buses. There was no rush to the El Al flight from Paris. </p> <p>But there is also the global aspect. Netanyahu stood <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/full-transcript-of-netanyahu-speech-at-un-general-assembly-1.386464\">before the United Nations</a> last year and claimed to speak for hundreds of generations of Jews across the world. It was an attempt to elevate himself above a mere political leader to claim to represent the full weight of Jewish suffering in justifying his government's stance towards the Palestinians.</p> <p>Gregory's slip \u2013 he later <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/16/david-gregory-netanyahu_n_1888329.html\">corrected himself</a> by tweeting that it would be better to call Netanyahu the leader of Jewish state \u2013 was revealing of a mindset in certain sections of the American press that has a hard time dealing with the fact that Israel's prime minister might not be the leader of an entire people, but just another politician less worried about the common good than shoring up his power.</p> <p>That was where Meet the Press was revealing on a second point. It threw up evidence of just how successful Netanyahu has been at putting his political interests before those of Israel's future, which should lie in keeping the ever-dimming prospect of a two-state solution alive.</p> <p>There wasn't a single mention of the Palestinians <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2012/09/netanyahus-touchdown-david-gregory-interviews-israeli-leader-without-talking-palestine.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">during the 15 minute interview</a>. Gregory didn't ask about them, and Netanyahu didn't talk about them. Thus the fate of several million people living under varying degrees of an occupation that continues to plunder land, maintain discriminatory laws and administrative procedures \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/israel-rations-palestinians-trickle-water-20091027\">rationing water</a> to Arab villages while their neighbors in the Jewish settlements have unlimited supplies \u2013 remains in limbo. Netanyahu's government, meanwhile, pays lip service to the creation of a Palestinian state while pursuing policies intended to stave off the day of its birth.</p> <p>Just last week, the prime minister moved to expand 40 West Bank settlements built on land <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2012/09/israel-seeks-to-resume-building-on-private-palestinian-land-in-40-west-bank-settlements.html\">confiscated illegally</a> \u2013 Israel admits it was illegal \u2013 from Palestinians by military order. Hardly the actions of a man or a government that only wants peace, as is so often claimed.</p> <p>As prime minister, Netanyahu's great achievement, as he would see it, is to have made the Palestinians all but invisible \u2013 first at home, and then abroad.</p> <p>Locked behind the land-grabbing West Bank barrier and caged in the Gaza strip, Palestinians have all but ceased to touch the lives of most Israelis. The occupation no longer demands an exacting price, so far as many Israelis are concerned. Yes, there is the inconvenience of military service; and there are unseen costs, such as financing the settlement project. But on the whole, Netanyahu has enabled Israelis to pretty much forget about the Palestinians if they choose to. And many do.</p> <p>Now, the Israeli leader has made the Palestinians disappear from the international stage, too, with the \"will he, won't he\" drama of threatening to bomb Iran.</p> <p>Three years ago, Netanyahu was humiliated by Barack Obama with a public scolding to <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/NEWS/MIDDLEEAST/2009/05/2009524202740614966.html\">stop settlement expansion</a>. Even a year ago, the Palestinian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/11/united-nations-delays-palestinian-statehood-vote\">bid for statehood</a> at the UN at least put the issue on the agenda, even if Washington sided with Israel by strong-arming members of the security council into blocking it. In <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/palestinians-to-seek-upgrade-of-un-status-ahead-of-renewed-statehood-bid-1.455899\">two weeks</a>, the Palestinians return to the UN to try again on recognition, this time with the general assembly.</p> <p>But, as Meet the Press showed, there's not much talk of that while Netanyahu draws Washington's energies into trying to prevent him from <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/17/iran-nuclear-israel-idUSL5E8KG2P520120917\">attacking Iran </a>before the US election. Whether he ever meant to is open to debate.</p> <p>But the effect has been clear. When the Israeli prime minister was last in Washington, there was barely a mention of the Palestinians after his meeting with Obama. And barely a word was breathed about the Palestinians at this year's meeting of the most influential of the pro-Israel lobby groups in Washington, American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). The focus was firmly on Iran.</p> <p>Netanyahu has everyone where he wants them. The Palestinians behind the wire and most of the rest of the world looking the other way.</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting will be open for 24 hours on this article and may be closed overnight</p> <p>\u2022 Editor's note: on first publication, because of an editing error, this article referred to \"Hamas and Islamic jihads\".

  "<p>You can imagine a stage adaptation of Robin Jenkins's sublime 1955 novel turning out like Of Mice and Men. Set during the second world war on a remote Highland estate, it's about two brothers hired to gather pinecones for seed before the forest is felled. Like Steinbeck's Lennie, Callum is a child-like innocent with a love of nature who, arousing suspicion and ridicule, relies on the protection of a more worldly man \u2013 in&#xa0;this case, his brother Neil.</p> <p>But here playwright Peter Arnott shifts the focus on to the gamekeeper, Duror, who, like Steinbeck's Curley, is threatened by the newcomers, for his own reasons. Played by Tom McGovern, blunt and self-justifying, he is a man under severe mental stress who shows signs of paranoid schizophrenia. He stands for something bigger than himself, however. The image of Adolf Hitler flickers onto a newsreel, just as Duror is giving a delusional speech about the evil in society. It harks back to Arnott's opening line: \"This story happens in the world and the forest.\" At&#xa0;a time of global persecution of minorities, Duror's campaign has a wider resonance.</p> <p>Arnott is also alive to the novel's vision of a ruling class no longer able to sustain its sense of superiority. John Kielty's Neil is an angry egalitarian, refusing to take orders from Jennifer Black's Lady Runcie-Campbell, a decent woman who is ill-equipped to deal with a changing social order.</p> <p>While designer Hayden Griffin creates an illusion of the forest's enveloping darkness by projecting images on to rows of vertical ropes, director Kenny Ireland builds enough tension for the tragic ending to draw audible gasps.</p> <p><em>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Architecture, the most public of endeavours, is practised by people who inhabit a smugly hermetic milieu which is cultish. If this sounds far-fetched just consider the way initiates of this cult describe outsiders as the <em>lay</em> public, <em>lay</em> writers and so on: it's the language of the priesthood. And like all cults its primary interest is its own interests, that is to say its survival, and the triumph of its values \u2013 which means building. Architects, architectural critics, architectural theorists, the architectural press (which is little more than a deferential PR machine) \u2013 the entire quasi-cult is cosily conjoined by mutual dependence and by an ingrown, verruca-like jargon which derives from the more dubious end of American academe.</p> <p>From early in its history, photography was adopted by architects as a means of idealising their buildings. As beautiful and heroic, as tokens of their ingenuity and mankind's progress, etc. This debased tradition continues to thrive. At its core lies the imperative to show the building out of context, as a monument, separate from streetscape, from awkward neighbours, from untidiness. A vast institutional lie is being told in architectural magazines the world over, in the pages of newspapers and in countless television films. It's also being told on the web \u2013 which is significant, and depressing, for it demonstrates how thoroughly the convention has seeped into the collective.</p> <p>The mediation of buildings can never be neutral. As long ago as the 1930s, <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/history/view-page/item476742/252734/\" title=\"\">Harry Goodhart-Rendel</a> observed: \"The modern architectural drawing is interesting, the photograph is magnificent, the building is an unfortunate but necessary stage between the two.\" Goodhart-Rendel was an architect who belonged to no school, and is thus regarded as peripheral. He was also a writer: a rare combination of talents. John Vanbrugh was a good playwright who became a great \u2013 if not the greatest \u2013 of British architects. Sergei Eisenstein trained as an architect but gave it up. Thomas Hardy, to judge from <a href=\"http://www.maxgate.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Max Gate</a>, the house he designed for himself in Dorchester, made the right choice when he elected to abandon architecture in favour of writing.</p> <p>Architecture talks about architecture as though it is disconnected from all other endeavours, an autonomous discipline which is an end in itself. Now, it would be acceptable to discuss opera or sawmill technology or athletics or the refinement of lard in such a way. They can be justifiably isolated, for they don't impinge on anyone outside, say, the lard community \u2013 the notoriously factional lard community. To isolate architecture is blindness, and an abjuration of responsibility.</p> <p>If we want to understand the physical environment we should not ask architects about it. After all, if we want to understand charcuterie we don't seek the opinion of pigs. Architects make the error of confusing a physical environment with what they impose on it. Wrong. What is going on around us is the product of innumerable forces. Accidents \u2013 some happy, some not \u2013 clashes of scale and material, municipal idiocies and corporate boasts \u2013 these are some of the more salient determinants of our urban and suburban and extra-urban environments. Buildings are, of course, the major component of these environments. Some of those buildings will be the work of architects. But with the exception of those places where they have been granted the licence to do what they yearn to do \u2013 to start from zero \u2013 architects have less influence than they believe.</p> <p>The places where those accidents don't occur are salutary. The places where architects indeed had the opportunity to start from zero. We think of Bath's crescents and circuses, of the successive Edinburgh new towns, of the exiled Polish court's rebuilding of Nancy. At a higher level, Ledoux's Arc-et-Senans and Le Corbusier's l'Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation both instruct us in what genius is. The roof of l'Unit\u00e9 is a transcendent work: it is as though Odysseus is beside you. In a few gestures, it summons the entirety of the Mediterranean's mythic history. It is exhilarating and humbling, it occasions&#xa0;aesthetic bliss. It demonstrates the beatific power of great art, great architecture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376764\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/18/1347989393568/Seaside-Florida-010.jpg\" alt=\"Seaside, Florida\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artifice ...

So are the other places I mention. They are the exceptions to the rule that planned towns, tied towns, new towns, garden cities, garden villages, communist utopias, national socialist utopias, socialist utopias, one-nation utopias, comprehensive developments and wholesale regenerations that lurch between the mediocre and the disastrous. From Letchworth to Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, from New Lanark to <a href=\"http://www.ourwelwyngardencity.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Welwyn</a> \u2013 the first provincial town in Britain, incidentally, to develop a serious smack habit \u2013 from the Aylesbury estate in south London to <a href=\"http://www.seasidefl.com/history/architecture/\" title=\"\">Seaside, Florida</a>, from cuteness to high modernism, from beaux arts to new urbanism. It doesn't matter what idiom is essayed, it is the business of attempting to create places that defeats architects. Architects cannot devise analogues for what has developed over centuries, for generation upon generation of amendments. They cannot understand the appeal of untidiness and randomness, and even if they could they wouldn't know how to replicate it.</p> <p>New buildings are simple: imagination and engineering. New places are not. It seems impossible to achieve by artifice the parts with no name, the pavement's warts and the avenue's lesions, the physical consequences of changed uses, the waste ground, the apparently purposeless plots.</p> <p>It shouldn't be impossible. One cause of this failure is architects' lack of empathy, their failure to cast themselves as non-architects: architect <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=8109\" title=\"\">Yona Friedman</a> long ago observed that architecture entirely forgets those who use its products. Another cause of failure is their bent towards aesthetic totalitarianism \u2013 a trait <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/nikolaus-pevsner\" title=\"\">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> approved of, incidentally. There was no work he admired more than <a href=\"http://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/college/buildings-and-gardens\" title=\"\">St Catherine's College, Oxford</a>: a perfect piece of architecture. And it is indeed impressive in an understated way. But it is equally an example of nothing less than micro-level totalitarianism. Arne Jacobson designed not only the building, but every piece of furniture and every item of cutlery.</p> <p>At macro-level, a so-called master planner will attend to the details of streets, avenues, drop-in centres, houses, offices, bridges. The master planner is almost certainly an architect, even though planning and architecture are contrasting disciplines. There are countless differences between a suburb and, say, a shopping mall in that suburb. We are all familiar with the hubristic pomp that often results when actors direct themselves. Appointing architects to conceive places is like appointing foxes to advise on chicken security.</p> <p>The human ideal is to revel in urbanistic richness, in layers of imperfection. I got sick of Rome when I worked there: too much perfection, too constant a diet of masterpieces \u2013 the lumbering, sod-you-ness of <a href=\"http://www.basilspence.org.uk/work/buildings/rome-embassy\" title=\"\">Basil Spence's British Embassy</a> was peculiarly attractive. The only town in the Cotswolds that attracts me is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2010/dec/18/lets-move-to-stroud-gloucestershire\" title=\"\">Stroud</a>, where the tyranny of oolitic limestone is ruptured by brick and slate.</p> <p>The overlooked can only survive so long as authority is lax. When authority goes looking for the overlooked, the game is up \u2013 as it is today in the <a href=\"http://www.walklondon.org.uk/route.asp?R=4\" title=\"\">Lea Valley in east London</a>.

  "<p>Plans to open up a new Australian \"coal export rush\" would turn a single Queensland region into the seventh largest contributor of carbon dioxide emissions on the planet, undermining international efforts to keep global warming below 2C, a new report has warned.</p> <p>Nine proposed \"mega mines\" in the Galilee Basin would, at full capacity, result in 705m tonnes of CO2 released into the atmosphere, according to a Greenpeace Australia analysis. This level of emissions would surpass those of all but six nations in the world. By comparison, the UK emitted <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_033/pn12_033.aspx\" title=\"\">549.3 million tonnes of CO2</a> from all sources in 2011.</p> <p>Greenpeace said that the nine mines' production capacity of 330m tonnes of coal a year for export would represent an \"unprecedented\" increase in the scale of coal mining in Australia. The mines' maximum output, primarily aimed at servicing the burgeoning Chinese and Indian markets, would nearly double Australia's total 2010/11 coal production of 352m tonnes and eclipse its <a href=\"http://www.ret.gov.au/resources/mining/australian_mineral_commodities/coal/Pages/australia_coal_industry.aspx\" title=\"\">export total of 283m tonnes</a>.</p> <p>The Greenpeace report states that the mines will only be able to launch and operate at capacity if global appetite for coal continues to grow strongly. This scenario would in effect nullify an internationally agreed goal to keep the increase in average global temperatures below 2C from pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>Greenpeace warns that a growth in coal-fired emissions represented by the nine Queensland mines would be in line with the International Energy Agency's model of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/25/governments-catastrophic-climate-change-iea\" title=\"\">\"catastrophic\" 6C rise</a> in temperatures.</p> <p>\"At a time when the science could not be clearer on the need to reduce global carbon emissions, and when governments worldwide are shifting to a low-carbon economy, exploiting the Galilee Basin is a reckless proposition,\" the report states. \"It is imperative that the Galilee Basin coal reserves remain in the ground.\"</p> <p>The Alpha coal mine, a joint venture between Indian conglomerate GVK and Gina Rinehart's Hancock Coal, last month became the first major Galilee Basin project to be given <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-23/alpha-coal-mine-approval/4218112\" title=\"\">state and federal government approval</a>, despite protests from environmentalists and farmers.</p> <p>The mine, which will bring an estimated AU$1bn (\u00a3642m) into the Queensland economy, will have the capacity to create 64.7m tonnes of CO2 \u2013 the equivalent of Israel's entire 2009 emissions from fuel combustion.</p> <p>The other eight mines are yet to be given the green light by ministers. Adani, another Indian mining firm, hopes to build a <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/business/worklife/plan-for-specialised-mines-town-as-an-alternative-to-the-controversial-fly-in-fly-out-roster/story-e6frfm9r-1226428492230\" title=\"\">new town for 12,000 people</a> to service its big Carmichael mine, which would produce up to 60m tones of coal a year.</p> <p>Greenpeace's report argues that the expansion in Queensland coal mining will damage the nearby Great Barrier Reef through coral bleaching from increased temperatures, but also in the shorter term due to the development of new ports and shipping lanes in order to transport the coal overseas.</p> <p>In June, a UN report expressed \"extreme concern\" over the level of <a href=\"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/conservation/unesco-report-scathing-of-great-barrier-reef-management-20120602-1zo0m.html\" title=\"\">development along the Great Barrier Reef coast</a>, calling for all building to cease until an assessment of the ecosystem's health was carried out.</p> <p>The Greenpeace Australia campaigner Georgina Woods, author of the new coal report, said: \"Australia has just pretended up until now that coal exports aren't part of the problem but it's time that we started talking about it if we want to keep treasures like the Great Barrier Reef.\"</p> <p>\"These proposed mines need to be taken off the table and development along the Great Barrier Reef coast needs to be ruled out. The topic of coal exports is a very immature conversation in Australia but we need to start that conversation.\"</p> <p>Australia is itself a heavy user of coal, as well as a leading exporter. Although the country has committed to cutting its own carbon emissions by 5% on 2000 levels by 2020 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/28/australia-eu-carbon-markets,\" title=\"\">introduced carbon pricing in July</a>, the federal government has been accused of botching its attempts to move the country away from fossil fuels. This month, the government <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1689319/Labor-scraps-plan-to-close-dirty-power-stations\" title=\"\">abandoned plans to pay five of Australia's dirtiest coal-fired power generators</a> to close down, despite already handing them $1bn in taxpayer money to cushion the impact of carbon pricing.</p>",
  "<p>Having battled through the wettest summer in over 100 years, we northerners might be tempted to up sticks and move down south in search of sunnier climes.</p> <p>It's no great surprise that southern cities get on average more hours of sunshine per year than the north, but <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/2011/annual/averages.html/\">Met Office statistics</a> show that the difference is not actually that great. Overall, the north of England lies not so far behind the south for annual hours of sunshine, with 1484.4 hours and 1589.7 hours respectively. That works out at just under 20 minutes extra sunshine for southern England per day, over the course of a year.</p> <p>The amount of sunlight a city gets is directly linked to the amount of electricity that a solar panel in that location can generate. Historically speaking, the appeal of free electricity has been greater in the south.</p> <p>Renewable energy specialists <a href=\"http://www.evoenergy.co.uk/\">EvoEnergy</a> have now released figures showing how many years it takes for the average solar panel installation to pay for itself. They show that installing panels in the north remains a good deal.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, cities in the south came out tops, with Plymouth, Exeter and Truro named as the three cities with the highest return on investment for domestic solar panel installations. In Plymouth, it takes only 8.4 years for a domestic solar panel installation to pay for itself, compared with the national average of 9.5 years.</p> <p>Here's how the figures break down for cities in the north of England:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396342248\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347987714794/solarcity.jpg\" alt=\"solar power\" width=\"460\" height=\"302\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As you might expect, most northern cities come in either on or above the national average for payback years. Anomalies in the data, such as the contrast between Hull and Wakefield can be explained by slight regional variations in measured ground solar irradiance and differing levels of cloud cover.</p> <p>Steven Hall, from <a href=\" http://www2.hull.ac.uk/science/geography.aspx\"> the Department of Geography, Environment and Earth Science at the University of Hull </a> explains why Hull bucks the trend for the north:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is most likely because the prevailing wind in most of the North is West to East from the Atlantic. All the wet air of the Gulf stream reaches the west coast first (drenching Manchester, which is why it is a rainy city), then has to go over the Pennines to visit Leeds and then still has the Yorkshire Wolds to rain on before reaching Hull. </p> <p>As such we have more sunny, dry days per year than our Yorkshire and Lancashire contemporaries, so contrary to the popular quip... it's never dull in Hull!</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396342249\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347987368475/amy.jpg\" alt=\"amy byard\" width=\"140\" height=\"244\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Amy Byard</strong> is a BA broadcast journalism graduate of Leeds university.</em></p>",
  "<p>Many people in higher education think of distance learning the same way one would a distant cousin: aware of its existence, perhaps even thinks well of them, but reluctant to pick up the phone and find out how they are doing. And like the cousin you don't know well, the justification for your lack of interest is that distance learning is just a little bit awkward.</p> <p>Distance learning is reputedly characterised by clunky online interfaces, isolation and generally conspiring to make students \u2013 and staff \u2013 miss out on so many of the things that make university life so attractive: daily interaction with people who think like we do. We imagine it to be just a depleted version of the 'real thing'.</p> <p>But in the same way that reconnecting with a distant relative can teach you things about yourself that daily interaction with your closest friends can't, distance learning has things to offer that are difficult to find in a traditional university course. An good example of this is its capacity to instantly connect to people from all over the world. At the <a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Alternative Technology</a>, we run a range of specialist <a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/gse-postgraduate-study\" title=\"\">renewable energy and sustainable architecture masters degrees</a>. Our distance learning course has enabled us to create a course that gives sustainability a global perspective.</p> <p>A distance learning course puts students into a classroom that spans the whole world. It means the range of perspectives that are brought into that classroom are more diverse than any other method of learning. For a course based on sustainability this is crucial. Sustainability shouldn't be taught as an abstract theory amongst a group of people that all basically come from the same background, it should be taught as a discourse amongst people with diverse experiences of its practical application. Many other fields would benefit from similar thinking.</p> <p>Of course, all university courses will have some international dimension to their intake. But the barriers of increasingly restrictive visa regulations and high cost mean that, in reality, physically attending a course in the UK is becoming increasingly difficult for many overseas students. Academic discourse will suffer if we can't find alternative models, such as distance learning, for bringing students together.</p> <p>Without a doubt there are features of attending university that distance learning courses will never be able to emulate. I've spoken to students on residential degrees at the Centre for Alternative Technology who say they learn as much from chatting to lecturers or other students in the tea breaks as they do from the lectures. Earl Wilson's quip: \"Science may never come up with a better office communication system than the coffee break\", rings true. Still, there are also unique benefits to joining the online classroom that can never be found in a traditional university course.</p> <p>If the benefits of higher education rest on the personal connections that students aspire to make, then we must ask what experiences are of value \u2013 if students just want to meet other people their own age to go out drinking with on a Friday night then sure, that is not what a distance learning course offers. If, however, students are looking to be part of seminars with people with a genuine plethora of life experiences, this is the extra element that a distance learning course can offer.</p> <p>Distance learning doesn't create distances between people, it bridges the distances that already exist and connects diverse people. And the tools are improving to help universities do this better. So rather than simply acknowledge that distance learning exists in a universe far removed from the traditional university campus, it might be time to get to know this 'distant cousin' and learn what it has to add to the strength, and diversity, of UK HE.</p> <p><em>Kit Jones is media officer at the </em><a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Centre for Alternative Technology</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A single European rail network with genuinely open competition and common standards is urgently needed to let trains relieve congested roads, according to EU transport commissioner Siim Kallas. He has vowed to push ahead with reforms requiring national rail networks to open up, which could lead to direct trains from Britain to destinations across the continent.</p> <p>At the opening of Innotrans, one of Europe's largest transport conventions, in Berlin, Kallas said \u20ac20bn (\u00a316bn) of a \u20ac50bn European infrastructure fund could be made available for national transport projects to make the networks interoperable, helping stimulate growth. He proposed a single central rail agency to certify all new rolling stock built to a single standard across the continent.</p> <p>\"There must be a genuine single market,\" he said. \"Eighty per cent of people and goods are taken by Europe's roads, and they are saturated. People expect railways to provide some alternatives.\"</p> <p>The German transport minister, Peter Ramsauer, said such reform was needed but would be \"incredibly difficult\" to implement and would cost \u20ac4.5bn for the German track alone. He urged Kallas to think further, suggesting that achieving common standards should be intercontinental, with China drawing up plans for a high-speed connection from Europe across Russia to Xinjiang.</p> <p>Kallas said he believed opening up national markets along the lines of Britain's franchising model was beneficial to passengers and had provided better value for money. He said few other EU states had truly opened up their markets to competition, despite previous directives, with conditions skewed in favour of domestic operators, particularly where train companies still operated the track. In Germany and France the state firms Deutsche Bahn and SNCF still dominate.</p> <p>Ramsauer said he would welcome competition, but accused the French of dragging their feet. \"If we want to travel by ICE (the German fast train) from Frankfurt to London, we need France to open up and so we absolutely have to do the same in Germany,\" he said.</p> <p>However, the minister said he did not believe that Britain's experience had provided a good model for regulation of the network. \"In Britain, they took it to excess and failed. We will not make that mistake. We will keep a government role.\"</p> <p>The Deutsche Bahn chairman, R\u00fcdiger Grube, welcomed the idea of more competition \u2013 \"so we can show how good we are,\" he said.</p> <p>The convention in Berlin is expected to pull in 100,000 trade visitors from around the world, with 115 new trains on display on tracks outside 26 large conference halls filled with global exhibitors ranging from Bombardier and Siemens to small suppliers of parts. Network Rail also has a presence here as its new, deregulated private consulting arm touts for business abroad. <strong>Gwyn Topham Berlin</strong></p>",

  "<p>Here's an illustrative tale of how science is used and abused in government policy making. In some circumstances, as with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/16/badger-cull-government-go-ahead?intcmp=239\">imminent badger cull</a>, you can take scientific evidence and extrapolate it to breaking point in order to justify the decision you have already taken.</p> <p>Today, on the issue of bees and pesticides, we see the opposite. Despite serious evidence of great harm being caused to bees by sub-lethal doses of neonicitinoid pesticides - published in the world's most prestigious journals - the government has decided that no changes to regulation whatsoever are required, because the case has not been proven beyond all doubt.</p> <p>So extrapolation is fine if you like where it takes you, but abhorrent if you don't. Evidence-based policy making remains as dreamy a concept as ever, it seems, even with something as critical as keeping the nation's pollinators in good health and our food supply secure.</p> <p>The bee fiasco began in March with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/29/crop-pesticides-honeybee-decline\">publication of two studies in Science</a>. The first found that bees consuming one pesticide suffered an 85% loss in the number of queens their nests produced, while the second showed a doubling in \"disappeared\" bees, those that failed to return from food foraging trips. The work was the first to be carried out in realistic, open-air conditions and used levels of neonicotinoids found in fields.</p> <p>Professor Micka\u00ebl Henry, at INRA in Avignon, France, who led the \"disappeared\" bees study was under no illusion about the implications of his findings: \"Under the effects we saw from the pesticides, the population size would decline disastrously, and make them even more sensitive to parasites or a lack of food.\" He said current regulation was inadequate.</p> <p>These high profile studies - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120405224653.htm\">and others</a> - prompted the UK's environment ministry (Defra) to investigate. \"It is appropriate to update the process for assessing the risks of pesticides to bees in the light of scientific developments \u2013 including the latest research,\" it stated. </p> <p>Now, six months on, it has <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/chemicals/pesticides/insecticides-bees/\">delivered its verdict</a>: \"The recent studies do not justify changing existing regulation.\" How can this be? Defra states:</p> <blockquote> <p>The studies were interesting but they either used neonicotinoids at a higher level than is currently permitted, or the studies weren't carried out under field conditions. The studies did not show that currently permitted uses of neonicotinoids have serious implications for the health of bee populations.</p> </blockquote> <p>The authors of the studies dispute the suggestion that both the doses and conditions were not realistic. It seems to me that Defra are refusing to be convinced by any scientific study, because the very act of studying it means it is not \"field conditions\". Do you see the paradox?</p> <p>Be careful to also note Defra's use of the word \"permitted\", which echoes the get-out used by pesticide manufacturers, but ignores the fact that farmers have and will exceed allowed doses, either by accident or design.</p> <p>Another question: why have <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/intheworks/ccd-european-ban.html\">France and Italy</a> been persuaded that the evidence is sufficient to impose a suspension in the use of some of these pesticides, but not the UK?</p> <p>Lastly, Defra states:</p> <blockquote> <p>Regulation needs to be based on all the science. Existing field studies on neonicotinoids found there weren't any significant differences between hives exposed to treated crops and hives exposed to untreated crops.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Prof David Goulson, at the University of Stirling and leader of the other study in Science, told me previously: \"If they have done these studies, where are they? They are not in the public domain and therefore cannot be scrutinised. That raises the question of just how good they are.\"</p> <p>There is one glimmer of hope in the Defra document, which was very quietly slipped out: </p> <blockquote> <p>The government has already put new research in place to explore further the impacts of neonicotinoids on bumble bees in field conditions and to understand what levels of pesticide residues and disease in honey bees are normal. This work is due to finish in spring 2013.</p> </blockquote> <p>Defra also states: \"We are prepared to take whatever action the evidence shows to be necessary.\" It seems clear to me that sufficient evidence already exists to require action, but we can only hope the new work ends Defra's stalling.</p> <p>Paul de Zylva, Friends of the Earth nature campaigner, sums it up well: \"The government's failure to act on neonicotinoid pesticides is astonishing \u2013 there is still a massive question mark over the impact of these chemicals in declining bee populations. Pesticide company profits must not be put ahead of bees well-being.\"</p> <p><strong>Update 1015, 19 September:</strong> Prof Goulson has sent me this response, which speaks for itself:</p> <blockquote> <p>Few experiments are perfect. In this situation, the perfect experiment would be to find and follow the fates of hundreds of natural bumblebee nests in landscapes with crops treated with neonicotinoids, and hundreds of control nests in an identical landscape without neonicotinoids. The latter does not exist, since these compounds are extremely widely used. That is why we dosed our bees in the lab, before putting them in the field. </p> <p>I still think that ours is the closest anyone has come to doing a well replicated, controlled experiment to look at the effects of neonicotinoids on bumblebee nests in something approaching a natural setting. If our results are anywhere close to the truth, then they are pretty alarming. </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Five of the six biggest countries in the EU, excluding Britain, have called for a radical overhaul of European foreign and defence policies to create a powerful new pan-European foreign ministry, majority voting on common foreign policies to bypass a British veto, a possible European army, and a single market for EU defence industries.</p> <p>The German-led push, supported by 11 of 27 EU countries, embraces recent calls in Berlin and Brussels for a directly elected European president, sweeping new powers for the European parliament, and further splitting of the EU by creating a new parliamentary sub-chamber for the 17 countries of the eurozone.</p> <p>While the call for a European army was not supported by all 11, the document also calls for a new European police organisation to guard the union's external borders and for a single European visa.</p> <p>Nine months of brainstorming over the future of Europe by the foreign ministers of the 11 countries, launched by Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, has resulted in a 12-page document crammed with policy recommendations. It will prove hugely contentious and, if implemented, will increase the pressure on Britain to quit the EU.</p> <p>\"To make the EU into a real actor on the global scene we believe that we should in the long term introduce more majority decisions in the common foreign and security policy sphere, or at least prevent one single member state from being able to obstruct initiatives,\" the document said.</p> <p>\"Aim for a European defence policy with joint efforts regarding the defence industry (eg the creation of a single market for armament projects); for some members of the group this could eventually involve a European army.\"</p> <p>The backers include Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland, five of the six biggest EU countries omitting Britain. The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Portugal and Luxembourg also signed up.</p> <p>The recommendations include more incendiary steps, including a proposal to re-open and change European treaties by majority voting because getting consensus in a union of 27 or 28 has become too slow, acrimonious and unwieldy.</p> <p>Apart from stiff resistance from Britain, which would veto a European army and refuse to take part in foreign policies with which it disagreed, the proposals are likely to prompt a turf war in the European commission because they would strip several departments of powers and resources, concentrating them in the EU's relatively new diplomatic service headed by Catherine Ashton, a Briton.</p> <p>The document demanded a \"substantial revision\" of the powers of the European External Action Service by next year, streamlining it and giving it authority over development, energy, trade and enlargement currently vested in other parts of the commission. If realised, the changes would produce a European foreign ministry with much more muscle.</p>",

  "<p>Lawyers acting for a severely disabled prisoner who was rushed from jail to a life-support machine in hospital, are asking the high court to rule he should not be sent back to a prison that cannot meet his medical needs.</p> <p>Daniel Roque Hall has Friedreich's ataxia, a degenerative disease, that affects co-ordination of the whole body. It causes a heart defect which requires constant monitoring, and diabetes.</p> <p>Hall, 30, is a wheelchair user with a life expectancy of 35 to 40 years. In July, he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, after pleading guilty to importing two and a half kilos of cocaine into Heathrow. The drugs, hidden in his wheelchair, had been smuggled in from Peru where Hall and a&#xa0;carer had been on holiday.</p> <p>The judge accepted that Hall had been \"groomed and manipulated\" by drug dealers and, aware of his condition, sought assurances from the prison service that Hall's complex medical needs would be met in custody. The governor of Wormwood Scrubs, in west London, assured the judge that the prison would provide the round the clock care and monitoring that Hall requires, as well as the complex stretching programme needed to keep him stable. This was despite prison inspectors last year finding \"little progress in support for men with disabilities\" and expressing particular concern over the \"lack of systematic identification and help for prisoners with disabilities\" at the prison. They described the inpatient unit (where Hall was held) as \"an unsuitable environment for those recovering from physical illness\".</p> <p>According to Hall's family and lawyers, within hours of admittance to the prison he suffered a spasm and fell from an examination couch, sustaining a head wound. He was taken in handcuffs to a care home for elderly people. Staff there were not given full details of his medical requirements, which included Warfarin, prescribed to thin his blood.</p> <p>Back in Wormwood Scrubs, Hall suffered further spasms and says he was constantly denied his full medication. The two constant carers he needs, in case of spasms, were not supplied, nor were the stretching exercises.</p> <p>Hall's condition deteriorated rapidly and in the early hours of 23 August he was rushed to University College Hospital, London, and placed on a life support machine. A consultant at the hospital said Hall's heart had been \"stunned\" by his treatment at the prison. His GP says his life will be threatened if he is sent back to prison.</p> <p>No longer on a life support machine, Hall remains in hospital while his lawyers seek a judicial review of his treatment, and campaigners, including the poet Benjamin Zephaniah and MP John McDonnell, have signed an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/09/prison-no-place-disable-man\" title=\"\">open letter</a> printed in the Guardian calling for him to complete his sentence at home.</p> <p>Hall's claims, though shocking, are not unique. Despite the Paralympics helping to challenge myths and raise awareness about disability, the neglect of disabled people in prison is well documented.</p> <p>Estimates of the number of disabled prisoners vary. The prison service database records a figure of 5% (around 4,500 prisoners), but inspectorate surveys record 19% (around 16,000). A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/research-and-analysis/moj-research/estimating-prevalence-disability-amongst-prisoners.pdf\" title=\"\">survey</a> earlier this year, found 18% of prisoners interviewed had a physical disability of some kind. The dramatic rise in the number of older prisoners in the system over the last decade is likely to further increase the disabled prisoner population.</p> <p>Yet a joint <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/organisations-we-regulate/special-reviews-and-inspection-programmes/offender-care/commissioning-offe\" title=\"\">report </a>by the Inspectorate of Prisons and Care Quality Commission in 2010 found an ageing prison population, where \"disabilities were not being adequately dealt with and many prisons not having a disability policy\". It also reported that it was \"rare to find any form of needs analysis or consultation with prisoners to help establishments carry out their duties under the Disability Discrimination Act\".</p> <p>In 2006, the NHS took over responsibility for healthcare in prisons from the prison medical service. Governors were mandated to appoint a disability liaison officer (DLO) whose job it is to assess the prisoner's needs and link him or her to the appropriate channels in the prison, but last year the rules changed and it is now up to governors to decide whether a DLO is required, or if existing managers and staff can do the job. The MoJ says it cannot say how many prisons have DLOs.</p> <p>Many DLOs told former chief inspector of prisons Anne Owers that they did not have enough time, support or training to do their jobs. She also noted in her 2010 annual report that prisoners with mobility difficulties suffered considerable disadvantage because of the refusal by ordinary prison staff to push wheelchairs without training. \"While some prisons had clearly identified schemes for assisting disabled prisoners in wheelchairs, some staff still declined to do so,\" says the report.</p> <p>None of this comes as a surprise to the Prisoners' Advice Service (PAS), a charity that takes up prisoners' complaints about their treatment inside prison. It says it is inundated with calls from disabled prisoners claiming they are not receiving appropriate treatment. Some case notes make harrowing reading: cells occupied by disabled prisoners with no wall bars and inmates having to drag themselves across the floor and falling frequently; PAS \"having to make a fuss\" to get inmates supplied with basic needs, such as walking sticks, which are then taken away when a prisoner moves prison; and an incontinent prisoner with mental health problems sleeping naked on a urine-soaked mattress.</p> <p>PAS caseworker Nicola Gregory recalls visits to jails to meet disabled prisoners. On one occasion, a prisoner failed to turn up and an officer pointed to his lack of interest. However, the meeting room was on the fourth landing, accessible only up narrow spiral stairs, which seemed to escape the officer's notice. PAS has advised a wheelchair user who lost privileges for not returning a library book to the prison library, which was on an inaccessible third-floor landing.</p> <p>Disabled prisoners reported similar experiences of neglect to the Prison Reform Trust (PRT). In a 2010 <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/doing%20time%20good%20practice%20with%20older%20peop,.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> on older people in prison, one inmate said he could not get his wheelchair into his cell and had to \"try to get from the entrance to my bed\"; he had been told officers are not allowed to push him.</p> <p>Another prisoner who uses two walking sticks says he couldn't have a shower because \"I might slip and there is nothing to hold on to, or chairs to sit on\". He adds: \"Usually a friend helps me because there seems to be no officer or nurse willing to&#xa0;help.\"</p> <p>The PRT found few jails had a disability policy, or established ways to help staff identify the needs of disabled people, and that health and social care provision is patchy and often dependent on an individual officer or governor's motivation.</p> <p>PRT director, Juliet Lyon, says the justice system is putting punishment before humanity and common sense. \"Locking up severely disabled men and women without proper treatment and care puts lives at risk. At best, imprisonment for the disabled amounts to a double punishment.\"</p> <p>On 8 September, campaigners calling for justice for Hall held a protest outside Wormwood Scrubs. They fear sending him back to prison would be as good as imposing a death sentence on him and want him to be allowed to serve his sentence at home. \"He was given a three-year sentence, not a death sentence,\" say the campaign posters.</p> <p>The MoJ says: \"The claimant's allegations are currently before the courts and will be resolved in that forum.\" As for the level of care provided to disabled prisoners, it says: \"We have a duty of care to those sentenced to custody by the courts. As part of that duty of care, we ensure that prisoners have access to the same level of NHS services as those in the community.\"</p>",
  "<p>Never let it be said that George Entwistle is not the creative type \u2013 the new BBC director general used the word creative (or its close variants) 34 times <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2012/george-entwistle-to-staff.html\" title=\"\">in his opening address to staff</a>.</p> <p>He's also keen on quality (16 mentions in Tuesday's speech), change (15) and of course the Olympics, which narrowly missed out on a podium place, flagged up a mere nine times (a photo finish with love).</p> <p>The Queen's diamond jubilee, in which Entwistle was closely involved, and the corporation's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/19/bbc-diamond-jubilee-coverage-mps-mark-thompson\" title=\"\">much-criticised coverage of the pageant along the Thames</a> unaccountably failed to make the cut \u2013 although he does hold up his hand on this in a Radio Times interview also published on Tuesday.</p> <p>Maybe the unfortunate Fearn Cotton interlude (royal-themed sick bags and all) was what Entwistle had in mind when he said: \"I don't mean we can't afford for anything ever to go wrong. We just won't be trying hard enough if nothing goes wrong.</p> <p>\"In my time at the BBC, I worry that I've seen the quality of our own critical conversations decline. I've seen a culture emerge where only the experts are encouraged to say what they think. This isn't healthy,\" he added.</p> <p>\"I think it's vital we re-establish, in private, the practice of robust self-criticism \u2013&#xa0;that we become more demanding of ourselves in order to make our output better still.</p> <p>\"I like working in an environment of creative confidence and respect \u2013 where nothing is unsayable, so long as you find the right way to say it.\"</p> <p>A lot of Entwistle's speech, and his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/18/bbc-george-entwistle-women-sport\" title=\"\">interview in the Radio Times</a>, emphasised the human side of the new boss.</p> <p>\"I was an 'internal' candidate for DG \u2013&#xa0;and that's a matter of some pride to me,\" he told staff. \"Almost 23 years ago to the day, I sat in the old reception of this wonderful building in my new suit, about to start as a broadcast journalism trainee. I had to pinch myself to believe I had the right even to walk through the door.\" So, he's just like you and me.</p> <p>BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said the new DG had to make the BBC 10 or 20% better, but Entwistle went further: \"The challenge I face now is to justify the faith placed in me to lead this amazing organisation by making us as good as we were during the Olympics, all the time.\" But without the 24 extra channels, presumably.</p> <p>Of the BBC's own internal problems, Entwistle listed \"the silos, internal competition, the duplication, the jockeying for position. And at its worst, the leaking, the briefing against other people and other departments \u2013&#xa0;and the sheer waste of energy and money that results.\"</p> <p>And that was just the race to be DG.</p> <p>His list of his favourite shows will have had programme-makers scanning the speech (and the RT) to find their own. Sherlock, Call the Midwife, Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, the Proms, Shakespeare on BBC2, Parade's End ... so far, so predictable.</p> <p>BBC1's Luther possibly less so (more of an acquired taste that one) and Entwistle loves The Great British Bake Off. Like, he really loves it.</p> <p>\"I absolutely adore Bake Off. I watched every episode last time and am already sucked into the new series,\" he told the Radio Times. BBC2 controller Janice Hadlow will be delighted \u2013 except when it switches, like MasterChef, to BBC1.</p> <p>Entwistle was also keen to big up the BBC's partnerships \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/01/bbc-arts-council-digital-space\" title=\"\">The Space, its digital tie-up with the Arts Council</a> \u2013 and his quest for what he called \"genuinely new forms of digital content\" and \"living output\".</p> <p>\"Even in our near-miraculous coverage of the Olympics, I would say that we've taken \u2013&#xa0;joyously \u2013 our capacity to present and distribute existing forms of content to their natural limits rather than innovate to discover genuinely new forms of content.</p> <p>\"As we increasingly make use of a distribution model \u2013 the internet \u2013 principally characterised by its return path, its capacity for interaction, its hunger for more and more information about the habits and preferences of individual users, then we need to be ready to create content which exploits this new environment \u2013 content which shifts the height of our ambition from live output to living output.\"</p> <p>Entwistle's new-look BBC will be genre-based, rather than platform (vision v audio and music v future), as it is now.</p> <p>So after <a href=\"http://media.theguardian.com/broadcast/image/0,,1824189,00.html\" title=\"\">Greg Dyke's petals</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/19/future.jpg\" title=\"\">Mark Thompson's hub and spokes</a> we have, well, what exactly?</p> <p>All he needs now is a buzzphrase (Mark Thompson promised to deliver Creative Future six years ago, a forerunner of Delivering Quality First). What's Entwistle going to deliver? We will find out in the autumn.</p> <p>\"Starting today, I intend to change the way we're led to put the emphasis where it belongs,\" said Entwistle. \"On creative people doing creative things; on our audiences and the exceptional quality of work they deserve.\"</p> <p>To which, to borrow a phrase from Elisabeth Murdoch's MacTaggart lecture, itself a nod to one of the BBC's biggest successes of late: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/23/elisabeth-murdoch-mactaggart-lecture\" title=\"\">\"No shit, Sherlock.\"</a></p>",
  "<p>One of the most provocative statements made at Electronics Goes Green 2012 came from a manufacturer representative. His claim: a sustainable electronics industry will arise from bringing comfort that appeals to the average Joe or Jane rather than playing to the eco-aware. It turns upside down the conventional wisdom that cultivating green scenesters will create a critical mass of informed and conscious customers who value sustainability criteria more than a bargain.</p> <p>He countered that the reality is somewhat more pedestrian. The bottom line for most of us boils down functional products at an affordable price. In a world that seems to wedge mounting reams of information into narrowing attention spans, comfort and ease-of-everything are companion incentives to dispense with intellect. We're human, after all.</p> <p>In this spirit, I have identified three emerging themes that put self-interest to work, rather than enforcing high-minded altruism.</p> <p>Leasing technology is nothing new, but its appeal is growing. Indeed, an experimental programme in the UK showed a customer <a href=\"http://www.mobiledia.com/news/126393.html\" title=\"\">preference for leasing mobile phones</a>, citing the appeal of flexibility and increased choice. Will your next tech acquisition be leased? The case is building on many fronts that you may want it that way, and so might makers and vendors.</p> <p>Ownership has lost a bit of lustre in recent years \u2013 upside-down mortgages and around-the-clock shifts for repo men are just the most ominous signs. The prosaic truth of ownership is that it has more responsibility.</p> <p>More responsibility means less ease and comfort. What to do with that old smartphone now that the new one is almost here? More than likely, you will set it on the shelf as it collects dust. Maybe someday it will make its way to recycling. And what a bother that can seem! So, your former trusty sidekick sits in a kind of purgatory, waiting for you to do the right thing.</p> <p>With leasing, it's much easier being green for all considered. For the purchaser, the benefit of a definite end state and a due date. In a year or two, you either love the thing so much that you'll pay to keep it, or you trade it in. For the retailer, what a pleasant opportunity to make your acquaintance again, dear loyal customer. May we introduce you to our newest products? For makers, a high level of guaranteed recycling of whole devices ready for another purpose. The incentive to design for reuse becomes that much stronger and more direct when businesses can calculate expected returns. With the cost of digging new materials from the ground a perpetually dirty and expensive business, costs to consumer and business alike should almost certainly decrease, making ownership less of a default choice.</p> <p>For smaller products where leasing proves impractical, a non-refundable eco fee (a term used widely in Canada) is a method of placing a set cost on products grouped into categories to cover their recycling costs. This differs from refundable bottle deposits on glass and plastic, resources more easily reused. While the upfront charge alone does not ensure recycling, British Columbia's private product stewardship organisations (funded by the eco fee) set a notable example by using marketing and awareness campaigns to drive home the premise that purchases have <a href=\"http://www.return-it.ca/electronics/recycling/\" title=\"\">meaning beyond the store walls</a>.</p> <p>Will it turn us all into lifecycle thinkers? Perhaps not right away, but it sends visible economic and behavioural signals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://center.sustainability.duke.edu/sites/default/files/documents/ecolabelsreport.pdf\" title=\"\">Ecolabels</a> may also streamline the purchase decision for time-pressed household customers. However, the front lines for eco label schemes are with procurement professionals. Defining what traits should earn a product consideration at the enterprise scale eventually work their way into the home. <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/environment/letter-to-customers/\" title=\"\">Apple's departure from electronics</a> registry EPEAT, followed by a hasty retreat, serves notice that eco labels can be a powerful nexus of the marketing, public relations and science behind industry.</p> <p>Apple opened itself not only to losing sales based on government purchasing guidelines, but also by appearing to be above seeking consensus on product sustainability. From a PR perspective, it may well become a case study in what not to do.</p> <p>The importance of emerging customer-facing trends such as leasing, eco fees and more authoritative labelling schemes raise the bar in much the same way our industry soothsayer foretold in Berlin. Customer commitment and awareness will continue to be a source of pride, but may no longer be required to move the needle on sustainability. For the rest of us, making it easy to do the right thing is exactly what we need.</p> <p><em>Jeremy Jones is a planning analyst based in Minnesota, where he evaluates program and policy for </em><a href=\"http://hennepin.us/portal/site/HennepinUS/menuitem.b1ab75471750e40fa01dfb47ccf06498/?vgnextoid=080c2d651fbb4210VgnVCM10000049114689RCRD\" title=\"\"><em>Hennepin County Environmental Services</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><strong>Age:</strong> 56.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Strict but jolly dad.</p> <p><strong>Who is he?</strong> He's the new secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs.</p> <p><strong>Well, he looks like a nice man.</strong> Doesn't he just?</p> <p><strong>Is he?</strong> That's debatable.</p> <p><strong>Then let's debate. Arguments for the \"nice guy\" theory?</strong> In his own words, from <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/14/09/2012/135217/In-the-hot-seat-Owen-Paterson.htm\" title=\"\">an interview with&#xa0;Farmers Weekly</a>: \"I can guarantee to you&#xa0;that&#xa0;I am the only MP who has had two pet&#xa0;badgers.\"</p> <p><strong>Adorable. Can you have pet badgers?</strong> You can if you're Owen Paterson. He called them Bessie and Baz. One was an orphan, and both eventually returned to the wild to start families.</p> <p><strong>Aww. My heart just melted. He sounds like the loveliest man imaginable.</strong> Aye, but here's the rub: his first major act in his new post will be overseeing a controversial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jul/19/badger-cull-bovine-tb-spelman\" title=\"\">four-year cull of around 50,000 badgers</a>.</p> <p><strong>Sorry, what?</strong> He's going to kill tens of thousands of badgers.</p> <p><strong>That doesn't sound very nice at all.</strong> It's&#xa0;really&#xa0;not.&#xa0;In fact, protesters are up in arms.&#xa0;The Coalition of&#xa0;Badger Action Groups is&#xa0;planning a campaign of direct action against&#xa0;the culls, and a number of arrests are&#xa0;expected.</p> <p><strong>So why is he doing it?</strong> Because he is convinced that a badger cull is necessary to help curb the spread of bovine TB among cattle. He also thinks it's much better for the badgers.</p> <p><strong>And is it either? </strong>Well, it's definitely not much fun&#xa0;for the badgers who get shot, and scientists aren't so sure about the effects on cattle either. Professor Lord John Krebs, who ran the government's previous badger culling trial, has described culls as an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\">\"ineffective\" method of reducing TB,</a> capable of dealing with at most a&#xa0;mere 16% of the problem.</p> <p><strong>But Paterson's doing it anyway?</strong> Yep.</p> <p><strong>Sounds like a bad guy.</strong> Perhaps. Or perhaps it's a&#xa0;little more psychologically complex. As <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bill-oddie-attacks-owen-patersons-1328986\" title=\"\">Bill Oddie put it</a>: \"Apparently, when he was a little boy he had two badgers as pets. Perhaps they got more attention than he did? Maybe the cull is some kind of vendetta.\"</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"Joined parliament in 1992 \u2026\"</p> <p><strong>Don't say:</strong> \"\u2026 succeeded in life-long plan for badger genocide in 2012.\"</p>",
  "<p>Labour knows that tuberculosis in cattle is a major animal health problem. We understand the desperation of farmers affected by this devastating disease. That is why, in government, we set up the randomised badger culling trial (RBCT). It cost \u00a350m and remains the most extensive scientific study, over a 10-year period, on whether culling badgers reduces bovine TB.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bovinetb.info/docs/The%20Duration%20of%20the%20Effects%20of%20Repeated%20Widespread%20Badger%20Culling.pdf\" title=\"\">study concluded</a> that \"the reductions in cattle TB incidence achieved by repeated badger culling were not sustained in the long term after culling ended and did not offset the financial costs of culling. These results \u2026 suggest that badger culling is unlikely to contribute effectively to the control of cattle TB in Britain.\"</p> <p>Labour's approach in government was led by that science. We continue to be led by it. Sadly, the coalition government's approach to bovine TB has been driven by short-term political calculation. Their \"big society badger cull\", which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">issued the first licence on Monday</a>, carries some very real risks and will be bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.</p> <p>First and foremost, the cull could make TB worse. Localised culling significantly increases the TB risk in neighbouring herds due to a \"peturbation\" effect, when traumatised badgers move out of cull areas and spread the disease, particularly in the first two years. The new cull will use \"hard boundaries\", such as roads and rivers that badgers find hard to cross, but the RBCT found that the perturbation effect still occurred when hard boundaries were in place.</p> <p>Furthermore, the RBCT used cage trapping and shooting, but the new cull will use free shooting as it is cheaper. Free shooting has therefore never been tested and is not supported by the science. <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/tb-control-measures/100915-tb-control-measures-annexe.pdf\" title=\"\">The environment department's own risk assessment</a> to ministers raises concerns about the impact of free shooting: \"If a different culling strategy to that conducted in the RBCT is used the effect on TB incidence and the degree of the resulting perturbation is uncertain.\"</p> <p>The panel of scientists who met at the department on 4 April 2011 stated that vaccination is unlikely to be effective at reducing the impact of peturbation. The government places great emphasis on that <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\" title=\"\">scientific meeting at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the two-page document</a> it yielded, yet it concluded: \"If culling is not conducted in a co-ordinated, sustained and simultaneous manner according to minimum criteria, then this could result in a smaller benefit or even a detrimental effect on confirmed cattle TB incidence.\"</p> <p>Worryingly, there is no mechanism in place to measure whether the culling makes things worse or better. The \"pilot scheme\" in Gloucestershire which got the go-ahead on Monday is in no sense a scientific test of policy. The panel set up to oversee its effectiveness will have a narrow remit: is free shooting humane and can the farmers deliver it? They will not look at the reduction in the number of cattle affected by TB to see if culling saves public money.</p> <p>The panel will assess whether farmers can shoot more than 70% - but less than 100% - of badgers in an area. But as the government hasn't counted the badgers in cull areas, they will not know what proportion of the population has been killed. If 1,000 badgers are killed, we won't know whether that is part of a population of 1,001 or 2,000. Lord Krebs, the Oxford scientist who instigated Labour's RBCT, has described the government's cull as \"a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19623931\" title=\"\">crazy scheme</a>\". These pilot culls are a shot in the dark, in every sense of the word.</p> <p>Another crazy aspect of the culls is that costs will exceed the benefits. <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovine-tb-impact-assessment.pdf\" title=\"\">Defra's impact assessment</a> states: \"For farmers in cull areas, monetised costs exceed expected monetised benefits.\" So the costs to farmers will exceed the benefits. Hardly a compelling case to sign up for the cull.</p> <p>Taxpayers will still pay for TB testing, monitoring, issuing licences and judging the effectiveness of the cull. In addition, the costs of providing armed police to manage any public protest at cull sites was not included in the government's cost-benefit analysis produced in 2011. In a written answer to parliament, the government estimated it will <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120220/text/120220w0001.htm\" title=\"\">cost taxpayers \u00a3500,000 per cull area</a> per year to police. Police will also bear the costs of licensing firearms.</p> <p>And there are a series of further risks. Will the cull wipe out whole badger populations, putting us in breach of the Bern Convention on wildlife protection; will farmers actually be able to deliver the long, hard cull the policy prescribes?</p> <p>The government is under siege from scientists who rightly object to ministers dressing up the cull as being \"science-led\". The reality could not be further from the truth. Bovine TB is a terrible disease that needs to be controlled. This cull is not the way to do it.</p> <p>\u2022 Mary Creagh is Labour's shadow environment secretary</p>",
  "<p>John Whitelegg's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2012/sep/04/wellbeing-quality-of-life-european-british-cities?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">recent blog</a> on this network considered one of local government's biggest blindspots: transport.</p> <p>Transport requires long-term strategic thinking and consideration of how decisions impact the communities they affect. This is a key element of the success of places such as Freiburg \u2013 a long-term commitment to tackle issues and create a quality urban environment.</p> <p>Yet there is a constant frustration at the continued dissonance between long-term planning, essential for creating quality spaces and improve communities, and short-term issues and delivery. Transport is too often seen as a short term problem because that is how it is often experienced by many.</p> <p>Congestion, safety, buses not turning up \u2013 all seen as short term issues that can be fixed quickly. But taking a short-term view to problems and solutions collectively leads to the major transport-related issues we are seeing in our towns and cities today.</p> <p>There is the funding issue too. As annual budget discussions start, savings for transport inevitably need to be found. Reduce a bus service here, reduce the scope of public realm improvement there, stretch maintenance further. These things keep us within budget, but over time the impacts build up, resulting in lower quality public realm, increased maintenance costs, and declining bus use among residents.</p> <p>Thinking longer term and much broader than our specific remits is also a professional issue. As we deliver works and policy, we need to ask how what we are doing contributes to better cities and better communities. This means ensuring policy objectives focused on communities are the foundation of our transport plans and schemes, not just transport-related ones. Wider issues, such as public health, climate change, and community impacts need to be considered much more.</p> <p>Local government has a central role in improving lives and communities through its physical environment and services, and things are getting better. Our strategies are focusing on the relationship between transport and community much more.</p> <p>Numerous public realm improvements like new road in Brighton are leading to higher quality, desirable public spaces benefitting everyone. What's more, as this becomes socially desirable, political support and funding follows.</p> <p>Short term issues won't go away. But transport planners and engineers are making great strides to improve the communities they serve by taking a longer-term, more holistic view. Progress is slow, but one day our transformation from international laggard to top performer will be complete.</p> <p><em>James Gleave is senior strategic transport officer working for an English local authority</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest vacancies in your area</strong></p>",
  "<p>A man with a sack slung over his shoulder trudges up a mountain of rotting rubbish, where Marabou storks perch like mournful sentinels. In the valley below, a woman pulls a jacket from the rubbish and holds it up, appraising it with a critical eye.</p> <p>At Nairobi's Dandora rubbish dump, the working day is in full swing. Men and women pick through a newly arrived truck, looking for plastic, food, clothes, paper and bottles \u2013 anything they can sell on or take home to use.</p> <p>Robert Ondika, 27, straightens from sifting through the rubbish with an iron hook. He has been working in Dandora, one of Africa's largest rubbish dumps, for three years and earns between 50 and 500 Kenyan shillings a day (between $0.60 and $6). \"We come here to earn our daily bread,\" he says in Kiswahili. \"Here, we touch different things, we could step on something sharp. It is only God who is helping us here.\"</p> <p>For these foot soldiers in Nairobi's unregulated rubbish business, the work is perilous and the rewards paltry, to say nothing of the discomfort of spending the day in a smoky, stinking wasteland. But for those who live in the neighbourhoods around the dump, it offers survival.</p> <p>That is Dandora's paradox \u2013 it is source of life, but also of illness and, occasionally, death. In a <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report released on Tuesday</a>, <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\">Concern Worldwide</a>, Italian development group <a href=\"http://www.cesvi.org/\" title=\"\">Cesvi</a> and church group <a href=\"http://www.kutokanet.com/\" title=\"\">Exodus Kutoka</a> say the dump is \"one of the most flagrant violations of human rights\" in Kenya.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report</a> says the city council of Nairobi, local government departments and the <a href=\"http://www.nema.go.ke/\" title=\"\">National Environment Management Authority</a> (Nema) bear legal responsibility for the hazardous living conditions in the slums nearby.</p> <p>The dump, which lies 8km (5 miles) from the city centre, was declared full in 2001, and since then campaigners, including Concern, have sought to have it decommissioned.</p> <p>The report, <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">Trash and Tragedy: The Impact of Garbage on Human Rights in Nairobi City</a>, says the rubbish had polluted the soil, water and air, affecting more than 200,000 people, including up to 10,000 who spend the day seeking treasure from it.</p> <p>Most of them do not wear gloves or masks and many suffer from respiratory ailments, such as asthma. Other conditions that have affected workers include anaemia, kidney problems, cancer and frequent miscarriages.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=519&amp;ArticleID=5679&amp;l=en\" title=\"\">2007 study</a> by the United Nations Environment Programme found that at least half the children in surrounding neighbourhoods had heavy metal concentrations in their blood that exceed the minimum level set by the World Health Organisation. Some estimates say around half the workers on the dump are under 18.</p> <p>A site for a new dump was earmarked near Nairobi's international airport, but that idea stalled this year when the Kenya Airports Authority said birds attracted by the rubbish could endanger planes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">Trash and Tragedy report</a> says many workers do not support plans to close the dump, where 850 tonnes of waste are deposited each day.</p> <p>Father John Webootsa, who lives nearby in Korogocho slum, understands this. \"It brings money and it brings death,\" says the Comboni priest, who has campaigned for years to have the 30-acre dump relocated. He organises vocational training and loans for scavengers to help them escape.</p> <p>\"We believe this is not a life that human beings should live,\" he says. \"Many [people] have died and others are dying. Others have been burned by the acid, the 'boilers' [contaminated industrial waste barrels] that are there. Beneath that garbage, there are boiling chemicals, and people may be burned if they step on them by accident.\"</p> <p>Korogocho, which means \"crowded shoulder to shoulder\" in Kiswahili, appears to have been forgotten by the government. On one of the narrow streets, pigs snuffle among piles of rubbish, just yards from the body of a dead dog. Webootsa says people here feel rejected by society and by the government. \"Social amenities are not provided, the government is not here. We do not have a public health facility \u2026 there are only two schools, and they were built by us,\" he says.</p> <p>But the dump is a source of wealth and power for the men at the top of an informal cartel that runs the site. With no government control, there is plenty of room for gangsters to wield their influence. Visitors must organise and pay for \"security\" to walk around the site and to take photographs.</p> <p>The report says powerful business interests have rallied communities against the decommissioning process. \"Most of the anti-decomissioning forces have deeply vested business interests that thrive in the prevailing chaos,\" it says.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report</a> argues that any solution requires a sea-change in Nairobi, a city of more than 3.5 million people where recycling is non-existent, or ad hoc. \"Residents of Nairobi must take responsibility for their waste \u2026 a key step is to demand urgent delivery of a safe and comprehensive waste management system, with a functional sanitary landfill,\" the report says.</p> <p>Concern and its co-authors urge the government to use modern technology to isolate toxic waste in Dandora, and identify a site to build a sanitary landfill.</p> <p>Webootsa stresses that any solution must take into account the thousands working as scavengers. \"They don't need the dump. They need the job,\" he says. \"They don't need the rubbish. They will be happy to have a clean environment, they will be happy to breathe clean air, and of course, there has to be a proper livelihood.\"</p>",
  "<p>The flamboyant Chinese police chief whose dash to a US consulate triggered the downfall of politician <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bo-xilai\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai</a> appears on course to escape the death penalty, after the court trying him credited him with confessing and giving important evidence against others.</p> <p>Wang Lijun received 3m yuan (nearly \u00a3300,000) or more in bribes, according to a statement released by Chengdu intermediate people's court in south-west China shortly after his trial concluded on Tuesday. He is also accused of defection, \"bending the law to selfish ends\" and abuse of power.</p> <p>The statement described how Wang had been privy to state secrets due to his position and had left his post in Chongqing while on duty and defected to a foreign consulate \u2013 the US mission in Chengdu.</p> <p>There, he told diplomats that he believed Bo's wife Gu had murdered British businessman Neil Heywood. She was handed a suspended death sentence last month. \"Wang knew perfectly well that Bogu [SIC] Kailai was under serious suspicion of intentional homicide, but he deliberately covered up for her so that Bogu Kailai would not be held legally responsible \u2026 The circumstances are especially serious,\" said the statement.</p> <p>The document, read out by spokesman Yang Yuquan, also said Wang had used surveillance technology \"against many people on multiple occasions, either without the approval of authorities or by forging approval documents\".</p> <p>But it also added that prosecutors acknowledged a string of extenuating circumstances that should result in a lighter sentence. Wang ordered his subordinates to collect and preserve evidence of the murder case, reported Gu's possible involvement to authorities, provided evidence and willingly aided the reinvestigation.</p> <p>He turned himself in, in other words, agreed to leave the US consulate, and confessed and performed \"major meritorious services\" by exposing serious offences committed by others and playing a key part in the investigation.</p> <p>While the amount of bribes Wang accepted appeared almost modest when compared with the startling sums revealed in other recent corruption cases, it might under normal circumstances be enough to warrant the death penalty because the legal threshold was low, said Joshua Rosenzweig, a Hong Kong-based expert on the Chinese criminal justice system.</p> <p>\"There are significant grounds for lenience, but we have to figure out what we mean by lenience. It's clear, I think, that he won't be put to death and quite likely, I think, that he won't be given a suspended death sentence. Could he still get a life sentence? I think there's a chance of that. Under the circumstances, that might be considered lenient,\" he added.</p> <p>Video released by China's state broadcaster showed the 52-year-old Wang looking calm and apparently well as he sat in the courtroom, wearing a white shirt and dark trousers, with a few dozen people behind him.</p> <p>He was seen reading documents and speaking briefly. The court statement described Wang as emotionally stable and in good health. The judgment will be delivered on an unspecified date, but there is little doubt of the verdict.</p> <p>Criminal cases almost always end in conviction in China and state news agency Xinhua described evidence against him as \"concrete and abundant\" when it announced his indictment.</p> <p>The case began unexpectedly on Monday, with a hearing held behind closed doors because it touched on state secrets.</p> <p>Xinhua described Tuesday's hearing as an \"open trial\", although it took place under tight security and with only carefully selected people present.</p> <p>Scores of uniformed and plainclothes officers surrounded the taped-off courthouse, with at least 10 photographing and filming journalists. Wang Yuncai \u2013 no relation of her client, and one of two defence representatives \u2013 said the former police chief's relatives had been in court. She declined to comment on whether he had made a statement.</p> <p>The court statement said Wang did not challenge the charges but his lawyer put forward mitigating circumstances. The conclusion of the trial will take China closer to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/gu-kailai-suspended-death-sentence\" title=\"\">resolving the political upheaval that resulted from Wang's decision to go to US officials</a> \u2013 particularly important given the impending transition of power to younger leaders.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether authorities will also try Bo, who has been under investigation by the party for unspecified disciplinary violations since April. Some analysts believe those at the top of the party are reluctant to do so because it would shed such an unflattering light on senior leaders and might stir up Bo's supporters. Others think that indicting Wang for offences related to his duties indicates they are preparing the way for a criminal trial of his boss.</p> <h2>Court security<br></h2> <p>The security operation mounted at Wang Lijun's trial appeared at least as intense as that deployed at Gu Kailai's in Hefei. Authorities will not have been concerned that the former police chief planned another sudden dash, like the flight that brought him to Chengdu in the first place.</p> <p>The efforts were directed at keeping people away from the courthouse, not inside it. Unlike the recently built Hefei facility, the Chengdu intermediate people's court is in a busy neighbourhood and surrounded by ordinary businesses, making it harder for officials to monitor.</p> <p>Uniformed police taped off and guarded the imposing grey stone building and scores of plainclothes officers surrounded it; mostly men, with a handful of fashionably clad young women. At least 10 unidentified individuals were taking pictures and video footage of foreign journalists and other people on the street, some while apparently pretending to be on the phone or surfing the net, and others just openly using cameras. They appeared less keen to have their own photographs taken.</p> <p>While Xinhua described the hearing as an \"open session\" and stressed that \"Wang's family and relatives, journalists, deputies to the people's congress, political advisers, as well as ordinary citizens\" heard the trial, foreign media were not allowed to register for places. It appears the state broadcaster, CCTV, and official news agency, Xinhua, were the only media inside.</p> <p>Foreign journalists were allowed to film the front of the court, but not the back entrance, where most people and vehicles arrived. A subsequent press briefing on proceedings in court was short and no questions were permitted. But its very existence was unusual, demonstrating how aware Chinese authorities are of the extraordinary global impact of a story that has shaken its domestic political world.</p>",

  "<p>Do you know what my favourite gun is at the moment? The Jakob Ornery Law. It's a pistol holding nine rounds with what looks like a bread knife soldered to the underside of its slender barrel. The name may sound a little silly, but I tell you, it's a work of art.</p> <p>This is a new one for me, as I don't usually take to pistols in shooter games. They aren't as pleasing either sonically or physically to use as assault rifles or shotguns and they usually don't cause as much damage. Not so, the Ornery Law. Pull the trigger on this baby and you're rewarded with a satisfying crack, the control pad kicks in your hands and the target in front of you takes 293 points of damage. At close range, this unassuming little handgun is capable of doling out more pain than a couple of the shotguns I have in my possession.</p> <p>Over longer range, though, it's fairly useless, which is why I have the Jakob Skookum Muckamuck sniper rife. This is a sleek, beautiful instrument of death capable of putting 245 points of damage into targets at a fair distance. Unless, of course, you score a critical hit and then you're looking at 1,345 points of damage; in most instances, the target's head simply goes away.</p> <p>Yes, it could be said that Jakob is my favourite weapons manufacturer on Pandora. Not only do their guns bring the pain, as it were, but they all have a classic, wild-west-meets-steampunk look to them. I prefer them to, say, the rockabilly blasters made by Bandit, or the hi-tech, yet soulless-looking stock of Hyperion. And don't get me started on Tediore; their guns may be effective, but their garish day-glo colours mark them out as the sort of guns you'd take to a rave. Nope, I'm a Jakob man, through and through.</p> <p>The fact that I've spent four paragraphs talking about my favourite weapons in Borderlands 2 should give you some sense of the loving care that inhabits every pixel of this title. A rudimentary appraisal of the game is that Gearbox is simply super-sizing their 2009 sleeper-hit, giving players more \u2013 well, a super-tanker-load more \u2013 of guns to shoot, enemies to kill and trinkets to pick up. There's a kernel of truth to that, sure, but the game's most immediate impact is made by Gearbox fleshing out the overall character of the universe they created in the first Borderlands.</p> <p>The world of Borderlands 2 is a place where irreverent space-western sci-fi collides with trailer-park horrorshow hostility and all of it is shot through with rambunctious playground humour. The planet of Pandora is equal parts Firefly and Mad Max, with all of the dialogue and plotting taken care of by the creators of South Park.</p> <p>Gearbox paints in broad brushstrokes, sure, but they don't rely on cardboard cut-out characters or run-of-the-mill mission structure. For example, the fact that Pandora's resident big-game hunter sports a monocle and a plummy British accent shouldn't surprise anyone, but if you could predict this character would send you on a mission that involves sifting through mounds of alien dung for voice recorders, you're a more visionary gamer than I.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396299262\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347903682472/Borderlands-2-2-008.jpg\" alt=\"Borderlands 2 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borderlands 2 Review Screenshot.jpg</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's a plot of sorts, but it's mainly used as a framework to hang a ton of gun battles and looting opportunities off. As the game begins, Pandora is in the grip of a war between an entity known at the Hyperion Corporation and a rag-tag band of prospectors. Hyperion's man on the ground is a sneering bucket of contempt and hair grease known only as Handsome Jack, who has taken it upon himself to wipe any non-Hyperion personnel \u2013 including the player \u2013 off the face of Pandora. In swift succession, the player finds themselves joining up with a rebel movement \u2013 led by the four characters from the original game \u2013 who want to stop Jack from unleashing some sort of unstoppable weapon upon the planet's inhabitants. Hilarity ensues.</p> <p>Like the first Borderlands, players have a choice of four character classes to pick from. There's Salvador, the Gunzerker, a raging slab of muscle and testosterone whose special powers is dual-wielding weapons. There's Maya, the Siren, who is able to project a forcefield around enemies and haul them out of cover. There's Axton, the Commando, who can deploy a machinegun turret with a barrel that can swivel in a 360 degree arch. Finally, there's Zero, The Number (or assassin), whose powers involve turning invisible in order to slide up close to enemies and then dismembering them with a katana.</p> <p>Essentially, Zero, Axton, Maya and Salavador are steroid-enhanced versions of the four characters (Mordecai, Roland, Lilith and Brick) from the first Borderlands, and as before they all have a set of three talent trees. Each time the player levels up, they're assigned a point to spend as they wish, and since it's fairly impossible to fill up all three talent trees before the game's level cap of 50, it pays to specialise.</p> <p>Talents start off as fairly rudimentary \u2013 more health, more shields, more gun damage and the like \u2013 but at high levels, they turn the player into a vicious two-legged wrecking ball. At high levels, for example, Salvador's dual-wielding expands to encompass any sort of weapon he can get his hands on, so if you fancy taking aim at a target with two massive rocket launchers, have at it.</p> <p>Zero has the ability to tag critical points on targets on his HUD, which makes his sniper shots and blade swipes incredibly lethal. Axton becomes able to deploy his turret on any surface \u2013 wall, roof, you name it \u2013 while Maya can turn entire gangs of enemies against each other.</p> <p>Alongside their skills, the player also has a list of Badass Challenges to complete \u2013 such as scoring headshots or blowing enemies up \u2014 which are, roughly put, Gearbox's way of encouraging players to do as much and shoot as much as humanly possible in the game. This Badassery rewards players with Badass tokens they can spend on improving abilities they'll use all the time, such as reducing gun-recoil, gun damage, health levels and shield recharge rates. The amount each Badass token improves a skill by is tiny, so players who want to beef their character up better load up on guns and bring some friends.</p> <p>Speaking of friends, like its predecessor, Borderlands 2 supports four-player co-op and the more players who join the party, the tougher Pandora's collection of robots, alien creatures and hockey-mask-wearing nutjobs become. Friends don't have to pick different classes to each other \u2013 especially if they've specialised differently \u2013 but it's arguably more fun if you do. A team of Axtons with missile-flinging turrets can do a ton of damage, but a Gunzerker's ability to flip off enemies and act as a decoy can provide the rest of his squad with a veritable turkey shoot.</p> <p>It's also worth noting that it's best to play this game only with players who you trust to work as a team, as there's no mechanic to stop greedy so-and-so's hovering up all the best loot and cash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396299263\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347948756227/Borderlands-2-004.jpg\" alt=\"Borderlands 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borderlands 2 Photograph: Ashley Rochelle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Rochelle/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, one of the main reasons to play Borderlands 2 \u2013 aside from the compulsive nature of its loot drops \u2013 is the insane arsenal available to the player. Guns here come in all shapes, sizes and colours. Some shoot electrically charged bullets. Some fire incendiary rounds or bullets filled with corrosive acid. Some transform into a grenade when you reload them. Still more come loaded with AI pacifist chips that plead with the player not to kill anyone with them.</p> <p>Each target the player shoots and each container the player opens has the potential of dropping yet another weird and whacky firearm, the stats of which they can immediately check against those of the weapon they're carrying in their hands. Since backpack space is limited, occasionally players are forced to toss out items they aren't using to make room for a shiny new toy. Pack rats, you've been warned.</p> <p>There are also a ton of mods, class augmentations, grenade mods and shields in the game. Some are fairly standard, while others are as weird as the game's weaponry. How about a shield mod that tosses out shield recharge batteries if the player takes too much damage? Or how about a grenade mod that splits grenades into bouncing bettys that produce multiple explosions? My personal favourite, for the moment at least, is a mod that spews acid from grenades that eats through flesh and metal \u2013 particularly handy against robotic or shield-carrying foes.</p> <p>If the size of the game's arsenal sounds impressive, you should get a load of its environment. To put it bluntly, Pandora feels even bigger and more varied than it did in the first Borderlands. Whether players are ploughing through icy tundra, driving across a desert, picking their way through a goop-filled cavern or blasting through a gang's blood-daubed hideout, Borderlands 2 feels consistently fresh. This is a world to lose yourself in \u2013 and thanks to the addictive quality of the game's loot-drops, it's likely many players will do just that. It's not just the size and scope of the place that is likely to seduce them, however, it's the fact that this time round, Pandora feels more like an actual place than a virtual battleground, thanks to Gearbox's attention to detail in this game.</p> <p>I mean, when was the last time you cared about the name of any gun manufacturer in any shooter you played recently? Listen, I've played the heck out of the COD: MW titles, and I've used a TAR-21 more times than I care to mention, but I couldn't tell you who manufactured it (not without looking it up, at any rate). The gun-makers in Borderlands 2 don't even exist, for goodness sake, and I'm already brand-loyal to one of them. That would be Jakob, who proffer the most stylish firearms in the galaxy. If you want to take down a Badass Spiderant Burner, be a Gentleman about it, and use Jakob ordnance. (Hey, Gearbox, you can have that one for free!)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",
  "<p>Manchester United have announced a 25.4% drop in total revenue from \u00a399.8m to \u00a374.5m in their last quarter. United's income fell by 3.3% to \u00a3320.3m for the year ending 30 June 2012. This was due to the failure of Sir Alex Ferguson's team to emerge from the group stage of last season's Champions League and a disappointing FA Cup challenge, which ended in the fourth round, and the consequent reduction in broadcast and matchday income.</p> <p>United's on-field performance also affected the recent disappointing flotation of the club in the US, with share prices below the Glazer family's $20 (\u00a312) valuation. They were sold for $14 and have continued to drop, with shares now traded for $12.</p> <p>With United also recently having to advertise to sell tickets for games the pressure is on Ferguson to ensure the club again reaches the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p> <p>United are insistent there should be no concern. \"The results are consistent with what we expected,\" a spokesman said. \"We strongly believe the outstanding results in the commercial sector demonstrate the huge potential the club has, and the financial outlook is very positive.\"</p> <p>Year-on-year commercial revenue increased by 13.7% to \u00a3117.6 million due to a raft of new global and regional sponsorship deals. Ed Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman, said: \"We are delighted to announce our first results as a NYSE [New York Stock Exchange] listed company \u2013 fiscal 2012 was the best year ever for Manchester United's commercial business.</p> <p>\"Our world-record $559m shirt sponsorship deal with Chevrolet and the Premier League's new \u00a31bn a year UK television rights deal \u2013 a 70% increase] \u2013 highlight the outstanding growth prospects for the future. We also expect a substantial increase in the value of the Premier League's international television contracts scheduled to be announced later this year. In addition, we continued to strengthen our team by signing world-class players such as Robin van Persie and Shinji Kagawa over the summer.\"</p> <p>While Van Persie and Kagawa represent a total \u00a335m investment in new players and the figures show the club's debt dropped to \u00a3436.9m from \u00a3458.9m, United is still heavily leveraged, which affects share prices.</p> <p>For the year, profits rose from \u00a313m to \u00a323.3m, though this was due to a tax credit of \u00a328m. United's financial report stated: \"Profit for the year from continuing operations for the year increased 79.2% to \u00a323.3 million primarily as a result of the increase in our tax credit.\" Without this there would have been a \u00a35m loss.</p>",

The last stop before the final climb to the summit of Mont Blanc on the main route, this 1960s building is outdated, uncomfortable and an environmental hazard. Hygiene problems recur, night temperatures are icy and the two outside toilets are inconvenient and a source of pollution, emptying waste directly on to the mountainside for the past 50 years.</p> <p>A few hundred metres away a new hut awaits mountaineers: <a href=\"http://www.orgone-design.com/blog/le-futur-refuge-du-gouter-en-2012-ecologique-et-design/\" title=\"\">a four-storey, egg-shaped structure, 16 metres high</a>, on the Ar\u00eate du Go\u00fbter. Part of it juts out from the cliff, over a 1,500-metre drop. This all-wooden structure, clad in stainless steel, was commissioned by the <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.clubalpin-idf.com/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DFrench%2BAlpine%2BClub%26hl%3Den%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QbJRUKbRHsK7hAeRn4DYCw&amp;ved=0CDkQ7gEwAg\" title=\"\">French Alpine Club</a> and designed by the Swiss architect <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.refugedugouter.fr/%3Fp%3D875&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DHerv%25C3%25A9%2BDessimoz%26hl%3Den%26prmd%3Dimvnso&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XbJRUKXrEZOKhQesvIHADA&amp;ved=0CDQQ7gEwAg\" title=\"\">Herv\u00e9 Dessimoz</a>. It aims to be exemplary in environmental terms, self-sufficient for energy and water, and able to withstand winds of up to 300kph (186mph). The hut, which took five years to design and three more to build, had been due to open on 30 August, but a technical problem in the cooling of the solar thermal system has delayed that until next year.</p> <p>Building the refuge above 3,800 metres was a technical and human challenge. Work was only possible from spring to autumn, so the job was spread over three summers, and was often interrupted by the weather. Workers were selected for their endurance and experience of working roped to structures.The site, often battered by 70kph winds, had a special 18-metre telescopic crane which could fold up in five minutes. \"Working conditions were very tough, with constant danger,\" says Thomas B\u00fcchi, who supervised the project.</p> <p>The hut was put together like a kit. The structural elements, made with spruce, larch and white fir from nearby forests, were assembled in the valley, hoisted by helicopter and mounted on the spot using a special resin adhesive, to limit the need for nuts and bolts. To tie the building to the cliff and absorb the vertical load, but also the twisting effect of the wind, struts had to be sunk 14 metres into the rock.</p> <p>One of the design challenges was to provide the hut with a self-sufficient water supply for cooking and washing. Its egg shape is part of the answer. \"The building is pointed into the prevailing wind, causing turbulence, which makes the snow slide across the outer skin and accumulate on a 60 sq metre grid. Heat from solar panels melts the snow, which collects in huge tanks,\" says Dessimoz. It can operate for 16 days without fresh snow.</p> <p>There are solar panels, generating heat and electricity on the front of the building and the cliff face. Only the kitchen will continue to use gas. If there is no sunlight, a backup generator, running on rapeseed oil, produces electricity.</p> <p>Unlike its predecessor, the new hut boasts six environmentally friendly toilets. To reduce water consumption, the design team borrowed the vacuum-suction principle used in aircraft. A tiny sewage farm will process organic waste, outputting highly compacted sludge which can, if necessary, be heliported down to the valley for final disposal. Any water released into the mountain environment will be clean. With triple glazing and dual-flow ventilation, insulated by wood-fibre panels, the temperature indoors ranges from 18C to 22C. \"What we're saying is that, if it's possible to build a self-sufficient, eco-friendly building at 3,835 metres, there's no excuse for not doing it at sea level,\" say Dessimoz and B\u00fcchi.</p> <p>The alpine club dismisses criticism that it has produced a high-altitude hotel, but the architects undoubtedly took particular care with interior design, using white fir throughout. The bunks are fitted with flaps for a modicum of privacy. The old hut will be dismantled next year, leaving only a more recent extension to accommodate groups in winter. But will this be sufficient?</p> <p>Every year about 17,000 climbers attempt to reach the summit of Europe's highest peak, taking the <a href=\"http://pistehors.com/news/ski/comments/1018-a-tunnel-for-the-gouter-couloir/\" title=\"\">Couloir du Go\u00fbter</a> route. In summer, sometimes as many as 300 climbers spend the night here, before making an early start on the final ascent. The old building was designed to sleep 100, but often lodged almost 150, with people sleeping on the tables and floor. Dozens of tents are pitched outside, and the waste they leave behind is piling up.</p> <p>The strain on the natural environment, exacerbated by global warming, is beginning to show. On 21 August the local council at Saint Gervais Les Bains warned that warm weather had increased the risk of falling rocks and advised that climbs be postponed. Local guides promptly cancelled all engagements.</p> <p>According to a study by the <a href=\"http://www.fondation-petzl.org/en\" title=\"\">Fondation Petzl</a>, published in July, most of the serious accidents on Mont Blanc occur on this route \u2013 it is known as the Couloir de la Mort (death gully). In the past 20 years, 77 fatalities have been recorded between the T\u00eate Rousse and Go\u00fbter huts, mainly when climbers were crossing the gully. The week before the council's warning, the air temperature stayed above freezing point. \"At present it's so warm, stones are falling even at night,\" said Jean-Marc Peillex, the leader of the council.</p> <p>There is nothing new about the problem. Last summer about 1,000 climbers had to dodge falling rocks as they crossed the gully, according to the mountain police. \"It is a real hazard but we cannot ban climbers from crossing the mountains. It must remain a place of freedom, but with everyone taking responsibility for their acts,\" Peillex adds.</p> <p>The fragility of the \"crust\" on <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1300220/Flood-risk-Mont-Blanc-water-pocket-discovered-glacier.html\" title=\"\">the T\u00eate Rousse glacier</a>, crossed by climbers en route to the summit, compounds the danger. \"The safety perimeter has been extended, after the collapse of part of the cavity roof a few weeks ago, but some people pay no attention,\" Peillex says. Work was due to take place this month to pump water out of the pocket which has once again formed inside the glacier. With the recent hot weather, and the associated melting, about 10,000 cubic metres of water are thought to have accumulated.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>This article originally appeared in Le Monde</p>",
  "<p>For the past few months, <a href=\"http://conservationdrones.org/\" title=\"\">drones</a> have been flying over the tropical forests of south-east Asia to map endangered species. A dozen of these unmanned aircraft, fitted with a video camera and an autopilot, have been deployed and will be joined by several more.</p> <p>The planes are designed by Lian Pin Koh, a specialist in applied ecology and conservation at the <a href=\"http://www.ethz.ch/index_EN\" title=\"\">Science and Technology University</a> in Zurich, and Serge Wich, a biologist from <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Liverpool University</a>. The project started in 2011 during a study of deforestation in Indonesia, on which Wich headed a programme to protect Sumatran orangutans. In this area, oil-palm plantations are spreading at an alarming rate, and the primates' survival is jeopardised by slash-and-burn operations that destroy their natural habitat. The <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/\" title=\"\">United Nations environment programme</a> estimates that 98% of these forests will have vanished within 10 years.</p> <p>\"Monitoring is difficult in a tropical environment because cloud cover makes it impossible to use satellite imagery. Remote-controlled model planes are affordable and seem to be a good way of speeding up our research,\" the two scientists explain. Conventional observation missions are expensive: \"$250,000 for a two-year study,\" Koh adds.</p> <p>A fully configured drone costs $2,000: $320 for a scale model manufactured in China using expanded polyolefin foam, which is sufficiently elastic to withstand shocks; slightly less for the flight control software developed in the United States; and the rest for stabilisers and batteries, imported from Europe, and, of course, the camera.</p> <p>The drones have a range of 20-25km (about 20 minutes' flight) and are GPS-guided, following a route established on computer. Newer prototypes \"will travel twice as far and photograph about 100 hectares on each mission,\" Wich and Koh explain. Partly funded by the National Geographic Foundation and the <a href=\"http://www.orangutan.com\" title=\"\">Orangutan Conservancy research centre</a>, the project has received almost $19,000 in subsidies.</p> <p>In February a drone made a successful test flight at Aras Napal in Sumatra.

  "<p>\"The novelty has worn off\" is an odd phrase, with unnecessarily limited, negative connotations. Sometimes the novelty fades and the excitement remains. Afghanistan are by far the most interesting team at the World Twenty20 which started in Sri Lanka on Tuesday; it's just that they are no longer new. They are now part of international cricket's furniture. It is not a shock they qualified. It would have been a surprise had they not done so.</p> <p>Afghanistan \u2013 who play India in Group A on Wednesday before facing England on Friday \u2013 are a team of irrepressible optimists; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/27/the-spin-afghanistan-cricket\" title=\"\">full of character, charm and innocence</a>; free of the cynicism and entitlement that pollute modern sport. They are subject to the unique goodwill, affection and gratitude that only occurs when you are exploring virgin territory on behalf of your country. Theirs is a tale the whole cricket world has embraced. The more you delve into their story, the more you fall in love with it. If you have not yet seen the life-affirming documentary <a href=\"http://www.outoftheashes.tv/\" title=\"\">Out of the Ashes</a>, your LoveFilm list is in urgent need of&#xa0;revision.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of problems in the world today, you know?\" the then national coach Taj Malik says in the documentary. \"And everywhere, everywhere, there is complex fighting. The solution of all the problems&#xa0;... is cricket.\" <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/player/318334.html\" title=\"\">Nawroz Mangal</a>, the captain, estimates the cricket-playing population of Afghanistan at more than 500,000. \"After participating in this World Cup, if we do better, I expect 30 to 40% of the population to start playing cricket.\" The swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/419873.html\" title=\"\">Mohammad Shahzad</a> says their participation \"could be a positive step towards bringing peace to the country\".</p> <p>The word \"journey\" has become a little hackneyed in the reality TV age, but Afghanistan's journey is worth revisiting. It began in refugee camps during the Soviet occupation of 1979-89, where cricket was played using shoes for stumps and balls made out of torn-up shirts. The national team became affiliated to the ICC in 2001, when they went on their first tour, a trip across the Pakistan border from Kabul to Rawalpindi. As recently as 2008 they were playing in Division Five of the ICC World Cricket League against Japan, Jersey, Singapore, Botswana and the Bahamas. That was the start of a series of qualifiers for the last 50-over World Cup which took them to Jersey, Tanzania, Argentina and finally South Africa. Their dream of World Cup qualification ended with defeat to Canada in 2009 but they received ODI status at the end of the same&#xa0;tournament.</p> <p>Afghanistan then qualified for the World T20 in 2010, where they were beaten by India and South Africa. Last month they played their first ODI against Australia and <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/engine/match/571947.html\" title=\"\">were far from embarrassed during a 66-run defeat</a>. Mohammad Nabi clubbed four sixes while the boyish No9, Gulbodin Naib \u2013 whose endearing fixation with his Popeye muscles was a recurring theme of Out of the Ashes \u2013 showed the value of that gym work by hammering three sixes in nine balls off Mitchell Johnson and James Pattinson.</p> <p>That match is one of only two ODIs against a Test-playing nation \u2013 they also lost to Pakistan by seven wickets in February \u2013 but they have an overall record of 12 wins and 11 defeats in that form of the game. In T20 internationals their record is won six and lost five, again with defeats in both their matches against a major nation. They have not played enough games to qualify for a place in the ICC T20 rankings, although their points total would put them 10th, above Ireland and Zimbabwe \u2013 and, for a few days a fortnight ago, Australia.</p> <p>Afghanistan are probably not yet ready to beat one of the big nations. That day will come, however, and a victory against England \u2013 who have lost to Associate nations in two of the past three global tournaments \u2013 should not be completely discounted. \"We have a very competitive team,\" says the ACB chief executive Hamid Shinwari, \"and I hope that they will put up a better show in this year's event.\"</p> <p>They were comfortably beaten in both matches in the Caribbean two years ago, although they left their mark. The lower order swung merrily to recover from 14 for six and 32 for eight to reach 80 against South Africa, while Hamid Hassan took three for 21 in that match and one for eight from three overs against India.</p> <p>Hassan is the best fast bowler among the Associate and Affiliate nations. Afghanistan are not yet Associate members of the ICC, and share Affiliate status with, among others, Cameroon, Luxembourg and the Isle of Man. His former coach, the Pakistan wicketkeeper Rashid Latif, says he is \"good enough to represent even a full nation in a developed team\". His strength, yorkers and ability to swing the ball both ways, prompted Clive Lloyd to say that he reminded him a little of Waqar Younis. As a child he played in secret, because his father hated cricket. Now he loves expressing his talent in public. Hassan's aggression and love of wearing bandanas \u2013 with a lick of sunblock on his cheek \u2013 have led to him being described as the \"Rambo of Afghanistan cricket\".</p> <p>He has been included in the squad despite fitness concerns. Hassan was badly injured playing for an Associate and Affiliate XI against England in Dubai in January, when he dismissed Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott during a lively spell, and has bowled only a handful of overs in the past eight months. In his absence, Dawlat Zadran has been Afghanistan's premier new-ball bowler: he was the only non-Irishman included on the five-man shortlist for Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year at last week's ICC Awards.</p> <p>Fast bowling is probably Afghanistan's strongest suit, but batting is their most eye-catching. They are not especially savvy and do not really do nurdling, instead preferring to embrace <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N8IoqILtRw\" title=\"\">an unashamed six-addiction</a>. Nabi clouted five in a 22-ball half-century during a warmup against Sri Lanka A on&#xa0;Saturday. Overall Afghanistan hit 13 sixes in their 20 overs.</p> <p>It has almost become a cliche to refer to Afghanistan's cricketers as fearless, yet that is the way they play the game. Nobody exemplifies that more than the hard-hitting opener, Karim Sadiq, who goes after bowlers from the moment the umpire calls \"play\". In the final of the World T20 qualifiers against Ireland, he pulled the first ball of the match from Warwickshire's Boyd Rankin over the&#xa0;ropes.</p> <p>When Afghanistan met Pakistan in February, Shahzad <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=pSVyQdOh7pQ\" title=\"\">reverse swept Saeed Ajmal, the world's best spinner, for an amazing six</a>. And in a warmup game ahead of the last World T20, Sadiq smashed consecutive short balls from Shoaib Akhtar to the boundary, one of them on to a roof. As Shoaib prepared to share a few four-letter insights, Sadiq got in with the pre-emptive sledge: \"This is not club cricket.\" It was international cricket, and it is where Afghanistan unquestionably belong.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/signup/2010/mar/30/1\" title=\"\"><em>\u2022 This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian's free weekly cricket email.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has a long history of exploitation of resources by foreigners due to a weak government and other problems. South Africa is totally different in its attempts to escape their apartheid history. All of these states have serious problems with inequality.</p> <p>Birrell notes the relative success stories of Ghana, Ethiopia and Mozambique. He says the west remains locked into stale narratives of Africa. His article does nothing to alleviate this misinformation. The differences within the continent require an understanding of the specific cultures, politics and historical differences for each region and nation.</p> <p>An important aspect of certain African states is the history and the continuation of exploitation of their resources. One should remember those Africans who have been assassinated or executed, probably with western complicity, for advocating the use of their resources for the benefit of their people. They include Am\u00edlcar Cabral of Guinea-Bissau, Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso; and the Congolese Patrice Lumumba. <br><strong>Don Kerr </strong><br>Collingwood, Ontario, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Reducing Kenya fatalities</strong></h2> <p>Whilst agreeing with most of Clar Ni Chonghaile's article <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/08/kenyan-dangerous-drivers-twitter-roads\" title=\"\">about Kenyan road deaths</a> (31 August), I think two key issues have been overlooked.</p> <p>First, the poor infrastructure and maintenance of the roads. Drivers have to avoid potholes and long stretches of road with little or no tarmac. Second is the over-reliance on lorries to transport goods, especially from Mombasa to Nairobi and beyond to Uganda.</p> <p>These issues need to be addressed by the government through a road repair programme and upgrading the railway system. It will be through action both by the state and individuals that the number of road accidents will be reduced.<br><strong>Graham Girvan </strong><br>Mombasa, Kenya</p> <h2><strong>Time for a 'spurn list'?</strong></h2> <p>Congratulations for publishing Desmond Tutu and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/02/desmond-tutu-tony-blair-iraq\" title=\"\">his words on the immorality of the invasion of Iraq</a> (7 September). Clearly since international law does not have provision for heads of countries to be brought to justice, then the word \"spurn\" is appropriate. The leaders of countries and former leaders of countries who have overstepped the bounds of morality should be spurned.</p> <p>Perhaps the Guardian Weekly would consider publishing the names of these people on its front page. George W Bush and Tony Blair would certainly be at the head of that list, in perpetuity. Then other names could be below Bush and Blair, changing weekly.

The degrading and frustrating aspect of this situation \u2013 at least for the more or less informed inhabitants of the supposedly democratic west \u2013 is that we know this, but are helpless in the face of the corruption Tutu clearly addresses.

I agree compulsory school uniform is ridiculous yet have rarely found others who think likewise.</p> <p>I hated it as a teenager and did my best to wear it badly. I hated it as a teacher of teenagers and annoyed some of my colleagues and \"superiors\" by refusing to question or discipline students about it. I once sat in a staff discussion for more than an hour while they argued about where students should be required to take off their non-uniform coats to reveal their uniforms. At report-writing time, the lack of individuality meant I wasn't always sure which student I was writing about. Hardly any of my colleagues agreed with me and those with children told me uniform was easier for parents, and I'd understand when I was a parent myself.</p> <p>I didn't. I have had two daughters who wear school uniform. It is expensive and only sometimes available in reasonable condition second-hand; many garments are totally impractical for the weather or the activities of the day; it is usually unflattering; and it is insulting and repressive to dictate what children and teenagers wear over and above health, safety and decency considerations.

  "<p>Days before US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos were due to launch a partnership, to promote US culture and provide English lessons to young learners around the world via 35,000 Kindle e-readers, the event was quietly cancelled.</p> <p>The proposed partnership with Amazon to develop the Kindle Mobile Learning Initiative was officially terminated on 15 August. The cancellation notice stated that the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/\" title=\"\">state department</a> \"intends to conduct additional market research and re-examine its requirements for this programme\".</p> <p>The U-turn was an embarrassment for the state department, which spends close to $40m a year on spreading English language skills around the world. But it is also a tacit acknowledgement that e-readers may not be a quick fix for raising learning achievement and that more needs to be done to learn how to exploit them effectively.</p> <p>The reasons behind the withdrawal remain unclear. One factor may have been the US's <a href=\"http://www.nfb.org/\" title=\"\">National Federation of the Blind</a>'s (NFB) claim that Kindles are not fully accessible to the visually impaired and therefore the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/97451466/Mauer2clinton-Nfb\" title=\"\">project was illegal</a>. \"This agreement would violate US law regarding access to information by the blind,\" NFB president Marc Maurer said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the apparent commitment to conduct further research has been welcomed by many education experts. Mobile learning has a relatively short history, but there is much to learn from both the successes and failures of early projects.</p> <p>The agreement with Amazon would have involved a purchase of 35,000 Kindles over five years, with pre-loaded content and access to further material online. The anticipated value of the contract was $16.5m with the state department aiming to: \"Create a global e-reader programme that introduces aspects of US society and culture directly to young people, students, and international audiences in new ways and expands English language learning opportunities worldwide.\"</p> <p>While Amazon's input into the project was clearly outlined in <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=8232e06b4c4af4bb54f90e706b5e9ebc&amp;tab=core&amp;tabmode=list&amp;=\" title=\"\">US Federal Business Opportunities</a> documentation, there appeared to have been little focus on exactly how the Kindles would be integrated into current education programmes. Yet a concentration on technology over pedagogy has become a critical factor in determining the success of English language programmes that combine ICT and traditional teaching, also known as blended learning.</p> <p>Kindles have already been used to support large-scale education projects. The nonprofit organisation <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/\" title=\"\">Worldreader</a> aims to improve literacy and language skills of school children in developing countries by providing digital libraries on Kindle devices. With current projects in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda, encouraging results have been reported in evaluation studies. Worldreader is also developing its <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/what-we-do/our-app/\" title=\"\">Book App</a> that can be accessed on mobile phones, with further details on new funding partners for this scheme expected to be announced shortly.</p> <p>However, putting in funding and providing hardware for a blended learning project is not enough by itself. The US-based <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org/\" title=\"\">One Laptop Per Child</a> (OLPC) project has distributed more than 2m low-cost laptops since 2007 to children globally, but a report by the <a href=\"http://www.iadb.org/en/research-and-data/publication-details,3169.html?pub_id=IDB-WP-304\" title=\"\">Inter-American Development Bank</a> into OLPC in Peru sparked widespread debate when it appeared in February. It stated that, 15 months after implementation, there appeared to be no significant increase in language test score levels or the quality of teaching in classrooms. The report suggested that the amount of training that teachers received on how to use the technology with their students could have been a factor in the disappointing results.</p> <p>When large numbers of expensive and delicate electronic devices are involved, research and training on how to maintain them is key. Over 40% of the Kindles broke during Worldreader's initial pilot in Ghana. According to <a href=\"http://worldreader.org/uploads/Worldreader%20ILC%20USAID%20iREAD%20Final%20Report%20Jan-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">USAid's final evaluation report</a>: \"[the] high breakage rates were primarily a result of the device's fragile screen and vulnerability to&#xa0;dust.\" Worldreader claims that the breakage rates have been reduced to almost zero in the latest project, following the introduction of a more robust screen and better training for users on care and maintenance.</p> <p>Working on ways to ensure that the technology is valued by the students, teachers and administrators is also of crucial importance in ensuring that the devices do not end up being discarded.</p> <p>As UK-based ELT learning technologies specialist <a href=\"http://www.psa.eu.com/\" title=\"\">Pete Sharma</a> states: \"Both teachers and students need to hold positive attitudes towards technology. While many teachers are happy to incorporate digital learning, others are less so. If the teacher does not believe in the pedagogical soundness of the digital component, there is a real chance of failure.\"</p> <p>The content that is available for use via the devices must also be closely matched to the existing curriculum.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/english\" title=\"\">British Council</a>'s English projects manager David Pardoe has been working on bringing English language audio content to resource-poor schools in sub-Saharan Africa. British Council-produced podcasts and radio programmes are loaded onto solar-powered, portable devices with integrated speakers, known as <a href=\"http://lifelineenergy.org/lifeplayer.html\" title=\"\">Lifeplayers</a>. These are being distributed to rural schools in eight countries in southern Africa.</p> <p>\"A lot of people get excited when they see the device and that is good, but the initial enthusiasm can quickly be lost if it's not linked to curriculum,\" Pardoe says. \"I would say that right now, matching content is almost more important than the device, because if it's not then it's quite difficult to convince a teacher to use it in lessons.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/\" title=\"\">Unesco</a> is currently drafting policy guidelines for the development of m\u2011learning initiatives. According to its programme specialist Steve Vosloo, \"[Our] research has found that there is a dearth of policy related to mobile learning at the national level. [The guidelines will] try to fill that vacuum by helping policy makers understand the benefits and challenges related to mobile learning and to offer guidelines for creating an enabling policy environment in which mobile learning can grow.\"</p>",

Its boundless energy, future-thinking beats and sickeningly clever wordplay made Banks into a global star overnight. In 2011, she topped NME's cool list.

  "<p>The culinary traditions of Scotland have been in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/05/mars-disowns-deep-fried-bar\" title=\"\">the news again</a> with the revelation that Mars, the eponymous maker of the chocolate bar, has been in correspondence with an Aberdeenshire fish and chip shop.</p> <p>Lawyers for the confectionary giant sent a letter to the owners of the Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven asking them to make clear that its speciality, the deep-fried Mars bar, was not authorised or endorsed by the company. Apparently Mars felt obliged to act on learning that the Carron's owners were considering an application to Europe for deep-fried Mars bars to be given protected origin status, which highlights traditional, regional foods whose authenticity can be guaranteed.</p> <p>So far, so reminiscent of a pitch for a whimsical David and Goliath-type screenplay that might persuade Bill Forsyth out of retirement. In fact, the Carron's owners did not pursue the application, and it has to be doubtful at best whether the humble deep-fried Mars bar might be deemed worthy of the special status normally reserved for thoroughbred products like champagne, or pedigree foodstuffs like the Melton Mowbray pork pie. Nonetheless, the bad PR has forced Mars to add yesterday that it is, in fact, \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9548029/Mars-proud-of-deep-fried-chocolate-bar.html\" title=\"\">proud</a>\" of the dish.</p> <p>Either way, does this episode mean that the deep-fried Mars bar is unworthy of a place in the Scottish culinary canon? Not necessarily. Yes, the fact that this gooey, bastard child of fat and sugar has become a shorthand for the excesses of the Scottish diet can be immensely irritating. It is tiresome to listen to lazy cliches which suggest that Scots live and die in the shadow of a pie shop, sipping <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckfast_Tonic_Wine\" title=\"\">Buckfast Tonic Wine</a> as if it were our mothers' milk.</p> <p>But most sane and reasonable people know that Scotland is as famous for its fine seafood, meat and artisan cheeses as it is for its pie rolls. (If not, I presume you are a bunker-dwelling moustachioed survivalist, and the only person alive who has never seen a bilious TV chef cook a hand-dived scallop in a rowing boat.)</p> <p>I think therefore that we need not be ashamed of the deep-fried Mars bar. There is no need to deny it \"traditional\" status just because it is less than healthful and was born in a chip shop within the past couple of decades. Traditions have to start somewhere.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invented_traditions\" title=\"\">The Invention of Tradition</a>, edited by Eric Hobsbawm, famously analysed the way in which some traditions which appear to have grown organically over time are, in fact, much more deliberate constructs, often linked to the concept of nationhood and a desire for markers of national identity. Many traditions which we think of as a natural expression of our national character are born of the marriage of grassroots invention and the guiding hand of state or commerce \u2013 for where there's pride, there's brass, and maybe a few votes too.</p> <p>Tartan, for example, does have its roots in Scottish tribal and clan culture but, ironically, it was its adoption by royalty, first George IV and then Victoria and Albert, which confirmed its place in world consciousness as Scotland's \"national\" dress. The Burns Supper started as an in memoriam celebration of the poet's life by men who knew him, but has grown through careful cultivation into a global brand.</p> <p>In the very recent past, the advent of the Scottish parliament has seen the marriage of some ancient traditions with a modern marketing and political machine; the creation of the new St Andrew's day public holiday in 2006 and the efficient promotion of cultural events like Burns Night and Hogmanay as part of Scotland's \"winter festivals\" being prime examples.</p> <p>Few of our traditions are as pure as they may at first seem. The deep-fried Mars bar may be a media cliche and a tourist attraction, but in other ways it is also genuinely of the people. It is the grubby-faced <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wean\" title=\"\">wean</a> of tradition, like the kids in an <a href=\"http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/M/4064/artist_name/Oscar%20Marzaroli/record_id/22171\" title=\"\">Oscar Marzaroli</a> photograph or a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Eardley\" title=\"\">Joan Eardley</a> painting. It may not represent the finest cuisine Scotland has to offer, but it came to life in the community, not on the desk of a bureaucrat, and I like that.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://atrium.haygroup.com/uk/our-products/misc.aspx?ID=3295\" title=\"\">study</a> conducted by the global management consultancy Hay Group, which surveyed 600 graduates and managers at 40 of the UK's largest graduate employers, found that more graduates are prioritising career progression and the ability to make a difference over bonuses and benefits. But it's not only graduates who are changing their priorities. Neil King, HR director at the <a href=\"http://www.leyf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">London Early Years Foundation</a> also reports an increase in applications from the private sector.</p> <p>These findings are echoed by Lydia Langford of <a href=\"http://acre-resources.com/\" title=\"\">Acre Resources</a>, a specialist sustainability recruitment consultancy, who has seen an increase in numbers of applicants wanting to get into the sector, mirroring a corresponding rise in vacancies. A second wave of companies has begun to join those who already have a sustainability agenda, while the number of FTSE 100 companies employing a sustainability executive has increased more than fourfold since 2005, she explains.</p> <p>However, competition for vacancies is tough, and employers are selective. What does a candidate need to do to appeal to a company with sustainable values?</p> <h2>Values alignment</h2> <p>Ed Shepherd credits the <a href=\"http://onpurpose.uk.com/become-an-on-purpose-associate/apply-today-2\" title=\"\">On Purpose leadership programme</a> with helping him examine his own values so he could then identify a company where those values were aligned. Clarity in how your values match helps you build your proposition as a candidate, he says. Shannon Houde, executive and career coach at Acre, suggests mapping your language and values to the organisation's, through \"creating a story around your values, skills and character traits\" in your application.</p> <p>Researching the organisation's website should reveal important information about its values and skills requirements. However, demonstrating awareness of the business model and strategy and an interest in the organisation's culture and mission at assessment or interview stage, will impress much further, says King.</p> <h2>Training, skills and mindset</h2> <p>Although values-led companies expect candidates to share the same values, they are also as specific in their skills and experience requirements. Candidates need to show they can deliver results on projects or programmes. At senior level, strong engagement and relationship management skills are vital to get stakeholder buy-in, says Langford; while in other organisations assessment activities are also used to determine an applicant's suitability.</p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.pg.com/en_UK/\" title=\"\">Procter &amp; Gamble</a> the importance of leadership potential goes beyond an assumed skillset, says Niall de Lacy, HR director for UK and Ireland. To stand out, candidates need to show examples of their ability to engage and energise \u2013 whether these are gained from education, extra-curricular activities or community work.</p> <p>A commitment to developing skills (both technical and soft) makes you more desirable as a candidate. Jack Scriven, an On Purpose fellow, received training in structured problem-solving, influencing techniques and story-telling to complement his technical skills in finance, while Candice Motran developed her social impact measurement and multi-agency programme management skills, both highly desired areas of expertise. Organisations also value strong teamwork skills \u2013 especially evidence of working to achieve shared values and outcomes. Houde also underlines policy and legislation understanding, commercial understanding and strategic thinking as important skills to build.</p> <p>Coaching and mentoring demonstrate a commitment to your professional development and an \"ongoing professional development\" section can be effective in highlighting your goals and motivations, as well as demonstrating personal ownership of your career \u2013 a key trait, advises P&amp;G's de Lacy. Displaying an interest in your future with the organisation is also important. Sustainability-focused companies see \"the future\" as their people, explains Houde, and mutual investment is crucial to attract and retain top talent. Applicants therefore need to portray themselves as having the potential to be managed and developed.</p> <h2>Experience</h2> <p>Analyse previous experience to uncover your main strengths and value to an employer, then frame these in terms of the problems you solved and the impact you had. Both paid and voluntary experience are useful: a variety of environments and challenges not only widens your understanding of business operations, but enables you to improve problem-solving skills and flexibility in applying solutions across sectors. Experience in values-led organisations is particularly important for the insights into how values are applied in decision-making and operations, while any experience you have which clearly matches the company's sustainability agenda should be prominent, advises Langford.</p> <p>Jack Scriven emphasises the importance of voluntary work or acting as a trustee to demonstrate commitment as well as to gain practical experience \u2013 particularly valuable for those changing career into the sustainability sector.</p> <h2>Networking</h2> <p>Networking (such as attending events) is key for building and maintaining contacts with likeminded professionals, and for finding out more about potential employers and the sector.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The government's new planning guidance, the National Planning Policy Framework, came into effect in March this year and since then has been the topic of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/planning\" title=\"\">numerous heated debates</a>.</p> <p>Concerns have been raised about protection of the green belt, whether central government control will hamper localism and how councils can build enough new and affordable homes to meet the demand.</p> <p>Other strands of debate are emerging too, including the opportunity for local government to combine the aims of planning and public health for better outcomes across the board, and how long-term decisions on infrastructure could boost economic growth.</p> <p>Conversations about regenerating high streets are also taking place, and the interest among communities is being assessed and tested as community planning takes shape.</p> <p>With all these changes, how is local government coping with this planning overhaul? Are councils managing and thriving under the new guidance that promised to remove red tape and allow authorities to make decisions relevant to their area?

Published yesterday, the survey found that Britons are less keen on the idea of coalition government, less satisfied with the NHS - and think there should be less spending on benefits. Penny Young, chief executive of NatCen, the organisation that carries out the survey, says this year's findings <a href=\"http://natcenblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/what-britain-thinks-bsa29.html\" title=\"\">highlight the likely battleground for the next general election</a>. She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With most of the planned spending cuts still to bite, a striking finding is that after a decade of declining support for more public spending, we're seeing the first signs of a reversal in this trend. 36% now want more spending \u2013 even if it means higher taxes \u2013 a rise of 5 points year on year. This is not huge, and most people want spending to remain the same, but the fact that the trend is changing direction is significant \u2013 and we'd expect to see it rise further in the coming years.<br>The challenge for government, then, will be to convince the public that cuts won't necessarily mean poorer performance in key public services. But there are already worrying signs in terms of the NHS: from an all-time high at the end of the Labour government, we found the first fall in NHS satisfaction for more than a decade. The 12 percentage point drop (to 58%) is the biggest annual fall since the mid 80s. This is likely to reflect some concern about what's ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, on the Office for Public Management blog, Mike Bonnet asks <a href=\"http://www.opm.co.uk/are-the-public-really-as-unhappy-with-the-nhs-as-reports-would-lead-us-to-believe/\" title=\"\">Are the public really as unhappy with the NHS as reports would lead us to believe?</a> He says \"it would seem that public's perception of NHS standards has fallen disproportionately to the reality\", and adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are numerous possible reasons for this shift in attitudes, many of which are explored in the report, but a theory that particularly interests me is the idea that people's perception of the NHS has become increasingly negative because they oppose the extent of changes being made to the service. As the report points out \"while many feel the NHS needs to change to some degree, radical changes\u2026are not generally the kind of change they have in mind. Even so, a large minority think this is what will, in fact, happen\".</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A timely retweet of a 2010 Demos report on the impact of <strong>welfare reforms </strong>on people with a disability. The report, <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/destinationunknowndisability\" title=\"\">Destination Unknown</a>, concluded that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... the impact on disabled people has not been fully considered. Rather than simply incentivising work, cutting benefits will have unintended consequences on households where finding and keeping work is only achievable with personalised welfare to work support</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The report's co-author <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eugene_Grant/status/247940553273131008\" title=\"\">Eugene Grant tweets</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Govt last changed indexation rate at which benefits are uprated, the impact on disabled people was enormous</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 An eye-opening confession on the Systems thinking for girls blog: <a href=\"http://systemsthinkingforgirls.com/2012/09/15/public-sector-porkies-my-10-years-of-lying/\" title=\"\">10 years of lying up the hierarchy</a>. The anonymous blogger, who has a background in local government, writes that she spent 10 years of her life writing (\"funding bids, monitoring documents, council plans, service plans\"), but: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much of it was made up. Fudged. Spun. Pasted. Cobbled together. Cut. Cleansed. Copied. Attractively formatted!<br>I told lies in themes, lies in groups, lies in pairs. Pages and pages of them. Hundreds of pages of nonsense. Strategic lies. Operational lies. Cross cutting lies. My speciality.<br>Every document I wrote was packed full of white lies. I've lied at every level.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>She adds that \"if not lying, I wasn't confident that what I was writing was real\", and says the purpose of this written work was to project positive news. But she concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The alternative to lying up the hierarchy is simple. Take the hierarchy to see the truth.<br>We should have been taking our managers, chief executives, politicians, civil servants and funders to see what was actually going on. We should have got them sitting on council receptions, listening to hours of phone calls and listening to service users in their own contexts. No reading or writing required. No hours of wordsmithing, checking and formatting. Just good honest finding out.<br>To find out what is really going on, you don't need to be aware of the committee cycle, no approvals necessary, no checking, no version control, nothing cross cuts and nothing comes in clusters or themes. It is just as it is. Always there, waiting to be discovered. Immediate, live and real.<br>There are no lies here. At the bottom of the hierarchy, where the end-user touches it, you find out the truth.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Term of the day, coined by Gaby Hinsliff: \"<strong>elastic middle</strong>\". Referencing Saturday's Guardian Weekend feature on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/14/do-britons-feel-rich-poor\" title=\"\">who feels rich or poor</a>, she says British people are relutcant to label themselves rich. But Hinsliff says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/defining-the-squeezed-middle?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">politicians should be clear about who is really struggling</a>. She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's easy to mock deluded millionaires, of course, but they're not the only ones hopelessly confused about what it means to be rich, poor or stuck in the infamously \"squeezed middle\". We're riding into a storm over the creation and distribution of wealth, with the party conferences dominated by arguments about tax and spending, yet most Britons still have only a vague idea of where they fit in the national picture.<br>Attitudes to the poor are hardening, but based on fundamental misunderstandings about who the poor actually are. Today's British Social Attitudes Survey showed sympathy for the unemployed dwindling, on the assumption that they should just get jobs \u2013 never mind the forgotten hordes in jobs that don't pay enough to escape poverty. And while attitudes to the rich have hardened too, we're hazier than previously about who they really are.<br>Survey after survey shows most people reckon themselves roughly in the middle of the income scale: they think they're average because they feel no richer than their friends, forgetting that their friends are from similar backgrounds. The result is a large, politically awkward class of \"imaginary middles\" \u2013 perhaps best defined as the kind of people who definitely think the richest 10% of Britons should pay more tax \u2013 until they realise that means anyone earning just over \u00a346,000 a year, themselves included.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 An incredibly powerful letter by One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest author Ken Kesey following his son's death at the age of 20. The excellent Letters of Note site <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/09/what-world.html\" title=\"\">shares the letter Kesey wrote to five of his closest friends</a>. It's not an easy read, as Kesey describes his son Jed's final days in hospital following a bus crash, and the funeral. But it ends on a hopeful note after the family agreed to organ donation (\"Jed's always been as generous as they come. Take whatever you can use\"). Kesey writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the doctors were there, bent over a long list, phoning numbers, matching blood types, ordering nurses...in such a hurry they hardly had time to offer sympathy. Busy, and justly so. But the nurses, the nurses bent over their clipboards, could barely see to fill out the forms.<br>They phoned the hotel about an hour later to tell us it was over, and that the kidneys were in perfect shape. That was about four in the morning. They phoned again a little after six to say that the kidneys were already in two young somebodies.<br>What a world.<br>We've heard since that they used twelve things out of him, including corneas. And the redwinged blackbirds sing in the budding greengage plumtree.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Kesey adds a postscript:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Jed's wallet was finally sorted out of the debris and confusion of the wreck it was discovered that he had already provided for such a situation. He had signed the place on his driver's license indicating that he wanted to be an organ donor in the event of etc., etc. One man gathers what another man spills.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19629997\" title=\"\">Government eyes end to benefits and inflation link</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074624/parents-suffer-silence-hands-abusive-children-report\" title=\"\">Parents suffer in silence at the hands of abusive children, report finds</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/13387/csv_launches_700000_government-backed_professional_volunteers_drive\" title=\"\">CSV launches \u00a3700,000 government-backed professional volunteers drive </a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/blogs/mental-health/2012/09/film-confronts-mental-health-s.html\" title=\"\">Campaign confronts mental health stigma in schools</a><br>\u2022 FT [\u00a3]: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a8a41abc-00d4-11e2-9dfc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26ogwgKpW\" title=\"\">Cameron puts brakes on pension reform</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/doctors-from-crisishit-eurozone-countries-heading-to-uk-for-work-8145194.html\" title=\"\">Doctors from crisis-hit eurozone countries heading to UK for work</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/tenancies/banks-asked-to-help-tenants-with-universal-credit/6523770.article\" title=\"\">Banks asked to help tenants with universal credit</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106944\" title=\"\">Prisk urges landlords to create 'spark' for home building</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/call-for-end-to-perverse-tax-breaks-for-pensioners/\" title=\"\">Call for end to 'perverse' tax breaks for pensioners</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9549656/Controlling-partners-to-be-prosecuted-for-domestic-abuse.html\" title=\"\">Controlling partners 'to be prosecuted for domestic abuse'</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Fundraising/article/1150366/scope-launches-scheme-philanthropists-sponsor-charity-shops/\" title=\"\">Scope launches scheme for philanthropists to sponsor charity shops</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Hawa Aden Mohamed watched the young women in blue and red shawls as their hands fluttered busily over clacking sewing machines in an airy workshop in Somalia's Galkayo town. \"Seeing these girls earning a living, it is a good feeling,\" said the diminutive Somali, whose work to help displaced women improve their living standards was recognised on Tuesday when she was named winner of this year's <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/nansen/49c3646c461.html\" title=\"\">Nansen Refugee Award</a>.</p> <p>The prize, which is named after the late Norwegian polar explorer and Nobel peace laureate Fridtjof Nansen, is awarded annually by the United Nations refugee agency, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home\" title=\"\">UNHCR</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/somalia/reallives_7709.html\" title=\"\">Aden Mohamed</a>, or Mama Hawa, was nominated for her work to empower Somali girls and women, especially those displaced by decades of cyclical war and hunger in the Horn of Africa.</p> <p>For the co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.gecpdsom.org/\" title=\"\">Galkayo Education Centre for Peace and Development (GECPD)</a>, education means everything. \"I think not having education is a kind of disease \u2026 without education, you do not exist much. Physically yes, but mentally and emotionally you do not exist,\" she said during an interview last month in Galkayo.</p> <p>Around 1,250 girls receive formal education from GECPD, and 1,600 over the age of 16 are taught basic literacy, numeracy and other life skills, such as sewing. Most have been displaced by the conflict and droughts that have affected Somalia for more than two decades. According to Unicef, since GECPD began its work <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/somalia/reallives_7709.html\" title=\"\">the percentage of girls receiving education in the surrounding district has reached 40%</a>, the highest enrolment in Somalia.</p> <p>Mama Hawa's commitment to women's rights in a traditionally patriarchal society has shaped her whole life. And, in many ways, she owes this to a man: her father. When she was 10, he sent her to school \u2013 a controversial decision \u2013 in the central Somali town of Baidoa in the 1950s. \"My father was special when it comes to girls,\" she said. \"I remember the elders, his friends, asking: 'Why do you want to send your girls to school?' And my father used to say: 'Leave my girls alone'. \"</p> <p>This decision began a lifelong love affair with learning that saw Mama Hawa become an educator, a government official, an activist and a refugee. She has now expanded her work in Galkayo to include boys and young men. As well as the sewing workshop, where women and girls make underwear and sanitary pads for \"dignity kits\" for displaced women, the GECPD runs metalwork and woodwork centres for boys in the dusty town of low houses with colourful doors and thorn trees festooned with plastic bags. Mama Hawa said pirate gangs and other militias often recruited street boys, and she wanted to offer them an alternative.</p> <p>The GECPD, which is supported by UNHCR and the NGOs <a href=\"http://www.oxfamnovib.nl/en-home.html\" title=\"\">Oxfam Novib</a> and <a href=\"http://www.diakonia.se/main_eng.htm\" title=\"\">Diakonia</a>, among others, has also opened a youth resource and sports centre, which has become a social and cultural focal point for the town.</p> <p>Mama Hawa at first faced criticism for teaching women to speak for themselves. \"The mosques spoke of us, said we were devils \u2026 Afterwards, it calmed down when they saw how many, almost 250 women, were taking classes in adult education. We had built around 12 schools.\"</p> <p>The GECPD also campaigns against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2011/apr/18/female-genital-mutilation-video\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> (FGM). Mama Hawa's sister, Fatouma, died aged around seven from an infection contracted after she was circumcised, and the memory still haunts her. \"The word 'Why' \u2026 was not there. [It's] only when you think of the pain \u2026 the deaths, the girls who are circumcised twice because the first time it is not sewn properly ...\" Mama Hawa's voice trailed off. \"You see?\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/somalia/SOM_FGM_Advocacy_Paper.pdf\" title=\"\">An estimated 95% of Somali girls undergo FGM</a>, usually between the ages of four and 11, and most suffer the most extreme form of cutting or infibulation. A new constitution, passed in August, outlaws the practice, but campaigners say it will be difficult to enforce.</p> <p>Mama Hawa, who was born in 1949, studied in India before returning to Mogadishu and working in the Ministry of Education for 15 years. She fled abroad when the military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991. She ended up in Canada, and recognises that her refugee life \u2013 she found a job and a good apartment \u2013 bore no relation to the horrors experienced by women forced to flee their homes on foot in recent years. \"We always say there is hope, we should not lose our hope, our torch of life \u2026 In reality, it's very difficult, especially for women and children,\" she said.</p> <p>In 1994, she returned to Somalia and the southern port of Kismayo, where she opened a women's education centre. But she was forced to flee abroad again in 1999 as clan militias fought each other.</p> <p>Mama Hawa will have no problem spending the $100,000 prize money. She would like more running tracks at the youth centre, a guesthouse to host visiting teams, and a professional college for women.</p> <p>For 16-year-old Mouna Hassan Mohamed, Mama Hawa has already delivered. The teenager fled to Galkayo from the capital Mogadishu three years ago, and still lives in a camp for displaced people. But the money she makes from sewing has given her some independence and respect. \"The money I earn I use for the family,\" she said as her nimble fingers fed material into the sewing machine. \"I pay school fees for my three younger siblings and I am also able to help vulnerable people.\"</p>",
  "<p>New BBC director general George Entwistle used <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/dg-world-class.html\" title=\"\">his first address to staff</a> to announce the closure of the operations division and the departure of one of his rivals for the job, Caroline Thomson.</p> <p>Entwistle signalled a radical shakeup of the BBC structure <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/19/bbc.newmedia1?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">put in place by his predecessor Mark Thompson</a>, including the creation of BBC Vision, just six years ago.</p> <p>The operations group, overseen by Thomson, which was recently expanded to include the BBC's marketing and human resources departments, will be merged immediately with the finance unit into one division under chief financial officer Zarin Patel.</p> <p>Lucy Adams, the BBC's director of business operations and former director of BBC People, will return to the executive board <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/13/sharon-bayley-bbc-executive-board?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">which she left in 2010</a>.</p> <p>Entwistle said: \"Caroline Thomson and I have agreed the time is right for her to leave the organisation.\"</p> <p>Thomson, the BBC's chief operating officer who made the final shortlist for the job and would have been the first female director general, will leave the corporation at the end of next week. Patel will also leave the BBC but will oversee the newly combined division for the immediate future.</p> <p>Entwistle signalled the shakeup would go much further than the axing of the operations division, saying \"in around two years' time, my aim is to have restructured the BBC \u2013 with fundamental implications for A&amp;M [Audio and Music], Vision and Future Media\".</p> <p>He added: \"To be ready to create and curate genuinely digital content, we will need to integrate all three disciplines ... We need to be ready to produce and create genuinely digital content for the first time.\"</p> <p>Audio &amp; Music, comprising all of the BBC's radio services, is headed by Tim Davie, with the BBC's Olympics supremo Roger Mosey in charge of BBC Vision in an acting capacity. Future Media, including BBC online and interactive, is currently overseen by Ralph Rivera.</p> <p>The new director general has also been working with a single consultant from Deloitte, who has been helping him analyse the BBC's finances and organisation in the runup to his taking over at the helm. Insiders played down the significance of the move, saying that Entwistle had wanted somebody to help him with the \"grunt work\" of examining the BBC's internal data, leaving him free for face-to face-meetings.</p> <p>Entwistle, in his second day as director general, spoke to staff from studio B, home of BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show, in the BBC's newly refurbished Broadcasting House in central London.</p> <p>\"Though our best is often brilliant \u2013 in some of our output, we do settle for less than we should,\" Entwistle told staff. \"So I believe we owe our audiences a determined effort to raise the creative quality of what we do.\"</p> <p>Entwistle, who was talking to staff in the studio and live to all BBC premises via its internal video channel, said: \"I want to make a promise \u2013 to listen to you and to work tirelessly on fixing the things that get in the way of high creative quality, making the BBC a place where you really can do your best, and deliver the best of British creativity to our audiences.\"</p> <p>The BBC's management board will be reduced from 25 to 12, he said, replacing the direction group which currently meets three times a month.</p> <p>Headed by the director general, it includes BBC News director Helen Boaden, Davie and Mosey.</p> <p>The direction group also includes the heads of the BBC in the nations as well as BBC North director Peter Salmon, creative director Alan Yentob, chief creative officer Pat Younge and director of communications Paul Mylrea.</p> <p>\"With immediate effect, I'm reorganising the BBC to group all the operational and finance functions in one business division under the chief financial officer,\" said Entwistle.</p> <p>The new director general said cost savings had to be made not just by managers at the top of the organisation but by frontline film-makers. He said some of the savings made would be reinvested in better funded output.</p> <p>Entwistle said the management overhaul would enable the corporation to be run as \"a more creative organisation, led and managed in a radically simplified way\".</p> <p>\"I intend to change the way we're led to put the emphasis where it belongs \u2013 on creative people doing creative things; on our audiences and the exceptional quality of work they deserve,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"I want to make a promise \u2013 to listen to you and to work tirelessly on fixing the things that get in the way of high creative quality, making the BBC a place where you really can do your best, and deliver the best of British creativity to our audiences.\"</p> <p>He said no TV or radio services would be axed despite the ongoing cost-cutting. \"I will do nothing which puts at risk the radio services and TV channels our audiences love. Our wonderful TV channels and radio stations have a great deal of life left in them \u2013 they should be cherished and sustained.\"</p> <p>But he said it would be \"increasingly difficult in the years ahead to remain successful in the UK without success overseas too\".</p> <p>He said the BBC needed another Strictly Come Dancing, which has gone on to be a global hit. \"BBC Worldwide needs to carry on growing but on the basis of successful public service content,\" he added.</p> <p>Entwistle said BBC's in-house production, the subject of much speculation about whether parts of it would be hived off and moved into the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, was a \"vital mechanism through which [we] guarantee editorial standards, protect specialism and create IP [intellectual property] with commercial potential\".</p> <p>\"The BBC would be unimaginable without it but like everyone we want it to up its game,\" he added.</p> <p>The new director general said he wanted to \"get out and understand things ... I am here to put right the things that need to be fixed\".</p> <p>\"There's only one thing that will guarantee the future of the BBC \u2013 the continuing love and trust of our audiences,\" he added.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>The government has for the first time been ordered to disclose copies of confidential letters that Prince Charles wrote to ministers.</p> <p>The publication of the letters will reveal how the heir to the throne has been lobbying ministers behind the scenes with his strongly held opinions.</p> <p>In a significant ruling published on Tuesday, three judges in a freedom of information tribunal decided the public is entitled to know how the prince seeks to alter government policy.</p> <p>\"The essential reason is that it will generally be in the overall public interest for there to be transparency as to how and when Prince Charles seeks to influence government,\" they ruled.</p> <p>For seven years, the government has been resisting the disclosure of a set of letters following a freedom of information <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2010/sep/20/prince-charles-letters-ministers?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">request by the Guardian to see them</a>.</p> <p>Seven Whitehall departments will now have to hand over within a month letters sent during a seven-month period in 2004 and 2005, unless they lodge an appeal at the court of appeal.</p> <p>There <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/16/prince-charles-letters-to-ministers\" title=\"\">have been long-standing criticisms</a> that the prince has been intervening in the affairs of government by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/31/prince-charles-public-duty-private-power\" title=\"\">sending a stream of letters to ministers</a>, known as \"black spider memos\" because of his handwriting.</p> <p>In their <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/media/judgments/2012/evans-v-information-commissioner\" title=\"\">126-page ruling</a>, the judges, led by Mr Justice Walker, acknowledged that some people \"fear, among other things, that disclosure would damage our constitutional structures\". However, they dismissed the arguments put forward by the Whitehall departments, saying they had a \"strong air of unreality\" and were \"difficult to pin down\".</p> <p>The departments had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2010/sep/20/prince-charles-letters?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">argued that the correspondence</a> between the prince and ministers had to be kept secret under a constitutional convention. Disclosure would undermine the convention which allowed the heir to the throne to be educated in the business of government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2010/sep/20/prince-charles-letters-rodney-brazier?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">to prepare him to become king</a>, they claimed.</p> <p>But the judges decided that permitting the prince's lobbying to be concealed under this convention was a \"massive extension\" of the convention, which was not justified. They decided that \"it was fundamental\" that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/15/prince-charles-letters-appeal?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the lobbying by the heir</a> \"cannot have constitutional status\" and cannot be protected from disclosure.</p> <p>The evidence, they said, \"shows Prince Charles using his access to government ministers, and no doubt considering himself entitled to use that access, in order to set up and drive forward charities and promote views, but not as part of his preparation for kingship\".</p> <p>\"Ministers responded, and no doubt felt themselves obliged to respond, but again not as part of Prince Charles's preparation for kingship.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/14/prince-charles-letters-ministers-adviser?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Paul Richards, a former Labour special adviser,</a> told the tribunal that letters from the prince went \"to the top of the pile\" and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2010/sep/20/ministers-prince-charles-letters?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">were \"treated with great reverence\"</a>.</p> <p>The judges noted that although the public had strong views about Charles, they had made their decision \"dispassionately \u2013 in the words of the judicial oath, 'without fear or favour, affection or ill-will'\".</p> <p>They said: \"Some will be horrified at any suggestion that correspondence between government and their heir to the throne should be published&#xa0;\u2026 Others may welcome such disclosure, fearing among other things that without it there will be no real ability to understand the role played by Prince Charles in government decision-making.\"</p> <p>The judges noted that the prince's activities \"are not neutral and in a number of respects have been controversial\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2010/sep/20/prince-charles-letters-adam-tomkins\" title=\"\">Adam Tomkins, a law professor,</a> had testified that the prince had lobbied on \"the perceived merits of holistic medicine, the perceived evils of genetically modified crops, the apparent dangers of making cuts in the armed forces, his strong dislike of certain forms of architecture (leading him to make high-profile interventions in a number of contested planning developments), a range of issues relating to agricultural policy\".</p> <p>According to media reports, the prince once complained to Tony Blair, when he was prime minister, about the government's treatment of rural workers, relaying a Cumbrian farmer's view that \"if we, as a group, were black or gay, we would not be victimised or picked on\".</p> <p>On another occasion he outlined his concerns to Lord Irvine, then lord chancellor, about an American-style \"compensation culture\", reportedly writing: \"I and countless others dread the very real and growing prospect of an American-style personal injury 'culture' becoming ever more prevalent in this country\".</p> <p>He was also reported to have criticised \"the degree to which our lives are becoming ruled by a truly absurd degree of politically correct interference\".</p> <p>Copies or details of the prince's letters have been made public, either through leaks, Jonathan Dimbleby's 1994 biography of Charles, or other sources. However, the tribunal's decision is the first time under the freedom of information legislation that the government has been instructed to publish his letters.</p> <p>It is likely to be the last time, as ministers last year enforced a blanket ban on his correspondence being disclosed under the freedom of information law in the future, regardless of whether it is in the public interest. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/13/charles-letters-freedom-information-act?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">The absolute block was imposed following pressure</a> from the royal family, a well-placed source has told the Guardian.</p> <p>The judges ordered the Cabinet Office, and the departments responsible for business, health, schools, environment, culture and Northern Ireland to disclose their correspondence with the prince between September 2004 and April 2005.</p> <p>It is the second freedom of information defeat the government has suffered over the question of the prince's political influence. The Queen and the prince have the power <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/30/prince-charles-offered-veto-legislation\" title=\"\">to veto legislation</a> that could harm their private interests. Last month the information commissioner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/31/secret-royal-veto-powers-exposed\" title=\"\">ruled that an internal Whitehall guide</a> into the use of this veto should be published.</p>",
  "<p>The film community is waiting with anticipation for the announcement from the British Film Institute (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">BFI</a>) about their five-year plan to develop the UK film industry, film culture and film going. Following their consultation document <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/node/1136\" title=\"\">New Horizon's for UK Film</a>, many believe the BFI's proposals will include a call for a \"UK-wide network of virtual and physical film hubs.\"</p> <p>If this is the case it has to be applauded. The devil will be in the detail as to what these hubs will deliver, but I think the notion of a UK-wide network is a major step in recognising that film in its many manifestations \u2013 producing, making and watching \u2013 is a national activity.</p> <p>It's always been easy to think of the film industry as London-based, with the gravitational pull of the capital as a natural phenomenon. Historically that has always been the case.</p> <p>Yet a major shift is possible. Digital formats and the internet has fundamentally changed and challenged that assumption of the \"centre\" \u2013 work can now be made and distributed from where you're based; they can come to you, rather than vice-versa.</p> <p>I was struck by a recent profile on Paignton-based singer, songwriter and film-maker <a href=\"http://cosmojarvis.com/\" title=\"\">Cosmo Jarvis</a>, who as well as having released three albums and numerous singles at the age of 23 has also made short and feature films. For me he exemplifies the new phenomenon of talent coming from outside of the centre and establishing their creative profile without taking the traditional London apprenticeship.</p> <p>In this decentralised and dynamic digital landscape it becomes more imperative to have equally dynamic UK wide networks of venues capable of responding to, nurturing and developing creative talent. This is not only about responding to the needs of local and regional talent, but also creating dynamic local and regional cultures and creative communities.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.watershed.co.uk/\" title=\"\">At Watershed in Bristol</a> we have just launched FilmWorks, a networked regional talent development initiative with partners in Sheffield (Showroom) and Nottingham (Broadway) and funding from Creative England. This is a groundbreaking initiative in talent development with live talks and events across the partner venues while also working with locally-based film producers to train and mentor.</p> <p>The aim is to develop regionally-based film talent and help generate self supporting cross regional networks that share skills and experiences \u2013 critically fostering a creative local environment where talent can grow without feeling that need to move to the capital.</p> <p>Another element of the scheme which I'm excited about is the sharing of skills across production and exhibition. As we all know, thanks to digital the old models are being challenged. The film industry has always been based on the separate factions of production, distribution and exhibition \u2013 there was very little exchange of ideas and practice between these sectors. Instead, the only thing that ever really changed hands would be money: what deal was everyone getting?</p> <p>Now, however, those boundaries are becoming more porous and discussions are becoming more interesting. In my day job I show films at Watershed cinema in Bristol, and these films are supplied by distributors. In the past I would have no contact with the makers unless the distributor had their film to promote. Now I am approached on a regular basis by directors who have just finished a film and want me to look at showing it or producers who are getting a project together and want me to discuss it.</p> <p>The wonderful documentary <a href=\"http://missiontolars.com/\" title=\"\">Mission to Lars</a> is a recent example of a film that fell below the radar of the traditional distribution model. The film's producer Kate Spicer approached me directly \u2013 with some helpful social media lobbying from friends \u2013 and I had a memorable packed screening and event in the summer. That connection between the makers and the audience, between producers and exhibitors is an area ripe for sharing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.watershed.co.uk/whatson/3682/filmworks-launch-it-begins-with-an-idea/\" title=\"\">The first event for FilmWorks</a> takes place on Wednesday 19 September at Encounters Short Film and Animation Festival. On the panel will be Bristol-based Academy award-winning film director, producer and Aardman co-founder Peter Lord talking about developing an idea into a film script, and alongside him will be Bristol-based producer Alison Sterling, who will be talking about the development of her first feature Flying Blind.</p> <p>Future film-making, like other creative practices, will increasingly be locally-based with potential global reach. It is important that we get a UK wide network of supportive and resourced venues to help nurture, platform and profile emerging local and regional talent.</p> <p><em>Mark Cosgrove is head of programme at </em><a href=\"http://www.watershed.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Watershed</em></a><em> and artistic director at the </em><a href=\"http://www.encounters-festival.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Encounters Short Film and Animation Festival</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>\"If this were London, there would be a circle of young bankers standing outside here, ties off, pints of beer in their hands, smoking, sweating, shouting, joking. But look around you \u2026\"</p> <p>He is a man in his early 30s who lived in London before and has been working in the Frankfurt financial services industry for a few years now. Asked about the difference between the two, he took me to a pub called Mutter Ernst in the Alte Rothofstrasse at the edge of the financial district.</p> <p>We are literally standing in the shadow of a huge Commerzbank office, Germany's biggest bank after Deutsche Bank (insiders just say Deutsche). Around the corner are JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of Scotland. It's six o'clock in the evening and the Rothofstra\u00dfe is deserted. Inside Mutter Ernst (Mother Serious) it's very peaceful and placid, with a few people here and there eating their Frankfurter or sipping an Apfelwein.</p> <p>\"In London at this hour this place would be jammed. Frankfurt has the best Opera in Germany and fantastic concerts, all generously funded by local taxes. But there's none of that 'lads' culture you find in London.\"</p> <p>Regulars of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/aug/01/banking-blog-comes-together\" title=\"\">the banking blog</a> know that the financial industry does not look kindly on those who speak to the press, so I cannot tell you much more about my interviewee, except he is not German himself. This is another difference between London and Frankfurt; there are far fewer people in any one particular niche, making it even harder to hide their identity.</p> <p>So here we go, big differences between London and Frankfurt, and it'd be great if other insiders could add their own thoughts in the comment thread. Asked for an analogy, he says that Frankfurt is like London's younger, not so boisterous cousin. Younger or older?</p> <p>\"Hmm, in the 15th century Frankfurt was already a centre for trade finance. So you might say older. But this place never had London's big bang of deregulation. So when it comes to today's banking, Frankfurt is late to the game.\"</p> <p>Also, he says, finance in Frankfurt is more knitted into the wider fabric of the economy.</p> <p>\"Finance here is less of an end in itself.\"</p> <p>How come?</p> <p>\"It's not like German bankers sit together and say: 'Let's be modest.' You have the same tendencies at work here as in London. But German bankers operate in a different environment, and the financial lobby here just doesn't have the political weight it has in London.</p> <p>\"It gets less of what it wants. The financial transaction tax is a vote-loser in the UK. Here it's a winner. The majority in Germany feel that bankers should pay more.</p> <p>\"Generally I'd say German culture is more egalitarian than the UK, more risk-averse, and slightly quieter. You are right that German banks loaded up on risky exotic products in the US like no other, but that was probably out of naivety, not a thirst for risk.</p> <p>\"They just didn't understand these things. The people who ran the smaller German banks that got burnt so badly were used to a culture where trust builds long-term relationships. But when you can cross the border, you cannot assume that your counterpart shares those values. Same story with German banks lending to southern Europe.\"</p> <p>Having said all this, he confirms that the stereotype of Frankfurters in the rest of Germany is that they are arrogant and ostentatious.</p> <p>\"The Goethestra\u00dfe around the corner is one long row of luxury boutiques. And there are a hell of a lot of Porsches in this city.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Next: where is the anger?</p>",

  "<p>A justified public outcry arose yesterday at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19622903\" title=\"\">news</a> that some traders in east London's Ridley Road market have been selling illegally imported meats, including Ghanaian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_rat\" title=\"\">cane rat</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10341174\" title=\"\">bushmeat trade</a> is a destructive and criminal operation, a potential threat to public health, to the environment and even to the security of certain species.</p> <p>It was almost certainly west African hunters butchering chimpanzees for food that led to the relatively tame simian immunodeficiency virus jumping species and <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0612_030612_hivvirusjump.html\" title=\"\">mutating into its monstrous, pandemic cousin, HIV/Aids</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.bushmeat.org/bushmeat_and_wildlife_trade/what_is_the_bushmeat_crisis\" title=\"\">Bushmeat Crisis Task Force</a> has documented the environmental damage wreaked by some bushmeat hunting methods, such as people starting forest fires to smoke their quarry out. Many of the African animals commonly used for bushmeat, <a href=\"http://www.bushmeat.org/bushmeat_and_wildlife_trade/what_is_the_bushmeat_crisis\" title=\"\">including gorillas and elephants</a>, are endangered.</p> <p>But much of the disgusted reaction to this news overlooks an important point. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204579/Food-shops-east-London-caught-selling-DEAD-RATS-undercover-probe-reveals-illegal-meat-trade.html\" title=\"\">One tabloid headline</a> capitalised \"rat\" as though the Ridley Road stallholders had been selling Cockney rodents hauled from the sewers. In fact, <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Grand_aulacode_male.jpg/220px-Grand_aulacode_male.jpg\" title=\"\">cane rat</a> looks rather more like a cat-sized, short-haired guinea pig. Its meat is <a href=\"http://www.theworld.org/2011/01/cane-rats-delicacy/\" title=\"\">said to be</a> lean, \"succulent and sweet\" , and low in cholesterol. In Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria, where it's more appealingly called grasscutter, people actually farm it.</p> <p>Rodents are enjoyed as food <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=vpc14\" title=\"\">around the world</a>. Brown rats, the second most successful mammals on the planet, are a delicacy in China, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7230233.stm\" title=\"\">south-east Asia</a> and certain communities of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7557107.stm\" title=\"\">northern India</a>. The Romans enjoyed dormouse, which is still popular in Slovenia. The Peruvians famously eat <em>cuy</em>, or guinea pig, and have developed a <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/scenes-from-a-peruvian-guinea-pig-festival\" title=\"\">fascinating festival</a> in which they dress the creatures in little costumes before roasting and eating them. Capybara, bandicoots and agoti are also enjoyed in the countries in which they live.</p> <p>It is sheer historical accident that we eat the very few meats we do in this country, rather than different ones. Over a brief period a few thousand years ago, humans managed to domesticate a handful of species for the meat or labour they provided. At least in the west, these domesticated pigs, cattle, chickens and sheep account for the almost all the meat that people eat, with only a tiny fraction coming from wild game and other sources.</p> <p>All of our food choices are based on culture and experience and seasoned with prejudice. The French, Belgians and Swiss are enthusiastic eaters of horsemeat, an idea that horrifies many people in this country. But if your moral landscape countenances the consumption of venison, why shouldn't horses feature in it as well? Dogs make better pets than pigs do, and people I know who've tried dog meat have rarely been impressed by it. But pigs are at least intelligent, as sentient and as capable of emotion as dogs are. If you can eat pig, then on a purely ethical basis there's no reason why you should feel disgusted or angry at the idea of eating dog.</p> <p>An acquaintance of mine is a man named <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/apr/17/the-man-who-eats-live-animals\" title=\"\">Louis Cole</a>; he makes a living uploading videos of himself eating unusual things on to the internet. So he's eaten live scorpions, a live goldfish, locusts and ragworm, and been censured by animal rights charity the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4401793/Disgust-at-video-of-internet-celebrity-Louis-Cole-eating-dead-rabbit-at-roadside.html\" title=\"\">in the red-tops</a> for doing so. His current mini-series sees him travelling Britain and eating roadkill. He recently <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2R3SzQoXeY\" title=\"\">tried fox</a> \u2013 sustainable, free-range \u2013 and pronounced it \"kind of tangy \u2026 I'm really surprised how good it is\".</p> <p>The popularity of individual foods tends to fluctuate too. The Victorian poor ate oysters in their millions, which is why we have legacy dishes like steak and oyster pie. A series of bad winters in the late 19th century and the destruction of oyster beds meant that the molluscs became costly and rare, and are now enjoyed mainly by more adventurous eaters. Eels have undergone a comparable narrative.</p> <p>There are serious environmental and public health issues surrounding the consumption of bushmeat in this country. But to castigate a community for trying to maintain the tastes it historically enjoyed is arrogant and misguided. The British stomach, like its language, is polyglot, a result of borrowings and co-options from around the world. Perhaps it falls on an enterprising Ghanaian or Nigerian to open the UK's first cane rat farm and place this meat safely in the food chain. We came to love curry and sushi and a style of Cantonese cooking in this country: perhaps, in a generation or so, British families will be sitting down to cane rat stir-fry.</p>",

The consultancy's <a href=\"http://www.echarris.com/pdf/8356_Pipeline%20Report_Final.pdf\">latest report (pdf)</a> finds that 125 \"prime residential\" schemes are in the pipeline, \"equating to a total floor area of nearly 20 million square feet, equivalent to the size of the Olympic Park in East London.\" </p> <p>This represents an increase of 70% on the previous year, as the super-affluent take their multi-millions out of the nervy Eurozone and surf the safe and surging crest of the top end of the London market.</p> <p>It seems there's a bit of a race to serve up the sorts of deluxe developments that are to these footloose speculators' taste, with two of the capital's largest vying for their favour. </p> <p>The Battersea Power station site is one and the Earls Court project, with its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/sep/17/earls-court-project-battle-endgame-is-nigh\">aspiration to destroy 760 existing affordable homes against residents' wishes and meagre proposed provision of additional \"affordable\" homes within the redevelopment area</a>, is another. The main political drive for the latter scheme has, as regular readers know, come from Boris Johnson's close allies at Hammersmith and Fulham council. </p> <p>An EC Harris analyst argues that the likely inability of developers to meet the gargantuan demand will probably help to \"smooth out the potential 'bubble' indicated in 2016/17,\" though others aren't so soothed. </p> <p>Research from the <a href=\"http://www.futureoflondon.org.uk/2012/07/21/new-report-surge-in-overseas-investment-risks-creating-london-housing-bubble/\">Future of London policy network</a> and <a href=\"http://www.smith-institute.org.uk/\">Smith Institute</a> think tank published in July warned that the staggering growth in overseas investment \"creates the risk of another housing bubble and is pricing out local people,\" and is partly responsible for the capital's \"distorted and dysfunctional\" housing market. It adds that anecdotal reports suggest that a high proportion of the high price properties are kept empty.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.smith-institute.org.uk/file/London%20for%20Sale.pdf\">research (pdf) </a> ends by addressing the aspirations of Mayor Johnson's 2010 London Housing Strategy to, among other things, help first time buyers and improve the private rented sector:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is the contention of this report that if such aspirations are to be achieved then the prime focus of analysis, strategy and policy must be the dynamics of the private housing market. Within that focus the most urgent task is to understand and develop a strategy in relation to overseas investment. Without intervention the unattractive phenomenon of a financially buoyant but socially dysfunctional housing market will continue and may worsen...</p> <p>Policy makers and politicians have long been wary of intervention in markets. According to the neo-liberal ideology that has gained so much currency over the past thirty years such intervention risks unforeseen consequences and courts inefficiency of outcomes. However, if five years of international financial turmoil have taught us anything it is that untrammelled markets do not necessarily optimise social outcomes. </p> <p>Public intervention saved and sustains the banking sector in the UK and internationally. In the end markets exist to serve the interests and needs of real people. Arguably the London private housing market serves the interests of few people and fails to serve the needs of the majority. There is a case for intervention.</p> </blockquote> <p>And you can bet <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/23/london-needs-a-champion\">Mayor Jolly Goodfun</a> won't be making it.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/18/uk-inflation-falls-despite-fuel-costs\" title=\"\">UK inflation eased last month</a> as retailers cut prices to tempt in cash-strapped shoppers. The <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_278917.pdf\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics (ONS) said</a> annual consumer price inflation came down to 2.5% in August, from 2.6% in July, in line with analyst expectations. Retail price inflation \u2013 which includes the cost of mortgages and council tax \u2013 eased to 2.9% from 3.2% in July.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, Markit</h2> <p>Good news as UK inflation fell in August, as expected, helping to alleviate the squeeze on incomes that has plagued households over the past two years. However, incomes continue to fall in real terms due to weak pay growth, and rising oil and food prices have the potential to keep inflation higher than anticipated by policymakers over the next few months. While the damaging effect on consumer spending is not likely to be anything like as marked as late last year, the persistence of high inflation and weak pay growth means consumer spending could well disappoint in the final few months of 2012.</p> <h2>David Tinsley, BNP Paribas</h2> <p>This release will assuage some fears that underlying inflationary pressure is firming. Most obviously the CPI inflation rate has fallen. But also the fairly broadly based decline will be welcome. So, while it is certainly the case that compared with a few months ago the near-term outlook for inflation is firmer, most of that firming looks to be coming from higher energy and food prices. Core inflation is back at 2.1%, the level it was at in June, and there is little reason to see underlying inflation as anything but contained.</p> <h2>Samuel Tombs, Capital Economics</h2> <p>July's core inflation rate had been boosted by the earlier than usual end to high street sales and a sharp Olympics-related rise in air fares inflation, so a drop back in August had always looked likely. Admittedly, the recent increase in oil prices has meant that inflation is falling at a somewhat slower pace than seemed likely a few months ago. Nonetheless, oil prices have levelled off in recent weeks. What's more, inflation should drop to a greater extent in September \u2013 perhaps to 2% \u2013 as we reach the anniversary of last year's utility price hikes. Meanwhile, the weak economy should push core price pressures down further, keeping inflation low next year. As a result, we doubt that the outlook for inflation will dissuade the monetary policy committee (MPC) from announcing more asset purchases later this year.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The easing back in consumer price inflation in August supports belief that the Bank of England will enact further stimulus to help the economy in the fourth quarter, despite some recent improved news on economic activity.</p> <p>Although there is a risk that inflation will be sticky over the coming months, and despite some recent improved data and surveys, extended weak economic activity rather than inflation remains by far the main problem facing the UK economy. The likelihood remains that appreciable labour market slack and excess capacity will keep a lid on underlying price pressures. Certainly earnings growth currently remains very low.</p> <p>We strongly suspect that the Bank of England will deliver a further \u00a350bn of quantitative easing (QE) in the fourth quarter.</p> <h2>James Knightley, ING</h2> <p>The rise in oil prices and food commodities presents some risks for headline inflation in coming months, but with the weak economy implying only limited corporate pricing power we still expect inflation to fall back to 2% by the end of the year. This means that the Bank of England will have room to implement more QE at the November [meeting of the] MPC, especially with sterling strength causing some concern over export competitiveness at a time when domestic demand remains weak.</p> <h2>Ross Walker, RBS</h2> <p>The August inflation data provide some reassurance in the respect that, with some upside price influences in the pipeline (food, utility charges, petrol increases will filter in over the next few months, as well as some \"administered\" prices increases such as tuition fees) further inflation stickiness at this point would have been unhelpful and might have fuelled doubts about the BoE's ability to pursue further QE purchases.</p>",

Like-for-like sales in its core retail business ticked up 1.1% in the first half.</p> <p>The company's executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, said: \"As ever, the group result for the full-year remains very dependent on the sales and margin performance in December and January.\"</p> <p>Despite pressures on margin and rising taxes and other levies across Europe, he said full-year profit before tax should come within expectations of \u00a365-\u00a370m.</p> <p>That will take a monumental effort in the second half, as first-half pre-tax profits came in at just \u00a32.9m, tumbling from \u00a320.1m in the first half of last year. Revenues, meanwhile, rose 26% to \u00a3556m.</p> <p>Recent trading has been mixed with like-for-like sales in the sports shops up 3.2% in the six weeks to September, while like-for-like sales at JD's fashion stores dropped 6%.</p> <p>The company said the vast majority of losses at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/23/blacks-la-senza-head-administration\" title=\"\">Blacks</a> fell in the first three months of ownership and that business was stabilising. Stores are fully restocked, it said, and it continues with its programme of reorganising central costs.

  "<p>The economic and political environment is pushing through unprecedented changes within the NHS, none more so than in the provision of back-office functions.</p> <p>NHS organisations across the country are evaluating how they provide their corporate services, including estates, facilities, procurement, HR and payroll \u2013 all of which make up a significant \u00a32.8bn chunk of NHS annual expenditure.</p> <p>The Department of Health's efficiency improvement programme Qipp suggests a saving in excess of \u00a3600m can be achieved by delivering a more creative model for back-office services. However, savings are not the only driver for change. Ensuring that operational infrastructure is of optimum quality is essential in delivering the service reconfiguration that is needed.</p> <p>Some trusts are becoming acutely aware of this issue and are confronting it. NHS trusts have become encumbered by back-office responsibilities. Many would relish, and are relishing, being freed of these responsibilities and focusing on what they do best \u2013 providing world-class healthcare.</p> <h2>Does this mean going private?</h2> <p>The current government agenda in this area is clear \u2013 reduce the size of the NHS by contracting non-core services out. \"So who will provide these vital infrastructure services then?\" I hear you cry. The private sector? Not necessarily.</p> <p>There's no question that if managed correctly, the NHS can benefit greatly from procuring services through commercial providers. They offer mature systems, strong investment profiles, good service delivery capability and economies of scale that make for a very compelling business case.</p> <p>There is also a growing appetite within a number of NHS organisations to share services. Yet there remains a generally recognised consensus that many of the current NHS shared services providers, while understanding their customer's cultural demands, often do not have to commercial rigour to reach the service levels regularly seen and expected in the private sector.</p> <h2>The best of both worlds</h2> <p>Forward-thinking NHS organisations have recognised that there is an excellent opportunity to bridge the gap. An NHS shared service, with the service levels, commercial rigour, innovation and investment profile that can compete with commercial-sector competitors, but still retaining all the healthcare domain knowledge, is essential to provide services in this complex marketplace.</p> <p>We're working with a number of NHS providers and shared services organisations that are aggressively developing their offering to compete for this new market. They are looking to provide a wide range of services within their local healthcare economy, their local authority and way beyond.</p> <p>A shared services organisation such as this has the ability and expertise to not only compete with private sector organisations but also support them. They are finding that it is no longer the case that it is just the public sector that needs the private sector's commercial expertise, but also that the opposite can be true.</p> <p>A notable example of that is Guy's and St Thomas' NHS foundation trust, which has built a range of services under its Essentia brand to offer to other NHS and public sector organisations.

  "<p>\"Politics and literature,\" Salman Rushdie wrote in 1984, in what now seems an innocent time, \"do mix, are inextricably mixed, and that \u2026 mixture has consequences.\" Criticising George Orwell for having advocated political quietism to writers, Rushdie asserted that \"we are all irradiated by history, we are radioactive with history and politics\" and that, \"in this world without quiet corners, there can be no easy escapes from history, from hullabaloo, from terrible, unquiet fuss.\"</p> <p>Five years later, his novel <em>The Satanic Verses</em> would be abruptly inserted into a series of ongoing domestic and international confrontations in the west and Muslim countries. Sentenced to death by an Iranian theocrat, Rushdie himself would embody the perils of mixing politics and literature in an interconnected and volatile world, where, as Paul Val\u00e9ry once warned, \"nothing can&#xa0;ever&#xa0;happen&#xa0;again without the whole world's taking a hand\" and where \"no one will ever be able to predict or circumscribe the almost immediate consequences of any undertaking whatever.\"</p> <p>In his new memoir <em>Joseph Anton</em>, which describes his life in hiding for more than a decade, Rushdie claims that <em>The Satanic Verses</em> was his \"least political book\". It was \"an artistic engagement with the phenomenon of revelation\", albeit from the perspective of an \"unbeliever\", but \"a proper one nonetheless. How could that be thought offensive?\" But then authorial intentions barely seemed to matter to readers bringing to the book their own particular backgrounds, worldviews and prejudices.</p> <p>No one among Rushdie's early readers in Europe and America seems to have suspected that parts of the novel constituted, <a href=\"http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/weinbge/outsss.htm\" title=\"\">as Eliot Weinberger wrote in 1989</a>, an \"all-out parodic assault on the basic tenets of Islam\". A pre-publication review in the Indian newsweekly India Today revealed that Rushdie had irreverently rewritten the life of the Prophet, the paradigmatic figure of virtue for all Muslims, naming him Mahound, the term used to identify him as a devil in medieval Christian caricature, and placing his 12 wives in a brothel. Rushdie claimed in the accompanying interview that the image out of which his book grew was of the Prophet \"going to the mountain and not being able to tell the difference between the angel and the devil.\"</p> <p>Responding to the coverage in India Today, some self-proclaimed leaders of Indian Muslims demanded a ban on <em>The Satanic Verses</em>. The Indian government rashly obliged, prohibiting the novel's importation (though copies were already in circulation). \"You own the present,\" Rushdie appealed unsuccessfully to the Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, \"but the centuries belong to art.\" The following month South Africa proscribed the book. Nearly 70 per cent of Bolton's Muslim population turned up for Britain's first major demonstration against the book. Most of the Muslims protesting against the book had not read it; but many of those who had were no less \"transfixed with fear, anger and hatred\", as the writer Ziauddin Sardar, himself a critic of Islamic fundamentalism, confessed.</p> <p>Rushdie's exemplary record of anti-racism amounted to little as demonstrators in Bradford ceremoniously burnt a copy of <em>The Satanic Verses</em>. As with the film <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> last week, news of the novel's alleged insult to Islam travelled speedily to politically combustible regions. Some Kashmiris in Srinagar, fighting a corrupt and brutal Indian rule, found in the book another pretext to ventilate their rage, and a differently motivated crowd of Pakistani protesters attacked the American Center in Islamabad, claiming the first of many lives consumed by a fast-spreading global wildfire. No one, however, weaponised the novel with more devastating effect than Iran's chief cleric, then bloodily consolidating his young theocracy and Iran's claims to global Muslim leadership after a catastrophic eight-year war with Iraq.</p> <p>Khomeini's unconscionable fatwa, though immediately condemned by most critics of <em>The Satanic Verses</em>, widened the already great chasm of perception and historical memory between white westerners and the Muslim inhabitants of former western empires. In Britain, it became another pretext for rants about Muslim barbarism, and fresh assaults on the straw man of \"multiculturalism\". \"We fell for the idea,\" <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/500765ec-fd93-11e1-8fc3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26jpKSEBH\" title=\"\">Michael Ignatieff admitted last week</a>, speaking for many liberal intellectuals, not to mention quasi-racist right-wingers, \"that the ayatollah was speaking for the whole faith.\" In this atmosphere of \"anti-Muslim feeling\", as Bhikhu Parekh described it, most Muslims were seen as fundamentalists or \"illiterate peasants preferring the sleep of superstition to liberal light, and placed outside civilised discourse\".</p> <p>Christopher Hitchens's gloss on Islam was not untypical: \"the very word is like the echo of a forehead knocking repeatedly on the floor, while the buttocks are proffered to the empty, unfeeling sky.\" Not surprisingly, as Malise Ruthven wrote, \"Muslims in Britain and abroad\" who already felt the sharp edge of the \"power of the west\", responded \"to <em>The Satanic Verses</em> as an assault on their collective cultural identity\".</p> <p>Simple assertions of the principle of free speech did not persuade those Muslims who were aware of laws that protected Christians from blasphemy. Edward Said, while correctly defending Rushdie's right to untrammelled expression, tried to ventriloquise the Muslim sense of hurt and bafflement: \"Why must a Muslim, who could be defending and sympathetically interpreting us, now present us so roughly, so expertly and so disrespectfully to an audience already primed to excoriate our traditions, reality, history, religion, language, and origins?\" But the question suffered from many misunderstandings about Rushdie's position and role as an expatriate novelist from a former imperial possession.</p> <p>Like many writers of non-western backgrounds in the west, Rushdie had suffered the ambiguous fate of being hastily appointed as a representative and spokesperson of India, South Asia, the \"third world\", multiculturalism, the immigrant condition \u2013 whatever seemed alien and incomprehensible to the white majority. In reality, there was little in common between Rushdie, an atheistic, Cambridge-educated upper-class intellectual from Bombay, and the devout guest-worker from Anatolia (representative of the mostly working-class Muslims of rural origins who had been imported to service Europe's post-war economies), or the Pakistani trade unionist chased out by the torturers of Zia ul-Haq, the CIA-backed radical Islamist who had spent most of the 1980s facilitating an anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. <em>The Satanic Verses</em> itself is less about the immigrant condition than a helplessly Anglophilic Indian's profound ambivalence about a British ruling class that regards him as a wog.</p> <p>Attacked for having defamed the Prophet, Rushdie withdrew from the terrain of history and politics he had previously staked, insisting that his novel was a \"work of art\", and not reducible to an anti-Islam polemic. Upholding an exalted post-Christian notion of literature, he argued that the novel was the privileged realm of polyphony, doubt and argument. As such, it was naturally opposed and superior to the \"unarguable absolutes of religion\" and incomprehensible to the Muslims protesting against his book \u2013 people prone to \"mass popular irrationalism\".</p> <p>The world of unreformed Islam in this view presented a clear and present danger to the cherished beliefs, institutions and art forms of the secular and rational west. In his memoir, where Rushdie bizarrely decides to write about himself, or \"Joseph Anton\", his Conrad-and-Chekhov-inspired alias, in the third person, he repeatedly points to his early intuitions and warnings about the atrocity suffered by the west on 9/11. \"He knew, as surely as he knew anything, that the fanatical cancer spreading through Muslim communities would in the end explode into the wider world beyond Islam.\" Indeed, Rushdie's writings from this period anticipate many declarations of war on \"Islamofascism\" after 9/11. As he wrote in 1990, defending <em>The Satanic Verses</em>: \"'Battle lines are being drawn in&#xa0;India today,' one of my characters remarks. 'Secular versus religious, the light versus the dark. Better you choose which side you are on.' Now that the battle has spread to Britain, I only hope it will not be lost by default. It is time for us to choose.\"</p> <p>The ayatollah's cruelty and malice made many of Rushdie's choices for him. <em>Joseph Anton</em> conveys a clear and shaming picture of his ordeal \u2013 the soul-numbing humiliations of a subterranean existence, the scurrying from one safehouse to another, and the endless negotiations with security staff for a few slivers of ordinary life. The reader is fully on Rushdie's side, and outraged when, in one of the book's few superbly rendered scenes, fear and confusion force him to re-embrace Islam before some Muslim scholars/busybodies.</p> <p>There are fascinating details about Rushdie's parents in the memoir's early pages, which also appealingly evoke his years as a struggling writer with his first wife, Clarissa; few readers would fail, later in the book, to be moved by the account of her death and Rushdie's grief-tinged recall of his superseded self. Rushdie engagingly reveals the autobiographical energies that went into the making of such novels as <em>The Satanic Verses</em> and <em>Fury</em>. Anton's Herzog-style letters, addressed variously and randomly to famous people, critics, and even God, effectively evoke the mind of an isolated and hunted man.</p> <p>Yet the memoir, at 650 pages, often feels too long, over-dependent on Rushdie's journals, and unquickened by hindsight, or its prose. Ostensibly deployed as a distancing device, the third-person narration frequently makes for awkward self-regard (\"The clouds thickened over his head. But he found that his sentences could still form \u2026 his imagination still spark\"). A peevish righteousness comes to pervade the memoir as Rushdie routinely and often repetitively censures those who criticised or disagreed with him. The long list of betrayers, carpers and timorous publishers includes Robert Gottlieb, Peter Mayer, John le Carr\u00e9, Sonny Mehta, the Independent (evidently the \"house journal for British Islam\"), Germaine Greer, John Berger and assorted policemen \"who believed he had done nothing of value in his life\". Small darts are also flung at James Wood, \"the malevolent Procrustes of literary criticism\", Arundhati Roy, Joseph Brodsky, Louis de Berni\u00e8res and many others.</p> <p>Not just individuals, entire countries, even races are judged, and frequently found wanting. The Danes lay on a battleship to protect Anton, who falls \"in love with the Nordic peoples because of their adherence to the highest principles of freedom\". \"America,\" we are told, \"had made it impossible for Britain to walk away from his defence.\" Also, outside Britain, Anton \"was seen as likeable, funny, brave, talented and worthy of respect\".</p> <p>There are some exceptions to British mean-mindedness. After one \"lovely evening\" at Chequers, where the singer Mick Hucknall's \"hot girlfriend\" is distractingly present, Anton confesses to a \"soft spot\" for Tony Blair. \"You set out sincerely to change my life for the better,\" he writes, and though this \"may not quite cancel out the invasion of Iraq\", it does weigh in his \"personal scales\". Oddly, Anton seems to require no such moral balancing for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/06/sri-lankan-president-london-protest\" title=\"\">the Sri Lankan strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa</a>, who is commended for resisting Iranian pressure and green-lighting the filming of <em>Midnight's Children</em>; the responsibility of this authoritarian president and his brother in the massacre of tens of thousands of Tamil Hindus is passed over in silence. Nor does Anton record the piquant fact that the Hindu nationalists who noisily protested against the Indian decision to ban <em>The Satanic Verses</em> and, once in power, allowed him to visit India are implicated in the killings of thousands of Muslims in the previous two decades.</p> <p>All this was also on the front pages into which, as Martin Amis famously remarked, Rushdie \"vanished\" soon after the fatwa. However, <em>Joseph Anton</em> describes more accurately, if inadvertently, how Rushdie re-emerged, after the strangest ever writerly journey, in the gossip pages, aureoled by the wealth, power and glamour of the western world.</p> <p>Understandably, proximity to doting US senators in the \"heart of American power\" would prove exhilarating for someone miserably on the run from a murderous regime; and it is one of the grotesque ironies of Rushdie's situation that freedom for him should become synonymous with a private plane with a \"Ralph Lauren interior\", and a nine-car motorcade with motorcycle outriders.&#xa0;But the moral autonomy of literature, or the dignity of the individual artist, is not affirmed when a celebrated writer exults over being in the same \"mighty room\" as Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy and Nicolas Sarkozy.</p> <p>A naive beguilement rather than sly irony frames Rushdie's accounts of hanging out with such very famous people as Jerry Seinfeld and Calista Flockhart. Madonna, narrowly missed at Tina Brown's immortal launch party for Talk magazine, is finally encountered at Vanity Fair's Oscars bash in the company of Zadie Smith. At lunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Warren Beatty confesses that Padma Lakshmi, Rushdie's fourth wife, is so beautiful that it makes him \"want to faint\". And William Styron's genitalia are unexpectedly on display one convivial evening at Martha's Vineyard.</p> <p>In this remembrance of parties and celebrities past, as in much of Rushdie's later fiction, eclecticism amounts to a disconcerting absence of discrimination \u2013 and tact. We learn uneasily of, among other infidelities, his wine-induced adultery with Jack Lang's \"beautiful and brilliant daughter\". His wives themselves are described much less flatteringly as gold-diggers or nags, squeezing Anton for more alimony or progeny. Cuttingly titled \"His Millenarian Illusion\", the chapter about his marriage to Padma Lakshmi tries to show that his fourth wife's \"grand ambition and secret plans\" for wealth and fame had \"nothing to do with the fulfilment of his deepest needs\".</p> <p>A similar longing for self-affirmation fuels Rushdie's geopolitical analysis, where an obsession with the \"poison\" of \"actually existing Islam\" suppresses all nuance suggested by political and historical facts. He accuses Khomeini of taking \"his country into a useless war with its neighbours\" and sees more evidence of Muslim irrationalism in the frenzied mourning provoked in Iran by the old fanatic's death. In fact, it was Saddam Hussein who invaded Iran, and then assaulted it with chemical weapons, with the consent, even support, of western countries. This not only stoked a long-simmering anti-westernism in Iran, which had been occupied by Russia and Britain during both world wars, and then suffered for decades the brutal dictatorship of the pro-American shah. The second longest intra-nation war of the 20th century, which killed nearly one million Iranians, also entrenched the Basij militia and Revolutionary Guards, made life harder for the moderates who cancelled Khomeini's fatwa, and eventually helped bring Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power.</p> <p>One would respect Rushdie's wish to decline close scrutiny of a radioactive history and politics that have caused him so much distress. But he is too invested in his self-image as an unpopular \"Cassandra for his own time\". Back in 1989, he claims, \"nobody wanted to know what he knew\" \u2013 that a \"self-exculpatory, paranoiac Islam is an ideology with widespread appeal\" \u2013 and we didn't get this even after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, which, among other things, vindicated his critically ill-treated but evidently prophetic novel <em>Fury</em>.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/opinion/02RUSH.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">Of course this is 'about Islam'</a>,\" Rushdie quickly retorted in a New York Times op-ed to those who argued that 9/11 \"isn't about Islam\", or like Susan Sontag, a loyal friend and supporter, described the attacks as \"a consequence of&#xa0;specific&#xa0;American alliances and actions\", such as the support of Saudi Arabia and fundamentalists in Afghanistan. According to him, \"the restoration of religion to the sphere of the personal, its depoliticisation, is the nettle that all Muslim societies must grasp in order to become modern.\"</p> <p>This French-style secularisation was and remains a tall order \u2013 even in the United States and much of Christian Europe. In the meantime, Rushdie seemed content to endorse the Anglo-American assault on Afghanistan, and, claiming that another \"war of liberation might just be one worth fighting\", hailed the CIA-sponsored conman Ahmad Chalabi as \"the most likely first leader of a democratised Iraq\".&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Joseph Anton</em>, obscuring these stumbles, presents Rushdie as confidently in step with the march of history. \"The world of Islam,\" he reminds us he had written in 2001, \"must take on board the secularist-humanist principles on which the modern is based\"; in 2011 \"the young people of the Arab world\" \"tried to transform their societies according to exactly these principles\".</p> <p>Since Egyptians and Tunisians have subsequently elected Islamic parties to power, Rushdie has now changed his mind. Things have \"gone very wrong\", <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/13/epiphanies_an_interview_with_salman_rushdie\" title=\"\">he recently told Foreign Policy</a>. \"One has to say that the Arab Spring is over.\" Maybe, but long before Egypt and Tunisia, large majorities elected Islamic parties in the biggest and economically most successful Muslim countries, Turkey and Indonesia, where they supervised a transition from military despotism to electoral democracy.</p> <p>In Iran itself a mass movement drawing on Islamic notions of justice and morality has ranged itself against Khomeini's discredited heirs. Fanatics and fundamentalists, non-Muslim as well as Muslim, remain a blight on many South Asian and Middle Eastern societies; sometimes, they violently disrupt public life in the west. But, arguably, it is the institutionalised procedures of torture, rendition, indefinite detention, extrajudicial execution through drones, secret trials and surveillance that have emerged in the west as the more serious threat to civil and human rights. The icon of free speech today is the Wikilieaks source Bradley Manning, fully exposed in his degrading confinement to the malevolence of an omnipotent intelligence and military establishment.</p> <p>Meanwhile, cut-price white supremacists gunning down Sikhs, bombing mosques and burning the Qur'an, and the Nordic nationalist massacring multiculturalists and left-wingers have taken Rushdie's reform-minded diagnosis of a \"fanatical cancer\" within Muslim communities to another level. \"Islam is a cancer, period,\" according to the sinister California-based filmmaker whose calumnies about the Prophet provoke riots across the Muslim world. At the same time, western states, after waging calamitously ill-conceived wars that killed and mutilated hundreds of thousands of Muslims, pursue a face-saving deal with people described by Rushdie as \"fascist, terrorist gangsters\" \u2013 the Taliban.</p> <p>Certainly, Rushdie's neat oppositions between the secular and the religious, the light and the dark, and rational literary elites and irrational masses do not clarify the great disorder of the contemporary world. They belong to an intellectually simpler time, when non-western societies, politically insignificant and little-known, could be judged solely by their success or failure in following the great example of the secular-humanist west; and writing literary fiction could seem enough to make one feel, <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1999/may/06/gods-monsters/?page=1\" title=\"\">as Tim Parks wrote in a review</a> of Rushdie's novel <em>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</em>, \"engaged on the right side of some global moral and political battle\".</p> <p>Indeed, such complacencies of imperial intellectual cultures were what Rushdie had bravely attacked in his brilliant early phase. \"Works of art, even works of entertainment,\" he had pointed out in 1984, \"do not come into being in a social and political vacuum; and \u2026 the way they operate in a society cannot be separated from politics, from history. For every text, a context.\" No text in our time has had contexts more various and illuminating than <em>The Satanic Verses</em>, or mixed politics and literature more inextricably, and with deeper consequences for so many. In <em>Joseph Anton</em>, however, Rushdie continues to reveal an unwillingness or inability to grasp them, or to abandon the conceit, useful in fiction but misleading outside it, that the personal is the geopolitical.</p> <p>\u2022 Pankaj Mishra's <em>From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia</em> is published by Allen Lane.</p>",
  "<p>In 1901, the total population of the Bangladeshi areas of British India was less than 2%. Now, more than a century later, urban planners are predicting the country's future will be one of sprawling, interconnected metropolises with a largely urban population moving between hundreds of cities and large towns.</p> <p>Last year, the national census showed that out of a population of more than 150 million, just under 30% live in the rapidly expanding cities and towns, with the urban population increasing about 6% a year as millions of people leave rural areas in search of work.</p> <p>Dhaka absorbs many of those on the move. Its sprawling slums are testament to the capital's struggle to accommodate the millions of new residents. Land is so scarce that people have filled in rivers around the city to make space for new housing. Mass evictions are on the rise as landowners clear out slums to make way for more profitable building projects. New residents are increasingly pushed out to the city's fringes.</p> <p>The government's refusal to acknowledge either the slums or the fact that 40% of Dhaka residents are now slum dwellers means that public service budgets \u2013 and basic facilities like water and electricity \u2013 are not being extended to accommodate the millions of new residents.</p> <p>While many rural districts now have an accessible community outreach healthcare system in place, in Dhaka the vast majority of healthcare services are still based in hospitals.</p> <p>According to healthcare workers, hospitals are already unable to meet the growing demand for treatment and services. Dhaka's largest hospital is operating at 50% staff capacity and trying to accommodate 3,000 patients in a facility with just 800 beds.</p> <p>Many rural migrants, fearful of hidden costs, are reluctant to access hospital or clinic-based services at all. And since no healthcare facilities are provided in the slums, Dhaka's newest \u2013 and poorest \u2013 residents are facing a healthcare black hole.</p> <p>Those who most often fall through the cracks are women. While urbanisation presents significant advantages for rural women and girls, not least the opportunity to join the burgeoning female workforce in garment factories and middle-class households, women in the slums are left without any kind of antenatal or child healthcare services.</p> <p>After Bangladesh's impressive strides in improving maternal and child healthcare nationwide, the Manoshi project is one of the initiatives that aims to bridge this gap and prevent urbanisation creating a freefall in maternal and infant mortality levels.</p> <p>The project, run by Bangladeshi NGO <a href=\"http://www.brac.net/\" title=\"\">Brac</a>, was launched in 2007 and is currently helping 3 million female slum dwellers access maternal and newborn healthcare services.</p> <p>A network of 6,000 volunteer healthcare workers \u2013 each responsible for 200 households \u2013 offers women care from family planning through to antenatal services. These services include awareness programmes for family members, labour preparation programmes and regular medical checks. But only 34 volunteers work in Korail, one of Dhaka's largest slums.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, 78% of births still occur at home. The Korail programme has installed a labour room in its central office to replicate the home-birth environment, but with trained midwives and traditional birth attendants on hand to ensure births are as risk-free as possible. An emergency referral system enables women who need to be transferred to hospital to be taken there as quickly as possible, with transport provided.</p> <p>\"There's no point demanding these women give birth in hospital, because they are reluctant to do so and, even if we put pressure on them to go, when they arrive they will probably find there is no room for them,\" says Dr Rashed Choudhury, manager of the Brac health programme. \"We're prioritising creating a safe and familiar environment for them to get the best care possible.\"</p> <p>The project has almost halved the number of maternal deaths among its patients, from 294 for every 100,000 live births in 2007 to 135 now \u2013 a figure below the national average of 194 per 100,000.</p> <p>The next challenge is to meet increasing demand and keep track of women as they move from slum to slum. Korail was the site of a controversial eviction this year; similar episodes are not unlikely.</p> <p>Brac healthworkers say maternal health in Dhaka is beginning to reflect the challenges of urbanisation. \"Mothers are facing more new dangers than they did in the rural areas,\" says Choudhury. \"We're seeing a lot of jaundice from polluted water sources, infants severely affected by poor sanitation, and mothers severely undernourished. We will have to adapt to all these things if we're going to respond to the needs of millions of people in Dhaka in the coming years.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was amended on 19 September 2012. The original article said the urban population of Bangladesh was 2%, there were 6,000 volunteers in Korail, the maternal mortality rate was 297 per 100,000 live births and there were 4.1 million slum dwellers</em></p>",

Cameron is still beating Miliband in many polls asking who would make a good prime minister.</p> <p>The strategists take comfort from the fact that although they are often trailing Labour by 10 points, the bulk of Labour's lead has been amassed by Tory voters switching to Ukip, or by former Liberal Democrat voters deserting Nick Clegg's party. They believe few former Tory voters have switched directly to Miliband because of his actions or leadership.</p> <p>Conservatives believe that voters recognise the UK economy is locked into an ever more competitive global contest for jobs, and will portray Labour's deficit-cutting plans as superficially attractive comfort food that is ultimately damaging.

Many in the party believe Leveson has made his task more difficult by allowing the inquiry to roam so widely, including exploring the circumstances of News Corp's bid for BSkyB. Labour has opened a 15-point lead over the Conservatives, according to a Times/Populus poll last night. There was some comfort for the prime minister, however, as the poll showed 60% of respondents wanted Cameron to remain in his post. The poll put Labour on 45%, the Tories on 30%, and the Lib Dems on 10%.</p>",
  "<p>We left her a woman destroyed; emotions tattered by cruel betrayals, body intact rather more by luck than judgment, and partner \u2013 once more \u2013 decidedly dead. For Sarah Lund, left hollow by the horrors of The Killing's first mystery, just surviving the second was a triumph. The third and final series of BBC4's Danish crime drama will surely not let the detective off easily.</p> <p>In Copenhagen on Monday night, prior to a screening of the opening two episodes of Forbrydelsen III \u2013 expected on British screens in November \u2013 fans were mulling over the big questions about Lund's possible return to crime-solving. Not least: who in their right mind would ever volunteer to be her partner?</p> <p>Quick out of the blocks, it takes a scant few minutes for the Killing 3 to start addressing those queries \u2013 not to mention tackle the great jumper reveal. But predictably, the drama does so in a manner that is less than entirely straightforward. (To spare you spoilers, I am attempting to be equally cryptic.) Lund's trademark heavy knitwear, for instance, is briefly usurped by a uniform with shining buttons and braid. The question of a partner seems potentially muddied by a history only partly revealed. And Lund appears marked terribly by past events.</p> <p>But then, when hasn't that last point been true? Another astonishing, verging-on-unprofessional, kick-ass Scandinavian policewoman may have graced BBC4 of late, but it is Lund's return that quickens the heart. Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l's portrayal of the single-minded, unconventional, at times infuriating detective has always been at the heart of Forbrydelsen \u2013 and here she reprises that subtle, nuanced performance as Lund once more struggles to navigate both family and career. It is to Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l's great credit that we care so much about a character who in many ways gives us so little.</p> <p>Lund's state of mind has always owed a great deal to the progress of her current investigations \u2013 a situation that many viewers, hooked by The Killing's brilliantly plotted mysteries, might recognise. But it is the show's preoccupation with issues beyond the traditional \"whodunnit\" that elevates it above other crime dramas. And, after a second series that moved up a gear in terms of political storytelling with mixed results, the new series feels on a firmer footing.</p> <p>Politics, of course, remain at the heart of Forbrydelsen, with the global recession, big business and national politics placed centre stage in this third tale. But there are also many echoes of the first series, with its balance of police, politics and, crucially, a family touched by crime. At one point, a scene reveals cops combing a wood at night, in what feels almost a homage to our first hours in the presence of Lund.</p> <p>She, of course, is still running around dark and scary places without bothering to so much as flick a light switch.</p> <p>Like the second series, this Killing mystery lasts 10 episodes, and starts at quite a lick: by the end of the second episode, I was not only totally immersed in what is a largely new dramatic world, save for Lund, her family, and the odd colleague, I was wondering how I could persuade someone to show me the next eight episodes immediately.</p> <p>In fact, BBC4 will be broadcasting the show this autumn only a couple of months after it is broadcast in Denmark. Fans will, however, have to savour every last scene: I am told this will definitely be the detective's final outing. Question is: will it also be the one that finally gets the better of her?</p>"
