  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland's involvement in the Libor rigging scandal could be worse than Barclays' and may force the state-owned bank to pay a bigger fine than its UK rival, an MP has claimed.</p> <p>John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury select committee, said \"City insiders\" had suggested RBS's involvement may be \"noticeably worse\" than Barclays'.</p> <p>Barclays was forced to pay \u00a3290m in June by US and British authorities for its role in trying to manipulate Libor, which affect the cost of borrowing for millions of customers around the world.</p> <p>More than a dozen banks, including RBS, are under investigation by regulators in the US, Europe and Asia for suspected rigging of the London interbank offered rate (Libor), which is used to price trillions of dollars of financial products. RBS chief executive Stephen Hester has already warned that the bank is likely to face fines. It is thought that Barclays received a reduced fine for settling early.</p> <p>Mann is asking George Osborne whether he or Treasury officials have been briefed on the issue, and when the FSA inquiry into Libor fixing at RBS began. He said: \"It's not credible that UKFI, who represents the main shareholder ie, the taxpayer, was not kept informed of the investigation and it's seriousness. Either George Osborne is failing to run the Treasury properly or he is failing to tell parliament what he knows.\"</p> <p>UK Financial Investments (UKFI) controls the taxpayer's 82% stake in RBS.</p> <p>Mann's concerns have been heightened by City minister Mark Hoban's claim that he only learned of the scandal in recent times. Mann asked: \"Why was the City Minister kept in the dark and who else has been kept in the dark?</p> <p>\"If Osborne denies receiving any information there needs to be a full Cabinet Secretary investigation into the running of the UK taxpayers investment in RBS; the failure to protect future share values and the liability of both Osborne and UKFI if losses accrue to the taxpayer due to a lack of due diligence.\" Mann suggested that Osborne's position is compromised because he has based his fiscal projections on an anticipated windfall from the reprivatisation of RBS.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said it would not comment on a current investigation.</p> <p>Mann's comments came as a former RBS trader claimed that the bank's internal checks were so lax that anyone could change Libor rates. Court documents filed in Singapore show that Tan Chi Min, who is suing RBS for wrongful dismissal, claimed that in 2008 a trader for the bank, Will Hall, changed the Libor submission even though he was part of the Japanese yen swap desk in London.</p> <p>The papers show that Tan, who worked for RBS in Singapore, raised the issue at his disciplinary meeting last September, saying the bank's internal procedure in London seemed to be that \"anyone can change Libor\".</p> <p>Tan alleges that the bank's minutes of his disciplinary meeting omitted details of this and other conversations about how traders at the bank tried to influence RBS's interbank lending rate submissions.</p> <p>He was sacked in November as head of delta trading for RBS's global banking and markets division for trying to improperly influence the bank's rate setters. Delta trading involves using derivatives to mirror price moves in a basket of securities.</p> <p>Tan filed a lawsuit against the bank late last year, claiming the practice of traders making requests to the bank's rate setters was well known by RBS management.</p> <p>RBS is disputing the allegations, saying Tan was dismissed for gross misconduct and that it followed its company disciplinary policy in deciding to terminate his contract. It has already announced that it has sacked several employees for misconduct as a result of its investigations.</p> <p>Tan is claiming a loss of \u00a3693,000 in bonuses and 3.3m RBS shares.</p> <p>The bank reiterated that it \"continues to co-operate fully with ongoing investigations relating to the setting of Libor and other interest rates\".The Libor scandal, which has engulfed the banking industry, led to the resignation of three senior Barclays executives \u2013 chief executive Bob Diamond, his former right-hand man Jerry del Missier and chairman Marcus Agius, who was subsequently reinstated to search for a new chief executive.</p> <p>Barclays has appointed Sir David Walker as chairman from 1 November, when Agius will step down, but is still looking for a replacement for Diamond.</p> <p>Last week MPs accused Diamond of being \"highly selective\" in the evidence he gave to their emergency hearings on rigging Libor interest rates. The Treasury select committee also criticised the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, the chief City regulator, for not acting sooner: the FSA's investigation of Libor was two years behind the US.</p> <p>The Bank of England will take over the lead role in banking regulation next year when the FSA is disbanded.</p> <p>Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, has also admitted that a \"limited number\" of its staff were involved in the possible manipulation of Libor rates. HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and UBS are also under investigation.</p> <p>UK regulators are looking into instituting a reform of the Libor rates are set. Currently, they are compiled from a number of banks submitting their estimate of the price they would need to pay to borrow from other banks over periods ranging from overnight to 12 months, in a range of currencies.</p>",
  "<p>An excellent new album by a young band from Zimbabwe, a country that was a powerhouse of African music back in the 1980s. Mokoomba are from Victoria Falls in the north, and they blend local Tonga and global influences in their varied, self-written songs. Rising Tide starts out with the furious Njoka, including funk and rap elements, and is helped along by excellent guitar work from Trustworth Samende. Lead singer Mathias Muzaza demonstrates his powerful vocals in soulful songs that echo the country's greatest musical hero, Oliver Mtukudzi, before switching direction to bring in West African and Latin sounds, plus a dash of reggae. The impressive production is by Manou Gallo from the Ivory Coast, who once played bass for Zap Mama; here she adds keyboards and fills out the sound by using 13 guest musicians, playing everything from brass to kora and cello.</p>",
  "<p>It was a risk worth taking and a point worth making. Brendan Rodgers was accused of an affront to Scottish football and the Europa League with his team selection against Heart of Midlothian but it also showed his employers at Liverpool the stretch on his resources to qualify for European football's poor relation, never mind the Champions League.</p> <p>Tom Werner was present at Tynecastle to witness Rodgers' team secure a fortunate but valuable away win and the manager must hope the arrival of the Liverpool chairman on British soil signifies the start of a productive spell in the transfer market. Better late than never. The early indications suggest this is the case, with Nuri Sahin on the brink of a season-long loan move to Anfield from Real Madrid despite Arsenal's prolonged pursuit of the Turkey international. Sahin may undergo a medical on Merseyside as Rodgers desperately seeks to improve the technical ability of the Liverpool midfield.</p> <p>For the first leg of the Europa League play-off Rodgers' favoured a three-man central midfield featuring players who could be elsewhere when the transfer window closes at the end of the month, or would be if the manager could afford to reduce the squad further and those players were prepared to leave. Jonjo Shelvey was offered to Swansea City in Liverpool's first offer for Joe Allen, Bolton Wanderers want Jay Spearing and Liverpool are open to \u00a35m bids for Charlie Adam. Rodgers had hoped to start with Andy Carroll in attack for the first time this season but the centre-forward, another who Rodgers had hoped to sell to swell his transfer budget, was unavailable after suffering a hamstring problem on the eve of the game.</p> <p>As a former Rangers midfielder, Adam received a predictably hostile reception from the Hearts supporters every time he touched the ball. There must have been occasions when Rodgers was tempted to join in. His demand for possession football and intelligent passing, evident in spells at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday prior to the second-half collapse, was again lost on many of those charged with the responsibility.</p> <p>Adam was by no means the worst offender. Shelvey sprayed some dreadful, long-range passes out of play, dangerously across his own defence or straight to a Hearts player when a shorter and simpler option was available. Spearing was also careless on occasion in front of the Liverpool defence, Jordan Henderson remained on the periphery and the instruction to play out of defence even under pressure caused similar problems to those experienced at The Hawthorns.</p> <p>As Rodgers has said repeatedly, the development of a team structure and style will take time. He is also aware that time is a commodity managers rarely receive, particularly in a demanding environment such as Liverpool, but at least there was no added burden in the Europa League thanks to Andy Webster's own goal.</p> <p>The work-rate could not be faulted and there was satisfaction on offer to Rodgers in the contributions of Raheem Sterling and Jack Robinson on the left. Fabio Borini's link-up play, though not his finishing, with the Italian striker hitting the post when sent clean through by Sterling, also impressed in the central role vacated by Carroll.</p> <p>Liverpool need young players to emerge more than ever this season as senior players leave to reduce the wage bill. The performance from Sterling, who gained in confidence and composure as his full debut wore on, provided hope in that regard.</p> <p>Given the problems in Scottish football and the paucity of the resources available to the Hearts manager, John McGlynn, it may sound rich of Rodgers to publicly wish for further signings or to question Liverpool's spending after a \u00a3120m outlay in 2011. As the banner in the Liverpool end lamented: \"Against Mod\u00a3rn Football\". But this is a manager and a club under pressure to return to the Champions League and aiming to change its recent direction, style and personnel for \u00a320m, plus monies raised from player sales. It is some ask.</p> <p>Rodgers can only hope for rapid development on and off the pitch in the coming days. On Sunday he faces Manchester City in his first Premier League game at Anfield as the Liverpool manager and on the back of the 3-0 defeat at Albion. Hence the decision to leave Luis Su\u00e1rez, Steven Gerrard, Martin Skrtel and Glen Johnson behind and to start with a team containing four players likely to start on Sunday: Pepe Reina, Jamie Carragher, Martin Kelly and Borini.</p> <p>Whether the impending arrival of Sahin prompts a flurry of signings is likely to depend on off-loading others but there has been an absence of suitable offers for Carroll, Adam and Daniel Agger. It was striking that, when speaking of his confidence that Agger will stay despite Manchester City's advances, Rodgers should say: \"Like every player in the group, if someone comes in with a big offer then that might be out of my hands in relation to the club and where it is at with finances.\"</p> <p>It was only a few months ago that Werner proclaimed Liverpool had the resources to compete with any club in the world. There is a clear need to prove it in the final week of the window.</p>",
  "<p>\"I've always had the tendency to cause trouble,\" says Maryam Keshavarz. The 36-year-old is speaking down the line from an idyllic-sounding writers' retreat in Portugal, but with the release of Circumstance in the UK this week, the first-time director is not far from controversy.</p> <p>Set in Iran, the film follows two girls: Atafeh, raised in a rich liberal home, and Shireen, an orphan whose conservative uncle cannot afford to pay for her schooling. Against a backdrop of hedonistic underground parties, the teenagers' intense friendship spills over into a passionate love affair. With <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/17/iran-persecution-gay-community-revealed\" title=\"\">homosexuality illegal</a> in Iran (punishable by lashings or even death) their happiness is threatened by the jealousy of Atafeh's brother, an ex-drug addict who finds religion and with it the ear of the powerful morality police.</p> <p>Replete with illicit sex, drugs and alcohol, and furious in its criticism of the Islamic Republic, the movie's forthright style has made Keshavarz a target of death threats, she says. On the phone from Lisbon she sounds nonchalant, saying that \"in the beginning I was more frightened\", but insisting there have been so many, they no longer have the power to terrorise her. Yet she is cautious enough to refuse to reveal much.</p> <p>The film has also aroused passionate feelings in audiences at screenings, leading to arguments and walkouts. \"There were screaming matches,\" she laughs. \"One woman said: 'This film is such bullshit \u2013 it doesn't look like Iran, smell like Iran, taste like Iran.' I didn't even have a chance to reply when this woman in her 20s stood up and shouted at the older woman: 'I just came from Iran and it's people like you who are ruining our country because you deny the reality.'\" But her taboo-busting has also won critical acclaim (and the audience award at the Sundance film festival) while fans, many of whom are young women, have sent scores of \"long, emotional, emails\".</p> <p>Which is why, despite knowing that the focus on sexuality meant it was unlikely she would be able to travel to Iran again \u2013 \"You can always go to Iran,\" she tells me sardonically, \"you can't necessarily leave\" \u2013 Keshavarz, who is bisexual, was determined to show the physical interactions of the lovers.</p> <p>\"As a young girl growing up, I had not seen much on film I could identify with \u2013 not just sexual orientation but&#xa0;sexuality.</p> <p>\"They [Atafeh and Shireen] are brave individuals \u2013 they don't stop, they have an emotion and attraction and even though it could get them into trouble they still do it.\"</p> <p>Critics of the film have questioned its authenticity, and whether Keshavarz has the right to tell stories about Iran at all, given she does not live in the country. She was born and brought up in the US, where her parents have lived since the 1960s. But, she says, she has spent much of her life shuttling between the countries \u2013 spending summer holidays, a year of school, and time as a visiting scholar at the University of Shiraz in Iran. That has not always been easy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395103792\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345732520873/Maryam-Keshavarz-001.jpg\" alt=\"Maryam Keshavarz\" width=\"210\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maryam Keshavarz, director of Circumstance. Photograph: Peccadillo Films</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peccadillo Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"It was difficult on both ends to be from two countries that hated each other,\" she admits. \"In Iran it was all 'death to America' and 'you are American, you are a spy!'\"</p> <p>After students stormed the US embassy in Tehran in the 1970s, and took staff hostage, the family's US neighbours violently rejected them.</p> <p>\"Before Iran was this exotic place, but after the hostage-taking we were the enemy. My brothers were beaten up, they threw things at our windows and slashed our tyres,\" she recalls. \"They harassed us constantly. We were&#xa0;ostracised \u2013 it was a very, very difficult time.\"</p> <p>While some of her brothers (she has seven) responded by hiding their ethnicity, the experience sparked Keshavarz's lifelong attempt to \"translate\" the two countries to each other. Many of the film's characters were based on relatives or people she met during her time in Iran. The parties Atafeh and Shireen attend reflect her nights out with her cousins \u2013 ironically the only time she could do as she pleased as a teenager.</p> <p>\"I grew up in an ultra-religious family. I wasn't allowed to date boys or go out after a certain time. When I made the varsity basketball team as a freshman \u2013 which was a big honour \u2013 you had to wear shorts, so my dad said: 'You can't play.' Of course I did what I wanted, but I constantly had these huge battles with him. Luckily I had really liberal-minded brothers who helped me a lot.</p> <p>\"My father always had a tight hold on my social life \u2013 he was afraid I would be corrupted, but Iran is supposed to be an Islamic state so they thought 'what trouble could she get into?' The craziest parties I have been to and the wildest things I have done were definitely in Iran.\"</p> <p>Circumstance, she says, reflects issues in both cultures \u2013 and, while set in Iran and scripted in Farsi, its glossiness and pace feel American. The theme of surveillance \u2013 which culminates in Atafeh's brother secretly filming the lovers \u2013 addresses anxieties around officially sanctioned snooping in the US during the Bush era. But it also illustrates how the state can permeate and sour family life; she first saw this, aged seven, when she spent a year in school in Iran at the height of the Iran-Iraq war.</p> <p>\"Questioning children was very prevalent at the time,\" she tells me. \"They would ask 'do your parents pray?' or 'do you watch foreign movies?'</p> <p>\"I was from the school system in America, where you are taught to always tell the truth no matter what. But [in Iran] you knew you could get your family in trouble so you learned to lie.</p> <p>\"I was very much aware that I had to be careful what I said \u2013 and it creates a schism in children, I think. I had cousins who were my age and some of them were,\" she drops her voice and whispers, mock-dramatically, \"<em>the spies</em> for the teachers.\"</p> <p>Circumstance's strength is in the exuberance of Atafeh and Shireen, filled with adolescent fantasies of escape (and cringeworthy lad's mag-style fantasies of each other: all matching underwear and high heels) and their rebellious rush to dance, drink and break rules. At times the sensuous hair-flicking and the way the camera lingers on their beauty feels overdone and their interest in liberalism seems to extend only to their right to party.</p> <p>But the film frames their insistence on following their desires, whatever the consequences, as a powerful form of dissent; Atafeh tells a friend: \"Here&#xa0;anything illegal becomes politically subversive.\"</p> <p>Set immediately before the protests of the Green movement swept through Iran, the film aims to show where the anger behind the demonstrations came from. \"In Iran where the state controls your behaviour \u2026 they want you to dress a certain way, and not speak to people of the opposite sex in the street \u2013 of course the personal is political,\" explains Keshavarz, \"in a more explicit way than anywhere else.\"</p> <p>And while the film's religious figures may be hypocrites and villains, Keshavarz is uncomfortable with anyone reading the film as anti-religion. Rather, she says, it is about how power and politics corrupt religion.</p> <p>\"It is happening in the US too, with the intrusion of the church into politics. It's a global problem. Look at the focus on birth control in America. It's 2012, and we are talking about the pill \u2013 are we joking?\"</p> <p>Crucially, she says, it is her religious parents, who refused to impose their beliefs on her, and insisted she think for herself, who gave her the strength to make a film her mother disapproves of. \"I think my parents taught me to be a fighter \u2013 I just don't think they intended it to come out the way it did.\"</p> <p>Circumstance is released in the UK on 24 August</p>",
  "<p>Germany and France have ratcheted up the pressure on the Greek government by insisting that Athens stick to its hardline austerity plans in order to remain a member of the eurozone.</p> <p>Before meetings with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin on Friday and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in Paris on Saturday, the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, was given little hope that the two biggest EU economies were prepared to soften their approach.</p> <p>Hollande, speaking at a meeting with Merkel in Berlin on Thursday night, said he wanted Greece to remain in the single currency but that the recession-stricken country had to carry out the reforms it had promised.</p> <p>Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's finance minister, flatly rejected Samaras's plea that Greece be given two extra years to put its finances back on track.</p> <p>A decision on whether Athens should be allowed more time will be taken next month by the \"troika\" \u2013 the European Central Bank, the EU and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 but Sch\u00e4uble said it was only six months ago that a second package of help had been provided.</p> <p>\"You cannot just say after half a year, all of that is not enough, because then you will never win the confidence of financial markets,\" he said on Germany's SWR radio.</p> <p>\"So more time is not a solution for the problems. The question is how we win back confidence.\"</p> <p>The existing programme for Greece \"must be implemented, and in case of doubt more time means more money\", Sch\u00e4uble continued. \"And more money would require a new programme.\"</p> <p>The Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, urged Germany to take a tough line on Greece. \"I say to the German government that it is best for it to stick with its strict position,\" he said in an interview with the FT Deutschland newspaper. \"Delaying correct measures helps nobody, not even the Greeks.\"</p> <p>Data released on Thursday showed Germany was now being affected by the crisis in the 17-nation eurozone and by the slowdown in the wider global economy.</p> <p>A survey by Markit of the business climate pointed to output declining by about 0.5% in the third quarter, putting the eurozone on course for a double-dip recession. The findings for Germany edged down for a seventh successive month to stand at 47 \u2013 below the 50 level that marks the cutoff between expansion and contraction.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Overall, the survey provided yet another reminder that a chronic lack of economic growth in the eurozone will continue to act as a major impediment to efforts to bring the debt crisis to an end.\"</p> <p>Data from China and the US \u2013 the two other powerhouses of the global economy \u2013 also showed signs of weakness.</p> <p>The HSBC Flash \u2013 or preliminary \u2013 China manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers' index) fell to 47.8 in August, its lowest level since November, while the number of Americans applying for first-time jobless benefits rose unexpectedly last week.</p> <p>Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said: \"The indicators taken as a whole indicate a material slowdown in the pace of the world economy.\"</p>",
  "<p>A pair of dark eyes peers through a narrow slit in a high green metal gate, watching people waiting to enter.

More than 100 attempted hijackings off the coast of east Africa have been foiled so far this year, and dozens of pirates captured \u2013 raising the question of what to do with them. None of the countries in the region have been prepared to take responsibility for bandits captured at sea.</p> <p>Step up the breakaway enclave of Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia in 1991 but is not officially recognised, and volunteered its territory in an attempt to enhance its international standing.</p> <p>The prison holds 313 prisoners, including 17 pirates convicted in the Seychelles and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/29/somalia-somaliland-piracy-idUSL6E8ES5O520120329\" title=\"\">flown to Hargeisa in March</a>. Finding countries willing to prosecute the pirates has also been difficult. Seychelles changed its laws last year to allow pirates captured anywhere beyond its territorial waters to be put on trial, although it has turned down some requests.</p> <p>The deal to transfer the 17 from Seychelles to Somaliland was signed in London between the leaders of the two territories in February. President James Michel of the Seychelles and President Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo of Somaliland said the agreement was an important step towards combatting piracy.</p> <p>Inside the Hargeisa prison the atmosphere is relaxedut several of the prisoners complain they have been unjustly convicted.</p> <p>\"There were six of us in the boat, fishing,\" said Ahmed Khalif, 21, wearing a bright orange T-shirt. \"We could see the lights of Mogadishu in the distance. We were arrested and taken to the Seychelles. At the trial, we didn't have lawyers and we didn't know the language.\" Khalif was sentenced to 10 years in jail.</p> <p>Abdi Gadir, who was jailed for 24 years for the same crime, complained about the discrepancy in sentences.</p> <p>Mawlid Ahmed, also jailed for 10 years, said the men did not have a chance to appeal against the convictions.</p> <p>The prison commander, Omer Said Ali, echoed their concerns. \"I don't know the particular points of the case or whether they are telling the truth,\" he said, \"but they do have a right to appeal and it is unfair that they have not had the chance to do so.\"</p> <p>A British barrister who observed a trial of pirates in the Seychelles last year has raised questions about the legal process. Tim Moloney QC said: \"Whilst every effort was made by the parties and the trial judge to ensure that the proceedings were fair, there was a marked inequality of resources between the prosecution and defence which was capable of producing injustice. All five defendants were represented by a single lawyer. He had no instructions from the alleged pirates as to their defence to the charges and was simply testing the prosecution case.\"</p> <p>Moloney pointed out that one of the five defendants claimed he was forced into taking part in piracy after being held hostage following an earlier raid.</p> <p>\"With one lawyer representing all the defendants, such a defence simply could not emerge,\" he said.</p> <p>Even the military admits that the truth can be difficult to establish. Captain Jeremy Hill, commander of the American frigate USS Taylor, part of the Nato counter-piracy mission, said this year it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/08/outgunned-somali-pirates-luck\" title=\"\">hard to distinguish between legitimate fishermen and pirates</a>.</p> <p>But with the new Somali government intent on joining Nato and international navies in cracking down on piracy, which is said to have cost the world economy more than $6.6bn in 2011, little is likely to change for the convicted pirates in Hargeisa.</p> <p>The prisoners say they had requested to be transferred to Hargeisa mainly so they could be closer to their families in Mogadishu. However, none of them have yet received a family visit.</p> <p>\"We have not seen our families,\" said one prisoner. \"The food here is not good. We get rice, tomatoes and only a little bit of meat. In Seychelles the food was better.\"</p>",
  "<p>For international batsmen of a certain era, a menacing aroma meant there was no mistaking when West Indies were in town. The nostrils gave it away; the whiff of leather used to get stronger. In the early 1980s, if you negotiated an over of Malcolm Marshall, your prize was a tussle with Joel Garner or Michael Holding. Their attack made the expression \"one-paced\" sound ominous.</p> <p>But somewhere along the way \u2013 historians will point you towards the retirements of the two Cs, Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose a decade ago \u2013 intimidation was lost. And it is a sign of how the global game has changed \u2013 with the proliferation of slow pitches and advent of 20-over cricket \u2013 that while they used to grip you in fear, they now tie you in knots.</p> <p>You see, the 30-man provisional squad named by West Indies for next month's World Twenty20 contained than 10 spinners. No, that was not a misprint. A third of their party were capable twirlers. Such are the capabilities of the premier ones among them that Darren Sammy's team are serious contenders to snatch away England's crown in spin-friendly Sri Lanka next month. You certainly won't find a reputable bookmaker willing to offer pre-tournament odds in excess of 7-1.</p> <p>In Sunil Narine, West Indies possess a trump card in subcontinental conditions. In the spring, he outbowled all the homegrown spinners to claim 24 wickets for Indian Premier League champions Kolkata Knight Riders, a tally that earned him the man-of-the-tournament award. So whereas the whoosh of wind past the nose previously signalled danger, the current Caribbean alarm bell is a gentle whirring of the seam as the ball fizzes this way or that. Narine is fundamentally a mystery spinner, whose fleeting presence on the scene to date is arguably his greatest weapon \u2013 batsmen are yet to work him out.</p> <p>Others of his ilk have proved less effective as familiarity has increased, losing their magic like a card trick when the slight of hand is exposed. Australia's John Gleeson and Sri Lanka's Ajantha Mendis are among them.</p> <p>For now, however, there are enough opponents out there still unable to read the \"knuckle ball\" the 24-year-old Narine squeezes out with the aid of his middle and forefinger, that the possessor of international cricket's most-famous Mohawk remains West Indies' main threat. It increases once the opposition get behind the required scoring rate and where West Indies' other frontline spinner comes in.</p> <p>Samuel Badree, a 31-year-old physical education teacher at a Trinidad secondary school and compatriot of Narine, was selected in the final 15 ahead of the giant left-armer Sulieman Benn and fellow leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo, his higher-profile rivals.</p> <p>In previous generations, Badree's career, which comprises 14 first-class wickets over 10 years, would have passed without notice but 20-over cricket has provided a platform for his miserliness. When it comes to Twenty20 he is as tight as a snare drum. Badree, handed his international debut earlier this year, carries a lack of inhibition due to such late and unexpected exposure but with it comes an extraordinarily good T20 record: his career economy rate is 4.59, and the next best by anyone to have played in excess of 25 matches is Narine with 5.28.</p> <p>What makes these figures even more astonishing is that more often than not he takes the new ball and bowls through his entire allocation up front. Back in the autumn of 2008, his spell of 4-0-15-1 for Trinidad &amp; Tobago came within a whisker of embarrassing England during a Stanford Super Series warm-up match.</p> <p>It is the role West Indies want him to play in their quest to become the fourth team to win international cricket's fledgling trophy. With Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels more than capable back-up options on surfaces expected to be receptive to spin, and a batting unit crammed with big hitters, it could all add up to the sweet smell of success.</p> <h2>Tuesday 9.20am update</h2> <p>\u2022 Damien Wright, who is currently touring India with the New Zealand side, announced his resignation on Tuesday, saying \"the decision is related to time away from my family\". He will end his role after next month's world Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka. New Zealand director of cricket John Buchanan said: \"Damien has done a brilliant job since he came on board and will be hard to replace.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/579708.html\">According to Cricinfo</a>, \"Cricket Australia has moved to revamp its strength and conditioning structure by appointing Andrew Weller to the newly created position of physical performance manager.

Exports are growing.</p> <p>Yet from the Cape's sunlit winelands, which have thrived for more than three centuries, comes the distant drumbeat of what some are describing as a \"wine war\" \u2013 against Britain.</p> <p>It emerged this week that South Africa is considering retaliatory measures to counter job losses caused by a British supermarket's move to buy wine in bulk rather than in bottles.</p> <p>Buying in bulk means that hundreds of millions of litres of wine are transported in tankers to a harbour, poured into a giant container and shipped overseas, where the bottling and labelling is done locally.</p> <p>In 2008, 45% of South African wine was exported like this, against 55% that was packaged, bottled and labelled inside South Africa before shipping. But by the start of this year the situation was reversed, with 56% of wine exported in bulk and only 44% pre-packaged.</p> <p>Shipping in bulk appeals to British retailers such as Tesco and Sainsbury because a giant container can hold a higher volume of wine than when it is divided among thousands of bottles. They can also package it more appealingly for local customers.</p> <p>But the trend has so far led to 700 job losses among South Africans who package wine, according to the government, which raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat move on British whisky.</p> <p>Stephen Hanival, chief director of agro-processing at South Africa's trade and industry department, said: \"We certainly hope that the developments on bulk wine don't lead to any kind of trade war between either South Africa, the UK or any of the European Union countries with whom we trade extensively.</p> <p>\"However, South Africa does have a responsibility to protect its trade interests. Our view is that this is a serious risk to the South African wine industry.\"</p> <p>Hanival said UK retailers insisted on bulk wine to save on costs. The UK's Waste and Resource Action Programme had campaigned for retailers there to import wine in bulk \"under the guise\" of environmental concerns, he added. Hanival warned that the problem could spread to other sectors of agriculture such as fruit.</p> <p>Last year South Africa imported 1.7bn rand (\u00a3129m) of British whisky, the department said. It exported wine valued at 993m rand (\u00a375m) to Britain during the same period, a significant trade imbalance, which Hanival suggested could be exploited to South Africa's advantage.</p> <p>\"Why shouldn't South Africa be importing bulk whisky from the UK and bottling it locally, so that we can at least attempt to prevent some of the job losses that we've seen up to now spreading to other parts of the economy?\" he asked.</p> <p>Government spokesman Jimmy Manyi said the cabinet had approved a series of actions to reduce the effect of bulk wine exports. Among nine proposals was a \"study on the impact of possible bulk imports of whisky from the UK\".</p> <p>South Africa's wine industry has seen exports grow more than 200% between 1998 and 2010, with Britain the number one market for packaged wine and number two for bulk. Bulk export figures are up by 31% while exports of wine packaged in South Africa are down by 9% in the first six months of this year.</p> <p>The wine industry loses about 107 jobs for every 10m litres of bulk wine exported, according to a three-year study by <a href=\"http://www.wosa.co.za\" title=\"\">Wines of South Africa</a>.</p> <p>The shift is putting a squeeze on farmers, according to <a href=\"http://www.ssonke.org.za\" title=\"\">Sikhula Sonke</a>, a women-led union of farm workers. Patricia Dyata, its general secretary, said: \"The farmers aren't getting more income. The wine is made on this side and the exporters decide the price, not the farmers.</p> <p>\"So the profits decrease and it does impact on the workers. If we go to negotiate it becomes hard for the salary to increase beyond the minimum wage. If the exporters were willing to pay more, the farmers could pay more and keep people in permanent jobs with benefits.\"</p> <p>Delheim is a family-owned wine farm in Stellenbosch that continues to bottle all its produce locally. But its director, Nora Sperling-Thiel, said: \"I know a lot of the bigger guys had no choice but to move into bulk because of the competition in the UK market.\"</p> <p>Jobs are disappearing, she added. \"The label guys are not even printing any more, the capsule makers and the box makers are being bypassed. The whole packaging industry has been affected. It's not just because of the UK; it's a global trend.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ethiopia's state TV broke the news of the death of prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/21/meles-zenawi-dropout-prime-minister\" title=\"\">Meles Zenawi</a> on Monday night. For weeks, little had been known not only of his health, but also of his whereabouts. Within a few hours world leaders publicly mourned the loss of a figure praised for his diplomatic skills and ability to mediate between competing interests in the region. For the African Union, headquartered in Addis Ababa, \"the death of Prime Minister Meles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/meles-zenawi-death-fears-turmoil?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">has robbed Africa</a> of one of its greatest sons\".</p> <p>Most articles in the international media strived to strike a difficult balance: on one hand, the notable skills of a premier who brought double-digit growth to one of the poorest countries on the continent, and on the other, a brutal ruler who ordered police and soldiers to fire on protesters in the aftermath of the contested 2005 elections.</p> <p>Social media have, however, offered a more complex picture, signalling the problematic legacy of a figure who took Ethiopia in unprecedented directions \u2013 for instance, he recognised ethnic diversity as a building block of the nation while most post-colonial African states attempted to overcome it. But by doing so, he also polarised the political debate among his supporters and adversaries. On Facebook, the words \"dictator\", \"saviour\", \"murderer\" and \"visionary\" were blending on many a post reflecting on his death.</p> <p>These mixed reactions indicate that Africa has lost one of its most notable contemporary ideologues. After the end of the cold war many African leaders progressively adhered, at least nominally, to a technocratic approach to governance and relinquished any ideologically charged language. On the contrary, during his 21 years in office, Meles continued to actively elaborate concepts negotiating his Marxist-Leninist training with a pragmatic approach to democracy, which the international community was advocating.</p> <p>And while Meles has been hailed as an ally of the west in the volatile Horn of Africa, he leveraged the geopolitical weight obtained by providing a base to fight terrorism in the region to undertake paths that, at policy level, openly challenged the western doctrine. In recent years, he often claimed that the neo-liberal model of development had failed, and that a paradigm shift was needed. He expanded the role of the state when donors were asking to reduce it, and turned new media into <a href=\"http://www.soros.org/reports/mapping-digital-media-digital-media-conflict-and-diasporas-horn-africa\" title=\"\">supports</a> for his centrally controlled state and nation-building project, against those who emphasised their importance as vehicles to promote open and unfettered debates.</p> <p>This ideologue image progressively obtained a life of its own. Numerous texts officially published by the party were considered to be his, and he was believed to occasionally enjoy participating in \"doctrinal\" debates online under a pseudonym. A <a href=\"http://cgt.columbia.edu/files/conferences/Zenawi_Dead_Ends_and_New_Beginnings.pdf\" title=\"\">51-page document</a> Meles published as part of a conversation with development economists such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephstiglitz\" title=\"\">Joseph Stiglitz</a> became a rallying point for academics and policymakers alike. Many African leaders looked up to Meles because, despite his young age \u2013 he died at 57 \u2013 he showed the traits that characterised key post-independence leaders, such as the willingness and ability to theorise and defend a path towards development that was distinctive for Africa. As a Ghanaian diplomat once told me, referring to a quarrel between Meles and Eritrea's president, Isaias Afewerki, during an African Union meeting, it was impressive how Meles was able to hold his ground during a doctrinal debate, while all the rest of the assembly was quietly listening.</p> <p>Meles's role as an ideologue, however, came at a cost for the Ethiopian people. First, it made him uninterested and intolerant towards most forms of critique of his policies. Despite having a government that initially created a space for a free press, it consistently avoided engaging with the debates it had allowed to flourish. After 2005, this lack of engagement turned into active suppression, with many journalists imprisoned and access to opposition blogs blocked. Second, Meles's drive to implement his ambitious vision turned into a need to secure political hegemony for an extended period of time. The process of transforming Ethiopia into an ethnic federation through trial and errors led the political leadership to maintain control often through violence and repression.</p> <p>Meles's passing leaves the country at a crossroads. Ethiopia's spokespeople have said that the new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, will continue along the path ploughed by his predecessor. But it is difficult to imagine Meles's policies being brought to life without the ideological drive he was able to lead with. Such measures could facilitate an \"opening of political space\" as advocated by <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/21/ethiopia-transition-should-support-human-rights-reform\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a>, but it could also lead to the crumbling of a project requiring strong leadership in the absence of a viable replacement.</p>",
  "<p>A former trader for Royal Bank of Scotland Group has claimed that the bank's internal checks were so lax that anyone could change Libor rates.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/31/deutsche-bank-libor?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">More than a dozen banks, including RBS, are under investigation</a> by regulators in the US, Europe and Asia for suspected rigging of the London interbank offered rate (Libor), which is used to price trillions of dollars of financial products.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Barclays was fined \u00a3290m in June</a> by American and British authorities for its role in trying to manipulate the interest rates, which affect the cost of borrowing for millions of customers around the&#xa0;world.</p> <p>Court documents filed in Singapore show that Tan Chi Min, who is suing RBS for wrongful dismissal, claimed that in 2008 a trader for the bank, Will Hall, changed the Libor submission himself even though he was part of the Japanese yen swap desk in London.</p> <p>The papers show that Tan, who worked for RBS in Singapore, raised the issue at his disciplinary meeting last September, saying that the bank's internal procedure in London seemed to be that \"anyone can change Libor\".</p> <p>Tan alleges that the bank's minutes of his disciplinary meeting omitted details of this and other conversations about how traders at the bank tried to influence RBS's interbank lending rate submissions.</p> <p>He was sacked from his Singapore-based role as head of delta trading for RBS's global banking and markets division in November for trying to improperly influence the bank's rate setters. Delta trading involves using derivatives to mirror the price moves in a basket of securities.</p> <p>Tan filed a lawsuit against the bank late last year, claiming the practice of traders making requests to the bank's rate setters was well known by RBS management.</p> <p>RBS is disputing the allegations, saying Tan was dismissed for gross misconduct and that it followed its company disciplinary policy in deciding to terminate his contract. It has already announced that it has sacked several employees for misconduct as a result of its investigations.</p> <p>Tan is claiming a loss of bonuses from the bank totalling $1.1m (\u00a3693,000) and 3.3m RBS shares.</p> <p>The bank reiterated that it \"continues to co-operate fully with ongoing investigations relating to the setting of Libor and other interest rates\".</p> <p>RBS' chief executive, Stephen Hester, has warned that the bank is likely to face fines, like Barclays. RBS is 82% owned by the British taxpayer.</p> <p>The Libor scandal, which has engulfed the banking industry, led to the resignation of three senior Barclays executives \u2013 chief executive Bob Diamond, his former right-hand man Jerry del Missier and chairman Marcus Agius, who was subsequently reinstated to search for a new chief executive.</p> <p>Barclays has appointed Sir David Walker as chairman from 1 November, when Agius will step down, but is still looking for a replacement for Diamond.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/18/bob-diamond-slammed-libor-report?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">MPs accused Diamond of being \"highly selective\"</a> in the evidence he gave to their emergency hearings on rigging Libor interest rates.

  "<p>My heart leapt when I heard that <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/foodgrowingguide\" title=\"\">Space for food growing</a>, a new guide by Eric Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government, is championing a \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9493117/Return-to-the-Good-Life-Eric-Pickles-wants-people-to-turn-wasteland-into-allotments.html\" title=\"\">spot a plot</a>\" initiative that is going to create more land for growing. The how-to guide suggests that if you can find public land that is disused, derelict or just underused (those endless boring green patches around towns spring to mind), then as a community you can challenge your local authority to change its use to a growing space \u2013 be that more allotments, or community gardens.</p> <p>The guide is both ambitious and surprisingly progressive. It suggests the development of mixed-used gardens, playgrounds for the young, plots for mum and dad, tree houses, and a sculpture or two (I'm not entirely sure how that will get people growing, but I'm all for more public art). It likes the idea of ponds and trees for wildlife, and is keen to see people eating in those spaces, too: throw a barbecue, have a tombola, win at the local veg competition. Readers end up with a mental picture of Eric Pickles and his gang eating lashings of cream cakes and sandwiches on green grass. Gosh, it's going to be fun.</p> <p>Still, it is a hugely important initiative. There are three tenets to food sovereignty: access to land; maintaining and enriching soil; and skills to grow food. This report does recognise the role of all three, although it slightly brushes over soil fertility.</p> <p>A lot of brilliant, hard-working charities such as <a href=\"http://www.groundwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Groundwork</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.farmgarden.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Federation of City Farms and Communiy Gardens</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Garden Organic</a>, <a href=\"http://www.landshare.net/\" title=\"\">Landshare</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Royal Horticultural Society</a>, among others, have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to make sure that we have both land and skills to grow food.</p> <p>The real triumph of this guide is that the government recognises all the work that these bodies have been undertaking, although last year's <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Localism Act</a> will make challenging land use easier, but a lot of the report's material is not new. For example, <a href=\"http://www.incredible-edible-todmorden.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Incredible Edible Todmorden</a> signed a community growing licence with Calderdale council in 2009, allowing them to turn underused areas into community food-growing initiatives \u2013 everything from community orchards to containers for growing vegetables in public spaces.</p> <p>However, acknowledging that we, the public, can now start to challenge the way our communities grow and eat food is a huge step forward and one for great celebration. But it is still a very steep hill to climb. A bit of ground-growing buddleia or grass may look simple enough to turn into growing land, but there can be considerable barriers. Food growing needs good soil and much of ours, particularly in cities and towns, is highly polluted. The report does refer to soil contamination as a considerable and often costly issue. Good, healthy food needs good, fertile land and disused spots may be years away from that.</p> <p>Raised beds are one alternative to growing in polluted soil, but the truth is that there is not a great deal of research available to the public on how to grow in contaminated areas. Anyone who has battled through the first few years on a neglected allotment can empathise with how physically hard it is to change a weed-strewn area into good soil. It takes time and skills to grow good food. And it will take money, too: most of these sites will need at least fences and access to water (though the guide does offer advice on where to find funding).</p> <p>Despite all these challenges, if you've got grit, there's potential land out there for you \u2013 and a comprehensive guide to wave in the face of opposition. I, for one, intend to take the government up on this opportunity.</p>",

  "<h2>An Amnesty on the fringe</h2> <p>There are plenty who dismiss the fringe as a place where only airhead theatre and shows with jokes are available, but they're wrong. Over my years on the Edinburgh fringe I have discovered a great deal about the world and how it works, not only from international productions but from homegrown work. The <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20290\">Amnesty International Freedom of Expression award</a>, which was presented today (I have been one of the judges), has always recognised that theatre offers a window on the world and can be a catalyst to change. </p> <p>This year's winner, announced at lunchtime today, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/jan/18/two-worlds-charlie-f-veterans\">The Two Worlds of Charlie F</a>, a piece created from the stories of injured soldiers returning from Afghanistan and performed by them. If you missed its brief run in Edinburgh (or when it was in London last January) there will be two final performances at the <a href=\"http://www.trh.co.uk/whatson/the-two-worlds-of-charlie-f/\">Haymarket Theatre</a> in London on 9 September. </p> <p>Charlie F was a worthy winner in a strong shortlist that among others included Grant O'Rourke's very fine one-hour version of Mike Daisey's The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs at Gilded Balloon, a show that will make you see blood welling from the keyboard every time you use a Mac, and Theatre Uncut, the brilliant initiative that responds with speed and eloquence to the ever-changing global financial crisis and public spending cuts. Check out future events <a href=\"http://www.theatreuncut.com/\">here</a> . </p> <p>You're too late to catch 18-year-old Koba Ryckewaert's theatre mindmap, <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/07/all-that-wrong-edinburgh-review\">All That is Wrong</a>, which pointed out that if we are going to change the world, the self is a good place to start, and Peter Arnott's Why Do You Stand There in the Rain, about the first world war veterans who marched on Washington during the Great Depression to demand the bonuses that had been promised to them. But you can still catch the astonishing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review\">Mies Julie</a> at Assembly Mound \u2013 a stark reminder that equality is impossible without justice, and that without justice personal relationships are irrevocably tainted. </p> <h2>Curtain calls</h2> <p>Watching Camille O' Sullivan skip about the stage like a demented pixie at the end of the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk\">Rape of Lucrece</a> last night was rather delightful. Relief was etched upon her face, and her pleasure so evident \u2013 a much more real and human response than the traditional curtain call with its restrained formality. I always think companies coming from abroad must be disappointed by the response of British audiences. In Europe curtain calls can go on almost as long as the play. Apparently when Elfriede Jelinek's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/jul/23/sports-play-review\">Sports Play</a> premiered in mainland Europe, the standing ovation went on for 48 minutes. Although of course the audience might just have been applauding their own survival; Jelinek's is an epic piece.</p> <p>On the fringe, the standing ovation is now pretty well standard, even though everyone knows the truly outstanding shows are few and far between. This practice is now so widespread that you're more likely to notice when it doesn't happen than when it does. It's nice that people want to show their appreciation, but like star-rating inflation, indiscriminate standing ovations only devalues the gesture. If almost every show has a standing ovation, how is it possible for audiences to demonstrate their enthusiasm when they see something that really blows them away?</p> <h2>Two cultures no longer</h2> <p>The appearance of fringe star Camille O'Sullivan in the Edinburgh international festival is another sign of the breakdown of the divisions between the fringe and the international festival. It probably won't be long before standup comedian Daniel Kitson \u2013 who's been appearing at the Traverse for a few years now \u2013 makes his international festival debut.</p> <p>In the previous director Brian McMaster's day, it often felt as if there was outright hostility between the EIF and the fringe, but Jonathan Mills has understood that the two are stronger together, and that all of Edinburgh's festivals benefit from a united approach. The cross-over between fringe and EIF has been strengthened by the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/news/edinburgh-international-festival-fringe-prize-2011-winner-announced \">Fringe prize</a>, awarded each year to an outstanding fringe company and offering development money towards a new piece.

  "<p>I've had so many wonderful days in Africa, there was bound to be tough one.</p> <p>Earlier this week, I witnessed how illegal ivory was obtained, along with Peter Knights, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.wildaid.org/\" title=\"\">WildAid</a>, with whom I've worked for several years now. With the help of Kenya Wildlife Service, we travelled via helicopter to access the carcasses. Iain Douglas-Hamilton of <a href=\"http://www.savetheelephants.org/\" title=\"\">Save the Elephants</a> had spotted the bodies from the air in his small plane, and marked the spot for our pilot to bring down the chopper in a dry riverbed. It was so tight we did a little hedge trimming on the way down.</p> <p>Not 20 yards away, I saw the body of an elephant poached for its ivory three weeks ago. Its face had been cut off by poachers and its body scavenged by hyenas, scattering bones around the area. A sad mass of skin and bone. The smell was overwhelming and seemed to cling to us, even after we left.</p> <p>I really was speechless. After seeing these animals up close and watching them interact in loving and protective family groups, it was heart wrenching and deeply depressing to see this one cruelly taken before its time.</p> <p>People, like Iain, have spent their lives studying and living intimately with these animals and now, just like in 1989 before the international ivory trade was banned, they must spend their lives looking for bodies, using metal detectors to find bullets and conducting autopsies.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I saw four more bodies in close proximity that day. One that poachers had attempted to hide with bushes; another that had been found dead from his wounds within shouting distance of a lodge with its ivory still intact, having evaded the poachers while wounded; and later, two fresher carcasses of much smaller elephants that had been sprayed with bullets. Their tusks would have been small, but that did not protect them. Poachers often only wound elephants and they may fall well away from where they were originally shot. I could imagine the clamour in the herd as the elephants fled in terror.</p> <p>The fact that we were able to see five bodies in one area in the brief time I was here is an indication of the seriousness of the poaching crisis.</p> <p>Before the international ivory trade ban, in addition to legal ivory from natural deaths, huge amounts of illegal ivory were laundered into the trade despite years of attempted regulation. This \"regulated\" trade led to the halving of elephant numbers from 1.2 million to around 600,000 in two decades. West, central and east Africa were hardest hit, while southern African populations remained stable and even increased.</p> <p>Post-ban, the price of ivory fell to a quarter of its previous levels as markets in the US, Europe and much of the world, collapsed. For a number of years, elephant numbers stabilised and poaching declined. Some South African countries pushed for re-opening ivory trade for their stockpiles, but each time this was done, poaching increased again on speculation of a renewed market.</p> <p>Theoretically, I'm told we could have a market in ivory supplied from elephants that die naturally. But unfortunately, with the high amount of money at stake, few will wait for the elephant to die to make a profit. There are too many people with access to weapons to do the killing here and too many people ready to buy the ivory without questioning how it was obtained.</p> <p>I also learned that at one point in history, the United States was the largest consumer of ivory. As of 1989, Japan and Hong Kong were the largest importers of ivory, with Hong Kong holding 127 tonnes in its stockpile.</p> <p>But China's economic boom has lead to greater buying power with few potential consumers exposed to the publicity surrounding the 1989 ban. This is why we really need to document what's happening here in Africa, on the ground. I firmly believe that Chinese consumers will have a change of heart once we understand the consequences, but it hasn't been covered widely enough in the media.</p> <p>Unlike rhino horn (which was banned in 1993 in China), ivory is still legally available and side-by-side with illegal ivory from poached elephants, which I think is very confusing for people. If you see something openly on sale, you assume it is legal. An ivory carving is thousands of miles removed from the sad carcass of a poached elephant, but we need to make that connection.</p> <p>It was a harrowing experience I never want to repeat, but something that everyone thinking of buying ivory should see. The wastefulness of this animal cruelly slaughtered just so a small part of it can be used. Would anyone buy ivory if they had witnessed this?</p> <p>\u2022 Yao Ming is a Chinese former NBA player who has travelled to Africa for the first time as global ambassador for <a href=\"http://www.wildaid.org/\" title=\"\">WildAid</a>.

What is totally unacceptable is the use of tools which, by essence, discriminate and single out, fostering a general boycott.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Such exclusion and discrimination bring to mind ideas of racist nature which the government of South Africa, more than any other, should have wholly rejected.\"</p> <p>The South African Jewish Board of Deputies said it was \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishsa.co.za/media/press-releases/jewish-leadership-deplores-cabinet-decision-on-labeling-of-israeli-goods\" title=\"\">outraged</a>\" by the decision to re-label goods. Zev Krengel, its president, said: \"It is the firm belief of the Jewish communal leadership that the proposed measures are discriminatory, divisive, inconsistent with South African trade policy and seriously flawed from both an administrative and procedural point of view.</p> <p>\"At bottom, they are believed to be motivated not by technical trade concerns but by political bias against the state of Israel. All attempts to discuss these concerns, however, have come to nothing.\"</p> <p>South Africa's relations with Israel have been strained for years. In 2010 the archbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu likened the treatment of Palestinians to the injustice of racial apartheid, urging a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/oct/27/desmond-tutu-opera-boycott-israel\" title=\"\">South African opera company to cancel its tour of the Israel</a>.</p> <p>Last week South Africa's deputy foreign minister Ebrahim Ebrahim <a href=\"http://www.citypress.co.za/Politics/News/Ebrahim-cautions-against-Israel-20120811\" title=\"\">recommended against visiting</a> Israel. \"Israel is an occupier country which is oppressing Palestine, so it's not proper for South Africans to associate with Israel,\" he told City Press newspaper. \"We discourage people from going there except if it has to do with the peace process.\"</p> <p>An international boycott of South Africa in 1980s was a crucial factor in forcing the apartheid regime to eventually surrender power. Israel was one of the last countries to sign up to the campaign.</p>",

  "<p>With career opportunities increasingly scarce and the culture of unpaid internships still thriving, emerging artists and arts professionals could be forgiven for doing away with bespoke cover letters, wordy proposals and CVs. Instead, thousands of creatives are opting for alternative solutions to jobseeking, many harnessing the power of the internet as the cheapest fuel to move forward.</p> <p>This shouldn't come as a surprise \u2013 it's never been easier to build a customised website and the cultural sector is spoiled for digital training. It's not hard to understand how so many people find themselves thinking what a great idea it would be to buy their own little piece of webspace.</p> <p>It's true the internet can be a great place to platform your work and source new clients. But while building a website to advertise your creative flair may be as easy as 1, 2, 3, the vast majority of people seldom consider what happens next. All too often people expect to put their work online and \u2013 hey presto! \u2013 Mr Moneybags will be offering you megabucks for your portfolio of vintage photographs. Sadly, it's not that easy.</p> <h2>Take a good look at yourself and your content</h2> <p>The number one rule of creating a successful website is that your content has to be both innovative and unique. Ask yourself why people would want to visit your site? Without this integral question, your website is already doomed. There are nearly 55,000,000 <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Wordpress websites</a> alone, with roughly 100,000 new blogs being created every day. </p> <p>The competition is fierce \u2013 so how can you avoid your site merging into the murky backdrop of mediocrity? Remember too that whatever you publish on the web can be seen by anyone and everyone, from your grandmother to high-flying editors you might one day be begging for a job.</p> <p>First and foremost, you have to decide if your work is ready to go global: is it original? Are you confident that you could become the next 'big thing' in your industry? How would you feel if an interviewer or a buyer found your work in five years' time, when you'll have hopefully refined your craft to near perfection? If these questions don't faze you, fantastic \u2013 you're well on your way \u2013 but you're by no means ready to press the publish button.</p> <h2>Swot up on the basics</h2> <p>Having a great website featuring strong work is one thing but a lot of people don't realise that successful websites are the result of innumerable hours of research. When I founded <a href=\"http://www.thegaystage.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Gay Stage</a>, I didn't have the first clue about search engine optimisation (SEO) or html tags. Instead, I spent most of my spare time swotting up on all the boring essentials to building, marketing and sustaining a successful website. I've been doing it for a year now and I still haven't stopped \u2013 even after countless emails, hundreds of mistakes and new contributors, my own website is still only half way there, and maybe not even that.</p> <p>Until recently, The Gay Stage was 100% a labour of love. That means no profit. Not a penny. Nada. Thankfully all that hard work has started to pay off as we're finally in a position to attract advertisers and people are getting in touch about freelance opportunities for myself and our other contributors. The downside is that we now need to consider finance and taxes \u2013 and so the learning curve continues.</p> <p>I don't for a minute want to portray website creation as a pointless or thankless task. Personally, I have enjoyed the hard work and I'll certainly keep hold of the web skills I've now picked up, which means I've broadened my career opportunities in the process.</p> <p>The point I'm making is this: being able to build a website isn't what matters; most creatives can have a good stab at it. As with every other route to success, finding your place on the internet requires hard work, commitment and a professional outlook \u2013 as soon as your website goes live, it essentially becomes a business.</p> <p>There is no such thing as a magic wand in this business, and the sooner creatives fully understand what a decent website requires, the sooner those artists can earn a decent crust. If you're still up for the ride then clearly you love a challenge and if that's the case you'll likely be rewarded for your efforts, even if the cash-cow doesn't arrive tomorrow.</p> <h2>Ask for help</h2> <p>And one final message: there is nothing more valuable than getting to know other webmasters if you want your website to attract the right kind of attention. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/feb/22/beyond-twitter-arts-social-media?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Take to Twitter</a>, email everyone (myself included) and be willing to share a little of your creativity in return for publicity.

  "<p>Arctic sea ice is set to reach its lowest ever recorded extent as early as this weekend, in \"dramatic changes\" signalling that man-made global warming is having a major impact on the polar region.</p> <p>With the melt happening at an unprecedented rate of more than 100,000 sq km a day, and at least a week of further melt expected before ice begins to reform ahead of the northern winter, satellites are expected to confirm the record \u2013 currently set in 2007 \u2013 within days.</p> <p>\"Unless something really unusual happens we will see the record broken in the next few days. It might happen this weekend, almost certainly next week,\" Julienne Stroeve, a scientist at the <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/\" title=\"\">US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) </a> in Boulder, Colorado, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"In the last few days it has been losing 100,000 sq km a day, a record in itself for August. A storm has spread the ice pack out, opening up water, bringing up warmer water. Things are definitely changing quickly.\"</p> <p>Because ice thickness, volume, extent and area are all measured differently, it may be a week before there is unanimous agreement among the world's cryologists (ice experts) that 2012 is a record year. Four out of the nine daily sea ice extent and area graphs kept by scientists in the US, Europe and Asia suggest that records have already been broken. \"The whole energy balance of the Arctic is changing. There's more heat up there. There's been a change of climate and we are losing more seasonal ice. The rate of ice loss is faster than the models can capture [but] we can expect the Arctic to be ice-free in summer by 2050,\" said Stroeve.</p> <p>\"Only 15 years ago I didn't expect to see such dramatic changes \u2013 no one did. The ice-free season is far longer now. Twenty years ago it was about a month. Now it's three months. Temperatures last week in the Arctic were 14C, which is pretty warm.\"</p> <p>Scientists at the Danish Meteorological Institute, the Arctic Regional Ocean Observing System in Norway and others in Japan have said the ice is very close to its minimum recorded in 2007. The University of Bremen, whose data does not take into account ice along a 30km coastal zone, says it sees ice extent below the all-time record low of 4.33m sq km recorded in September 2007.</p> <p>Ice volume in the Arctic has declined dramatically over the past decade. The 2011 minimum was more than 50% below that of 2005. According to the <a href=\"http://psc.apl.washington.edu/\" title=\"\">Polar Science Centre at the University of Washington</a> it now stands at around 5,770 cubic kilometres, compared with 12,433 cu km during the 2000s and 6,494 cu km in 2011. The ice volume for 31 July 2012 was roughly 10% below the value for the same day in 2011. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/11/arctic-sea-ice-vanishing\" title=\"\">A new study by UK scientists</a> suggests that 900 cu km of summer sea ice has disappeared from the Arctic ocean over the past year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395168904\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345731390184/Arctic-sea-ice-001.jpg\" alt=\"Arctic sea ice\" width=\"460\" height=\"382\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arctic sea ice Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The consequences of losing the Arctic's ice coverage for the summer months are expected to be immense. If the white sea ice no longer reflects sunlight back into space, the region can be expected to heat up even more than at present. This could lead to an increase in ocean temperatures with unknown effects on weather systems in northern latitudes.</p> <p>In a statement, a Greenpeace spokesman said: \"The disappearing Arctic still serves as a stark warning to us all. Data shows us that the frozen north is teetering on the brink. The level of ice 'has remained far below average' and appears to be getting thinner, leaving it more vulnerable to future melting. The consequences of further rapid ice loss at the top of the world are of profound importance to the whole planet. This is not a warning we can afford to ignore.\"</p> <p>Longer ice-free summers are expected to open up the Arctic ocean to oil and mining as well as to more trade. This year at least 20 vessels are expected to travel north of Russia between northern Europe and the Bering straits. Last week a Chinese icebreaker made the first voyage in the opposite direction.</p> <p>\"Every one of the 56,000 Inuits in Greenland have had to adapt to the retreat of the ice,\" said Carl-Christian Olsen, president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council in Nuuk, Greenland. \"The permafrost is melting and this is jeopardising roads and buildings. The coastline is changing, there is more erosion and storms, and there are fewer mammals like polar bears. It means there can be more mining, which is good for the economy, but it will have unpredictable effects on social change\".</p> <p>Research published in Nature today said that warming in the Antarctic peninsula, where temperatures have risen about 1.5C over the past 50 years, is \"unusual\" but not unprecedented relative to natural variation. The research by Robert Mulvaney of the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, based on an ice-core record, showed that the warming of the north-eastern Antarctic peninsula began about 600 years ago. Temperature increases were said to be within the bounds of natural climate variability.</p> <p>The difference between the rate of warming at the two poles is attributed to geographical differences. \"Antarctica is a continent surrounded by water, while the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land. Wind and ocean currents around Antarctica isolate the continent from global weather patterns, keeping it cold. In contrast, the Arctic Ocean is intimately linked with the climate systems around it, making it more sensitive to changes in climate,\" said a spokesman for the NSIDC.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 August 2012 to restore to the start of the penultimate paragraph the words \"Research published in Nature today\", which had been lost in the editing process, and to clarify that the research was about temperatures in the Antarctic peninsula.</p>",
  "<p>This year's GCSE results are out today and show the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/23/gcse-results-fall-first-time\">top GCSE results fall for first time in history</a>. </p> <p>The Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jeevanvasagar\">Jeevan Vasagar</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/22/english-gcses-marked-down-teachers\">reports evidence</a> that English GCSE students are being marked down to curb grade inflation. </p> <p>But how do the results compare across the board? To see the big picture of GCSE results this year we turn to the <a href=\"http://www.jcq.org.uk/national_results/news_releases/2012_1/\">Joint Council For Qualifications</a> (JCQ), the overview body which looks after exam results, and their <a href=\"http://www.jcq.org.uk/national_results/gcses/\">complete analysis</a> of how the exam results break down. </p> <p>We've extracted the UK datasets from the JCQ pdfs in this Google <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AoEZjwuqFS2PdEZfSVpFd0UwdExROXlQbHR4d2laUHc&amp;output=html\">spreadsheet</a>.</p> <p>One thing to bear in mind when viewing the results is that year on year the number of students entering the exams changes. This year more people sat GCSE examinations than last. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395099446\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345721955939/gcse-001.jpg\" alt=\"gcse\" width=\"460\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Source: JCQ</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This increase seems to reflect a trend for younger students to sit their GCSEs early, and possibly for adults sitting the exams as the number of 16 year olds in the population this year has decreased on last year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395099447\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345726169412/16-year-olds-001.jpg\" alt=\"16 year olds\" width=\"460\" height=\"285\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">16 year olds in the UK Source: JCQ</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another thing to consider are the trends in particular GCSE subjects over the years, for example business and communication studies has taken a nose dive in entrants in recent years, while biology has seen an increase. So when comparing results its important to take into account the number of entrants - we give both entrants and results in our spreadsheet.</p> <p>The key results from the JCQ are:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 The number of entries achieving the A* grade is down 0.5 percentage points, with girls significantly outperforming boys (girls 8.7% and boys 6.0%). <br>\u2022 At A*-C, the proportion securing these grades is down 0.4 percentage points with girls outperforming boys by a greater margin year-on-year (7.5 percentage point margin in 2011 and 7.9 percentage points in 2012). </p> </blockquote> <p>For each key subject the results are explained by the JCQ as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 The number of entries for English (including English Language) increased by 3.1%. The proportion of entries achieving A*-C decreased by 1.5 percentage points. This can partly be explained by more candidates switching from the Winter series to the Summer series, due to the introduction of a new specification. Historically the outcomes in the Winter series are lower. </p> <p>\u2022 The results show a year-on-year decrease of 12.6% in the number of entries for Mathematics in Summer 2012. When the whole academic year is considered, the number of entries increases by 17.6%. The main factor in this variation is an additional examination opportunity in March 2012. In Summer 2012, the number of entries achieving A*-C in Mathematics decreased by 0.4 percentage points. <br> \u2022 The dramatic increase in entries for GCSE Science (36.1%) and fall in the number of entries achieving grades A*-C (2.2 percentage points) is partly explained by a more demanding standard introduced in 2012 and a significant increase in entries by 15 year olds this year, influenced by the introduction of the 'terminal rule'. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here's the cumulative GCSE results by English region:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AoEZjwuqFS2PdEZfSVpFd0UwdExROXlQbHR4d2laUHc&transpose=0&headers=1&range=A1%3AJ11&gid=6&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"title\":\"Cumulative regional breakdown by GCSE grades 2012 \",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"animation\":{\"duration\":0},\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},\"isStacked\":false,\"width\":460,\"height\":276},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart2\"} </script> </figure>  <p>Unlike last year there is no data on how academies, comprehensives, independent and secondary modern schools compare in results. <br> So it's a complicated picture and here is the best data available until <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jan/26/secondary-school-league-tables-data\">more detailed results</a> are published later in the year.

  "<p>In the Bowen Basin coalfields 600 miles north of Brisbane, a gold rush is in full swing. Black gold. Coal from this part of central Queensland \u2013 home to the country's biggest deposits \u2013 is driving the economy to set new records.</p> <p>\"Huge just doesn't do it justice,\" says a recent Deloitte Access Economics report on the state's resources boom. \"Humungous might bring us closer to the mark.\" Deloitte's Chris Richardson says Australia has been riding in the slipstream of China and other emerging economies. \"We have opportunities that the likes of the UK and others don't to sell our resources in a period where half the world is having an industrial revolution. That's magnificent for us.\"</p> <p>But when the London-listed miner BHP Billiton this week<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/bhp-billiton-olympic-dam-china\" title=\"\"> shelved plans to build the world's biggest open-pit copper and uranium mine in south Australia</a>, the Sydney Morning Herald website ran the headline: \"The bubble has burst.\" BHP said it was a financial decision based on slowing demand and the high price of expansion in Australia, with its tight labour market and high exchange rate.</p> <p>This year the minerals and resources industry will account for 8.5% of Australia's GDP, compared with the long-term average of less than 2%. It will make up more than half of the country's export income. Australia is the world's biggest exporter of coal and iron ore.</p> <p>The industry has shielded the country from the economic storms that have buffeted Europe and the US. Saul Eslake, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (Australia), says the country's strong financial position is a combination of good luck and good management. \"What China is doing for our exports is not a result of anything politicians have done in Canberra \u2013 but we have also had good monetary policy backed up by good, prudential management of our banks. Unlike most other western countries, who ran deficits during the boom years, Australia ran surpluses, which put it in a very strong position to deal with the financial crisis when it came.\"</p> <p>Australia remains one of only eight countries worldwide to hold AAA sovereign debt ratings from all three main ratings agencies. While much of Europe is mired in crisis, unemployment in Australia is 5.1%, inflation stands at 1.2%, official interest rates are 3.5% and growth is predicted to be 3.1% in 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund, compared with 0.2% in Britain.</p> <p>The strong economy, however, has not brought benefits to all sectors. At Mission Beach in north Queensland, an hour and a half's drive south of the barrier reef hub of Cairns, Atalanta Willy is preparing to take a small group of tourists on a half-day sea-kayaking trip to a nearby tropical island. \"Many small towns like this are only just keeping their heads above water,\" she says.</p> <p>Strong economic fundamentals and the mining boom have pushed the Australian dollar to sustained highs, hurting industries such as tourism. Five years ago \u00a31 bought you A$2.50; today it's closer to A$1.50.</p> <p>\"The foreign tourists that come through here find it unbelievably expensive,\" says Willy. Full- or half-day sea kayaking trips were once the backbone of her business, but demand is much lower now. \"Tourists used to have more money in their pockets and stay a bit longer. Now the high dollar means they're moving through towns like this much faster.\" Shops and cafes in the small community have closed. Last year Willy's husband, David Tofler, went back to work as a sound recordist to supplement their income. He's likely to do it again in the upcoming wet season.</p> <h2>Catastrophic</h2> <p>Across north Queensland it's a similar picture. Tourism in the area fell 8% in the year to March, with substantial dropoffs in the lucrative European backpacker market, down 18%. The numbers of Japanese tourists, who make up more than half of all visitors to the state, fell at the same rate.</p> <p>\"It's been catastrophic for some businesses and many have hung on for dear life,\" says Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council. In Cairns, which for years has thrived on tourism, unemployment is 8.3%, well above the national average.</p> <p>Manufacturing has also been a significant loser in Australia's two-speed economy. Manufacturers have been reporting falling output since March and the latest Australian Industry Group's monthly index for industrial performance, in July, showed a sharp 6.9-point fall to 40.3 points \u2013 the lowest level since the global financial crisis began.</p> <p>The high dollar has hit export-reliant industries such as steel and aluminium, making them uncompetitive internationally. Job losses have been painful, the majority coming in the south-east corner of the country, far away from the mining boom. It has dampened consumer confidence in those areas, which in turn has hit other manufacturers. Last month Ford laid off 440 workers at its plants in Victoria.</p> <p>By contrast, mining projects in the remote parts of north-western Australia face skills shortages. In May, the world's richest woman (and Australia's wealthiest miner), Gina Rinehart, won the right to bring in 1,700 foreign workers for the construction of an iron ore mine in Pilbara. The move, which enraged union officials, demonstrates the lopsided nature of the Australian economy and the difficulty mining companies have in persuading workers to leave their homes in Sydney and Melbourne.</p> <p>So what of the future? \"There has never been a boom which goes on forever,\" says Deloitte's Richardson. \"By the standards of booms, this one is already pretty old and will go for some time given the sheer size of the seismic shift under way in places like China and India, with people moving off farms and into factories.\"</p> <p>Eslake thinks the mining boom has another decade to run, and says the real challenge will come after that. \"The history of Japan and Korea tells us that the intensity of demand for commodities falls away once a country reaches per capita income somewhere between US$18,000 and US$25,000 (\u00a311,000-\u00a316,000). In China, I think that's about a decade away.</p> <p>\"The challenge then will be what else we can sell to the Chinese when they don't want our minerals. The answer won't be manufacturing but is more likely to be some sort of agricultural products and services.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, Australians can only be grateful that they don't face the sorts of economic challenges that Europe&#xa0;does.</p>",
  "<p>The fate of billions of dollars of promised funding from rich countries to help the developing world adapt to climate change will be discussed on Thursday in Geneva, at the first meeting of the UN's <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/green_climate_fund/items/5869.php\" title=\"\">Green Climate Fund</a>.</p> <p>The fund is meant to be the biggest single funding route for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/17/us-copenhagen-100bn-climate-fund\" title=\"\">$100bn (\u00a363bn) that developed countries have pledged</a> should flow to poor nations each year by 2020, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of global warming.</p> <p>But key decisions \u2013 such as where the fund should be headquartered, who should run it, how it will operate and how it can raise funds \u2013 will be delayed for months.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, the initial meeting, delayed by months as governments procrastinated, began with the election of a developing and a developed country co-chair. These were the South African representative Zaheer Fakir and Australia's Ewen McDonald, who had been favourite to win the post. They will jointly chair the fund for its first year. Fakir is head of international relations and governance at the South African Department of Environmental Affairs, while McDonald is deputy director general of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID).</p> <p>A final decision on the GCF's location \u2013 Germany, Namibia, and other countries have all offered to be the host \u2013 is understood to be unlikely before the end of the year.</p> <p>All of the other important issues around the GCF, including how much money it is likely to have to disburse and how it will raise funds from the private sector, are matters of contention. The fund is unlikely to have much sway over the initial round of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/07/cancun-summit-climate-aid-row\" title=\"\">\"fast-start\" financing from rich to poor countries</a> that was agreed at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/copenhagen\" title=\"\">Copenhagen summit in 2009</a>. Most of the $30bn (\u00a319bn) pledged at Copenhagen has now been committed, and most of it is already earmarked for various projects. For instance, the UK is on track to provide \u00a31.5bn between 2010-13 and about \u00a31bn of this has already been committed to bilateral and multilateral projects developed with poor countries, or is being channelled through existing funding routes.</p> <p>Given this, it is unclear whether the GCF will have access to much financing in the next few years, even though it is envisaged to be the world's single biggest source of financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2020.</p> <p>In the longer term, the prospects for substantial funding are even less clear: it will have to raise money from both governments and the private sector but at present there is no agreement on how it might do so.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/21/copenhagen-accord-climate-change\" title=\"\">the $100bn a year was agreed at Copenhagen</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/13/cancun-climate-agreement\" title=\"\">confirmed at Cancun in 2010</a>, the GCF will be only one source among many for those funds. Private sector and government cash flowing through other routes will also count towards the $100bn goal.</p> <p>One major source of contention in the discussions is that some developing country governments want to limit the fund, so that contributions from the public sector come only from \"traditional donors\". That is, the countries labelled as developed in the original UN climate treaties of 1992 and the Kyoto protocol of 1997. This is an important distinction, as it would mean that China, the world's second biggest economy, and other rapidly growing countries such as South Korea, Singapore and many Middle Eastern nations, despite their high incomes per capita, would be excluded from contributing. Developed nations including the US and the UK insist that this distinction should not apply to the fund. Although the GCF has been under discussion for years, with governments agreeing in principle at Copenhagen to set it up, the complexities of the climate negotiations have stalled its development. However, the delays increase the political risk around the project: for instance, the US under a Republican president or Congress is unlikely to be willing to commit substantial sums to the fund.</p> <p>As the US presidential campaign has progressed, the White House has not made climate change negotiations a major issue. The administration's special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, caused consternation several weeks ago when he appeared to suggest, in <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/e/oes/rls/remarks/2012/196004.htm\" title=\"\">a speech at Dartmouth College in the US</a>, that the long term goal of holding global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 the underpinning principle of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\" title=\"\">Copenhagen accord</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/11/mexico-cancun-environment-climate-summit\" title=\"\">Cancun agreement</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2011/dec/12/durban-climate-change-conference-2011-global-climate-talks\" title=\"\">last year's agreement at Durban</a> - could be abandoned.</p>",
  "<p>More and more people cross international borders because their lives have been ruined by an earthquake, flood, drought or hurricane. But they face a black hole of international law. No major migrant destination country allows people legal entry for this reason.</p> <p>Humanitarian permission may be given to enter rich countries for other reasons. If violence has ruined your life in the country you live in, you may qualify to enter as a \"refugee\" or \"asylee\", as <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/lpr_fr_2011.pdf\" title=\"\">16% of US immigrants did last year</a> (pdf). Equally, if your life was ruined back home by a natural disaster and you enter a rich country without authorisation, many countries won't immediately send you back. But the world has so far decided that the right amount of new, authorised migration because of natural disasters \u2013 no matter how horrific \u2013 is zero.</p> <p>Is zero the right number? Think of Haiti. <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13623699.2010.535279\" title=\"\">At least 150,000 people died there two years ago</a> when houses and buildings could not withstand a cataclysmic earthquake. Many <a href=\"http://www.prio.no/CSCW/Datasets/Armed-Conflict/Battle-Deaths/\" title=\"\">wars don't have a toll as large</a>, or effects as lasting. The US response was to admit a tiny number of Haitians for emergency medical treatment, and to <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/news/2010/01/15/secretary-napolitano-temporary-protected-status-tps-haitian-nationals\" title=\"\">delay most deportations</a>, but not one Haitian could be admitted to the US because of the disaster. This would have been completely different if war had struck Haiti.</p> <p>So, what if a limited number of humanitarian entry slots were offered to people affected by natural disaster? How many should it be? And how would it work? There are precedents. For a generation (1952-80), the US unilaterally defined \"refugee\" to include people fleeing \"natural catastrophes\", but the <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1425143\" title=\"\">provision was almost never utilised</a>. Some other countries have similar de jure provisions today; Sweden, for example, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/479df7472.pdf\" title=\"\">allows for protection of migrants</a> (pdf) \"unable to return to the country of origin because of an environmental disaster\". But there is no equivalent of the <a href=\"http://www.refugees.org/about-us/faqs.html\" title=\"\">international refugee system</a> to realise these on-paper mechanisms.</p> <p>One approach is case by case. Over the past year, my colleagues and I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/feb/20/immigration-passport-fresh-development-frontier\" title=\"\">have led a successful effort</a> to extend a modest, new visa opportunity to Haitians, explicitly for earthquake relief. <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423717/\" title=\"\">Our research</a>, supported by the MacArthur Foundation, showed that migration policy would be a highly effective and inexpensive complement to other US earthquake relief efforts. On this basis, we asked the US government to reverse a ban on Haiti's participation in its largest low-skill work visa programme. The US did so but, most notably, it did so because of the horrific disaster Haiti had just experienced \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465304323031058\" title=\"\">with bipartisan support</a>, in a bad economy. This step will <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/migration_tool_disaster_recovery/economic_impacts_h2_haiti\" title=\"\">barely affect</a> overall immigration to the US, but could bring hundreds of millions of new dollars to Haiti at no fiscal cost.</p> <p>Another approach is to review more systematically how destination countries allocate their limited slots of \"assistance\" migration. <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/review/2010/irrc-879-kolmannskog-trebbi.pdf\" title=\"\">International discussion is under way</a> (pdf) on how this might be done, but consensus is far off. There is less controversy about giving legal status as \"internally displaced persons\" to those affected by natural calamity who move domestically. But those crossing borders due to natural events still have no clear legal status anywhere. Many years of discussions in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and other forums have led to little change. Elizabeth Perris, Michael Cernea and Daniel Petz <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2011/9/idp%20climate%20change/09_idp_climate_change.pdf\" title=\"\">have summarised the state of this debate</a> (pdf) as part of the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/idp\" title=\"\">Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement</a>, a leading voice for reform in this area.</p> <p>These efforts face political barriers, but our work on Haiti proves such barriers have limits. Admitting humanitarian migrants like refugees isn't a handout, it's an investment. Overall, <a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465304323031058\" title=\"\">refugees contribute to the economy</a> at least as much as economic migrants. Great Americans like Intel co-founder Andrew Grove and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright arrived as humanitarian migrants. And the US refugee programme has weathered many economic downturns and political upheavals in its 60-year history.</p> <p>A systematic policy tackling the challenge of post-disaster migration remains far off. Without a major forcing event such as the humanitarian disasters of the second world war, which gave us modern refugee law, that situation seems unlikely to change. Such a moment might have come for natural-disaster migrants had thousands of Haitians arrived on the shores of Florida after the earthquake, but crushing poverty in Haiti and a US naval blockade put paid to that.</p> <p>This story is not over, however. With climate change will come the likelihood of increased damage from floods, droughts and hurricanes, especially in the poorest countries. A better migration policy would foresee and accommodate these 21st-century realities, although it might once again arrive too late to prevent initial tragedies.</p>",
  "<p>It's all over the internet, it's trending, tweeting, the funniest art joke of all time. You must know it by now. \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2191988/A-fading-fresco-DIY-fiasco-Masterpiece-Jesus-destroyed-old-ladys-attempt-restore-damage-divine-intervention.html#ixzz24Ma5yGPK\" title=\"\">Masterpiece of Jesus is destroyed after old lady's attempt to restore damage is a less-than-divine intervention</a>\", <a href=\"http://www.nodeju.com/26905/worst-painting-restoration-work-in-history.html\" title=\"\">Worst painting restoration work in history</a>\", \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/9491391/Elderly-woman-destroys-19th-century-fresco-with-DIY-restoration.html\" title=\"\">Elderly woman destroys 19th century fresco with DIY restoration</a>\".</p> <p>A woman said to be in her 80s in Borjanos in Spain took it upon herself to \"restore\" a fresco in the Sanctuary of Mercy church there. The original painting is an Ecce Homo by Elias Garcia Martinez and dates from the 19th century. But this triptych of photographs shows how totally it has been ruined. It's hilarious to see how the would-be restorer's efforts resulted in a complete reinvention of the painting as a crude image with a face like a neanderthal man's self-portrait. Oh dear. This pious art lover could have a career in slapstick if she wants, for her comic destruction of a work of art bears comparison with Rowan Atkinson <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQevyIy8hzs\" title=\"\">giving Whistler's Mother a badly drawn cartoon face in the film Bean</a>.</p> <p>How did it happen? What was the well-meaning vandal thinking? Reports differ on the meaning of the middle picture in the before-and-after triptych: was this the result of water damage or the self-appointed artist's early effort to prepare the picture for restoration? Picturing how it happened is even funnier than seeing the contrasting versions themselves. Did she, like the Marx Brothers trimming a moustache in Monkey Business, try to fix one bit and then had to do another bit and then another until the whole thing was gone? Was it like Father Ted in the episode of the much-loved clerical comedy where he attempts to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IL22sLF25s\" title=\"\">mend a car's bodywork with a hammer</a>?</p> <p>There is only one problem with this story. It doesn't really matter. Martinez is not a great artist and his painting Ecce Homo is not a \"masterpiece\". It is a minor painting in the dregs of an academic tradition. When it was painted, a boy called Pablo in another Spanish town was learning to paint in this same exhausted 19th-century style. Soon he would shake off the influence of his father the provincial artist Don Jose Ruiz y Picasso and start to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso\" title=\"\">reinvent art</a>.</p> <p>Google Martinez and you will find many, many references that have appeared in the last 24 hours to the botched restoration \u2013 and not much else. A previously obscure artist has become famous overnight because of the amateur restorer's exploit. A forgotten painting is now known around the world as a \"masterpiece\", because it was wrecked.</p> <p>Perhaps this offers a new strategy for those who seek to popularise the Old Masters. What if even older, but far greater, paintings were to get the Mr Bean treatment?</p> <p>After Rowan Atkinson gave a show-stopping Mr Bean performance as a keyboard player upstaging a Simon Rattle-conducted performance of Chariots of Fire in the Olympic opening ceremony, the composer Michael Nyman took exception to orchestral music <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a397652/michael-nyman-unhappy-with-chariots-of-fire-in-opening-ceremony.html\" title=\"\">being mocked in this way</a>. Where did his sense of humour go? Surely he can see that classical music should use this strategy to popularise itself. We need Mr Bean disrupting performances of Monteverdi and Mahler. That will get the kids into the concert halls.</p> <p>Similarly, the well-meaning restorer of this obscure Spanish painting should be turned loose on a couple of works that actually matter. Many true masterpieces are starved of the global attention this second-rate Ecce Homo has now got. She could be sent to Italy to see what she can do with the frescoes in the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara. Revered by art historians, these <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salone_dei_Mesi\" title=\"\">paintings of the months of the year</a> have never quite made it into popular culture. There are 12 paintings, one for every month, so one could be sacrificed for the good of the whole. A hideously repainted face on one of the lesser months might make their creator the 15th-century genius Francesco del Cossa as famous as the 19th century mediocrity Elias Garcia Martinez has now become.</p>",
  "<p>Prince Charles is said to be furious. Buck House is embarrassed. Over several pages of titillating hand-wringing, the Daily Mail and Telegraph express deep concern. Yes, that \"Prince Harry in nude photos\" row is enlivening a quiet late August. And yet again I find myself warming to the lad. He is fast becoming the royal Boris.</p> <p>I realise there is a recession on, that most of us can't afford a \u00a3450-a-night hotel suite and that even if we could many of us wouldn't choose Las Vegas. I've been there at least once, and once is enough. Its gangster image has long since been cleaned up, and nowadays it's more of a Disneyland for borderline grownups, a money-making machine in the Nevada desert, plastic-wrapped sin for all the family. Even the swimming pools are too shallow to swim in.</p> <p>Never mind. Harry's 27 now \u2013 plenty old enough to vote and to fight for the Queen \u2013 and he wanted to go there on holiday with his Etonian posse. If his salary as an army captain and Richard Branson's Caribbean hospitality didn't pay all the bills, I'm sure Granny will see him right and that the taxpayer will help her out, much as we all help pay those Branson bills for the train set.</p> <p>Scandalous, isn't it? As one prurient American TV host whom I spotted on YouTube put it with fake piety: \"Harry's brother is saving lives as a helicopter pilot in Wales\" while he's partying in Vegas. The presenter was grinning at the time.</p> <p>I gave up looking for the grainy shots of the naked royal. I'm assured they're online if you look hard enough, but who cares. It's hardly worth the trouble navigating one's way through the nudge-nudge and the \"show us the crown jewels, Harry\" uproar of all those sites trying to make a buck out of TMZ's little scoop. So many awful people, most of them tanned and overweight. Welcome to Vegas, where the casino food and drink is often very cheap \u2013 free even \u2013 provided you're a gambler or a young woman.</p> <p>We could talk all day about behaviour appropriate to a young royal, third in line to Granny's throne, not to mention that of an army officer \u2013 you're an officer wherever you are and should set a good example, the Telegraph quotes a colonel as saying. But not even he can keep a straight face for long. Young officers are just that, they don't stay at home knitting, he goes on to admit.</p> <p>It's so easy to get pompous about this, isn't it? Chippy to the end, the Sun protests that it's not part of the fake outrage and it's the posher papers (I think it means the Mail, which has five pages on the subject) that are getting worked up. The dear old Guardian provides a prim 500 words, tucked away on an inside page. The Times has a double-page spread, and the FT once again shields its readers from the harsh realities of unequal modern Britain.</p> <p>No, I haven't forgotten the privacy issue that is first cousin to the censorship issue. Prince Charles \"bans\" nude pics, the Mail tells its readers. Actually no, he just got a legal flunky to remind the press and broadcasters of assorted media codes on individual privacy and human rights. The royal Fitztightly chappie may even have murmured the word \"Leveson\" down the phone for Fleet Street's more knuckle-dragging executives. (I wonder if Sir Brian has ever taken Lady Leveson to check out the eye candy in Las Vegas?)</p> <p>So the mobile shots are not to be seen in the mainstream UK media. Is this an outrage, a violation of our Magna Carta rights? Of course not, but some of the people saying so will also say the prince's behaviour was immature and deplorable. Having it both ways? Welcome to Britain, where newspapers that deplore the rampant exploitation of sex in our society \u2013 I name no names, Paul Dacre \u2013 serve up a generous dollop of prurient filth most days of the week and sell a lot of copies in the process. As for their websites, don't ask. They don't.</p> <p>As the papers are keen to remind us, Harry has been in plenty of scrapes before: drinks, drugs, swastikas, pretty girls \u2013 though he also won a place to train in the US as an Apache helicopter pilot, which apparently is very exacting work. They don't let boys play with such expensive toys if they think they'll crash them. He also exudes an easy charm, the kind of talent money can't buy, as he showed in his enjoyably silly race with Usain Bolt during a successful \u2013 and notably informal \u2013 royal tour of Jamaica.</p> <p>So I prefer to frame the question differently: when you heard of Prince Harry's latest antics \u2013 all those bikini-clad girls, the swimming race with another Olympic gold medallist, Ryan Lochte (Lochte's chums apparently held his feet to help Harry), the etiquette of strip billiards \u2013 did you frown or laugh?</p> <p>I laughed. Perhaps the ever-dutiful Queen, who gave us a rare glimpse of the royal sense of humour by participating in that stylish Olympic gag with 007, laughed too. We all need cheering up. That's why Boris Johnson, the clown who got elected, got re-elected. The Las Vegas incident was very Boris.</p> <p>Of course it's all silly and possibly undignified. But Harry strikes me as likable. A bit wild, though not in the league of royal princes of the past. Their antics were both much more private and unpleasant. Think Edwards VII and VIII, think all the sons of poor, decent George III, their misconduct \u2013 the women, gambling, spending \u2013 lampooned mercilessly by James Gilray and his cartooning cohort, their carriages booed in the street.</p> <p>And yet and yet, the two Edwards were popular, the latter absurdly so before he ratted and married Wallis Simpson. Who would you prefer to sit next to on a bus, Prince Charles or Prince Harry? Is Shakespeare's Harry a more attractive character than Henry IV, his care-worn dad? Will such incidents as Nude Harry improve the monarchy's chances of survival? Or will our hereditary presidency succumb to a sternly republican one when Granny leaves the stage?</p> <p>It's impossible to predict. But meanwhile the Las Vegas saga is surely too funny to resist. There's Harry reportedly sidling up to a member of the royal protection squad (sic) and muttering something about protecting him from Facebook and Twitter \u2013 too late, Harry! \u2013 and the whole question of what exactly royal protection officers are protecting their charges from at a nude party in a Las Vegas hotel suite (and how). The royal soap opera needs Harry's storyline. It's part of the constitutional mix.</p>",
  "<p>In this concise but extremely ambitious book, the Oxford historian David Priestland sets himself the task of taking the long view of the financial crisis that afflicts the world today. His argument is&#xa0;that the year 2008, when the credit crunch began, is as important as 1917, the year of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, or&#xa0;1945, when the second world war came to an end. Four years on, the crisis shows no sign of coming to an end, and&#xa0;political systems, economies and societies seem in a state of disarray \u2013 even looming collapse.</p> <p>How has all this come to pass? Why have we got to such a crisis? Such questions, Priestland suggests, can only be answered with the help of history, \"the&#xa0;only kind of guide we have to the future\". If the crisis has done one thing, he suggests, it has been to discredit the simplistic view of history that recognises in it nothing but progress towards a liberal, free-market, capitalist, democratic present and future. Capitalism comes in many forms, and if the recent development of China shows anything, it is that democracy doesn't have to come with it. Historical change isn't impelled solely or even principally by the conflict between economically based classes, as Marx believed, or by the clash of ideologies, as the last of the great optimists, the American academic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/francis-fukuyama\" title=\"\">Francis Fukuyama</a>, assumed. In practice, both play a part. It makes more sense, says Priestland, to look not at the interaction of abstract forces but at the concrete competition for power between three major groups in society over the ages \u2013 or, as he calls them, \"castes\", each with its identity and purposes rooted in an ethos closely linked to occupation and social function.</p> <p>The first of these is the merchant caste, or in modern parlance, the capitalists, promoting the values of business competition and the market. The second is the soldier caste, originating in the warrior aristocracy of the feudal middle ages and emphasising heroism, aggression and discipline. The third is the sagely or clerical-intellectual caste, dating from the days of the monks in medieval Christian society and finding its present-day embodiment in the bureaucrat, the technocrat and the expert. Over the centuries, these three castes have struggled for supremacy over the broad mass of peasants and, more recently, workers. This struggle, he boldly declares, has been \"the locomotive of history\".</p> <p>When one or other of these castes becomes too dominant, crisis usually ensues and it is replaced by another. The dictatorial and hierarchical rule of the soldier caste is destroyed by defeat in over-ambitious military action; the hidebound and ossified rule of the sage caste leads to revolutionary uprisings designed to widen participation in the state; the unconstrained dominance of the merchant caste leads to economic instability and inequality, fuelling social conflict and sparking revolution.</p> <p>Most of Priestland's book is devoted to a narrative account of recent history seen in terms of the competition between these three castes. The focus here is on the inexorable rise of the merchant, beginning in England and the Netherlands in the 17th century, gathering pace and spreading geographically in the early industrial age, and coming temporarily to grief in the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Thoroughly discredited, the merchant caste gave way in a country like Germany to a modernised version of the rule of the warrior under the Nazis, in Soviet Russia to an unstable alliance of martial bureaucrats and ideologues under Stalin, in Scandinavia to the rule of Social Democratic sages keeping the warriors and merchants under their thumb.</p> <p>If the merchant caste was discredited by the Depression, the soldier caste lost its legitimacy after the vast catastrophe of the second world war, and for a while the Social Democratic model provided stability and progress. But this sagely rule got into trouble too, its bureaucratic dullness and elitism alienating women, youth, minorities and \"1960s creatives\", its managerial claims destroyed by its failure to control the economic crisis that followed the huge global oil price hikes of 1973-74. This allowed the merchant caste to make a comeback, which it did with a vengeance towards the end of the 20th century.</p> <p>Today, Priestland says, the merchant caste rules alone in the west. Wherever you look, you find it in charge. In the UK, Margaret Thatcher brought business values into the heart of government and there they have stayed. In the US, Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve unleashed an era of unbridled financial expansion. In Russia, the collapse of communism opened the way to a decade of free-for-all capitalist competition with huge fortunes being made by a few and a collapse in living standards suffered by the many. Everywhere, trade unions were vanquished, the public sector assaulted and diminished, while what was left of it was subordinated to commercial values.</p> <p>The destruction of New York's twin towers by Islamist terrorists led by Osama bin Laden (a warrior, according to Priestland, a sagely fanatic in the eyes of President George Bush) prompted the resurgence of the warrior ethos, represented most crudely by the US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld (\"We've got to do Iraq,\" he said before the invasion: \"There just aren't enough targets in Afghanistan. We need to bomb something else to prove that we're, you know, big and strong and not going to be pushed around by these kind of attacks\").</p> <p>Yet the self-evident pointlessness of&#xa0;the Iraq war and the huge costs it incurred \u2013 human, political, financial \u2013 shoved the warrior ethos back into its box. Only in Russia, where the consequences of merchant rule were spectacularly awful, did the warrior caste come back to power, in the shape of Vladimir Putin. In the west, continued merchant rule brought \"economic insecurity, corrosive inequality and potential environmental catastrophe\", with unbridled and unregulated financial competition leading from 2008 onwards to unprecedented financial collapse, government indebtedness and political instability with no foreseeable end.</p> <p>Priestland's solution, predictably enough in a book coming from an Oxford don, is more sagely power. Yet there are few signs of this happening, and, drawing on the example of the 1930s, he warns darkly that \"the year 2008 has set the world on a course towards potential conflict, and the domestic and international forces that brought us the violence of the 1930s and 1940s are with us today\" \u2013 not least in a China that has close similarities with the kaiser's Germany in its synthesis of nationalism and merchant power, though it's clearly less militaristic.</p> <p>If sages are to be reinstated in positions of power, they need, according to Priestland, to forge alliances with others, above all with creative groups and with workers. Yet this is where his model begins to come apart, for these two elements in society remain shadowy figures in the background all the way through his book. He clearly believes in democracy, but by portraying history as a struggle between elites he takes it out of the picture, reducing the vast majority of people to passive objects of the ongoing fight for supremacy by their superiors. This is history from above with a vengeance. Moreover, by forcing so much into such a simple straitjacket of historical categories, he lets himself in for a whole range of dubious generalisations and obvious oversimplifications. Are we really ruled by merchants for example? Have the military in the US really been sidelined? Is China really like Wilhelmine Germany? At the end of almost every paragraph readers will surely feel the word \"but\" coming to their lips.</p> <p>Priestland is of course aware of the complexities of political structures, but he leaves himself too little space to explain how and why alliances between his castes occur, and how the different groups modify and intermingle their values and behaviour with those of the others; if he'd done that, then the detail would have submerged his schema out of existence. Nevertheless, it's a schema well worth pondering and reflecting on. And among the many contributions to the dissection of our current predicament, this is surely one of the most thought-provoking.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard J Evans is Regius professor of history at Cambridge.</p>",

I heard these same things well over ten years ago when I started my career and that has become a sense of huge frustration for me personally. I wouldn't say that it is important that I share them, I think it might be more for my own peace of mind and sanity as much as anything else.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>11.35am: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17855290\">Danamo</a></strong> asks about wages: <strong>\"In what year did you think wages reached a level where the short career argument became invalid? If all this had never happened footballers made an average wage, do you think you'd be happy?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17856315\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I suppose there is an argument that wages were only going to go one way when Jimmy Hill lobbied to abolish the maximum wage because the demand has always been there for football, especially in this country. However, we all know that the real reason for enormous wages is a combination of Sky TV and the inception of the Premier League so if I had to say a year it would be 1992.</p> <p>Regarding the second part of the question, it is impossible to tell. I can, however, point to the things that would not have been there without the money. There is a certain pressure to maintain the income as the seasons are slipping by and a feeling of butterflies in the stomach as you are running out of time. And I think for a lot of players this can be applied to, for example, the adulation, the camaraderie etc. Fortunately I have always had an exit plan in place but so many don't.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>11.38am: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17855323\">GlasgowGooner</a></strong> asks about the Premier League's imports: <strong>\"I've always been curious why players who come to the premier league from Europe seem much more sophisticated/rounded Individuals.

It does seem as if players from abroad (not all of course) are well rounded and more capable of dealing with the spotlight. </p> <p>A foreign friend of mine at one club I played for used to think that this was because they would make it in to teams at a young age in so called lesser leagues before coming to the big European leagues, and they also knew that they would be going home one day which enabled them to look at life outside of the bubble.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>11.40am: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17856348\">matthewlgrant</a></strong> wants to know what the future holds for the Secret Footballer: <strong>\"Will there be more columns, or is the book the end of it all?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17856397\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can you ask the editor for me?

If so, what do they think of what you're doing and how has it affected your relationship with them?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17856500\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A couple of players do know. One is involved in the secret footballer website and the other has since retired. It obviously isn't the sort of thing that I discuss in the dressing room, not because I would be worried about what they thought but because word would soon get out in to the public domain, and that would have ruined the columns and the book.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>11.47am: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17856493\">marcostanleyfogg</a></strong> asks about the reading habits of footballers: \"Do you know any high-profile footballer who reads the Guardian or high-brow novels?

Thanks.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17856689\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can only think of one player I have played with that reads a broadsheet and he certainly wouldn't be a player that you would have expected to read The Times. The most popular paper is The Sun, followed by The Star but even then it is literally a 30-second flick through. </p> <p>Any player that reads on the bus or the plane is reading a novel, lots of the foreign players read novels.

In reply to your question the most common flagrance of a manager's instructions is from set pieces. Sometimes a player just needs to go with his gut instinct of where the ball will be delivered and where the opportunity for a strike a goal may lie. We all have individually tailored runs but if a team is in desperate need of a goal in the final minutes you might find that the players go with their instincts. </p> <p>As for losing a dressing room, it most definitely does happen and it will come on the back of a manager that changes too much too soon or a manager that just isn't up to the job and is out of his depth. The players will lose respect and stop trying as hard.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>12.01pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17856809\">GhostWiper</a></strong> seems to have caught out The Secret Footballer on the timing of his day off: <strong>\"It's Thursday today.

What's the strangest one you've personally witnessed?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17857158\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A lot of the African players have some interesting rituals. One African player I played with had two tiny pieces of cardboard wrapped with tape that he would slide down his shinpads. It was something to do with warding off bad luck.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>12.06pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17857142\">atrack</a></strong> thinks he has unearthed another clue: <strong>\"It looks like you're <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2012/aug/22/i-am-the-secret-footballer-video\">left-footed in the video</a> - are you, or is that another red-herring?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17857222\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Are you suggesting I'm one footed!

I am uncomfortable with being remembered as a footballer anyway because there is so much else to do. Not that I haven't done anything that is worth remembering - that's an occupational hazard!</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>12.12pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17856123\">tobyarup</a></strong> asks about the impact of London 2012 on football: <strong>\"Can the Olympic spirit change the behavior of footballers, managers and even some fans ?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17857412\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I really thought that there could be some residual euphoria left over that could creep across into the football season.

Hindsight is not a 'wonderful thing' as the saying goes, it is pointless in my view especially in football because even if you learn from a mistake in the early part of your career it isn't like you can benefit from it at 40 or 50, like other jobs. But if I was advising a 17-year-old now I would tell them not to be discouraged by rejection. I know lots of players that were rejected as kids that are now very successful footballers.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>12.19pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17857530\">JohnBarnesRap</a> asks about relationships in the dressing room: <strong>\"What sort of things do footballers tend to get ripped for in the dressing room? Shirking challenges? Songs against them by the crowd? Night-before photos in the press?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17857650\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Replying to questions that have an obvious answer plus... </p> <p>Dressing badly, especially dodgy shoes.

On the plus side you will always be known as a player that \"came through\" at Manchester United or Arsenal which generally means you will get a good move when your regular playing career starts. The obvious downside is that the competition is incredibly fierce and today, you really do have to be fairly exceptional. </p> <p>Josh McEachran is a great example, he is undoubtably a talented player, similar to Wilshire but he simply cannot get near Chelsea's starting 11 as they spend tens of millions on players that don't have as far to go to become regular first teamers.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>12.38pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17858063\">bartletsjacket</a></strong> asks about depression: <strong>\"In your most recent comment you were very open about receiving treatment for depression. Is this something that you are open with your colleagues about \u2013 not specifically players but club staff in general? I work in an environment very different to football and I know from experience that there is a huge stigma about this but I wonder whether it is viewed differently in a working environment where so much emphasis is placed on 'mental preparation'.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17858227\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A couple of players have seen me taking my pills before training and asked what they are (probably in fear that they are missing out on something) and so I have simply told them. They are always completely nonplussed. Club staff are generally excellent, after all, my performances affect their positions at the club but they are also looking out for me because, more often than not, we are friends. </p> <p>In light of some of the high profile cases the understanding within football is now pretty good, we have recognised that this is happening rather than pretending it isn't which was a major barrier even a few years ago. Interesting to see the former Norwich player Darren Eadie has set up a clinic to help treat depression in football specifically.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>12.40pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17858185\">snuffy</a></strong> asks about motivation against disliked players:<strong>\"In competing with other players, club mates or opponents, how much does hate or dislike for them motivate you?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17858312\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hate is a strong word but I take your point. I have lost count of the amount of times that i have thought to myself, 'if we could get rid of him, him and him, this would be a great club'. I am certain that other players have said thought that about me too. I think it can be a motivation to get in the team but I think that is where we draw the line, it's not as if we hope that they go off the road on the way home from training or anything!</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>12.47pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17857500\">BreadClub</a></strong> asks about favourite football grounds: <strong>\"Do you have a preference for type of stadium to play in?

I tend to lean that way too but sometimes when you are playing at the huge, brand new grounds you can't help but be impressed. The Emirates and The Etihad are both fantastic stadiums to play football in and Arsenal even do chicken nuggets in the changing room after!

It's well worth a read.</p> <p>Here are a few highlights:</p> <p><strong>How did the column come about and has it changed your opinion of the media?</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"Some time ago I was turned on to a column in The Financial Times called 'The Secret Agent', who worked in London sourcing real estate for the very wealthy. I became hooked on the idea of the column as much as anything else. His writing is excellent but I could never shake the thought of how huge a secret footballer column could be.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>How would you describe the relationship between sports stars and the media?</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"A friend of mine who runs one of the big weekly gossip magazines once told me that her publication goes out of their way to place David and Victoria Beckham on their front cover every week. The sales of the magazine increase significantly, regardless of what the story is about. In fact, she said in the absence of a real story they will simply \"generate\" one just to get their picture on the cover. None of that is new, but what has changed is the amount of \"celebrities\" this practice now extends to. It seems every company wants to affiliate itself with a celebrity and, whether they like it or not, footballers are some of the biggest global celebrities around.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>3.41pm: The news from the secret bunker in which TSF is blogging is that he will be back with us in 15 minutes. Here is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/22/i-am-secret-footballer-review\">the Guardian review of I Am The Secret Footballer</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is nothing like a concealed identity to drive people wild. Aside from all those Shakespearean kings going among their people disguised as commoners, it's the basis of the classic murder mystery, in which the governing idea is that someone with whom you thought you were familiar is capable of lethal actions, right under your nose. Just as this unnerves, it also bewitches: what if you were able to unravel the clues and solve the mystery? What would that say about you?</p> <p>As much as I enjoy the Guardian's Secret Footballer column, which has been running in the paper for the past 18 months or so, I must confess that I get even greater pleasure out of occasionally checking in with the website whoisthesecretfootballer.co.uk. </p> <p>It is there that the full obsessional nuttiness of football fans (and, by extension, of people in general, although that is debatable) is revealed. In this forum, each tiny piece of information, carefully tabulated and cross-referenced, about the unnamed Premier League footballer is analysed and subjected to verification, having been broken down into the categories \"Main clues\", \"Other clues\" and \"Clues from his tweets\".</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>4.38pm: While we're on here waiting for The Secret Footballer to return, it seems that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/23/manchester-united-mexico-hector-herrera\">Manchester United have been trying to sign \"Zorro\"</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/23/qpr-talks-sign-julio-cesar\">QPR have entered talks about signing Internazionale goalkeeper J\u00falio C\u00e9sar</a>.

I wanted to write a book that people haven't seen before, I know that I've never read a book like it before. </p> <p>I think there is an important point here, writing under anonymity allows the reader to asses my ramblings without the prejudice that they might have towards a player that they know has played for a rival team or a person that doesn't perhaps have any kind of profile outside of his own club. </p> <p>Football is extremely tribal and it can provoke a reaction that isn't born of logic but, instead, allowing your heart to rule over your head. So even if a pundit has something interesting to say, he may not always be able to penetrate a persons loathing of them.

Clearly, there are players at every club that are there because the agent has made promises to that manager that he will have a chance to sign the agents star player if he just takes this other one for a year or two first. </p> <p>To answer your other point, there are many examples of players that have made it all the way from bottom to top as you quite rightly point out and I think that is because many players are so hungry to get to the top now. There is a clear agenda in the media that football, outside of the Premier League, does not exist; the column inches alone back that up and many papers have pulled reporters from games outside of the Premier League altogether. </p> <p>For the players, they want to get to the Premier League, it is the only place they want to be. Some just want to say that they've done it, others are fiercely determined to get there and stay there. Talent wise the gulf is huge but there is no accounting for what can happen in a one-off game, that's why cup football can be so entertaining. </p> <p>I think there is still something to be said for masking talent with hard work (in fact I know there is) but I am convinced that the shift is towards technically superior players, even the holding midfielders in the Premier League are now extremely confident with the ball at their feet.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>6.27pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17866533\">kevvykev</a></strong> is loyal to the Guardian, but wants to know what paper The Secret Footballer reads: <strong>\"Are there any particular football journalists who you genuinely like and that you think have genuine insight?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17866777\">TSF replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Simon Kuper writes for the FTweekend about anything and everything and occasionally he'll write a fantastic article on football.

But mostly, it's because foreign players are cheaper. Despite everybody in the game knowing that English players can often be inferior to that of their foreign counterpart, the transfer fees paid for them and their wages remain excessive in comparison. </p> <p>Also, the pool is smaller, if I wanted to sign a new midfielder then I have a handful of English options or, alternatively, the rest of the world to choose from. </p> <p>The model at Wigan is interesting, they clearly have a policy and a scouting network that extends primarily to Latin America and South America. They feel that they can buy cheap players that are capable of performing in the Premier League and can be polished up and sold on at a hefty profit. South American teams are aware of this and charge a sell on fee. in order to maintain the supply of players to Europe they will push already technically sound players of 16-17 in to their first teams so that they can sell them when they hit 21 after which the player will have enough experience and (importantly) international caps to secure him a work permit (I think Neymar was 15 when I first heard of him).

Most of the people that were there to see it will surely be there the following next week.</p> <p>For me, it isn't necessarily the bad behaviour as a whole, it is more about not knowing when to stop.

  "<p>The Co-operative Group has said it sees no letup in the tough environment for consumers, as it <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/Press/Press-releases/Headline-news/Interim-results-for-The-Co-operative-Group-for-the-26-weeks-ended-30-June-2012/#3\" title=\"\">posted a 55% drop in pre-tax profits</a> in the first half of the year.</p> <p>With annual sales of more than \u00a313bn, the group is regarded as a bellwether of the UK's economy because of the broad spread of its consumer businesses, which include retail and banking as well as farming and travel.</p> <p>Overall sales at the group inched up 0.2% to \u00a36.6bn, as profits before tax and member payments \u2013 the equivalent of pre-tax profits at a public company \u2013 tumbled to \u00a369m.</p> <p>The Co-operative blamed the poor results on the \"tough headwinds of the unrelenting consumer downturn\". Peter Marks, chief executive of the group, said: \"A year ago I warned that we were operating in the worst conditions that I have seen in more than 40 years in business. The results we are announcing today show the full impact of that.\"</p> <p>He expects an improvement in sales and profit in the second half. \"The environment is tough and we see no letup in that. But we believe that the work we have done over the past five years to scale up in our core businesses means we are better placed than ever before to thrive when the economic upturn does come.\"</p> <p>The company said the impact of the downturn was most keenly felt in the banking division, as businesses failed to pay back loans, and the Bank of England kept interest rates at record lows.</p> <p>Co-operative food stores also suffered amid \"fierce\" competition from supermarkets. The group said its 3,000-strong convenience stores were also hurt by the wet weather as people drove to supermarkets rather than walk to local shops.</p> <p>The results come at the end of a busy half for the Co-operative Group, which saw its banking division <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/lloyds-branches-co-op-nbnk?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">agree to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group</a>, and the announcement that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/peter-marks-leave-co-operative\" title=\"\">Marks would step down as chief executive next May</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The government's announcement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/nhs-brand-sold-overseas-hospitals\" title=\"\">a renewed push to market the NHS abroad</a> could help improve patient care in the UK \u2013 but there are risks.</p> <p>The Department of Health (DH) and UK Trade and Investment want more leading hospitals to follow the example of world renowned institutions such as Moorfields eye hospital and Great Ormond Street children's hospital by establishing franchises abroad.</p> <p>The move was <a href=\"http://www.nhsconfed.org/priorities/latestnews/Pages/Scheme-for-NHS-hospital-trusts-abroad-a-real-opportunity.aspx\" title=\"\">welcomed with unrestrained enthusiasm by the NHS Confederation</a>, which believes the health service could secure a slice of the estimated \u00a32.5 trillion global healthcare industry and reinvest the money at home. But the <a href=\"http://www.patients-association.com/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Patients Association</a> fears it would be a distraction from implementing the government's health reforms and finding \u00a320bn of productivity gains.</p> <p>International work is not a luxury for the good times; it is key to the future of the NHS. Healthcare can mount a strong claim to be the most global of industries. New techniques spread with extraordinary speed. While technology firms and pharmaceutical companies hoard their inventions behind walls of patents, doctors and other healthcare practitioners shout their research results and clinical trials (the successful ones, at least) from the pages of peer-reviewed journals and the platforms of international symposia. This global network drives progress in the best NHS hospitals.</p> <p>While there are corners of the NHS which perform poorly by national and even regional standards, the best clinical teams in the country benchmark their survival rates and other performance measures internationally. Directly competing with other world class healthcare teams will encourage our best hospitals to stay at the forefront of modern practice, to the benefit of NHS patients.</p> <p>Working internationally need not be a distraction from the pursuit of greater productivity at home. Indeed, some of the most exciting developments in countries such as India and Brazil are focused on delivering high quality at low cost. The <a href=\" http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/multimedia/dr_ravindran.html\" title=\"\">Aravind eye care system</a> in India is just one example from which the NHS can learn. The NHS as a whole is often slow to adopt new approaches to care; more international work can help push reform through the system.</p> <p>So there is more to setting up NHS facilities abroad than simply the money. The additional income will, be useful, of course, helping fund innovation and research as well as more routine activities. But the DH and the NHS Confederation should be more open about the financial risks and address the issue of distracting hospitals from NHS care.</p> <p>As trusts struggle to cope with falling income and the cash freeze in NHS spending stretches into the far distance, it would be understandable for senior clinicians and managers to focus their efforts on developing a shiny new institution abroad rather than deal with the less glamorous frustrations back home. And, since these ventures will be funded by private patient income, will that further distort priorities? The risk of distraction is real and cannot be wished away. Rigorous board oversight will be essential to ensure clinical and management focus on the core service does not diminish.</p> <p>The financial risks are significant. The capital investment in technologically advanced healthcare facilities can be expected to be substantial, hospital building projects have been known to go over budget, and the running costs are likely to be high. The financial rewards will be uncertain and are unlikely to look impressive compared with total NHS spending.</p> <p>Simply saying the expenditure will be ringfenced from NHS funds sounds unconvincing. If money can flow in, it doesn't take much imagination to believe it could also flow out if what seemed a good idea in England turns out to be less appealing in Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>But if the risks are faced up to and managed, the long-term benefits to NHS patients of more international collaboration could be substantial. Hunkering down and saying the health service has not got time to work abroad is the creed of inertia. Faster improvement in patient care must be the overriding goal.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-healthcare-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The UK's flush of enthusiasm over the Olympic Games continues and will be boosted again by the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics\">Paralympics</a>, but academics who study our national attitudes to sport do not expect it to last.</p> <p>Football will soon reassert its primacy because of the communal, team and 'clubby' nature of the game and its very long-standing structure, according to Dr Chris Stride of Sheffield university who created the <a href=\"http://www.offbeat.group.shef.ac.uk/statues/\">Sporting Statues Project.</a></p> <p>This has compiled a directory and 'biography' over over 100 sporting statues in the UK of which only five are of Olympians: Sir Steve Redgrave, <a href=\"http://www.matthewpinsent.com/\">Matthew Pinsent</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/feb/12/john-curry-olympic-gold\">John Curry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-18971752\">Steve Ovett</a> from modern times, and <a href=\"http://www.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/home\">Eric Liddell </a>from the <em>Chariots of Fire </em>days in the 1920s. The contrast is striking with the evidence in ancient marble from Olympia in Greece, where the original games inspired an industry of statues portraying that favourite subject of the classical artist, the male nude.</p> <p>There is currently talk of statues in Sheffield and Edinburgh of Jessica Ennis and Sir Chris Hoy, but Stride is sceptical despite the success of the Royal Mail's golden pillarboxes and almost daily new stamps commemorating medal winners this year. He says: </p> <blockquote> <p>The lack of Olympian statues in the UK is ironic given the origins of sports statues in the ancient Greek Olympics but, for a statue project to succeed it requires a site and funding. Football clubs own land to site a statue upon and, at the higher echelons, a statue is a relatively small expense.</p> <p>The use of statues and other types of nostalgic branding in the commercialised world of Premiership Football is now well established. Even smaller clubs will often have a group of committed supporters willing to fundraise over a period of years to honour their childhood heroes.</p> <p>Conversely Olympic athletes are in the public eye for relatively brief periods and are not typically part of a larger sports organisation, so they do not have the same committed supporter base to campaign for a statue or raise money for one - nor do they have a regular home stadium where a statue would be placed. Even when they are suggested as statue subjects for a town or city centre site they may often be competing with other local heroes from all walks of life for the honour.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395083353\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2011/11/14/1321271004221/Sebastian-Coe-and-Steve-O-001.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett, knitted\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Ovett and Seb Coe got into knitwear.

So many were cast in Paris in the late 19th century that the term 'statuemania' became common currency and new monuments were eventually banned. The reaction which set in worldwide was memorably lampooned by <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/science/butler.html\">Samuel Butler</a> in his <em><a href=\"http://diaspora.gen.nz/~maire/Philyra/poetry/anthology/poems/Butler_Montreal.html\">Psalm of Montreal</a></em>, prompted by an encounter with a local who disliked depictions of naked athletes and hid his own in an attic:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The Discobolus is put here because he is vulgar,&#xa0;<br>He hath neither vest nor pants with which to cover his limbs;&#xa0;<br>I, sir, am a person of most respectable connections,&#xa0;<br>My brother-in-law is haberdasher to Mr. Spurgeon.\"&#xa0;<br>&#xa0; O God, O Montreal! </em></p> </blockquote> <p>If public enthusiasm falters, local councils seeking to promote tourism or just their image could take up the baton, says Stride: </p> <blockquote> <p>Just as football clubs believe that depicting a famous ex-player enhances the brand image of their club and its stadium, local authorities are beginning to use sport-related public art to promote their cities and improve the urban environment. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395083354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2007/10/28/angel140.jpg\" alt=\"Angel of the North.\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People didn't like the idea to start with.

After totting up the figures, Radio 4's More or Less has worked out that the deadliest fictional place in the world of deadly fictional places is Cabot Cove in Maine, home town of one Jessica Fletcher in Murder, She Wrote, which has 149 murders for every 100,000 people. Ystad, home of Swedish detective Wallander, is nipping at its heels, with 110 murders per 100,000. By comparison, Oxford, which is home to Inspector Morse and his sidekick Lewis, is positively boring, with a mere three murders for every 100,000, while Midsomer, of Murders fame, (where recent murders include the body of a tax inspector being found dumped in a barrel of cider and a local farmer brutally murdered on an ancient stone circle) has just 3.2 murders per 100,000. Handily, the Sun gives a few top tips for keeping safe if you ever find yourself in any of these places, including keeping an eye on your drink so no one can poison it and to never arrive in storm.

We built a rover, so unless the rover roves we haven't accomplished anything.\"</p> <p>Theisinger said the mission had been going \"extremely well\" so far, reporting \"no anomalies or other issues\", with the exception of suspected damage to one of two wind sensors on the rover's weather station, most likely caused by pebbles striking the device.</p> <p>The site where Curiosity landed has been named Bradbury Landing, the team said, after science fiction writer Ray Bradbury. In his short story collection The Martian Chronicles, humans colonised Mars after fleeing a ravaged Earth. Bradbury, who died in June, would have turned 92 on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"This was not a difficult choice for the science team,\" said Michael Meyer, lead scientist of Nasa's Mars Exploration Program. \"Many of us and millions of other readers were inspired in our lives by stories Ray Bradbury wrote to dream of the possibility of life on Mars.\"</p> <p>The journey on Wednesday was described as \"very beautiful\" by lead driver Matt Heverly, who was behind the wheel for Curiosity's initial foray. \"I'm pleased to report that today Curiosity had her first successful drive on Mars,\" he told the news conference in Pasadena, California, to whoops and cheers.</p> <p>Heverly reported a \"fully functioning\" system on the rover. The conditions for driving had been kind too, the soil \"firm, great for mobility\". The key thing ascertained from the drive, Heverly said, was that the team had been able to \"do one full revolution of the drive actuators\", which power Curiosity's six wheels.</p> <p>\"We're very excited to have this milestone behind us. We can see that the system is performing very well.\"</p> <p>The first few weeks on Mars are set aside for performing various tests on Curiosity to check its cameras and various scientific instruments. It is also an opportunity for engineers to get used to using Curiosity's robotic arm, which is 2m long and weighs in at 30kg \u2013 much bigger and trickier to manoeuvre than the arms on the previous Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity.</p> <p>\"They're not in any rush \u2013 this mission is meant to last for two Earth years,\" said Peter Grindrod, a planetary scientist at University College London, who has been watching every move of the mission. \"The first few days are about: is everything in one piece, are the cameras working?\"</p> <p>The science experiments will start when the rover gets to its first place of interest, an area called Glenelg, about 400m away to the east of where it is now. Nasa scientists are also keen to analyse blast marks created on Mars's surface when the descent rockets moved away dust during the landing, revealing interesting-looking bedrock.</p> <p>The rover has already fired its laser into the landing site and taken pictures and data, but Nasa has not yet revealed any of the measurements. \"All the other rocks on the surface look like the Mars everyone knows from Viking through to Spirit,\" said Grindrod. \"The ones that have been revealed [at the blast marks] look like they might be slightly lighter toned and might suggest a different composition. The most interesting thing is that these don't look like rocks that are just sat on the surface and have ended up there, either from thrown out from a meteorite impact or having been delivered by erosion. These things look like they might be in situ, where they formed.\"</p> <p>Geologists can use in-situ rocks to ascertain a good idea of the history of that part of the planet \u2013 when it formed, for example, and in what conditions.</p> <p>It will take Curiosity around three weeks or more to travel to Glenelg and, along the way, Nasa scientists will be watching everything the rover sees, in case they spot anything interesting on the journey. It could be a year before Curiosity gets to its main mission: Mount Sharp.</p> <p>\"There's two main things that make Mount Sharp interesting,\" Grindrod said. \"It's five kilometres of layered rock, which are probably sediments. We're not sure how they are laid down but, on Earth, those layers are very good at revealing the environment in which they formed.\"</p> <p>Another factor in choosing where to land Curiosity was the chemistry scientists saw from orbit. \"Near the bottom there is evidence that water was around at some point in some form. If you go to the top, it's dry,\" said Grindrod.</p> <p>While Nasa's current Mars lander has barely started its operations, the space agency is already planning its next. Insight will travel to Mars in 2016 to investigate how the interior of the planet is different to that of Earth \u2013 in particular, is it solid or liquid? </p> <p>A liquid core on Earth drives a dynamo that creates a magnetic field around our planet. Mars does not have a magnetic field at the moment but scientists think it might have had one in its very early history. </p> <p>As the core died out and stopped moving, said Grindrod, the planet would have lost its magnetic field and, consequently, its protection from the damaging solar wind. The atmosphere would have been stripped away, explaining why it is so thin at the moment.</p> <p>\"That happened at the same time as the volcanoes were erupting, that the water turned acidic,\" said Grindrod. \"All these things happened at the same time, making Mars go from a life-friendly environment to a more life-unfriendly environment, all at the same time.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK government should urgently analyse the impact of its new tax rules on developing countries, MPs on the House of Commons international development committee said on Thursday.</p> <p>Depending on the results of the analysis, the government should consider whether to drop its proposals from its finance bill, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news/tax-in-developing-countries-report/\" title=\"\">a committee report, Tax in Developing Countries</a>, said.</p> <p>In the 2012 finance bill, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/06/uk-tax-concessions-cost-developing-countries\" title=\"\">government proposed a relaxation of its anti-tax haven laws, or controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules</a>. Designed to discourage UK-owned corporations from using tax havens, the rules have applied to British-owned companies operating either in the UK or overseas.</p> <p>If a UK-owned company reports profits in a country with lower corporate taxes than the UK, the government is able to impose an extra tax charge on the company to \"make up the difference\". Consequently, as things stand, profits moved from developing countries into tax havens still incur tax at UK rates.</p> <p>Under the new rules, due to come into force in January, the UK will only impose this extra levy if the profits have been shifted from the UK. Profits moved from developing countries into tax havens will incur tax at the tax-haven rate, rather than the UK rate, so the incentive to shift profits will be significantly higher.</p> <p>NGOs strongly oppose changes to the CFC rules. ActionAid estimates poor countries <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/103143/the_problem_with_a_new_loophole.html\" title=\"\">may lose up to \u00a34bn in tax revenues</a>. The Treasury does not accept the estimate, but has acknowledged there would be a cost to developing countries. \"We do not know if this estimate is correct, but the government cannot legitimately refute the \u00a34bn figure unless it is prepared to conduct its own analysis,\" said Malcolm Bruce, chairman of the committee. \"That is what we are urging it to do.\"</p> <p>The committee urged the Department for International Development (DfID) to take into account the development impact of tax and fiscal policy. It also said there should be an administrative or legislative requirement for the government to assess new primary and secondary UK tax legislation against its likely impact on poverty reduction and revenue-raising in developing countries.</p> <p>The report highlights the importance of tax collection in developing countries, noting that tax revenues represent a significantly more predictable and sustainable source of revenue than aid. The committee looked at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/feb/29/uk-urged-support-zambia-tax-multinationals\" title=\"\">Zambia, which is heavily dependent on copper mining, as a case study</a>. To test allegations that companies are not making their audited accounts available to the public, the committee suggested that DfID should request access to the accounts of some of Zambia's main corporations.</p> <p>The committee praised DfID's work on taxation, citing a successful programme in Rwanda, where revenues collected increased sixfold over 10 years. It recommended that DfID increase its technical assistance work with the national revenue authorities of developing countries.</p> <p>The committee also said UK-owned multinationals should be required to report their accounts on a country-by-country rather than aggregate basis, which would enable irregularities to be more easily detected. Requiring tax authorities to exchange information automatically with their counterparts would also constitute a strong deterrent against cross-border tax evasion, the report said. The committee urged the government to enact unilateral legislation to achieve both objectives.</p> <p>NGOs strongly endorsed the committee's findings. \"It's fantastic to see there is a strong, cross-party consensus that collecting tax effectively is vital for poor countries to escape aid dependency and poverty,\" said Joseph Stead, senior economic justice adviser at Christian Aid. \"For the sake of the billions of people harmed by tax dodging, the prime minister must act on the committee's powerful recommendations. Next year's UK presidency of the G8 provides a global platform to demonstrate this leadership.\"</p> <p>Lucia Fry, head of policy at ActionAid, said: \"The international development committee has rightly recognised just how fundamental tax revenues are for developing countries. Tax avoidance is now a major global concern, and the UK needs to take into account the impact of its own tax regime on the world's poorest countries.\"</p> <p>The Treasury, however, said the CFC rules protected UK tax revenues and were never designed to protect other countries' tax revenues.</p> <p>\"Their reform will encourage investment and drive growth in the UK,\" it said in a statement. \"It is not sustainable for developing countries to protect their revenue using our tax rules, a much better way is to build their capacity and capability to collect the tax that they are due.\"</p> <p>The Treasury also questioned the feasibility of analysing the impact of the tax changes.</p> <p>\"Any assessment of the impact of CFC reform on developing countries would need to primarily focus on the nature of, and interaction of companies with, the tax regimes in developing countries. It would be an assessment not of our tax rules, but of the tax rules of other countries,\" said a Treasury spokesperson. \"Preparing an assessment of the impacts across a range of countries is inherently difficult and uncertain and the government does not think that such an assessment is feasible.\"</p>",
  "<p>In spite of its countless champions in government, social enterprise remains a sticky subject.</p> <p>I believe market-based income generation can be a crucial means for some organisations to support their work \u2013 namely when the business plan is closely linked with fulfilling the an organisation's mission.</p> <p>But there's an awful lot in the social enterprise world coming from the other end of the spectrum. I've called this \"Corporate Social Responsibility 2.0\" \u2013 or a veneer for profit-making businesses to portray themselves in a more positive light, without changing deeper unethical practices.</p> <p>It is \"enterprise\" with a sprinkling of \"social\" for PR purposes.</p> <p>That might sound too cynical. I don't want to imply that this is necessarily a malevolent effort, but that profit-making companies must do more than channel a small portion of their profits into a mostly removed charitable cause if they want to be taken seriously as a social venture.</p> <p>While many businesses turn profits through deeply unethical practices and then make sizable donations to charity, social enterprise should not be the \"carbon trading of social good\", by which I mean buying the right to keep doing something which is fundamentally wrong.</p> <p>This means thinking about how every part of what the organisation does, inside and outside its walls, aligns with the values it espouses. How is it making money? What impact do these activities have on the environment? On people involved in them, directly or indirectly?</p> <p>But there's a deeper question which is hardly limited to social enterprises, applying to so many of our more traditional charities and social change organisations. Do we believe our methods as much as we believe in what we do? I believe we should.</p> <p>Are our management structures, reporting processes, communication methods, individual behaviours and relationships with colleagues, reflective of the values we want to see more of in the world?</p> <p>In my experience with social enterprises, charities, NGOs, and campaigning organisations, this is often not the case. So many socially-focused institutions have taken industrial-era corporate organising blueprints and attempted to apply them to a range of social aims. But these systems were not designed to help create a better world, just a more profitable one.</p> <p>My friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBarasi\" title=\"\">Paul Barasi</a> often jokes about the number of social change organisations that use words such as engagement, participation, or involvement in their Twitter bios, yet who only follow newspapers' and politicians' accounts, and who don't communicate with people who tweet them. This makes for a relatively superficial, but also quite stark, disconnect between purpose and practice.</p> <p>More fundamentally, countless organisations promote ideas about democracy and egalitarianism, yet hold most decisions as high up the organisational command chain as possible, not trusting those doing the work to understand how best to do it.</p> <p>Or the many organisations that aim to improve relationships \u2013 whether personal or institutional ones \u2013 yet are deeply adversarial workplaces, where honest and open dialogue is distorted by accountability systems and management practices that promote the opposite ways of working with colleagues.</p> <p>Such contradictions have given rise to the first ever <a href=\"http://www.concretesolutions.org.uk/?p=1317\" title=\"\">More Like People Action Week</a>, a spur-of-the-moment initiative, happening right now, to remind us how people how don't wear organisational hats, nevertheless manage to organise. As Paul tweeted me on Sunday when he suggested the idea: \"It's about one small action you can take this week to make your workplace a bit more human.\"</p> <p>This is similar to what happens in communities when people come together for a common aim and figure out what to do about it at the pub, or around someone's kitchen table. It is also what happens online when we randomly connect with others concerned with the same social problem, and multiply our individual voices in the process.</p> <p>It also has similarities with the autonomy of joining an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/occupy-movement\" title=\"\">Occupy camp</a>, or a <a href=\"http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Uncut</a> action, knowing that what you do is up to you, and that you can find your own path to making a difference, as part of a bigger movement.</p> <p>What each of these examples have in common is that we come to them as ourselves, not as a professional or whatever our job title calls us, and we do things in the ways we want to do them, not through established formal systems that control us, and limit our abilities.</p> <p>And there's no reason these notions can't be a part of our working lives.</p> <p>Organisational culture isn't dictated from above, like so many policies; it is the cumulative result of how each of us who are a part of it chooses to engage with our work and with each other.</p> <p>If we don't feel our organisational culture is living the values we'd like it to, what can we do to improve it? We each have the opportunity to help make it a bit better, which is what this week is all about.</p> <p>What can you do differently this week to help your social change organisation to be more human? It might be about how you relate to a difficult colleague. Can you focus on hearing them, rather than proving them wrong? It might be about how you hold a meeting. Could you let conversation flow, and drop the formal agenda?. Alternatively it might be about how you make decisions. Can you involve more colleagues' opinions? Or put it out as a question on your social media channels?</p> <p>But it's up to you.

  "<p>An Australian government minister has declared the end of the resources boom that had cushioned the country against the global financial crisis, a day after the world's biggest miner, BHP Billiton, shelved two major expansion plans worth at least $40bn (\u00a326bn).</p> <p>\"The resources boom is over,\" resources and energy minister Martin Ferguson told Australian radio on Thursday. \"We've done well \u2013 $270bn (\u00a3178bn) in investment, the envy of the world. It has got tougher in the last six to 12 months.\" </p> <p>Ferguson's comments came after BHP announced it was indefinitely delaying the planned $20bn (\u00a313bn) Olympic Dam copper expansion in South Australia and plans to build a new harbour, estimated at more than $20bn, to nearly double its iron ore exports in Western Australia, looking for cheaper alternatives. </p> <p>But Ferguson's Labor party colleague Senator Penny Wong, the finance minister, disagreed with his assessment. \"We still have a lot of investment coming in to this country, about half a trillion dollars in the pipeline and more than half of that at the advanced stage,\" she told ABC News Breakfast.</p> <p>\"I think the mining boom still has a long way to run. But what I would say is that the government has always assumed that the terms of trade would step down over time, that's what our budget is predicated on.</p> <p>\"I think Mr Ferguson was referring to when the terms of trade peaked, and that's factored into the Government's budget.\"</p> <p>Ferguson later released a statement rowing back from what he had initially said. \"The commodity price boom is over but in terms of investment in Australia the boom continues,\" he said.</p> <p>Fuelled by Chinese-led demand for coal, iron ore and other resources, Australia's economy was one of the very few in the developed world to sail through the global financial crisis without sliding into recession. </p> <p>The resources boom fuelled what has been dubbed a two-speed economy, which has pumped up the Australian dollar and exacerbated the pain felt in manufacturing sectors and retail in Australia's most populous states. </p> <p>While manufacturers like Ford and Bluescope Steel have shut down plants and axed jobs, Australia's unemployment level has stayed around 5% thanks to substantial jobs growth in resources projects, where truck drivers command six-figure pay packets. </p> <p>Politicians may be worried the whole economy is moving into the slow lane but analysts say the fear is premature, as energy projects, underpinned by customers who have already been locked in, will continue full steam ahead. </p> <p>\"A marriage of our macroeconomic research with analysis of already committed and possible projects has confirmed our expectations that a peak is coming, but is yet to arrive,\" National Australia Bank economists said in a report. </p> <p>NAB expects the resources boom to peak in 2013 and 2014, when resource capital spending will be around 1% of gross domestic product higher than now. </p> <p>BHP put the Olympic Dam expansion on hold as it reported a 35% slide in second-half profit, the biggest sign of the pain inflicted by the slowdown in China's economic growth.</p> <p>Weaker demand from China has knocked prices of all key commodities, including iron ore, languishing at its lowest levels since December 2009, copper, coal and aluminium, clouding the outlook for all miners. </p> <p>In response to pressure from shareholders worried about poor returns in a weak global markets, miners have put the brakes on capital spending, with BHP on Wednesday announcing it would not sanction any major new projects in the year to June 2013. </p> <p>The Olympic Dam project, which had been due for approval by December 2012, would have created 25,000 jobs, according to the South Australian government. </p> <p>\"The next round was always going to be difficult and I must say Olympic Dam was always a very, very challenging project \u2013 its sheer size,\" Ferguson said. </p> <p>He said he still hoped the project could go ahead. \"Our requirement now is to continue to work together in partnership, South Australian and Australian governments, with BHP Billiton to actually get this project in place,\" he said.</p>"
