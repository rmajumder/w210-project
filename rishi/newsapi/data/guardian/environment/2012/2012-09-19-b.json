  "<p>Cohabiting couples are for the first time as likely to have children as those who marry, according to a report on changing family relationships in the UK published on Thursday.</p> <p>Cohabitation is increasingly seen as an alternative for long-term relationships and raising children, rather than as a \"trial run\" before marriage, the study commissioned by the Co-operative's new family law service suggests.</p> <p>A significant proportion of those who have not married, however, are unaware of their rights because the law has failed to keep up with social change, Christina Blacklaws, of the Co-operative Legal Services, warns.</p> <p>The evidence of shifting parenting patterns emerges in data extracted from the 2001 and 2011 censuses. It has been assembled by Dr Esm\u00e9e Hanna and Dr David Grainger, both of Leeds University, who specialise in family relationship changes over time.</p> <p>Their research reveals a 34% increase in the number of cohabiting couples with dependent children in the 10 years to 2011. Over that period, the total number of cohabiting families with dependent children \u2013 those aged under 18 \u2013 increased by 292,000, while the number of married couples with dependent children fell by 319,000.</p> <p>Last year, 38% of cohabiting couples were parents \u2013 the same percentage as married couples with children. Of live births in 2010, 31% were to women cohabiting with but not married to their partner \u2013 up from 25% in 2001. There are still more married couples with children than cohabiting couples with children in the UK.</p> <p>The rapid changes are reflected in a survey commissioned for the report showing that 52% believe marriage is not important providing that parents are in a committed relationship. Only 27%, according to the survey of more than 2,000 adults carried out by YouGov, take the more traditional view that couples should be married before having children.</p> <p>Despite increasing social acceptance, the report acknowledges that cohabiting couple families continue to be less stable than married couple families. A higher proportion of all family breakdowns involve young children from unmarried parents, the research reveals.</p> <p>There is also substantial confusion over the legal rights of cohabiting couples as compared to married couples. Of adults questioned, over a quarter, 26%, believe cohabiting couples have the same rights as married couples when it comes to child custody, 22% when it comes to property and 21% when it comes to finances.</p> <p>Hanna and Grainger commented: \"Part of the decline in marriage in recent years can perhaps be explained by the increase in cohabitation as a family format, with ever more couples choosing to live together. And as the number of cohabiting couples increases, they are increasingly seen as a socially legitimate family environment for childbearing.\"</p> <p>Blacklaws, who is director of family law at the Co-operative Legal Services, said: \"Although many people still believe they have rights as common-law spouses, there is no such status in law. As a result, some cohabiting families may find themselves facing real difficulties should they split up, particularly when there are children involved.</p> <p>\"It is clear that this area of family law is in urgent need of an overhaul. However, in the meantime, people need to think carefully about how they protect themselves and their families \u2013 preferably by reaching and signing agreements about what would happen if you did split up. This could save a huge amount of cost and heartache if the worst happens.\"</p>",
  "<p>British MPs are calling on Shell and others to halt \"reckless\" oil and gas drilling in the Arctic until stronger safety measures are put in place.</p> <p>Politicians also want to impose \"unlimited\" financial liability on operators and the creation of a \"no-drill zone\" in a new environmental sanctuary.</p> <p>The uncompromising demands have angered the energy industry but come just days after alarming new evidence has emerged about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">Arctic sea ice melting at record levels</a>. They also come on the day that an environment committee of MEPs in Brussels called for tougher financial guarantees from oil companies to ensure they could pay for spills in European waters.</p> <p>The British initiatives are contained in<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news/announcement-of-report-publication1/\"> a report published on Thursday from the cross-party environmental audit committee (EAC)</a> of the House of Commons, which warns that the vulnerable Arctic region is being endangered by a misguided search for hydrocarbons.</p> <p>\"The shocking speed at which the Arctic sea ice is melting should be a wake-up call to the world that we need to phase out fossil fuels fast,\" said the committee chair, Joan Walley MP. \"Instead we are witnessing a reckless gold rush in this pristine wilderness as big companies and governments make a grab for the world's last untapped oil and gas reserves.\"</p> <p>She <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9753000/9753217.stm\">told Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday</a>: \"I think the particular problem is that when you are talking about offshore drilling and you are talking about drilling in such harsh circumstances as the Arctic, we have to have proven techniques in place first of all, and we're not convinced that that is currently the case. It is for that reason that we want to see all drilling halted until we've got the highest available environmental standards in place.\"</p> <p>The EAC said it had heard \"compelling evidence\" from experts during several months of hearings that if a blowout occurred just before the dark Arctic winter returned it would not be possible to cap any oil spill until the following summer.</p> <p>Shell is currently in the middle of an exploration attempt in the Chukchi Sea, Alaska, but has had to call off immediate drilling due to dangers from ice and a faulty safety dome, which would be used for capping wells in the event of a blowout. The Anglo-Dutch group has already been heavily criticised for allegedly failing to properly test a new dome.</p> <p>ExxonMobil, Gazprom and others are either already working or preparing to operate in the Arctic region off Russia, Greenland or Alaska.</p> <p>The first report by MPs into the new rush for resources, entitled \"Protecting the Arctic\", says there should be a drilling moratorium until \"the highest available\" environmental standards can be imposed right across the far north.</p> <p>The committee believes that a \"preferably unlimited\" financial liability regime should be imposed for all oil and gas operations in the area. And it says the petroleum industry should set up a special group to peer-review and publicly report on all safety-related operating practices.</p> <p>The British government has no legal rights to limit drilling around the waters of the far north but is an observer on the Arctic Council. However the committee believes that the UK should be pushing for a special zone to be created that would be off limits for all drilling \u2013 as in Antarctica: \"We see the development of such a sanctuary as a prerequisite for further development of the Arctic's natural resources.\"</p> <p>But the committee also expresses deeper concerns about the British government's support for UK companies drilling worldwide at a time when it is trying to reduce carbon emissions at home.</p> <p>The energy industry argues that new oil reserves must be found to meet growing demands worldwide and says it can operate safely, having learned lessons from BP's catastrophic accident with the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.</p> <p>\"Our record throughout 50 years' experience of operating in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions demonstrates that we have the technical expertise to explore for and produce oil and gas safely and responsibly,\" said a Shell spokesman.</p> <p>Cairn Energy, which has been at the forefront of drilling off Greenland, said British MPs should not interfere. \"Cairn believes that governments and their people have the right to explore for natural resources in their sovereign territory, with the potential to strengthen both their energy security and economy,\" it added.</p> <p>But the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, another member of the EAC who has campaigned hard on the issue for many years, believes otherwise.</p> <p>She said: \"The UK government now has a responsibility to respond to this EAC report and show vital leadership on the issue by doing all it can to urgently secure a moratorium on Arctic drilling \u2013 starting with companies registered in this country.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney is running the worst presidential campaign since George McGovern \u2013 and that's going back a bit. Not a week goes by without the Republican candidate putting his foot in it. This week he refused to apologise for describing, to a closed audience of fundraisers, 47% of the American population as government-dependent victims. That was not all. In the same speech he wrote off the two-state solution in the Middle East, a policy to which every US government has been committed for three decades. Not bad for one night's work.</p> <p>Last week's gaffe was his attempt to score a cheap news cycle hit by attacking a statement issued by the US embassy in Cairo, just before it became known that the ambassador in Libya had been killed. An attack on a US ambassador is an attack on all Americans, not a concept with which Mr Romney is familiar. He is, by his own account, only interested in the ones who are going to vote for him. Before Libya, there was Clint Eastwood's strange monologue with an empty chair.</p> <p>With seven more weeks, and seven potential major gaffe opportunities, to go, the real question is not why Mr Romney is such a bad candidate (unzipped he is far worse than the man who, in his wife's <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/ann-romney-unzip-him-let-real-mitt-romney-170357495.html\" title=\"\">unfortunate analogy,</a> is zipped up) but why the polling in the battleground states is still so close. This may be about to change.</p> <p>In Virginia, one of the states Barack Obama has to win to retain the presidency, he has an eight-point lead, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/post-poll-obama-up-8-points-over-romney-in-virginia/2012/09/18/ca691d9a-0193-11e2-9367-4e1bafb958db_story.html\" title=\"\">according to one poll.</a> But the state has a big defence industry and the president receives more positive ratings on his ability to create jobs there than nationally. In Wisconsin, Mr Obama has a six-point lead, despite a massive Republican advertising campaign. Elsewhere, in Colorado, Ohio, Florida and Nevada, Mr Obama is either neck and neck or <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map.html#battlegrounds\" title=\"\">within a few percentage points</a>. Why? Going out polling the opinion of registered Democratic voters in Ohio gives a salutary clue \u2013 half of them are either undecided or openly hostile. It is one reminder of an unwelcome and enduring truth: the deep polarisation of the electorate. If Mr Romney blows it, it will be his fault and his alone.</p> <p>There is still everything to play for \u2013 seven weeks of Republican television ads in which they are outspending the Democrats two to one; the first of three television debates on 3 October; another weak set of employment statistics for Mr Obama; any number of international events which could disrupt or embarrass his foreign policy pragmatism. This is not to say that Romney would not \u2013 on the evidence of his policy statements and his gaffe-strewn foreign trip \u2013 make a disastrous president. The immediate effect of his election would be to let Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu off whatever fraying leash still ties Washington and Israel. It may still not be long before Iran is attacked and another war in the Middle East breaks out, but under a Romney presidency we know that all brakes on that front would be off. But little of that plays out with an audience which traditionally sees American foreign policy as the victim of global instability, not one of its instigators.</p> <p>For Mr Obama, Mr Romney's unguarded comments represent a gift. For he now has the chance to present himself as the president of all America, but particularly the very America \u2013 the 47% (actually the figure is 46.4% of households not paying federal income tax) \u2013 which has done so badly under the banking crisis.</p> <p>The difficulty that Mr Romney has keeping himself on message only highlights the discipline of Mr Obama's campaign. This is at last showing through in the polling. Mr Obama is getting his message across, whereas no one quite knows what Mr Romney's message is. On tax, is it to reduce the tax burden on low-income families, a long-standing goal, or to dismiss the retired, the elderly, and low-income families with children as scroungers dependent on state aid? Mr Romney loses himself in the complexity of each issue he stumbles into. An unlucky president, Mr Obama is proving once again to be a lucky candidate.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 The Conservative drift to the right won't mean that much, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/18/tory-party-drifted-right-ken-clarke\" title=\"\">Ken Clarke said on Tuesday</a>. But most think it will, and nowhere more than in the matter of immigration. Out goes Damian Green \u2013 tough, but not tough enough. In comes an even tougher cookie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/06/mark-harper-faces-tricky-week\" title=\"\">Mark Harper</a>. He's no-nonsense. But he's not stupid. So when he arrived at his new post and came across the case of Crescent Tours, he was smart enough to deal with their immigration problem commendably quickly. Crescent's hopes of sponsoring overseas employees were dashed by the UK Border Agency. And there it might have rested, were it not for representations on the firm's behalf from the local MP Theresa May, aka the home secretary. Within five days of taking office, Harper wrote back apologising for the delay, blaming the firm for completing the relevant forms incorrectly but nevertheless offering them guidance for a future application and reimbursement of the \u00a3500 application fee. \"I apologise again for the delay in replying,\" scribbled Harper at the bottom of the letter to his colleague and superior, adding the name of an official who will sort out any future problems. Will all immigration matters get this sort of attention? You bet!</p> <p>\u2022 So a solid start for the new director general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/george-entwistle\" title=\"\">George Entwistle</a>, and what a swell party at Broadcasting House for Mark Thompson, the DG just gone. Big names and big egos, fuelled by wine and canapes. The slickly made tribute film, featured Sir Terry Wogan who bemoaned the fact that Thompson had by his example encouraged other BBC execs to grow beards and \"look scruffy\": Cut straight to the bearded, perennially casual Alan Yentob whose words could not be heard above guffaws from mocking contemporaries. Poor Botney, most undeserved.</p> <p>\u2022 BBC execs earn less than they did, but for years they justified huge salaries by pointing to their true value in the commercial world. A fine example was deputy director general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2011/may/30/bbc-director-general-mark-byford\" title=\"\">Mark Byford</a> who left the corporation over a year ago with a reputed pay-off close to \u00a31m and a pension pot not far short of \u00a34m. He too was at Thommo's farewell with that distinctive bird's nest hairdo. Plainly wealth does not automatically yield a better barber. And after 16 months, has the commercial world lifted him into that private-sector post befitting of his former status? Er, not yet.</p> <p>\u2022 One absentee at the great goodbye was Kevin Marsh who led the corporation into mine-filled territory with the now famous Andrew Gilligan 2003 broadcast on the Blair government's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/09/Iraqandthemedia.bbc\" title=\"\">sexing up\" of the September 2002 dossier on Iraq and WMD</a>. The infamous row with Alastair Campbell followed, Hutton reported, the BBC was decapitated. Marsh now has his book Stumbling Over Truth to promote and as the BH party swung, he was doing just that. His book may make uncomfortable reading for both Campbell and Gilligan, and one wonders whether either will show up to ask the odd question when the publicity bandwagon stops at Westminster University on Monday? It could all could kick off quite quickly. In less than 45 minutes, apparently.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally gloves off between the troublesome Ukipian Godfrey Bloom, MEP for Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, and the Trades Union Congress. He's hopping mad. The TUC is immovable. At issue, one man's reputation. During a radio debate, the TUC equality officer <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/about_sveale.cfm\" title=\"\">Sarah Veale</a> cast Godfrey as the man who said women should not work but should stay at home and clean behind the fridge. That's a lie, said Godfrey. Withdraw it. I won't, you said it on Women's Hour, said Veale. Hard to know who's right because we didn't hear the discussion. But from what we do know, the situation is this. Godders has never quite said women should not go out to work. What he has said, with varying degrees of seriousness, is that \"no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of childbearing age.\" That women don't \"clean behind the fridge enough\". And that he was sent to Brussels \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/3912385.stm\" title=\"\">to represent Yorkshire women who always have dinner on the table</a>\". The notion of Godfrey Bloom as even a teeny bit sexist is really pretty outrageous, isn't it?</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Celtic Park can be among the most febrile stadiums in the world but this turned out to be a night for cool heads. Buccaneering attacks were largely absent against a Benfica lineup meriting full respect. Instead, Neil Lennon's side showed daring only towards the close of this goalless draw. There may have been no victory but neither was there disillusionment.</p> <p>It would have been rash for the Celtic players to wallow in the atmosphere, no matter how much the crowd revelled, after a four-year hiatus, in the return of matches with this sort of status. Some of Lennon's squad could be regarded as trainees where events of this sort are concerned. The danger also lay in the risk that Benfica might puncture all the swelling excitement.</p> <p>Rather than taking great strides, Celtic picked their way carefully through the early stages. Even so, this fixture carried such a sense of heritage that it would have been appropriate to broadcast the game in black and white. Benfica have by far the grander history in the European Cup but Celtic at least took that prize on one&#xa0;occasion.</p> <p>There is no scope for romance and Lennon's team strove to check their opponents. The defensive midfielder Victor Wanyama had the important task of checking the progress of Benfica's Pablo Aimar. The Celtic goalkeeper also had to do that in a more alarming incident when he had to pull off a save after Rodrigo broke through and shot in the 31st minute.</p> <p>The stadium may have been in need of a service given the time that has passed since a contest of this sort took place, and the fans did not create the irresistible atmosphere associated with this stadium. Celtic are no longer in an environment where expensive players can be lured. Supporters appreciate that and, before the interval, they were more watchful rather than impassioned.</p> <p>Benfica will be conscious of restrictions but Portugal's population of 10 million is almost double that of Scotland's. Lennon may have been happy enough to watch his men adapt to an occasion on this level. The aim then was for security, with everyone but the lone striker Miku prepared to drop back and create a barrier when needed. Even so, adventure from Celtic was expected at some moment or other.</p> <p>Whatever the tendency to take care in an opening fixture, the encounter did develop a little after the interval. Lennon's side appreciated that a win had to be pursued and Benfica would have wanted to exploit any increase in the space they were allowed. An opening almost did come their way early in the second half following a mistake by the Celtic defender Kelvin Wilson near his 18-yard line but he recovered to stop Rodrigo. Benfica's ambitions were on the rise, as they introduced the dangerous Oscar Cardozo to the&#xa0;attack.</p> <p>Lennon sent on a forward in Gary Hooper to replace the left-back Emilio Izaguirre. It seemed as if Celtic had banked on this late ploy as the best means of snatching a late win. The challenge was great, though, against a purposeful Benfica.</p>",
  "<p>\"No one can read everything. We rely on filters to make sense of the scholarly literature, but the narrow, traditional filters are being swamped. However, the growth of new, online scholarly tools allows us to make new filters; these altmetrics reflect the broad, rapid impact of scholarship in this burgeoning ecosystem. We call for more tools and research based on altmetrics.\"</p> <p>This quote is taken from the introduction to the <a href=\"http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/\" title=\"\">altmetrics manifesto</a>. And the reason it's a manifesto, rather than a mission or vision statement, is arguably because changing the way scholarly impact is measured is going to need something of a revolution \u2013 and no revolution is complete without a manifesto.</p> <p>So why is a revolution needed? Because long before the tools even existed to do anything about it, many in the research community have bemoaned the stranglehold the impact factor of a research paper has held over research funding, careers and reputations. As bloggers Victor Manning and William Gunn wrote: \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/06/mendeley-altmetrics-open-access-publishing\" title=\"\">Influence is only one dimension of importance</a>\". Other bugbears include the slowness of peer review and the fact that impact is not linked to an article, but rather to a journal, as this <a href=\"http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2012/07/25/altmetrics-trying-to-fill-the-gap/\" title=\"\">blog from the Scholarly Kitchen</a> points out.</p> <p>Now though, the tools exists to consider what other factors may be used to determine importance, and they are being refined daily. Alternative metrics (or altmetrics as they are known) have brought together the tech geeks and the research nerds who are eager to define their own measures of excellence. Though many of the communities they form or join, such as Academia.edu, Mendeley or Total-Impact aren't new, wider changes in the research environment (namely, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/10/uk-open-access-research-debate-round-up\" title=\"\">growing support for open access</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/feb/21/ref2014-what-researchers-concentrating-on?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">policy shifts mandating impact measurement</a>) have given altmetrics a new urgency.</p> <p>But altmetrics are not universally popular. One <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18124111\" title=\"\">commenter on the site writes</a>: \"[Impact factors] can be (and are) manipulated to a certain degree ... but the alt, total, ultimate, mega etc. metrics are far worse because the link to research quality is less direct, and in terms of some of the indicators, like twitter activity, it is non-existent. Moreover, these metrics will be much easier to manipulate\".</p> <p>So what does the future of impact assessment hold? How will these new metrics develop and how are they likely to be adopted by the sector? Perhaps most importantly, will altmetrics address the abuses of impact factors or simply create abuses of their own, particularly when importance is determined through social media influence.</p> <p>Join our live chat, Friday, 21 September at 12 BST, to explore these questions and any others you may have.</p> <p><em>The discussion takes place in the comment threads beneath the blog.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

More than 57,000 people have signed a <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">petition on the government's website</a> to stop the cull.</p> <p>The warning came from the police came during consultations with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>Detective chief superintendent Adrian Tudway, national co-ordinator for domestic extremism at the Association of Chief Police Officers, told Defra officials: \"Farmers and landowners culling badgers with firearms (of any description) has potential to place armed farm workers in the near vicinity of protesters and activists, typically during the night-time; we regard this as a scenario with clear potential for harm to public safety \u2026 we believe there is a likelihood [of] incidents of lawful protest and lobbying as well as some potential for unlawful direct action, disorder and criminality.\" He also referred to reduced police resources owing to \"the impact of the recent funding cuts\".</p> <p>Peter Charleston, staff officer at Acpo to Chief Constable Richard Crompton, who has responsibility for wildlife crime, told his boss in an email the cull would risk widespread illegal killing of badgers under the cover of culling: \"Concerns relate to the possibility of open season being declared on badgers because of a perception that Defra is not really bothered about their protected status.\"</p> <p>Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, who obtained the <a href=\"http://www.marycreagh.co.uk/index.php?id=1141\">police warnings through a freedom of information application</a>, said: \"The cull could make the problem worse, it will cost farmers more than they save and the police have expressed their concerns emphatically. We are deeply concerned that the government are ignoring official advice on the practical difficulties of the cull.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england\" title=\"\">first licence for a large-scale cull</a> was issued on Monday, covering 300 square kilometres of Gloucestershire. The government and many farmers <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/a-z/bovine-tb/\" title=\"\">argue the cull is necessary</a> to curb tuberculosis in cattle, which led to the slaughter of 26,000 cows in 2011 alone. Opponents, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\">including many prominent scientists</a>, say the cull will not work and that vaccination and better biosecurity are the solution. \"We are horrified the government is ploughing on with plans to kill badgers despite the clear public feeling against it,\" said the RSPCA's chief executive, Gavin Grant.</p> <p>Phil Hudson, head of food and farming for the National Farmers Union, said: \"This is an incredibly emotional issue for both sides, and we would not be surprised if there are demonstrations \u2026 obviously there is the potential for protesters to try and sabotage this lawful trial. We hope this is not the case and we will continue to work with the authorities to keep all involved safe.\"</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said: \"Only highly trained individuals will be licensed to cull badgers, and every licence application will have to meet strong safety requirements. Farmers and Natural England will also discuss these issues comprehensively with the local police force ahead of any activity taking place.\"</p> <p>Last week Defra secured a high court injunction against a website run by anti-cull protesters ordering them to remove personal addresses of ministers and others. <a href=\"http://badger-killers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Badger-Killers.co.uk</a>, the web domain used to post the details, has been owned since 1999 by Debbie Vincent, a prominent animal rights activist who was convicted in 2004 of intimidating people involved with the animal testing laboratories at Huntingdon Life Sciences. She was one of three parties named in the injunction.</p> <p>Vincent told the Guardian that she \"hadn't updated a single sentence\" on the Badger-Killers.co.uk website for four to five years. Nominet, which maintains the register of .uk domain names, confirmed to the Guardian that Vincent is still the owner of the Badger-Killers.co.uk domain. The current administrator of the Badger-Killers.co.uk website, who gave his name as Jay, said Vincent was no longer involved with the site. Jay said Badger-Killers.co.uk was now focused on facilitating forthcoming anti-cull protests and was the online hub for the Coalition of Badger Action Groups.</p> <p>\"We've been totally overwhelmed by the response from people supporting us,\" said Jay. \"They're coming from all over \u2013 London, Manchester, Birmingham. The hunt saboteurs are a vital group, but we've got lots of anti-vivisectionists coming too. These groups don't tend to cross over much, but this time it's different. We've never had this massive influx of people before for anything. Senior citizens and teachers have even asked us how they can help stop the cull.\"</p> <p>Lee Moon, a <a href=\"http://hsa.enviroweb.org/\" title=\"\">Hunt Saboteurs Association</a> spokesman, said experienced campaigners were getting involved alongside people who didn't usually take part in direct action.</p>",

The two conclusions were that culling badgers could make no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain and that the rising incidence of disease can be reversed, and geographical spread contained, by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone. To reach this conclusion took 10 years, cost \u00a350m and was undertaken by six professors and a knight of the realm.</p> <p>A document on the Defra website shows that the recently departed secretary of state, Caroline Spelman, consulted a different set of nine professors (with the exception of Professor Christl Donnelly). This group met with Defra's chief scientific adviser in April 2011. The meeting's conclusion may be summarised thus: after nine years, five years of culling and 4.5 years post cull, there is a 95% probability that the decrease in new outbreaks would be around 16%.

  "<p>The US military caught London and other Nato allies by surprise when it rushed into halting on-the-ground operations with Afghan security forces, after four Americans and two British soldiers were killed by local policemen at the weekend.</p> <p>Military sources said the suspension of routine joint operations, with approval now required from a general for Nato and Afghan soldiers to serve together, had been under discussion for several weeks following a surge of \"insider attacks\". Fifty-one Nato soldiers have been killed by members of the Afghan security forces, some of them by Taliban infiltrators, in 36 attacks this year \u2013 15 of them last month alone.</p> <p>But the Pentagon called a halt out of concern at the effect on army morale, and damage to public and political opinion over attacks from within the same military that Nato is training.</p> <p>Allies were only informed after the order had been written, causing a scramble to downplay its significance by the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) command and limit the political fallout in London and other Nato capitals.</p> <p>Opinion is divided on what the final impact will be on military operations, given that the joint on-the-ground operations that saw Nato and Afghan troops patrolling and fighting alongside each other were central to the US-led strategy to train the 350,000-strong Afghan army to hold off the Taliban after the American pullout in 2014.</p> <p>\"There's certainly been a fraying of the trust. There's no doubt about that,\" said lieutenant general David Barno, the commander of coalition military operations in Afghanistan for two years from 2003, and now retired from the army.</p> <p>\"One of the fundamental questions is: is this a temporary injunction to provide Nato and Isaf time to come up with some new measures that ensures the safety of their troops that are out on an advisory roles, partnering roles? Or is this going to be a longer-term restriction that prevents Nato troops serving in these very important roles? I think the jury's out on that.\"</p> <p>Barno said the suspension of joint operations is a message from the US that the insider attacks are \"a very serious problem\" and \"this is probably an appropriate response to it at this juncture\".</p> <p>Stephanie Sanok, a Pentagon official in the Bush administration with experience of Afghanistan and Iraq, who is now with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said insider attacks are \"a real problem and challenge facing the coalition\" and that stopping joint operations while Nato \"figures out exactly who they're sharing bases with is long overdue\".</p> <p>But she said it is a blow to the strategy to build a capable Afghan army to confront the Taliban.</p> <p>\"From an operational perspective it does hinder the coalition's ability to hand over responsibility to capable partners. It hinders in terms of confidence levels in the Afghan national security forces, because they're not going to be partnering with them as much. When you partner less, obviously their capabilities are going to be less,\" she said.</p> <p>Lieutenant colonel Daniel Davis \u2013 who caused a political stir in Washington in February<a href=\"http://armedforcesjournal.com/2012/02/8904030\"> by accusing the Pentagon of \"lying\" about the situation in Afghanistan</a> because his experience during a year-long deployment \"bore no resemblance to rosy official statements by US military leaders about conditions on the ground\" \u2013 said that calling off of joint operations will be damaging because it will reinforce a perception among Afghans that the US is rushing to leave.</p> <p>Davis said \"insider attacks\" have eroded trust among Nato troops of their Afghan colleagues. But, he added, confidence between the two militaries has been on the wane for some time because of overly optimistic claims by the US about the state of the war with the Taliban and Barack Obama's setting of a 2014 date for an end to American combat operations.</p> <p>\"In my personal opinion, we (Isaf) have been responsible for a portion of the destruction of trust between the Afghan forces and Isaf troopers because so often our leaders say things like \"everything's on track\", \"we're on the right azimuth.\"</p> <p>\"But when those messages are heard by the Afghan government, the Afghan security forces, and even the Taliban, they see with their own eyes that nothing could be further from the truth. When they hear us saying these things and actually appear to believe them, they either don't trust us or they don't put any value in our ability to assess,\" Davis said.</p> <p>\"When you're using the language of success to describe abject failure, you have no credibility in the eyes of those on the ground who know the truth.\"</p> <p>Davis said the pullback from joint operations will be taken by many Afghan soldiers as further evidence that the US will abandon them.</p> <p>\"Now a lot of them are getting scared because as we're getting closer to the date in 2014 when we're completely gone, they know they're going to be on their own, unable to operate without us. Despite the constant claims that we're not abandoning Afghanistan again, they see that we are in fact leaving many of them to their own fate,\" he said. \"I fear that as time continues to pass between now and 2014 the level of trust may degrade further. I can see where they might think: not only are you going to abandon us in 2014, you're starting to cut the cords now.\"</p> <p>Sanok agreed with Davis that setting a deadline for withdrawal has caused the Afghan soldiers to question US commitment.</p> <p>\"I understand why people like to set deadlines and have aspirations. But it really is the conditions on the ground and they really are so changeable in Afghanistan,\" she said. \"I think the vast majority of them will roll their eyes and say this [the halt to joint operations] is just another example of them abandoning us, and why should we care?\"</p> <p>Sanok said some in the US military command view the suspension of joint operations as an opportunity.</p> <p>\"The Afghan national security forces are going to have to take over responsibility anyway. Part of the US military establishment is saying: now or 2015, it doesn't matter. The Afghan national security forces are either going to sink or swim. They're just going to have to swim sooner rather than later,\" she said.</p> <p>Sanok does not agree with that view, and said she regards continued partnering as essential to getting the Afghan army into shape. But she is sceptical that Afghan soldiers are motivated to fight the Taliban.</p> <p>\"It's not just capability, it's willingness. We can give them as much training and equipment and advice as possible. But if they're not willing to shoulder that burden, it won't work,\" she said.</p> <p>That, said Davis, is the fundamental flaw in the US approach.</p> <p>\"I conducted several patrols with both US and Afghan troops. They [the Afghan soldiers] weren't actually interested in learning anything. They only did what they were made to do. The rest of the time, they're lying in the shade somewhere, resting. In the environment where our word means little to them, they don't seem interested in learning anything,\" he said.</p> <p>Barno is not so pessimistic about the Afghan army, but he said that the \"insider attacks\" are a warning as to the determination of the enemy it faces. </p> <p>\"One of the things it clearly says to me is: this is a resilient and adaptable enemy who is still very dangerous and very capable. The Taliban is going to find seams and fissures and fractures inside of the coalition's capabilities to exploit such as insider attacks, which have immense political repercussions back in Nato countries,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They will exploit that, and they will leverage that to the maximum extent. So this is a very crafty, very wily enemy and he is not at all on ropes or crushed at this point in time. He's simply adapting to the situation he finds himself in.\"</p>",

  "<p>The conundrum that underlies England's controversial badger cull is that the scientific bedrock of the case both for and against it is the same landmark 10-year trial that began in 1998, the <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/isg/report/final_report.pdf\" title=\"\">Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT)</a>. The opposite conclusions reached by supporters and opponents of the cull come down to a serious difference of interpretation.</p> <p>The scientists who commissioned and ran the trial are, almost without exception, opposed to the cull. Lord Krebs this week called the cull \"a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19623931\" title=\"\">crazy scheme</a>\". The <a href=\"http://www.bovinetb.info/docs/The%20Duration%20of%20the%20Effects%20of%20Repeated%20Widespread%20Badger%20Culling.pdf\" title=\"\">trial's leaders concluded in 2010</a>: \"Our findings show the reductions in cattle TB incidence achieved by repeated badger culling were not sustained in the long term after culling ended and did not offset the financial costs of culling. These results, combined with evaluation of alternative culling methods, suggest that badger culling is unlikely to contribute effectively to the control of cattle TB in Britain.\"</p> <p>But on 4 April the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) convened a meeting of 11 top scientists. The <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\" title=\"\">two-page document</a> produced was then used by ministers to justify labelling the cull \"science-led\".</p> <p>The meeting was led by Defra chief vet Nigel Gibbens and chief scientist Bob Watson and, with significant caveats, concluded culling might result in a drop in cattle TB infections somewhere between 3% and 24% in that area, with a central estimate of 12%-16%. The government says this is a big enough benefit to justify the cull, despite it costing farmers more than doing nothing.</p> <p>Opponents highlight those caveats. First, the 10-year trial used cage-trapping and shooting to kill the badgers, but the new culls will employ the cheaper method of free shooting. \"The more a future culling policy deviates from the conditions of the RBCT, the more likely it is that the effects of that policy will differ,\" Defra's panel noted.</p> <p>Second, the scientists noted the risks of not conducting hard, long culls over large areas: 70% of all badgers in at least a 150 sq km area for four successive years. The RBCT had identified a \"perturbation effect\", where badgers fleeing from cull areas increased infections in surrounding areas. \"If culling is not conducted \u2026 according to the minimum criteria, then this could result in a smaller benefit or even a detrimental effect on cattle bTB incidence,\" the panel said. Opponents argue the risks of disruption by protests and lack of co-ordination by large groups of farmers and landowners are high. When asked whether the differences between the RBCT and the government's cull justified calling the latter \"science-led\", Watson told the Guardian the cull was backed by scientific judgement.</p> <p>All sides agree that better biosecurity \u2013 preventing cattle-to-cattle infections \u2013 is crucial and that vaccination would be a better option. But the existing injectable vaccine for badgers is more expensive to administer. An oral badger vaccine, delivered in laced food bait, is stuck in development. Cattle cannot currently be vaccinated as this would mean they could not be distinguished by existing tests from animals with the disease.</p>",

According to Nsidc, the warming of Arctic areas is now increasing at around 10% a decade.</p> <p>Along with the extent of the sea ice, its thickness, or volume, has also significantly decreased in the last two decades. While this is harder to measure accurately, it is believed to have decreased around 40% since 1979.</p> <p>The collapse of the ice cap was last night interpreted by environment groups as a signal of long-term climate warming caused by man.</p> <p>\"I hope that future generations will mark this day as a turning point, when a new spirit of global cooperation emerged to tackle the huge challenges we face. We must work together to protect the Arctic from the effects of climate change and unchecked corporate greed. This is now the defining environmental battle of our era,\" said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International.</p> <p>Other groups called on the UK government, and industries across the world to heed the warning signs from the Arctic and act \"with urgency and ambition\" to tackle climate change.</p> <p>Rod Downie, polar expert at WWF-UK said: \"With the speed of change we are now witnessing in the Arctic, the UK government must show national and global leadership in the urgent transition away from fossil fuels to a low carbon economy.</p> <p>\"This is further evidence that Shell's pursuit of hydrocarbons in the Arctic is reckless. It is completely irresponsible to drill for oil in such a fragile environment; there are simply too many unmanageable risks.\"</p> <p>Author and environmental campaigner Bill McKibben said: \"Our response [so far] has not been alarm, or panic, or a sense of emergency.

  "<p>When the supermarket chain Waitrose challenged shoppers to \"finish the sentence: 'I shop at Waitrose because \u2026' <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/?q=%23WaitroseReasons&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">#WaitroseReasons</a>\" on Monday, it could not have envisaged the subsequent Twitter storm as internet jokers piled in to ridicule the brand for its posh image.</p> <p>Instead of saying they preferred the supermarket to rivals for, perhaps, its wide range of organic produce, internet wags posted gags sending it up as a retail temple for the well-heeled. Two of the spoof Twitter recommendations were that the upmarket shop was the best place to pick up unicorn food and 24ct gold thread toilet paper. One posted: \"I shop at Waitrose because it makes me feel important and I absolutely detest being surrounded by poor people,\" and commented: \"I also shop at Waitrose because I was once in the Holloway Road branch and heard a dad say 'Put the papaya down, Orlando!'\"</p> <p>Many of the quips ridiculed the high prices at Waitrose, with one saying: \"I shop at Waitrose because I think food must automatically be better if it costs three times as much.\"</p> <p>Three years ago the chain, which is based in Bracknell, Berkshire, sealed its envied royal connections when it threw a financial lifeline to the Prince of Wales's struggling Duchy Originals food company in a multimillion pound investment deal.</p> <p>However, there was faint praise for the chain, which is part of the John Lewis partnership, and the only supermarket to trust its customers to \"self-scan\" their shopping. With an eye on the quality of its grammar, one remarked: \"I shop at Waitrose because \u2026\" you say \"Ten items or fewer\" not \"Ten items or less\", which is important\", while genuine comments included: \"Because wine is arranged on the shelves by region rather than colour.\"</p> <p>Even Waitrose's \"green token\" scheme, which benefits local charities, was lampooned, with one wag commenting: \"I shop at Waitrose because when the economy finally breaks down and dies, those little green tokens will serve as currency.\"</p> <p>There was further debate on Twitter as to whether the social media initiative had backfired spectacularly or been hugely successful because of all the attention it attracted. One observer said: \"People are saying Waitrose don't quite get Twitter because of #WaitroseReasons hashtag. I think they do. No such thing as bad publicity.\"</p> <p>In a rather po-faced statement, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waitrose/status/247812602800009217\" title=\"\">Waitrose tweeted</a>: \"Thanks for all the genuine and funny #WaitroseReasons tweets.

  "<p>The news cycle in modern American politics is not so much supercharged, as nuclear-powered. So it is no surprise that less than 36 hours after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-gaffe-by-gaffe\">secretly-taped videos of Mitt Romney exploded</a> into the political race, they have already become the subject of political attack ads.</p> <h2>Obama's attack</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uaKIeR4Sn3k?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uaKIeR4Sn3k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Like Usain Bolt sprinting after a gold medal, pro-Obama Super Pac Priorities USA Action has darted out of the gate to get its latest ad on the air in the vital battleground states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. And Romney's comments at the private Florida fundraiser \u2013 in which he called 47% of Americans \"victims\" of government dependency who pay no income tax \u2013 are front and centre.</p> <p>The Romney campaign often complains that it is a victim of class warfare. It is an inappropriate and over-reaching defence. But this ad certainly does not shy away from its attempt to paint Romney as an uncaring, wealthy elitist \u2013 a task in which it is greatly helped by Romney's own words.</p> <p>Called \"Doors\", the ad begins with a picture of the huge mansion in which Romney was video-taped. \"Behind these doors Mitt Romney calls half the American people 'dependent upon government, who believe they are victims',\" the narrator says, splicing in footage of Romney's quote.</p> <p>\"Victims?\" the narrator says, incredulously, as the ad goes on to shows a normal-looking middle-class house and shots of ordinary \u2013 and perhaps significantly \u2013 white Americans looking worried and nervous as they raise families and work jobs. Then it claims that Romney wants to give tax cuts to the wealthy. \"Mitt Romney will never convince us he's on our side,\" the ad concludes.</p> <p>It is hard-hitting stuff. But this sort of theme is now bread-and-butter for the Obama campaign. On issue after issue, they have sought to portray Romney as out-of-touch, uncaring and concerned only with the interests of people as wealthy as him. From refusing to release his taxes, to his record at Bain, to spoken gaffes about corporations being people, the Democrats and their allies have been ever more relentless.</p> <p>Of course, no one has helped them more than Romney himself, and no mistake has been bigger than this video. It gives the wholehearted impression of a man who will say one thing in public, but in private \u2013 to a group of wealthy donors in a mansion \u2013 will spout the sort of ultra-conservatism that is beloved of rightwing billionaires but that would be suicide at the ballot box.</p> <h2>Romney's counter</h2> <p>And what is the Romney camp's response to all this? They have launched two ads on the air defending the coal industry. Called \"Way of Life\" and \"War on Coal\", the ads are both similar in tone and style. They feature groups of miners \u2013 again, perhaps significantly, they are all white \u2013 who speak about government attacks on their industry, their worries over the job prospects of their children and grandchildren, and their support for Romney. Their mood is sombre and full of foreboding.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1moHzb-r1DI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1moHzb-r1DI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The campaign has not revealed where these ads are airing but it seems likely they are destined for states like Ohio or Virginia where Romney is looking to maximise his white working-class turnout and which border coal-producing areas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rTFTjJS4GtE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rTFTjJS4GtE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The ads are a reminder of something that is increasingly overlooked in the current election race: Obama is vulnerable. The president's polling numbers are far from healthy, he motivates the Republican base to rally against him, the economic recovery he promised has not materialised and swathes of his own base are disillusioned. Against such a backdrop it is easy to imagine the right sort of Republican challenger having a good shot at winning 2012 and fulfilling the GOP's cherished dream of cutting Obama down to a one-term president.</p> <p>But when you watch that first ad from Priorities USA Action \u2013 let alone turn on the news and see yet another clip of Romney's secret speech \u2013 you realise that Mitt Romney just is not that candidate.</p>",
  "<p>The safety failures of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club when it hosted the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 at its Hillsborough ground have been chillingly clear since Lord Justice Taylor itemised them in his official report four months after the disaster. Last week, 23 years on, the Hillsborough Independent Panel supported Taylor's conclusions.</p> <p>Professor Phil Scraton, of Queens University Belfast, who wrote most of the report which was unanimously approved by all panel members, presented its findings at Liverpool's Anglican cathedral last week to the families of the 96 people who died. He told them that after previous crushes at Hillsborough throughout the 1980s \"the risks were known and the fatal crush in 1989 was foreseeable\".</p> <p>Now fresh questions are starting to emerge about what the club knew about the safety risks at its ground \u2013 and when.</p> <p>Charles Falconer QC, representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG), has called on the director of public prosecutions to investigate charging Sheffield Wednesday, as well as South Yorkshire police, Sheffield city council and the Football Association, with corporate manslaughter.</p> <p>\"Because the risks were known but the club and FA went ahead anyway with hosting the semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, we want the DPP to examine whether their conduct amounts to gross negligence which could be the basis for a manslaughter charge,\" he said.</p> <p>Sheffield Wednesday applied to host the semi-final, which 54,000 people attended, and semi-finals in 1981, 1987 and 1988, despite the club's safety certificate for Hillsborough not having been updated since 1979.</p> <p>There was a serious crush in 1981 on the Leppings Lane terrace in which 38 people were injured. The police moved supporters out, they told the club's then chairman, Bert McGee, to avoid \"a real chance of fatalities\". Shockingly, the panel found in the minutes of a post-match meeting, McGee replied: \"Bollocks \u2013 no one would have been killed.\"</p> <p>Scraton then described how changes to the ground, principally building metal fences running up the Leppings Lane terrace to divide it into separate pens, made \"a demonstrably unsafe terrace dangerous.\"</p> <p>There were crushes and problems with the old, inadequate turnstiles in 1987 and 1988, after which one supporter wrote to the FA saying the Leppings Lane terrace \"will always be a death trap\".</p> <p>Nevertheless, the FA invited Sheffield Wednesday to host the semi-final in 1989, without asking any questions about ground safety, and the club eagerly applied to do so.</p> <h2><strong>Safety breaches</strong></h2> <p>Taylor listed all the club's safety deficiencies and breaches of the Home Office Guide to Safety in Sports Grounds \u2013 known as the Green Guide \u2013 many of which were in the Leppings Lane terrace, which he described as \"unsatisfactory and ill-suited to admit the numbers invited\".</p> <p>Several safety breaches were directly related to the unfolding horror. The seven turnstiles in the Leppings Lane terrace were too few to admit so many supporters \u2013 10,100 from Liverpool \u2013 and there was no way of counting how many were in each of the central pens, which became lethally overcrowded.</p> <p>Hillsborough's overall safe capacity had never been reassessed since 1979; the tunnel that led to the Leppings Lane pens had a gradient of one in six, much steeper than the Green Guide maximum; 40% of fans were too far from the prescribed distance to an exit; the crush barriers were the wrong height and too far apart; and liaison between the club and police on the day \"failed\".</p> <p>Yet despite the 96 deaths, the suffering caused to the bereaved families and traumatised survivors, in the 23 years afterwards Sheffield Wednesday never admitted liability.</p> <p>The families say that as they were trying to cope with their losses the club was unsympathetic, built no decent relationship with them, and treated them with disdain. Not a single director or employee of the club resigned \u2013 even Graham Mackrell, the club secretary whose job included overall responsibility for safety matters, stayed in place.</p> <p>McGee stepped down from the chairmanship of the club in March 1990. He was replaced by Dave Richards, who had not been on the board at the time the disaster happened, but was appointed a director six months later in October 1989. Under his chairmanship, Sheffield Wednesday refused to put up a memorial at Hillsborough for 10 years, until 1999.</p> <p>Margaret Aspinall, the chair of the HFSG, Phil Hammond, the former chair, and Trevor Hicks, the group's president, all of whom lost teenage children at Hillsborough, recall instantly when asked about the memorial that Sheffield Wednesday initially offered them a small plaque, to be attached to a wall, outside some men's toilets.</p> <p>\"You could not get much greater contempt for families trying to deal with the loss of their loved ones,\" says Hicks. \"Sheffield Wednesday's attitude to the families, and failure to put a memorial up for 10 years, was very distressing to us when we were dealing with the loss of our loved ones. Taylor identified their safety failures as contributory causes of the deaths, yet they behaved as if they did think it was the fans' fault. There was no apology.\"</p> <p>Sources close to Richards denied that the families were offered a plaque outside the toilets.</p> <h2><strong>Compensation</strong></h2> <p>When the families and some of those injured sued for the loss they had suffered, Sheffield Wednesday refused to admit liability or pay compensation. In November 1989, South Yorkshire police did offer damages to some, and as Sheffield Wednesday still refused, the police sued the club and the club's engineers, Eastwoods. They claimed the club were liable because of the inability to control the capacities of the Leppings Lane central pens \u2013 \"the main cause of the disaster\", the police argued \u2013 and \"unsafe systems\" of management and escape from Leppings Lane.</p> <p>In October 1990, under Richards's chairmanship, Sheffield Wednesday reached a confidential settlement with the police. The club paid a proportion of the settlement. Claims from the bereaved and injured were settled \"without admission of liability\".</p> <p>The panel report notes that this drew criticism from the families: \"They had wanted South Yorkshire police and Sheffield Wednesday to accept, without ambiguity, their respective responsibilities in causing death and injury.\"</p> <p>That acceptance never came. Although Richards, the directors and Mackrell all knew their safety certificate had been 10 years out of date \u2013 and also knew all the identified safety failures \u2013 the club never actively sought to contradict the false South Yorkshire police stories that supporters themselves had somehow caused the disaster.</p> <p>In fact, that version of Hillsborough, conclusively proven by the panel to be untrue and deliberately disseminated by South Yorkshire police in a determined cover-up campaign, took hold in Sheffield and has been believed by many ever since. Under Richards, Sheffield Wednesday never apologised to the families for their suffering, nor sought to educate the club's own supporters about its failings and the disaster's true causes.</p> <p>Only under the new ownership of the Serbian-US businessman Milan Mandaric, who took over in December 2010, have Sheffield Wednesday finally made an official apology. That was issued last Wednesday, the morning before the report was published, following consultation with Aspinall.</p> <p>Richards stayed on as Sheffield Wednesday chairman until February 2000, shortly after a memorial was finally put up. The club had sunk into debts of \u00a320m, and was facing relegation from the Premier League. Richards left Wednesday three months before they were relegated, to take the job as the first paid chairman of the Premier League. His first salary, as part-time chairman, was \u00a3176,667. He is still the Premier League chairman, representing English football internationally, and is a main board director of the FA. His salary from the Premier League last year was \u00a3347,000.</p> <p>In 2006, while the Hillsborough families were struggling to have anyone in authority hear their campaign for the truth about the disaster to be accepted, Richards was knighted for services to football.</p> <p>This was principally due to him being chairman of the Football Foundation, which gives grants from the Premier League, FA and government to grassroots football facilities and projects.</p> <h2><strong>Distressing</strong></h2> <p>Richards generally does not talk to the press, but via sources this week he said of Hillsborough that he had been there on the day of the disaster and was horrified by seeing it. He said that prompted him to become a director of the club, and seek to improve its approach to safety. He was the chairman when, with grants of public money, the Leppings Lane and Kop terraces were made all-seated following the second Taylor report. Richards has told Premier League staff he was appalled that Sheffield Wednesday had hosted matches for 10 years without an up-to-date safety certificate. However, he has not made that known publicly during the 23 years in which, including under him, the club resisted liability. Richards said he refused to put a memorial up at Hillsborough for 10 years on legal advice. He said he was advised by lawyers that to do so would compromise the club's stance not to admit liability for the disaster. Representatives of Liverpool Football Club and supporters' groups who pressed Sheffield Wednesday during that period to put up a memorial, arguing that its absence was distressing to families and survivors, recall Richards giving a similar answer then.</p> <p>Aspinall said: \"I am absolutely appalled and disgusted that after our loved ones died and we were caused so much pain and suffering, the chairman of the club where the disaster happened, which failed to put a memorial up for 10 years and treated the families with contempt, has been knighted for services to football and is the chairman of the Premier League.</p> <p>\"While we have been through 23 years of hell fighting for the truth and justice, a lot of people have done very well after Hillsborough. We never got an apology from one of them. Certainly, Sir Dave Richards should give up his knighthood and resign as the chairman of the Premier League.\"</p> <p>Richards did not respond to that call for his resignation, other than to pass on the name of the law firm which he said gave legal advice not to put up a memorial. Senior sources at Sheffield Wednesday, however, and the panel, said they had handed over all the club's documents relating to Hillsborough, and seen no such legal advice.</p> <p>Falconer said: \"This idea that Sheffield Wednesday putting up a memorial would amount to admitting liability is utter rubbish. It is about showing respect for the victims, and failing to put a memorial up was consistent with how Sheffield Wednesday behaved under Sir Dave Richards: they wanted to reduce their association with the disaster as much as possible.\"</p> <p>None of the directors on the Sheffield Wednesday board at the time of the disaster resigned as a consequence, although in March 1990 McGee stepped down. Keith Addy, a director involved in construction \u2013 whose duties, according to club documents, included \"particular responsibility for ground alterations and improvements\" \u2013 stayed on for almost 20 years, until January 2008.</p> <h2><strong>Honourable</strong></h2> <p>Mackrell, who had been the official designated safety officer for Hillsborough at the time of the disaster, saw Sheffield Wednesday through all the legal processes in which it denied liability, and was promoted, under Richards, to chief executive. He still has high-profile jobs in football, working for the League Managers Association and as a venue director at stadiums hosting matches for European football's governing body, Uefa.</p> <p>In June 1999, Mackrell left Sheffield Wednesday to become the chief executive at West Ham United. Six months later, for the last eight minutes of a League Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa, West Ham fielded a player, Emmanuel Omoyimni, who had not been formally registered by the club. When that administrative error was discovered, Mackrell immediately stepped down from his job. \"I felt the only honourable thing to do was resign,\" he said at the time.</p> <p>Contacted this week about the possibility of the DPP mounting a corporate manslaughter investigation into the failings at Sheffield Wednesday that led to the Hillsborough disaster, Mackrell said: \"I am making no comment.\"</p> <p>When I interviewed him in 2004 for my book The Beautiful Game? Searching for the Soul of Football, Mackrell argued that the police blunder, opening an exit gate to allow a large number of supporters in without closing off the tunnel leading to the Leppings Lane pens, was the disaster's main cause.</p> <p>\"No way would I have any involvement in that whatsoever,\" he said.</p> <p>Mackrell said the changes made to Leppings Lane had happened before he joined the club, and \"other people\" were responsible for them. I asked if he had considered resigning after 96 people died at the ground for which he was the safety officer.</p> <p>\"No, never,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Palestinian leaders have raised the prospect of revoking an historic agreement with Israel amid rising frustration over the lack of progress towards a Palestinian state and growing dissent and protest on the streets.</p> <p>President Mahmoud Abbas is considering cancelling the 1993 Oslo accords, and related economic agreements, according to media reports. The issue was discussed at a meeting of the Palestinian leadership at the weekend, the reports said.</p> <p>The issue has been raised against the backdrop of renewed warnings that a two-state solution to the conflict may no longer be possible.</p> <p>In a speech to be delivered on Thursday, Britain's former foreign secretary David Miliband will say: \"For the first time in a long time there is no 'peace process'.

The problem is not with one term or another \u2026 The world must realise that we are reconsidering the whole issue.\"</p> <p>The unilateral revocation of the Oslo accords would be opposed by Israel and the US. The dissolution of the PA would have far-reaching consequences for its 153,000 employees and their families, and for the provision of basic services, such as hospitals and schools. It would also entail Palestinian ministers giving up their privileges and government salaries.</p> <p>The issue has been raised amid continuing protests in West Bank cities over the rising cost of living despite an emergency economic package announced last week by the prime minister, Salam Fayyad. Some protesters have demanded the scrapping of the Paris protocol, an economic appendix to the Oslo accords, which pegs Palestinian VAT to Israeli rates.</p> <p>The financial crisis in the Palestinian territories was deepening, according to a World Bank report released on Wednesday that blamed an economic slowdown, a fall in donor aid and \"few positive prospects in the broader political environment\".</p> <p>It said that Area C, the 60% of the West Bank assigned to full Israeli control under the Oslo accords, contained most of the territory's agricultural lands, natural resources and land reserves. \"Sustainable economic growth cannot be achieved without a removal of the barriers preventing private sector development, particularly in Area C,\" said Mariam Sherman at the Bank.</p> <p>Mustafa Barghouti, a former presidential candidate, said the Palestinian leadership was serious about reviewing the Oslo accords. \"The agreement has become a cover for the Israelis' policy of expanding settlements and creating a system of apartheid on the ground,\" he said.</p> <p>The PA could take actions short of dismantling itself, such as unilaterally setting its own VAT rate, he said. \"Some people advocated that economic success was possible even under occupation. It is not possible.\"</p> <p>But Diana Buttu, an independent analyst, said the talk of cancelling the accords was unlikely to result in action. \"This is just talk for them. They don't have any other strategy. Cancelling Oslo in all its forms would mean going back to popular struggle and these guys don't want that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Becky and John dream of the good life after a move to the country. But all is not pastoral bliss.

There are two brilliant scenes with the sad local plumber, Mike: the first in which a diagnosis of \"sweaty pipes\" leads to a torrent of innuendo; the second, a toe-curlingly painful demonstration of the gap between fantasy and reality.

Analyst Nicolas Guyon-Gellin said:</p> <blockquote> We see an intensification of value-enhancing bolt-ons to replenish the research and development pipeline (up to $14bn with potential targets like Amarin, Biomarin, Forest or Actelion) and to leverage untapped emerging market opportunities (expansion outside China). We view any larger deal (Shire or AbbVie) as unlikely and doubt a \"run for cash\" scenario. <br> After having been the worst large cap performer over 12 months ( down 9% relative) and in view of new management we see a turning point; the usual valuation metrics (30% PE discount and 7% dividend yield) should provide clear support. Yet much needs to be done (R&amp;D productivity, emerging markets) to fix long term growth uncertainties before we can turn more positive - we are still 3%-9% below long term consensus earnings per share. </blockquote> <p><strong>Sage</strong> rose 2.1p to 318.3p on talk the accountancy software group could be looking to sell its US operations. The company has recently been the subject of takeover speculation.</p> <p><strong>Smiths Group</strong>, the technology business whose products range from bomb detectors to medical equipment, ended up 12p at \u00a310.54, after a 7% rise in full year profits.</p> <p><strong>Ashmore</strong>, the emerging markets fund management group, had been under pressure recently after a dip in full year profits, and is set to leave the FTSE 100 at the end of this week. But Morgan Stanley began coverage of the company with an overweight rating and 390p price target, helped push its shares up 3.5p to 338.5p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Concerns over fund performance, pressures on margins, equity and multi strategy are priced in. With our earnings 5% ahead of consensus we believe Ashmore offers attractive risk/reward with size of opportunity still underappreciated. We expect acceleration in growth to drive 18% earnings per share compound annual growth rate and re-rating. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps, recruitment group <strong>Michael Page International</strong> slipped 1p to 389p after a sell note from Seymour Pierce, which pointed to a downbeat statement from Swiss rival Adecco. Analyst Kevin Lapwood said:</p> <blockquote> The Adecco trading update ahead of today's investor day indicates that there has been little improvement in European staffing markets. This is consistent with data from other sources and leads us to reiterate our negative stance. We note that Michael Page has enjoyed a good bounce in recent weeks which we believe is premature. France accounts for 17% of net fee income at Michael Page. The shares are expensive, trading on a prospective PE of 24.5 times compared with a staffing peer group average of 16.5 times. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Hibu</strong>, the ridiculous new name for Yellow Pages group Yell, dropped 35% to 0.44p after it warned again on profits and repeated that its restructuring discussions could lead to an outcome where its ordinary shares had no value.</p> <p>In a similar boat were shareholders in <strong>AEA Technology</strong>, down 33% to 0.06p. The environmental advisor said it was in talks with a number of parties, but that none of these were likely to lead to an offer for the company, meaning there will be little or no value for shareholders. It suffered a shareholder rebellion at its annual meeting over its remuneration report, surely too little too late as a protest?</p>",
  "<p>The 28th biannual <a href=\"http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/\" title=\"\">London fashion week</a> drew to a close yesterday. Mere mortal city dwellers breathed a sigh of relief and waved goodbye to the planes of models moving on to subsequent fashion weeks in Milan and then Paris.</p> <p>Twice a year, the \"big four\" fashion capitals bestow upon the western world the trends of the coming season, thereby dictating the next slew of outfits worth bankrupting yourself for. Nothing new there. But for the remaining 50 weeks of the year, beneath the radar of mainstream fashion press, other, lesser-known fashion weeks take place in countries on every continent.</p> <p>Over the past couple of years, I've attended many \"alternative\" landmark fashion weeks, including the first ever in <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/fashion-week-internationale/islamabad-part-1\" title=\"\">Islamabad</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/fashion-week-internationale/cambodia-part-1\" title=\"\">Cambodia</a>, events in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/mar/14/lagos-fashion-week\" title=\"\">Lagos</a> and Kingston, Jamaica, and even one in New York <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/fashion-week-internationale/full-figured-part-1\" title=\"\">purely for the full-figured</a>. Indeed, the first ever Congo fashion week begins this Friday in Kinshasa. There are vibrant, burgeoning fashion scenes in almost every country you can think of, and it's important we stop overlooking them.</p> <p>But it's not the clothes, trends or front rows that I've found most compelling about these \"other\" fashion weeks. It's the brilliant cultural idiosyncrasies. At fashion weeks in Nigeria and Cambodia the level of creativity represented in some of the designs rivalled anything I've seen come out of Central Saint Martins, and yet my favourite designers there were self-taught and had had limited access to fashion magazines. In <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/fashion-week-internationale/rio-fashion-week-part-1\" title=\"\">Rio, Brazil</a>, the fashion week seemed to represent a microcosm of Rio society, reflected in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/sep/13/brazil-transgender-models?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">use of transgender models</a> on the catwalk. Rio is a famously tolerant city and popular LGBT tourist destination. Its fashion industry stands out because of its capacity for embracing marginality.</p> <p>My time at these fashion events has also confirmed something to me that may sound trite: everywhere in the world, what fashion really boils down to is women. Not only in terms of the tremendous amount of pressure we withstand in pursuit of often unrealistic image goals, but the validation we get from fashion. The voluptuous models of full-figured fashion week took the New York fashion week template, squeezed into it and broke the mould, to riotous applause. Perhaps fashion weeks, events that historically have accusations of exploitation levelled against them, can and should represent a moment of empowerment for women.</p> <p>That said, most fashion weeks want to appeal to an international buying market, and often this means pandering to a globalised perception of beauty. In South Korea this expressed itself in a particularly disturbing way. Many young women, but especially models, are opting for \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_blepharoplasty\" title=\"\">double eyelid</a>\" surgery, a procedure that effectively westernises the appearance.</p> <p>As the global fashion industry grows, there will come a time when the powerhouses expand beyond the \"big four\". There is a wonderful potential emerging to develop fashion as a real cross-cultural language. But for this to happen it is important that fledgling fashion scenes don't lose sight of their own cultural heritages and identities in a quest to emulate the west. I want to keep being surprised by the uniqueness to be found outside Europe and the US.</p>",
  "<p>Plenty of people would argue that Kevin Pietersen has been the renegade of English cricket for some time, and now he is set to be offered the opportunity to make that description official. Pietersen has been identified by the Melbourne Renegades, one of the eight franchises in Australia's Big Bash Twenty20 competition, as the perfect signing following his latest England omission.</p> <p>That could mean a local rivalry in the Victoria capital with his old friend Shane Warne, who has already been signed up by the Melbourne Stars, for whom the England all-rounder Luke Wright starred last winter. Stuart Coventry, the chief executive of the Renegades \u2013 having previously worked for a daredevil motorcycling troupe called the Crusty Demons \u2013 will shortly fly to Sri Lanka, where Pietersen is covering the World Twenty20 for the ESPN Star Sports network.</p> <p>Coventry has confirmed in the Australian press that Pietersen's continuing stand-off with England has alerted a number of Big Bash franchises, with the Sydney Sixers now thought to be the main rivals to the Renegades for Pietersen's services, although Brisbane Heat have also expressed interest in the past. The league runs from 7 December to 19 January.</p> <p>\"Now that Kevin Pietersen is back in the mix there's no doubt we and the Sixers have been having some dialogue with his management,\" Coventry told the Melbourne Age. \"If he is available we'd love to grab him, but there's a lot of curve balls in play at the moment about his availability, whether he wants to come to Australia, whether he wants to come to Melbourne or Sydney.</p> <p>\"From a playing point of view, I think he is one of the best T20 players in the world and we've got a culture in our group that will create the right environment for him to play his best cricket.\"</p> <p>After being omitted from the list of England players receiving new central contracts from 1 October, Pietersen is understood to have been offered a separate deal covering four months that would have involved him joining the England team for their training camp in Dubai at the end of October, but not going on the four-Test tour of India which follows it this autumn.</p> <p>That was the main reason England delayed the announcement of their squad for India until Tuesday. But Pietersen refused to sign the deal, scuppering their hopes of being able to make a positive statement to accompany his ongoing match exclusion. It is understood that the Dubai camp was seen by England as a chance for Pietersen to begin the healing process with his team-mates, which clearly has some way to go.</p> <p>However, further talks are understood to be planned behind the scenes in Sri Lanka, and there have been suggestions that Pietersen could yet be offered a 12-month deal, having insisted in face-to-face meetings with all the key members of the England hierarchy that he is prepared to commit himself to putting international cricket above freelance opportunities until the end of 2015.</p> <p>If that deal included inclusion in the England one-day squad for India in the New Year, the dates would overlap with those of the Big Bash.</p>",

  "<p>It has been a summer full of reports of extreme weather, of unparalleled scope and severity. Among the highlights: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/heatwave-easing-us-temperatures-normal\" title=\"\">one of the warmest years on record in the US</a>, record-high temperatures in central and eastern Europe, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/30/rain-chaos-summer-wettest-years?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">wettest summer in the UK</a>, the heaviest rainfalls in northern India and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/07/manila-severe-flooding-torrential-flooding\" title=\"\">the Philippines</a> and the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/13/drought-declaration-natural-disaster-states\" title=\"\">severe droughts in the US</a> and east Africa.</p> <p>In short, climate change and weather extremes are not about a distant future. Formerly one-off extreme weather episodes seem to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/08/extreme-weather-video\" title=\"\">becoming the new normal</a>. Weather extremes are not that extreme any more. Heatwaves, floods, droughts and wildfires are the new reality of an ever warming world.</p> <p>And this should not come as a surprise. Scientists have been warning for years that as the planet heats up, we will have to deal with more severe, more changeable, more unpredictable weather. The evidence is mounting that human-caused warming is pushing normal warming effects to extremes. Heatwaves have increased in duration and frequency. Some parts of Europe are now gripped by severe water shortages while other parts have suffered extreme precipitations causing floods and increased crop losses.</p> <p>And although not every extreme weather event can be attributed to climate change, scientists are now much more confident about linking individual weather events to climate change. Take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/30/2011-second-warmest-year-december?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">2011's record warm November</a> in the UK, the second hottest on record. Researchers say that it was at least 60 times more likely to happen because of climate change than because of natural variations in the earth's weather systems.</p> <p>This summer continued the pattern. The retreat of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">sea ice in the Arctic smashed the previous record</a>, with just half the ice present compared to when satellite measurement began in 1979. Or take another example: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/24/greenland-ice-sheet-thaw-nasa\" title=\"\">Greenland's July thaw</a>, where satellite data showed that about 97% of the massive ice sheet surface covering the island was melting. \"Was this real or was it due to a data error?\" a Nasa scientist questioned. Unfortunately, the data was correct.</p> <p>All this record-breaking news reveals that global climate breakdown is occurring more rapidly than most climate scientists had expected. Climate change is happening, and it exacerbates a whole range of other global problems, adding further instability in an already unstable world.</p> <p>But isn't it too costly to invest in a low-carbon world, some may ask? Well, yes it costs. But so does business-as-usual. It would be wrong to believe that to continue business-as-usual is the cheap option. It is not. On the contrary, it is very expensive. Just one example: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/30/world-bank-global-hunger-warning-drought\" title=\"\">World Bank issued a global hunger warning</a> recently after severe droughts in the US, Russia and the Ukraine sent food prices to a record high. According to the World Bank, prices for maize and sorghum increased by 113% and 200% respectively in some markets in Mozambique and in Sudan. This is the kind of cost that often gets ignored.</p> <p>Businesses don't need to be told about the financial losses caused by weather extremes. This summer's drought in the US devastated the multibillion-dollar corn and soybean crops. Insurers in the US may face as much as $20bn&#xa0;losses this year, their biggest ever loss in agriculture. This is not exactly helping fight the economic crisis.</p> <p>It is simply incredible what big risks some people are prepared to take on behalf of future generations. Despite the facts and evidence in front of us, there are still many interests advocating doing nothing or continuing with business-as-usual. Or just forgetting the climate crisis until we have solved the economic crisis.</p> <p>And whereas some see the current financial turmoil as a bitter setback for international climate protection, I see intelligent climate action as a driver of new opportunities for jobs in Europe, for investments in energy efficiency technologies, for boosting innovation and competitiveness, for lowering energy bills.</p> <p>To me, tackling the climate crisis helps, not damages, our economic security and prosperity. Both crises are interlinked and must be tackled together.</p>",
  "<p>Freshers week is a double-edged sword. It's a week-long holiday, complete with clubbing, activities, and probably the odd drink. There's just one catch \u2013 you have no friends to share it with. It's unsurprising then, that in the face of such relentless socialising, many first-years experience loneliness.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of hype about students having the best days of their lives,\" says Melanie Withers, director of psychological and counselling services at Sussex University.</p> <p>\"But people don't recognise that loneliness and homesickness is also common. It just isn't acknowledged by the student body \u2013 those who do admit to it can be seen as a bit lightweight.\"</p> <p>This was exactly the case for Helen Wright who studied English and photography at the University of Sunderland.</p> <p>\"My expectations were that university, and especially freshers week, would be exciting, crazy, fun and the best time of my life \u2013 but it wasn't,\" she says.</p> <p>\"It was the first time I had ever been homesick, and it really took me by surprise because I genuinely wasn't expecting it. I remember crying quite a lot and calling my mum more than usual because it was too far to travel home at weekends.\"</p> <p>\"I resolved my loneliness by just talking to more people and going out with my housemates, and I soon realised that a lot of people felt the same as I did.\"</p> <p>A Royal College of Psychiatrists report, <a href=\"www.rcpsych.ac.uk/files/pdfversion/CR166.pdf\" title=\"\">The Mental Health of Students in Higher Education</a>, found that as many as 60% of first-year students experience homesickness. Additionally, one in five undergraduates raised concerns about their anxiety and one in three reported feelings of sadness or depression.</p> <p>Jack Elliot, 19, who is studying journalism at Leeds Trinity, sought help for his anxiety. Despite having attended a boarding school and being used to living away from home, Jack became increasingly uncomfortable in his new surroundings.</p> <p>\"There was a difference between boarding school and university, the people at my university were from very different backgrounds to myself and it was a bit of a culture shock at first. I began to feel extremely nervous and paranoid and broke down in tears several times,\" he says.</p> <p>\"After two weeks of feeling like this and being unable to sleep, I went to see a counsellor. Personally I feel that if you suffer from anxiety or loneliness, it is always better to just go and talk to someone.\"</p> <p>One service that offers students a chance to talk about their problems is <a href=\"https://www.nightline.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Nightline</a>, which operates in 90 universities. The phones are manned by fellow students who use what is called the active listening technique to reflect questions back to callers, helping them reconsider their situation.</p> <p>Anne Oxley is Nightline's chief executive: \"Its incredibly important for students to be able to speak to someone; just knowing someone's there is so reassuring. It's anonymous, but more importantly it's peer-to-peer. Because it's another student at your uni they'll understand exactly what you're talking about.\"</p> <p>Withers says that despite the emphasis placed on drinking during freshers week, it's important that new students don't feel obliged to take part in activities that make them feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>\"If it's good for you, then you can go on as many pub crawls as you like, but don't give in to pressure if you don't want to.\"</p> <p>\"There's a conspiracy of silence. Anyone going into a strange environment is going to feel a bit weird. My advice would be to share it with a fellow fresher \u2013 chances are they'll be feeling the same.\"</p> <h2>Daniel Eaves (name changed)</h2> <p>In the summer before freshers, I was full of anticipation and excitement. Before starting sixth form I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which meant I had to miss and retake a year of school. University was an opportunity for me to start a fresh chapter. I could put my health problems, which had stunted my progress at school, behind me.</p> <p>My condition was pretty stable back then, and I looked forward to making new friends and getting involved in a vibrant social scene.</p> <p>However when I arrived at Bristol University I felt very self-conscious and uptight when talking to anybody, especially the girls. I would sweat profusely all day, and tried to cover this up by wearing jumpers, even in the sun. Eventually these also bore the sweat patches and I was extremely embarrassed.</p> <p>Another point that added to the stress was my inability to remember people's names. It was really awkward talking to a face that I knew well, but not knowing their name.</p> <p>I felt increasingly isolated and ostracised. I begun to think that people were talking about me all of the time and making fun of me. This was symptomatic of my health issues, but it was incredibly difficult to fight.</p> <p>I would phone the Samaritans in the middle of the night. On one occasion, I sat up all night in my room, on my bed, just shaking and sweating in panic. I would stay in my room, missing all of my scheduled lectures and tutorials, in bed all day. I felt like I was on my own against the world.</p> <p>Eventually I spoke to a group of friends that I believed I could trust. Two in particular were very understanding and helpful. One would be happy to sit and chat with me about my issues whenever, and the other would go to the shops and buy me food, as I was too unwell mentally to go myself. This was a massive help for me, and I owe these two people a lot.</p> <p>The university did offer lots of support, the medical faculty student adviser was very helpful, as were the doctors at the student health centre. </p> <p>In my naivety, I had tried to put on a front and pretend that everything was okay, until it was far too late.</p>",

  "<p>Growth is a complicated business. Over the centuries, economists have not only been divided over how to make it come about, but over whether it is really a good thing in the first place. On the one hand, we want to live comfortable existences free of struggle, but then again many of us would prioritise greater social equality or preserving the environment over endless economic enrichment. As we shudder through the collective hangover, growth for growth's sake now finds itself under fresh scrutiny.</p> <p>Ironically it is in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/angela-merkel-shape-europe-german-image\" title=\"\">affluent Germany</a>, the only place in Europe that currently seems to have any hope of economic growth, where the consensus on the intrinsic value of growth is most sceptical. A recent survey commissioned by Bertelsmann Stiftung found that eight out of ten Germans crave a new economic order. The number of Germans who see growth as very important was down 14% compared with two years ago. The proportion of Germans who highly value money and possessions also dropped. Nearly two-thirds disagreed with the idea that a higher income could increase their quality of life. Many Germans now value protection of the environment over material prosperity, according to the findings.</p> <p>Academic research seems very much in line with the popular mood: German thinkers are increasingly publishing work, which denounces growth and touts drastic alternative economic policies. One of the more high-profile members of this movement is <a href=\"http://www.goethe.de/ges/soz/wsc/en9188517.htm\" title=\"\">Niko Paech</a> from the University of Oldenburg, who recently published a controversial new book called Liberation from Affluence, in which he lambasts growth , argues that societies need to shrink their economies, and calls for an embrace of self-sufficiency models and regional exchange. His policies for the ideal society include a 20-hour week, the introduction of regional currencies, and decommissioning large development projects such as motorways and airports.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.loske.de/\" title=\"\">Reinhard Loske</a> is another member of the so-called \"post-growth\" movement. In Where Now With the Growth Question? he advocates the formation of innovative transition towns featuring social banking, taxation according to environmental consumption rather than labour, and an enforced basic income. Meanwhile, conservationist Angelika Zahrnt, in her co-edited book on a post-growth economy, rallies for less paid work and more free time for the workforce.</p> <p>Many adherents to this burgeoning academic bloc can barely conceal their contempt for the financial architecture underlying the German economy and those of other western countries. To them, the modern financial sector is responsible for the current economic downturn, and in need of complete overhaul. They include economic commentator Thomas Jorberg, who has argued for a ban on financial services that don't service the real economy and claims that banks should only be allowed to partake in activities that address basic human needs.</p> <p>Some of these ideas seem far-fetched. But they have received a genuine hearing in Germany: a review of the books by Paech and Loske was published in the leading national newspaper Zeit earlier in September with the title: <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.zeit.de/2012/35/Paech-Loske-Wirtschaftswachstum-Wachstumswahn&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DFrau%2BMerkel,%2Blesen%2BSie%2Bdiese%2BB%25C3%25BCcher%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1392%26bih%3D950%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NKBZUN-VC5OGhQfQ_YDABw&amp;ved=0CCQQ7gEwAA\" title=\"\"><em>Frau Merkel, lesen Sie diese B\u00fccher</em></a> (\"Frau Merkel, read these books\").</p> <p>Perhaps a convergence of two factors helps to explain this shift. First, the financial crisis may have made some Germans more wary of growth as an ultimate end goal for a country. Second, their relative wealth gives Germans the luxury of security, and that security in turn makes them more likely to indulge in postmaterialist musings.</p> <p>This idea fits neatly within the theories of the modern father of post-materialism, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Inglehart\" title=\"\">Ronald Inglehart</a>. Writing in the 1970s, Inglehart argued that prosperity alone would ensure that humanity's values would gradually shift from materialism to postmateralist values like autonomy and self-expression. It also chimes with common sense: is it not natural that Germans, who are more likely to have steady jobs and can pay the mortgage, are less concerned with economic enrichment than Greeks who struggle to find a job?</p> <p>Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell, the controversial author <a href=\"http://www.abbeyweb.net/introduction.html\" title=\"\">Edward Abbey</a> once said. That might seem like a rather brutal declaration. But since the financial crisis, it seems many Germans, both exposed to crisis and isolated from the worst effects, would be tempted to agree.</p>",
  "<p>This is a very broad-brushed spectrum of possible responses to the financial crash. I'm not talking about businesses, small or large, charities, governments, or any other institutions. I'm talking about the man or woman in the street, with a cashcard.</p> <p>Some bright sparks will have responded immediately, seen the writing on the wall from the minute there was a run on Northern Rock (five years ago today, as I write), realised that traditional modes of banking were in crisis and rejigged everything from their current account to their pension. I've never met one of these \"early reactors\" but I'm going to assume they exist.</p> <p>Other people will have looked at the banks, acceded that they had flaws but plodded on with them anyway, and these people I know exist, because at the moment I'm still one of them.</p> <p>In the middle are the people for whom the deficiencies of traditional finance crept up slowly. First it was the systemic instability caused by financial instruments that somehow every large bank came to be exposed to, without apparently noticing, let alone mentioning it in their annual reports. This was pretty bad; it led to a global recession, it will probably sink the Euro, it has cast many millions of people out of work and will doubtless echo through some people's entire lives.</p> <p>This alone was not enough to make me fall out of love with banking the way I'd always banked. The scale of the disaster made it seem pretty unlikely that any of my chickenfeed decisions would make a difference one way or the other.</p> <p>Ditto, the spectacle of the bailouts and the comedy lack of remorse from the banking cadre.</p> <p>Then came the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/libor?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Libor scandal</a>; obviously dodgy, too technical to set my imagination on fire. The mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) and interest-rate swaps for small businesses seemed too long ago.</p> <p>The IT failures of the summer were annoying but could happen to anybody. Then, finally, the money laundering, where HSBC had deviated so far from its own safeguards that anybody could arrive with a big bag of money from anywhere, and have instant legitimacy conferred upon them (I imagine it had to be a pretty big bag; for the smaller scale drug dealer, there are probably some hefty charges that we'll find out about ten years hence).</p> <p>It was no one thing, it was simply the relentlessness of failure and mischief \u2013 I can't complain about these institutions and continue to bank with them. I can't worry about moral hazard when I am the hazard: I'm the person whose custom, for which read inertia, tells them that they can do what they like. I've got to move my money. You've got to move yours too. But where, and how, and how much of it, and how radical are you prepared to be?</p> <h2>In the short term \u2026</h2> <p>Move your current account. Three instant objections are a) that I am attached to my current account, b) that I cannot be bothered and c) that this is the one bit that costs banks money. I'm eschewing the one service that they don't rip me off for.</p> <p>Objections a) and c) are not as daft as they sound, and they are intimately related \u2013 banks don't make a huge amount out of current accounts, they get \u00a3125 on average a year for fees and charges, and if you leave any money in there, they make a profit on the interchange: that is, by paying you 2% in interest, and charging borrowers 15%. But they see current accounts as a loss leader for other financial products.</p> <p>Taking it chronologically through your life (a conventional life, with everything in the proper order), they'd sell you a loan, then a pension, then a mortgage, then possibly earnings protection insurance, then accounts for your children's savings. As Louis Brooke, from <a href=\"http://www.moveyourmoney.org.uk/\" title=\"\">moveyourmoney.org.uk</a> points out: \"They can get you for the resale for the financial markers in your life. Which is why they're happy not to compete with one another.\"</p> <p>There is very little in it for them to have a constantly fluctuating market in which customers compare deals on overdraft charges and then move banks; it is far better to foster an avuncular, whole-life relationship, in which your loyalty is repaid by their sagacity and generosity. The \"free current account\" was a stroke of genius \u2013 it makes them look socially useful and open-handed, without impeding their ability to levy charges. If this sounds cynical \u2013 the idea that the fixity of the market is deliberate \u2013 compare banks to the communications market, which also consists of just a handful of providers. Brooke expands: \"If you look at phones, there's a minute plan. Companies compete really heavily, and advertise aggressively on a granular level, and people switch quite happily.</p> <p>\"Analytically, there's absolutely no difference in the pricing plan you'd expect and the ease of the switching process, between a bank and a mobile phone provider. I should be able to say, I only need 20 direct debits a month, I do 500 withdrawals, I want this package.\"</p> <p>Well, nobody's that radical yet, but the fact that the market, left to its own devices, throws up this system that is not competitive at all, stacked entirely in the favour of four or five large providers, is a useful thing to bear in mind. The unfettered marketplace is not rufty-tufty and competitive, it is cabalistic, not just in banking but also in energy, supermarkets, public sector commissioning, waste management, almost everywhere. My secret worry is that nice guys finish last and capitalists finish first: but the mainstream isn't capitalism, it's an oligarchy.</p> <p>In looking around for a better offer, I'm the capitalist.</p> <p>Anyway, alternatives: the vanilla switching option would be Triodos for savings or Co-op for a current account. They both pledge to be as good as their mainstream rivals (the Co-op was actually voted best current account provider by Moneysupermarket last year), while being customer-centric and ethically-driven.</p> <p>Mutuals and credit unions offer differences that are more profound \u2013 in the first instance, that they're owned and governed by their members, in the second, that they're run as mutuals, and they also lend into their local communities. It is a cracking idea, and one that has caught on in Canada much more than here, but it has technical and systemic problems; it is not uncommon to get a Page Not Found notice when you go to their website, and I know few people with the stomach to put their monthly salary into <a href=\"http:// www.bristolcreditunion.org/news.asp?ID=\" 93\"\" title=\"\">something so chaotic</a>. Often you have to live or work in the area. At a more profound level, credit unions do not behave enough like banks. Chris Smyth from <a href=\"http:// www.leedscitycreditunion.co.uk/content.asp?section=\" 1\"\" title=\"\">Leeds City Credit Union</a> asked, rhetorically: \"Why aren't we, in this sector, as quick to react as the private sector?\"</p> <p>Wonga, payday loans companies, even pawn shops, have leapt on this recession and made \u2013 continue to make \u2013 a killing. Credit unions could be filling that role, making short-term crisis loans, in a non-predatory way. They don't chase the business, presumably because they don't want to exploit misfortune; and people don't seek them out, because on some fundamental level (warning \u2013 bare assertion coming, not evidence-based), we don't want to borrow money from do-gooders, we want to borrow it squarely from someone who is chasing our custom. We think of this as a relationship of equals, even though if they're chasing our custom, it's most probably to do us over.</p> <h2>In the medium-term \u2026</h2> <p>Having an ISA is possibly the most illogical financial decision I have ever made: I don't agree with tax breaks for high earners, and I don't agree with traditional investments. As Bruce Davis, one of the founders of Zopa, comments, \"with investment the dominant narrative is gambling\". This is nowhere truer than with ISAs, the nursery slope, where the decision is broken down for you in terms as simple as \"are you high risk, medium risk or low risk?\"\u2026 \"but we don't' think about what we're investing in\".</p> <p>You don't just have to make a negative choice with your money \u2013 that is, \"I don't want to invest in a bank that does x\" \u2013 you can make a positive choice. You can decide to lend it to small businesses (through Funding Circle) or to individuals (through Zopa). These peer-to-peer lenders are regulated (they have been since August last year) and they look pretty solid; indeed, as Giles Andrews, the CEO of Zopa, said: \"It's a new business model but it's not a radical alternative at all. It's for really sensible people who are really good with money.</p> <p>\"Banks had this horrible product called PPI , they were using the profits they were making on that to subsidise borrowers. That was a really good business for them, they made a fortune out of it. Its abolition has resulted in them having to charge higher rates to their borrowers. So bank spreads [this is the difference between what they pay in interest, and what they charge] have risen to 11/12/13% on average.\"</p> <p>Zopa doesn't pay lenders as little, nor charge borrowers as much \u2013 their spread is a combination of fees, charged to all customers, minus any losses they make on bad debts. But losses are low, because they're much more assiduous at vetting borrowers, about 50% of people are rejected out of hand; only 15% of those who apply ultimately get a loan.</p> <p>So you get more interest when you save, you pay less when you borrow. \"The second benefit is that you get money back each month and if interest rates are going up, you can relend it at a better rate,\" continues Andrews.</p> <p>\"The third one, which is subjective, it means something to some people and not to others, is that you're lending to other people and doing something more useful with your money than funding bankers' bonuses.\"</p> <h2>In the long term \u2026</h2> <p>The really slippery fact is that if you really want to change the way finance works, you can do more than eschew it, you can use your money for something better \u2013 not just to help people out (credit unions), or help people build new bathrooms (peer-to-peer) but to build things that need building, in the service of the society that you want to create. Davis, since setting up Zopa, has now set up Abundance, wherein you can invest in renewable energy projects, via a debenture, which pays you back your share of the profits as it goes along, and commits to repaying the full sum in 20 or 25 years. The first time I heard him speak, two things ignited my interest: one, you could invest for a fiver.</p> <p>People with less to save than a typical ISA allowance (\u00a311,280, or half that for a cash ISA) are atmospherically excluded, and people on low incomes are excluded absolutely, from mainstream investments, and slowly we've seen the development of a knowledge-apartheid. Rich people talk about their investments all the time; everyone else assumes they don't understand investments and would need some kind of money sherpa to get anywhere near one. Stripping a project back to its fundamental principles amounts to democratising finance.</p> <p>Someone wants to build something; they need money; you agree with the building; you have money.</p> <p>Two, traditional investment houses would never go near a new, untested infrastructure project \u2013 say, for example, a windfarm \u2013 because it doesn't have the margins for a middleman to make a great deal of money without a lot of work. As a result, the whole of mainstream capital investment is geared towards industries that make the most money for people who don't want to have to do very much. It's not very forward thinking.</p> <p>Those are pragmatic reasons for finding an alternative investment route; Davis articulates a philosophical underpinning, a central debate \u2013 \"Should we, as individuals, take responsibility for ourselves? Or should we, as individuals, all work towards a situation that benefits all of us? The radical thing is to say that both those hypotheses can co-exist.\"</p> <p>Because windfarms generate such peculiarly strong feeling, both pro and anti, the conversation about whether they should be built at all often crowds out the debate about the possibilities for finance: that here might be unchartered territory, that hasn't already been divided between four juggernaut private companies. Abundance also does solar projects; since the infrastructure is more diffuse and low-profile, it's not such a dramatic way to illustrate the story, but it might turn out to be a less incendiary route into this territory.</p> <p>Arguably, though, if you have a lot of money, and you do know your way around finance, there are easier, quicker ways to make more money than by investing in a renewables project. You could probably make a fortune shorting the euro. You could buy futures in some or other carbon based energy, whose price will rise until it runs out. In choosing a different model for investment, you're accepting, as Davis puts it, \"that your return might not entirely be in terms of money\". This sort of talk, around long-term investments that you might be using instead of a pension, puts the wind up me a bit \u2013 the only real requirement I have of long-term saving is that it's safe as houses, otherwise there's no point doing it.</p> <p>Yet, I know people who lost their life savings in 2008; I know pensioners whose investments yield less their allotments, because of the hit annuity rates have taken; I know people who can't retire until the situation improves. And I'm not even that old. Nothing is as safe as houses anymore, not even houses \u2013 so a decision to invest in something worthwhile is a sort of financial Pascal's wager. We don't know what things will look like in 25 or 30 years; we don't know if wind will have outstripped conventional energy; we don't know if normal finance will have recovered its equilibrium. But if you take a bet on doing something you believe in, at least you'll have done something you believe in.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Manchester is going to be even lovelier than usual this Friday, 21 September, when the local branch of Friends of the Earth joins other leading cities all over the world in marking <a href=\"http://parkingday.org/\">International Park(ing) Day</a>.</p> <p>This is a bright idea which sees the temporary transformation of metered parking bays into mini-parks whose design encourages green activists to run gentle but imaginative riot. Participants can use real or artificial grass, plants, portable ponds, beach sand, deckchairs and anything else which makes a small oasis of countryside in the middle of town.</p> <p>It coincides with the pan-European In Town Without My Car Day, highlighted in Sarah Hartley's <em>Guardian Northerner</em> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/sep/17/leeds-transport-metro-bus-culturevulture\">post on Monday.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396393401\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/2/19/1329675948590/Bradford-City-Park-water--002.jpg\" alt=\"Bradford City Park water feature\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradford's getting it right, with a mirror pool and fountains.

That's open until the end of the month.</p> <p>The point of the day is to open people's eyes to how much better a place such as Manchester would be with fewer spaces for cars and more for greenery. Thompson says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the last 50 years our cities have been developed to make more and more space for the car. Supermarkets and malls, with massive car parks, have often overpowered local businesses in city locations. At the same time our streets have become noisy, polluted and unpleasant - these policies have high costs in terms of air pollution, congestion and health.</p> <p>Imagine if our cities had fewer spaces for cars and more room for people.&#xa0;We are inviting people to help us make&#xa0;parking spaces more sociable, fun and colourful.

  "<p>Let's talk about work ethos. If you have been in both German and British and/or American workplaces, please give us your experiences in the comment thread below.</p> <p>By way of introduction to the topic, I meet Sebastian \u2013 not his real name \u2013 for a sandwich in the Goethestrasse in downtown Frankfurt. He is a German in his mid 30s, who worked for an American firm for many years before moving to one of the major German banks.</p> <p>\"In the American company,\" he says, \"I could go to my boss and tell him: look, I need a decision from you about this or that. Ten or 20 minutes later, I would have his decision. In my German bank: no way. We call this the <em>Gremien</em> \u2013 decision-making by committee or council. It's not so much about the procedures, but seems more like a kind of fear of upsetting other members of the <em>Gremien</em>.</p> <p>\"Obviously, this makes German organisations that much slower. It's less clear who has authority over what, and who is responsible when things go wrong.</p> <p>\"In my American company, I would know exactly what my bonus was: it depended on the extent that I had met or exceeded my targets; in my German bank, I have no idea, not really, how they arrive at my bonus figure. It's vague and discretionary, so partly based on what my superiors decide rather than cold numbers. Indeed, I don't even really know what my targets are. You see, this creates a very different office culture.</p> <p>\"Job security is another thing. If you didn't meet your targets in my American company, you got a warning; another one and then you were 'let go'. My bank is very different, as my job is much better protected. I suppose the American or Anglo-Saxon system suited me very well when I was younger, very eager and without a family. Now that I'm a father I ask myself, what if I fall ill? What if my partner falls ill and needs my care? The German system is much more based on solidarity. Is that word even used in English?</p> <p>\"What's very important is that I am in retailing, the side of banking to do with deposits, payments, current accounts for individual clients. Our bonuses don't swing with the economic cycle. So even though my bank's earnings had a rollercoaster ride over the past five years, my bonus has been more or less the same every year.</p> <p>\"There is a deep divide between the investment bankers (financial markets, deal-making) and us in retail. In my division, there are maybe a handful of people going all out for their career. Everybody knows who they are. It's quite noticeable: projecting this image of availability to superiors, like, 'You can ask me anything, any time. Come in for a call at 9.30pm, no problem.' Everyone else is having their career, but not at all costs. Many just seem to have a proper 'work-life balance': happy where they are, with their families having equal claims on them. I still live in the hope that I can have a rock-star career as well as a fulfilling family life, in parallel.</p> <p>\"Nobody I know sends his children to private schools. So yes, there is not the school-fee trap that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2011/sep/26/capitalism-banking-blog-computer-programmer\" title=\"\">London bankers talk about on your blog</a>.</p> <p>\"There has been a housing boom of sorts for a while in Frankfurt, and rents are going up while salaries stay flat. I know of some people in our neighbourhood who have had to move. And many individual shop owners have to give way to the big brands who have so much more spending power. But it's not in any way like the bubble in London. So no mortgage-trap for bankers either, not to that extent. Compared with what's happening elsewhere, I realise we have every reason to be grateful, here in Frankfurt.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/sep/19/occupy-the-global-brand-mainstream\" title=\"\">The Occupy movement</a>? I have a lot of sympathy for them, but I often find that they do not sufficiently know their stuff. Also, I wonder about the claim of speaking on behalf of the 99%. There was a piece in one of our papers today about Occupy Wall Street, and how its anniversary attracted 300 people. That's not a whole lot. So they'd be better off stating maybe that they are speaking behalf of the 25% instead \u2013 far less catchy, but then far more realistic. They're a good marketing success but shallow. It's hard to get to their substance.</p> <p>\"Some time ago Occupy staged a day of 'Blockupy' across Germany, where they would try to stop bankers from going to work. That was seen as a credible threat inside my bank. We were even advised to dress down that day, not look like a banker. Ha ha!</p> <p>\"If the Occupy people say that the financial system will go through fundamental change sooner rather than later \u2026 well, change begins with a sense of urgency. I don't sense any of that in my bank at the moment.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The banker interviewed in this article will be coming into the thread below, so please feel free to direct your questions at him</em></p>",
  "<p>Untouchable, an odd-couple comedy about a quadriplegic millionaire and his ex-con caregiver, has been selected as France's official submission for next year's foreign language film Oscar. Directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, the movie has become the highest-grossing French production ever, earning more than $360m at the global box office. It was distributed in the US by the Weinstein Company, which scored Oscar success earlier this year with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/22/the-artist-film-review\" title=\"\">The Artist</a>.</p> <p>Untouchable was selected by a seven-member committee that includes Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, president of the Cannes film festival, ahead of the 1 October submissions deadline. But in opting for a populist choice, the committee has snubbed a number of other, more critically acclaimed candidates \u2013 most notably Jacques Audiard's hard-hitting Cannes contender Rust and Bone. Audiard's previous film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129970/prophet\" title=\"\">A Prophet</a>, received an Oscar nomination in 2010 but lost to the Argentinian thriller The Secret in Their Eyes.</p> <p>This year's best foreign language film Oscar was won by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/30/a-separation-review\" title=\"\">A Separation</a>, an Iranian drama directed by Asghar Farhadi. Untouchable opens in the UK this Friday.</p>",
  "<p>November is likely to be chilly, yet there could be a little warmth flowing in the direction of stock market traders should the Bank of England inject a further \u00a350bn of new, freshly printed money into the economy, as looks increasingly likely.</p> <p>The stock market likes nothing better than cheap funds to play with when there is little in the real economy to get excited about.</p> <p>Most economists seem to think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/19/bank-england-mpc-minutes-quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">the latest minutes from the central bank's monetary policy committee</a>, released on Wednesday morning, show its quantitative easing (QE) programme will rise from \u00a3375bn to \u00a3425bn when the current spending spree is completed in two months time.</p> <p>QE involves the central bank buying government bonds from high street banks, insurers and other financial companies in the hope they lend the money to businesses or buy shares in corporate Britain via the stock market.</p> <p>A debate over whether QE has run out of steam seems to be heading down a blind alley. While the government sits on its hands, fearful of a bond market backlash against any hint of spending, the Bank of England's QE programme is the only game in town.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce wants the bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, to spend the money more imaginatively, but recognises QE's supporters are more numerous and influential.</p> <p>David Kern, chief economist at the BCC, points out that there is clearly a sense of momentum inside the MPC and the financial markets are expecting a QE increase sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Expectations are important to central banks and having built up the expectation of more QE, MPC members will be loath to disappoint.</p> <p>Kern said monetary easing by the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan will probably reinforce pressures for an increase.</p> <p>\"But we still think the MPC should be cautious and refrain from adding to QE unless the UK financial system faces new threats due to developments in the eurozone. It is important that additional QE is not used to limit falls in inflation over the next year, as a temporary fall below the 2% target would support demand.\"</p> <p>Kern view is reflected across much of industry and there are some supporters inside Threadneedle Street who are sympathetic to the idea that QE has run its course and now is the time for something else.</p> <p>However, QE has one little discussed benefit: it pushes down the value of the pound. And maybe we are witnessing a race to the bottom by the world's major currencies. Is a cheaper currency a key policy objective?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/19/japan-asset-purchases-global-demand-china\" title=\"\">Overnight the Bank of Japan added to its own QE policy</a>. Ostensibly the plan is to keep money flowing around the world's banking system. Another view says it is part of a desperate fight to prevent the yen inflating against the dollar after the Fed said it would start QE3 using $50bn a month until the US economy improves.</p> <p>The dollar rose 14% during the summer while the pound fell 11% and the euro 16% against a basket of currencies. The yen is up 50% against the dollar since the financial crash.</p> <p>Simon Smith, chief economist at currency dealer FxPro, points out that the Fed's plan is killing Japanese exporters and the BoJ could be forced to continue printing yen to counter the Fed's QE3.</p> <p>If exporting is the answer to flat domestic demand, then a lower currency is a key to unlocking foreign markets.</p> <p>The trouble is that if everyone is fighting the same battle using the same tools, it becomes fruitless. Everyone ends up back where they started, though with hundreds of billions of extra currency swashing around the financial system.</p>",
  "<p>In Europe, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\" title=\"\">crisis</a> continues to be felt by many. We are taking important decisions but we have not yet convinced citizens, markets or our international partners. Doubts persist over whether some countries are ready to reform and others are ready to show solidarity.</p> <p>Europe needs a new direction. Europe needs new thinking.</p> <p>This means accepting that we are all in the same boat. We must leave no doubt that we are determined to stick together and reform together to achieve the scale and efficiency needed to be a relevant global player and safeguard our values in a changing world.</p> <p>First, we need growth. In many member states, this means structural reforms that have been postponed for decades. At the European level, we need to be more decisive about breaking down barriers, whether physical, economic or digital. And we need to agree an EU budget adequate to meet the challenges of investment, growth and reform.</p> <p>Reform will only work if it is \u2013 and is seen as being \u2013 fair. In some parts of Europe we are seeing a real social emergency. I do not agree with those who say that the European social model is dead. An effective welfare protection system that helps those in need is not a hindrance to prosperity.</p> <p>Across the EU, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/18/eurozone-crisis-spain-debt?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">reform and consolidation measures are being implemented</a>. Joint financial backstops are being put in place, and the European Central Bank has consistently shown that it stands by the euro. We have a chance this autumn to come to a turning point on Greece. If Greece stands by its commitments it should stay in the euro.</p> <p>The crisis has shown the clear need to complete the economic and monetary union. The stability of the single currency is in the interests of those who use it and those who do not.</p> <p>The crisis has shown that when banks became transnational, rules and oversight remained national. Then when things went wrong, taxpayers had to pick up the bill. This week we have proposed a <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/12/953\" title=\"\">single supervisory mechanism for the euro area</a>. This is a huge step towards a banking union.</p> <p>This supervisory system in the euro area will be led by the European Central Bank. This is logical. Fourteen of the 17 national supervisors in the euro area today are already central banks, and indeed the UK is moving now to give these tasks to the Bank of England.</p> <p>The single supervisory mechanism will strengthen, not divide, the single market. The single rulebook, the substantive rules on bank capital requirements and so on, will be agreed by all 27 member states, with the UK continuing to play a leading role. It is worth remembering that the UK has never been outvoted on a financial markets measure. Better application of the common rules within the euro area has to be good news for the stability and safety of financial markets across the EU.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.eba.europa.eu/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">European Banking Authority</a>, based in London, will keep all its powers to solve disputes and uphold single market rules also vis-\u00e0-vis the ECB. There will be changes to the EBA voting system to ensure that decision-making is balanced and ensure a fair say for everyone, whether they are in the euro area or not. No one is more committed than the European commission to making sure no new walls are built in the EU.</p> <p>Alongside more integration, we also need more democracy at European level. This is best achieved by a strengthening of the European parliament and the emergence of real European political parties and a real space for a European debate among citizens. This will be helped if all the European political parties present their candidate for the post of commission president at the European parliament elections in 2014.</p> <p>A stronger EU also means having more clout globally. The appalling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/sep/19/syria-crisis-iran-visits-damascus-live\" title=\"\">situation in Syria</a> reminds us that we cannot afford to be bystanders. Standing together brings us greater influence over what happens in our global backyard.</p> <p>I have said that we will need more shared sovereignty in a way that each country and each citizen are better equipped to control their own destiny. This is about the union with the member states, not against the member states. In the age of globalisation pooled sovereignty means more power, not less. So when I call for a federation of nation states, it should not be seen as a threat to national democracies. As a former prime minister of my own country, I certainly do not want to see a European superstate. I believe in a Europe where people are proud of their nations, but also proud to be European.</p> <p>We must concentrate European action on the real issues that matter and must be dealt with at the European level. Proper integration is about taking a fresh look at where is the most appropriate level of action. <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/subsidiarity_en.htm\" title=\"\">Subsidiarity</a> is an essential democratic concept and should be practised.</p> <p>Europe also has to be more democratic. Before the next European parliament elections in June 2014, the commission will present its ideas on the future European union. We will put forward explicit ideas for treaty change so that when people go to the polls they can take an informed view on where they want to see Europe heading.</p> <p>Deeper integration is indispensable for the countries who share the euro as their common currency. It should also be open to \u2013 but not forced on \u2013 other member states. I strongly believe that we must not allow the populists and the nationalists to set a negative agenda on Europe. I urge all those who call themselves Europeans \u2013 not least in the UK \u2013 to stand up and take the initiative.</p> <p>We face enormous challenges. But previous generations have overcome bigger ones. Now it is for this generation to show they are up to the task.</p>",
  "<p>Japan has effectively abandoned a commitment to end its reliance on nuclear power by 2040 amid pressure from the country's business lobby, dropping a deadline recommended by a cabinet panel only days ago.</p> <p>The cabinet on Tuesday gave only a vague endorsement of the panel's report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/japan-end-nuclear-power\" title=\"\">released last Friday</a>, and dropped any mention of plans to complete the phase-out some time in the 2030s.</p> <p>The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, acknowledged that meeting the target date could prove impossible.</p> <p>\"Whether we can become nuclear free by the 2030s is not something to be achieved only with a decision by policy-makers,\" he said. \"It also depends on the will of [electricity] users, technological innovation and the environment for energy internationally in the next decade or two.\"</p> <p>The U-turn came after sustained pressure from business and industry leaders, who said the move would harm the economy by forcing firms to shift production overseas due to the high price of imported oil and gas.</p> <p>The panel's recommendation was based on a two-month public consultation on Japan's future energy mix, in which the no-nuclear option proved far more popular than two other choices that involved a limited role for nuclear.</p> <p>Instead, the cabinet said it would take the policy document \"into consideration\" and listen to the views of the public, the nuclear industry, businesses, and communities that depend on atomic facilities for jobs.</p> <p>The energy review was ordered after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi power plant in March 2011 shook public confidence in the safety of nuclear power plants.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Katsuya Okada, said ditching the deadline did not mean the government had abandoned its goal of a nuclear-free future.</p> <p>\"We aim to have zero nuclear power by the 2030s, but we have never said we will achieve zero by that date,\" he told a group of European journalists. But he conceded that a nuclear phase-out was \"the wish of a large number of Japanese people\".</p> <p>Data released last month showed <a href=\"http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120823p2a00m0na010000c.html\" title=\"\">90% of comments solicited from the public during the consultation favoured the abolition of nuclear power</a>, while only 4% wanted it to remain part of the country's future energy mix.</p> <p>Okada said the government had to consider the rising cost of power production many predict will result from the phase-out and a greater dependence on fossil fuels, as well as their impact on Japan's climate change commitments.</p> <p>The report says Japan should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 20% from 1990 levels and to reduce energy consumption through greater efficiency by about 10% from 2010 levels.</p> <p>The plan also calls for renewable energy to comprise about 30% of Japan's future energy mix and the development of sustainable ways to use fossil fuels.</p> <p>All but two of Japan's nuclear 50 reactors have been shut down to undergo safety checks ordered after last year's earthquake and tsunami disaster triggered the world's worst nuclear accident for 25 years.</p> <p>Two nuclear plants under construction have been given permission to restart; the 40-year limit on the lifetime of nuclear reactors means those plants could remain in operation until the early 2050s.</p> <p>Japan depended on nuclear for about 30% of its electricity before the accident, and had plans to increase its share to 50%.</p> <p>Anti-nuclear campaigners criticised the launch on Wednesday of a new nuclear regulatory authority, whose predecessor was blamed for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/05/japanese-cultural-traits-fukushima-disaster\" title=\"\">being part of a culture that contributed to the Fukushima disaster</a>.</p> <p>Kazue Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan said that by appointing people to the body who were \"heavily involved\" in nuclear power generation, \"the government is once again setting up the regulator for failure and endangering the health and safety of Japan's people and its economy\".</p>",
  "<p>Britain's scrutiny of multilateral development institutions has contributed significantly to improved transparency and in achieving value for money in the government's aid effort, a government watchdog said on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/1213/multilateral_aid_review.aspx?utm_source=Feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=naoorguk\" title=\"\">A national audit office (NAO) report</a> said the Department for International Development's (<a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">DfID</a>'s) 2011 multilateral aid review, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/09/aid-review-targets-multilateral-agencies\" title=\"\">which assessed 43 organisations</a> that accounted for \u00a33.6bn in 2011-12, was valuable in providing accountability to UK taxpayers and in promoting reform in the multilateral organisations themselves.</p> <p>\"By conducting a review of the money it spends through multilateral agencies, the department has taken a big step towards improving the value for money it gets from these funds,\" said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO. \"To maintain this progress, the department needs to collaborate with other donor countries to encourage further consistently measurable performance improvements in multilateral organisations.\"</p> <p>The positive findings should provide some political cover for DfID when its budget is under intense scrutiny in such austere times. Justine Greening, a former accountant who took over from Andrew Mitchell as development secretary, has launched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/17/dfid-spending-consultants-scrutiny\" title=\"\">an internal review of the department's spending on technical experts</a>, following media reports that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545584/Poverty-barons-who-make-a-fortune-from-taxpayer-funded-aid-budget.html\" title=\"\">DfID is paying hundreds of millions of pounds to a group of primarily UK-based consultants</a>.</p> <p>The UK aid watchdog, the <a href=\"http://icai.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Independent Commission on Aid Impact</a>, also plans to investigate DfID's use of contractors. The coalition government has committed to increase international aid to 0.7% of gross national income next year, despite budget cuts, to the displeasure of some Conservatives. The commitment means that <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/News/Press-releases/2012/Provisional-UK-Official-Development-Assistance-as-a-proportion-of-Gross-National-Income-2011/\" title=\"\">DfID's total spending (estimated at \u00a38.5bn in 2011)</a> is set to increase in real terms by 27% between 2010-11 and 2014-15.</p> <p>On DfID's multilateral aid review, the NAO said the department had shown international leadership in publicly assessing multilateral organisations, such as the European Development Fund and the International Labour Organisation, against a common set of criteria, and rating their performance. The NAO said the review has influenced some donors' approaches to assessing and reporting on multilateral performance. Australia has used similar methods and the Netherlands has publicly reported its assessments for the first time.</p> <p>But separate donor reviews created administrative burdens and costs for multilateral organisations, the NAO cautioned, so they should be used as a stepping stone to joint assessments. Seventeen of the multilateral institutions told the NAO of the burden of engaging with separate reviews by individual countries.</p> <p>DfID designed its review framework to apply to a broad range of organisations but some found it difficult to review all the evidence requirements, the NAO said. The focus on demonstrable development impacts was important but organisations involved in setting standards found it more difficult to provide the evidence to score well.</p> <p>Moreover, international agreements limit how much DfID can change its funding. The UK contributes to EU development programmes through its treaty obligation to the EU budget, and it must also make a minimum payment as a condition of membership of some UN organisations it rated as \"poor\" value for money. It is important, therefore, that it has co-ordinated, up-to-date plans on how it will use the review to boost improvements in each organisation, the NAO said.</p> <p>The review rated nine organisations as \"very good\" value for money for UK aid, 16 as \"good\", nine as \"adequate\" and nine as \"poor\". DfID has already announced funding increases to those it rated as offering better value for money and that it will cease to fund four of those it rated as \"poor\" value for money for UK aid. Funding to those organisations it rated as good or very good will increase from 74% of the total in 2010-11 to 77% in 2014-15.</p> <p>DfID welcomed the NAO report and said it was prepared to take tough action on laggards. \"We are determined to get even better value for money and more effective aid from multilateral agencies and we stand ready to take tough action \u2013 decreasing or stopping financial commitments \u2013 if poorer performers are not making the reforms they need to,\" said a DfID spokesperson.</p> <p>But some development experts expressed caution about such a mechanistic approach. \"We do not disengage from conflict or failing states,\" said Simon Maxwell, an adviser to the parliamentary international development committee. \"We should not disengage from institutions like Unido [UN Industrial Development Organisation], but work more closely with them.\"</p> <h2>Organisations rated as very good value for money for UK aid</h2> <p>Asian Development Fund, EU Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, European Development Fund, Gavi Alliance, Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, International Committee of the Red Cross, World Bank's International Development Association, Private Infrastructure Development Group, Unicef.</p> <h2>Organisations rated as poor value for money for UK aid</h2> <p>UN Industrial Development Organisation, UN Development Fund for Women, International Organisation for Migration, International Labour Organisation, Food and Agriculture Organisation, UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, UN Human Settlements Programme, Commonwealth Secretariat.</p> <h2>Organisations DfID said it would stop giving core funding</h2> <p>UN Human Settlements Programme, UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, International Labour Organisation, UN Industrial Development Organisation.</p>",

  "<p>Companies are in a bind. The pressure is on them to become sustainable, but they know they can't do it alone. Sure, they can cut energy use, reduce waste, limit water consumption and generally create a spick-and-span, eco-tastic chain of production. But they need consumers on board too. Why? Because a chunk of their environmental impacts occur when their products get into our mitts. And therein lies the bind. We, the consumer, do what we like. We're free to choose. Not that we're beyond being influenced. Make sustainability easy, normal and fun, and we should buy into it. That's the idea, at least.</p> <p>In the third in a series of discussions supported by Unilever, Guardian Sustainable Business gathered together experts to discuss how companies can help make sustainability \"just living\". The panel included Cheryl Hicks, team leader for sustainable lifestyles at UNEP/Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Production and Consumption (CSCP); Freya Williams, group planning director at OgilvyEarth; David Jones, global CEO at Havas and co-founder of One Young World; Fergus Lowe, professor in psychology at Bangor University; Mark Earls, author of Herd; Stefano Giolito, director, sustainability at Unilever; Dr Mark Cobain, global new business director at Unilever.</p> <h2>Moving with the tide</h2> <p>Changing habits isn't easy. That said, the trends augur well for a shift to sustainable living. We, the people, are broadly in favour. Lifestyles with less wastage and lower environmental impacts strike us as, well, not unreasonable. Cheryl Hicks, a sustainable consumption expert, pointed to \"mounting evidence\" of more sustainable ways of living in Europe. The watchwords for future lifestyles are \"efficient\" (ie wasting less), \"different\" (\"a shift in preferences from quantity and ownership to access and quality\") and \"sufficient\" (\"conscious efforts to consume less\").</p> <p>David Jones, chief executive of media group Havas, echoed that optimistic note. Today's youth hold the key, he reckoned. Their desire to change the world and their social media savviness mean they have the desire and, more importantly, the ability to reward sustainable companies. Indeed, it could be said that we're on the verge of a \"generational shift\", where irresponsible become viewed as \"socially unacceptable\". At least, so thinks Freya Williams, director of strategy at OgilvyEarth. Look at NikeFuel. All of a sudden, good living is \"fun, cool and visible\", she observed.</p> <h2>Dos and don'ts</h2> <p>Unilever's Mark Cobain emphasised ease over entertainment. Making sustainability fun is fine; making it easy is essential. Anything that takes undue time or requires extra thought turns online shoppers off, he argued. In other words, the simpler, the better. Similarly, he advocated easing people into new behaviours. Shock doctrine and sustainable living don't mix. It's unrealistic to expect a season car driver to swap their gas-guzzler for a pedal bike. But buy a hybrid or join a car-sharing club \u2013 now that borders on the possible.</p> <p>However, just because the zeitgeist is green, doesn't mean the future will be, too. Some tips on how not to mess it up. First, don't preach. Boring facts about healthy eating have never stopped a child scoffing down a doughnut, suggested Fergus Lowe, professor in psychology at Bangor University. Far better is a systematic approach based on fun, rewards and peer influence, such as the the Food Dudes programme. Secondly, don't price eco-products too high. Making sustainability the expensive option is a ticket to failure, argued Williams. Normalise the price, she insisted. Thirdly, package eco offerings as regular fare. Consumers, by and large, like the mainstream. Niche, we're not so sure about. So best to ditch the \"green\" labels.</p> <h2>Big up brand power</h2> <p>Of course, none of us are really entirely free to choose. We're targeted by messages day in, day out. Like it or not, many of those come from big brands. For individuals to adopt sustainable lifestyles, our good intentions need to be translated into practical actions, says Unilever's Stefano Giolito. Brands embody values and aspirations, so they should do what they do best: make great (and preferably sustainable) products, and then use their brand power to get people using them. The success of such a strategy will be born from marketing simplicity, added Hicks. \"Brand strategists hold the unique skills to distil complex issues and ideas down to something that people will understand, remember, and act upon.\"</p> <h2>Legislating for change </h2> <p>There is another option of course. Regarding the car to bike idea mentioned earlier, legislators could simply issue a blanket ban on the combustion engine, although that's unlikely to happen any time soon. Even so, a case can be made for law-making as the \"fastest and most effective\" towards changing behaviour. David Jones argued exactly that. Consider smoking: \"Who would have though just a decade ago that it would be now illegal to smoke in most bars and restaurants in the major capitals?\" he asked. So too with CFCs and car emissions. \"If you legislate, it works\". But does it? Bangor University's Lowe wondered how you would legislate for a child to like broccoli. Laws are good at stopping us from certain actions, but weak at initiating us in others. Mark Earls, author of the book Herd, points to the example of a tax on fizzy drinks in New York. Such a measure may eventually skew the market towards healthier beverages, \"but it will not work for everyone, nor will its impact be equal in all locations or amongst all demographics\".</p> <p>Other, less blunt tools are needed. Unilever's Mark Cobain had a suggestion. He'd like to see the creation of supportive environments, where sustainable living is easy (easier than unsustainable living, that is). Hicks agreed. She gave the example of sustainable cities. Legislators are important, of course. They set planning rules and CO2 targets. But we need the engineers, designers and architects to put these into effect. Once a sustainable infrastructure is in place, options like public transport or off-peak electricity use become straightforward for Joe Public.</p> <h2>Pulling the celeb card</h2> <p>Like everything else these days, if the sensible stuff (see above) doesn't work, then you can call in a celebrity. Take Matt Damon's work on water conservation. Celebs, like brands, have a massive opportunity to be a positive force of change, said Unilever's Giolito. But fame without feelings may no longer be quite good enough. As Havas's Jones concluded: \"Authenticity is becoming way more important than image\". Proof, indeed, that change is thankfully possible.</p> <p><strong>This article forms part of </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/letstalksustainableliving\" title=\"\"><strong>Let's talk sustainable living</strong></a><strong>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-living\" title=\"\"><strong>sustainable living</strong></a><strong> mainstream.

  "<p>Food is one of society's key sensitivities to climate. A year of not enough or too much rainfall, a hot spell or cold snap at the wrong time, or extremes, like flooding and storms, can have a significant effect on local crop yields and livestock production. While modern farming technologies and techniques have helped to reduce this vulnerability and boost production, the impact of recent droughts in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/25/drought-higher-food-prices\">USA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/al975e/al975e00.pdf\">China</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/09/russian-drought-wheat-prices\">Russia</a> on global cereal production highlight a glaring potential future vulnerability. </p> <p>There is some evidence that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/21/what-is-climate-change\">climate change</a> is already having a measurable affect on the quality and quantity of food produced globally. But this is small when compared with the significant increase in global food production that has been achieved over the past few decades. Isolating the influence of climatic change from all the other trends is difficult, but one recent <a href=\"http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/23214/policy_brief_trends11.pdf\">Stanford University study</a> found that increases in global production of maize and wheat since 1980 would have been about 5% higher were it not for climate change. </p> <p>All else being equal, rising carbon dioxide concentrations \u2013 the main driver of climate change \u2013 could increase production of some crops, such as rice, soybean and wheat. However, the changing climate would affect the length and quality of the growing season and farmers could experience increasing damage to their crops, caused by a rising intensity of droughts, flooding or fires. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter5.pdf\">latest IPCC report</a> predicted improving conditions for food production in the mid to high latitudes over the next few decades, including in the northern USA, Canada, northern Europe and Russia. Conversely, parts of the subtropics, such as the Mediterranean region and parts of Australia, and the low latitudes, could experience declining conditions. For example, across Africa, yields from rain-fed agriculture could decline by as much as 50% by 2020. Beyond this, if global temperatures rise by more than about 1\u20133\u00b0C, declining conditions could be experienced over a much larger area. </p> <p>The future course of global food production will depend on how well societies can adapt to such climatic changes, as well as the influence of other pressures, such as the competition for land from biofuel production. The IPCC <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter5.pdf\">concluded</a> that in the poorer, low-latitude countries, climate change could seriously challenge the capacity to adapt for a warming of more than 3\u00b0C. The richer, higher latitude countries are likely to have a greater capacity to adapt and exploit changing climatic conditions.</p> <p>But we can't ignore the potential for \"surprises\" down the line. There are many uncertainties in such predictions. The world has not seen such changes in climate for millennia, and so it is impossible to know how our agricultural systems will react in the real world. For example, the complex interlinkages with the impacts of climate change on pests, diseases and pollinators, like bees, are largely unknown. Also, climate models have difficulty in accurately predicting the detailed local environmental changes that are important for food production, particularly weather extremes.</p> <p>A looming vulnerability is the world's <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/13789/en\">fisheries</a>, which provide an important source of protein for at least half the world's population. Fisheries are already stressed by overexploitation and pollution. Warming surface waters in the oceans, rivers and lakes, as well as sea level rise and melting ice, will adversely affect many fish species. Some marine fish species are already adapting by migrating to the high latitudes, but others, such as Arctic and freshwater species, have nowhere to go. The absorption of carbon dioxide emissions by the oceans also has a direct impact on marine ecosystems through ocean acidification. </p> <p>But what does this mean for food security \u2013 the price and availability of food for the world's seven billion people? A <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/food-and-farming/11-546-future-of-food-and-farming-report.pdf\">2011 Foresight report</a> concluded that climate change is a relatively small factor here, at least in the short term, when compared with the rapid increases in global food demand expected in the next decade. On <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/wpp/Other-Information/Press_Release_WPP2010.pdf\">current projections</a>, by 2050 there will be between one and three billion additional mouths to feed. As people become wealthier, they also demand more food and disproportionally more meat, which requires far more land and water resources per calorie consumed. When these factors are combined, it points toward a future of increasing and more volatile food prices. </p> <p>As was seen during the 2007\u201308 food price spikes, the poorest countries and communities will be hit first and hardest. The <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/food-and-farming/11-546-future-of-food-and-farming-report.pdf\">Foresight report</a> concluded that international policy has an important role to play here \u2013 today, despite plentiful supplies of food globally, almost one billion people are undernourished. </p> <p>Finally, food production itself is a significant emitter of greenhouse gases, as well as a cause of environmental degradation in many parts of the world. Agriculture contributes <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/sites/default/themes/wri2009/favicon.ico\">about 15% of all emissions</a>, on a par with transport. When land conversion and the wider food system are taken into account the total contribution of food may be as high as 30%. This means that to limit the long-run impacts of climate change, food production must become not only more resilient to climate but also more sustainable and low-carbon itself.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was written by Nicola Ranger of the <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute\">Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment</a> at LSE in collaboration with the Guardian</em></p> <h2>The ultimate climate change FAQ</h2> <p>\u2022 This answer last updated: 10.07.12<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/05/ultimate-climate-change-faq\">Read about the project and suggest a question</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/09/climate-faq-report-error\">Report an error in this answer</a></p> <p><strong>Related questions</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/16/economic-impact-climate-change\">What is the economic cost of climate change?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/15/stern-review\">What is the Stern review?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/21/countries-responsible-climate-change\"> Which nations are most responsible for climate change? </a></p> <h2>This editorial is free to reproduce under Creative Commons</h2> <p><br>This post by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">The Guardian</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/uk/\">Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License</a>.<br>Based on a work at <a xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" rel=\"dc:source\">theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The BBC has confirmed plans to launch a new version of its iPlayer app for Android devices which will use its own BBC Media Player technology to securely stream audio and video.</p> <p>The technology, which was developed in-house at the BBC's Future Media division, is already being used for the mobile website version of iPlayer according to a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/09/media_player_android_phones_ta.html\">blog post</a> by executive product manager Chris Yanda.</p> <p>\"Next week we plan to release a new version of BBC iPlayer on Android which will use this player. Other applications and websites will follow,\" he writes, before telling Android owners that \"I want to reassure you that Android is an important platform for us\".</p> <p>If that sounds slightly defensive, the reason is critical comments posted on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/09/iplayer_mobile_downloads.html\">another BBC blog post</a> earlier in September, announcing an update to the iPlayer iOS app that included the ability to download shows to watch offline. </p> <p>Despite a promise that the feature would be added for Android \"soon\", a number of commenters criticised the BBC for not keeping the two versions of the iOS player app in sync for new features.</p> <p>Yanda addresses the criticism directly in his post, pointing out that the BBC needs to \"meet the security obligations we had agreed with our rights holders\", while working on Android devices running the Froyo and Gingerbread OS versions, through to the newest Jelly Bean incarnation.</p> <p>An added complication was Adobe's decision to stop supporting the Flash Player plug-in for Android earlier in 2012. \"In the end, Flash was still the best choice of media format for us to use. And the only practical technology for us to play this format back on Android is Adobe Air,\" writes Yanda.</p> <p>He sounds several notes of caution in the post, perhaps in an attempt to set people's expectations of the new app appropriately.</p> <p>\"No technology is perfect. We've seen some of the challenges that other Adobe Air based apps have had in the marketplace and so we have worked hard, both internally and with our technology partners to build the best application we can,\" he writes.</p> <p>The BBC isn't the only broadcaster that has faced challenges making TV services available across iOS and Android. BSkyB launched its original Sky Go app for Android in January 2012 for a selection of Android smartphones, seven months after the iOS app went live.</p> <p>In March 2011, BSkyB's general manager for mobile David Gibbs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/mar/08/sky-apps-iphone-android-blackberry-windows\">explained why Android was proving problematic</a> at the time for broadcasters:</p> <p>\"The big sticking point at the moment is security around streams,\" he told a London conference. \"We can't protect those streams to meet the obligations for our rightsholders. There will be a solution around September-time, but it's a challenge: we're optimising someone else's [DRM] solution and putting a wrapper around it.\"</p> <p>Android has moved on since then, but the quote remains the best explanation why companies like the BBC and BSkyB sometimes appear to be prioritising iOS over Android: their rights obligations often lead to them having to build bespoke technology in-house when making their content available on Google's platform.</p> <p>The important message, though, is that in 2012 Android is worth that effort and expense. In July 2012, <a href=\"http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/kwp_ftp/global/comtech/Kantar_Worldpanel_ComTech_Smartphone_OS_barometer_11_7_12.pdf\">Kantar Worldpanel ComTech claimed</a> that in the 12 weeks to 10 June, Android accounted for 57.2% of smartphone sales in the UK, well ahead of iPhone's 25.6% share.</p> <p>Mobile TV apps are very popular \u2013&#xa0;the BBC's iPlayer received 30m requests for shows from mobile and tablets in July 2012, which was 20% of iPlayer's total on all platforms.</p> <p>Enough of those new and existing Android users want to watch their favourite shows on their devices to make it a necessity for broadcasters to take the platform seriously \u2013&#xa0;whether for public-service reasons in the BBC's case, or commercial reasons in BSkyB's.</p>",

Modern contraception is effective in stopping unplanned pregnancy and is also highly cost effective. But it is simply useless if women are stopped from accessing and using it. A woman's reproductive years span over half of her lifetime and every reproductive choice she makes carries social, economic, and personal consequences.

There are over 20,000 volunteers within the UK online centres network so I've seen first hand just how huge an impact they can have - our network simply wouldn't run without them.

Yes the role of APs is crucial in protecting the public, and yes there are as many lows as highs. It's a serious role where at times we have to make difficult decisions and because of the nature of the people we work with we're often let down. Does this mean life in APs is doom, gloom and long faces? Not in our AP it's not. There's no point doing the job if we don't enjoy it. That, I guess, is why I tweet. To paint this balanced picture. And the beauty of Twitter\u2026. if it's not your cup of tea just click 'unfollow'!<br></p> </blockquote> <p><br>(link from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/russwebt\" title=\"\">Russell Webster</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ermintrude2\" title=\"\">Ermintrude</a>)</p> <p>\u2022 A charming interview with a <strong>teenage mother </strong>who is being supported by a children's centres young parents group in Shropshire. Claire, who discovered she was pregnant at 16, <a href=\"http://shropshirefamilyinfoblog.com/2012/09/18/being-a-young-mum/\" title=\"\">describes the stigma of being a young parent and her hopes for the future</a>. She says: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The best thing about being a young mum is the fact that I'm going to get to spend longer with my little boy and watch him grow up; yes I may not have lots of stories and experiences to share with him, but I still have some. People think that I am missing out on living my life but I am still so young that when my family has grown up, I will have all of the time in the world to do what I like.<br>... Another good thing about being a young parent is I feel like it OK for me to ask questions, I think that older mums feel like it is wrong to ask question, but at the end of the day no matter how old you are, having a baby is nothing like anything else so better to have as much information as you can.</p> </blockquote> <p>And she offers her advice to other young parents:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... talk to your partner and parents because they may surprise you \u2013 remember you're not on your own. It is OK to be scared because most new parents are whether they are 16 or 30.<br>Just make sure your baby is well loved and cared for, and everything else will fall into place. No parent is always right, things go wrong, that's life but how you handle it at the time will make you a good parent. When your child grows up and looks back they won't think 'My mum and dad were well young' they will think 'My mum and dad loved me'. There is no right way of bringing up a child because everyone is different. As long as you are happy and can say you did your best, you'll probably find that your child will be happy.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> (link from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katebentham\" title=\"\">Kate Bentham</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnpopham\" title=\"\">John Popham</a>)</p> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19638255\" title=\"\">Youth jobs plan is 'insufficient'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074659/edward-timpson-unveils-consultation-adoption-fostering-reforms\" title=\"\">Edward Timpson unveils consultation on adoption and fostering reforms</a> <br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2012/09/18/118535/staff-more-positive-about-cqc-but-bullying-concerns-emerge.html\" title=\"\">Staff more positive about CQC but 'bullying' concerns emerge</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scotland-could-not-afford-welfare-bill-says-iain-duncan-smith-8155990.html\" title=\"\">Scotland 'could not afford welfare bill', says Iain Duncan Smith</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106957\" title=\"\">Gap narrows between public and private sector pay</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/town-halls-will-be-able-to-compare-satisfaction-levels/\" title=\"\">Town halls 'will be able to compare satisfaction levels'</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9551305/Call-for-ban-on-disability-abortions-after-Paralympics.html\" title=\"\">Call for ban on disability abortions after Paralympics</a><br> \u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1150435/anonymous-donation-50000-gives-wiltshire-mind-second-chance/\" title=\"\">Anonymous donation of \u00a350,000 gives Wiltshire Mind a second chance</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>How can nature teach us to live in the 21st century? This was the question that was posed to a group of 35 primary school headteachers in Lancashire back in June last year.</p> <p>Their responses identified the importance of inter-connectivity. A big picture idea, but put simply meaning being part of something that was greater than just your own space and place. This important insight has contributed to a sustainability project that now stretches across the world - the idea of a <a href=\"http://www.pop-up-farm.com/\">pop-up farm</a>.</p> <p>Rather than take the children to farms to learn about growing food and sustainable practice, the farm could come to them. So each school has a special plotting shed or space where the teachers, parents and wider community can come together to decide how to bring sustainable living to their schools.</p> <p>The range of activity across the different places and projects has been remarkable. For example, within the first year every primary school in Burnley has established a food growing space. This will become, during the coming year, part of a combined yield site for the local network. Think of an allotment and then multiply by 34 and then connect it together across lots of different sites and you begin to get the picture. </p> <p>Many of the schools have planted fruit and nut orchards, schools have designed ingenious water capture mechanisms to irrigate the vegetable beds across the summer holidays, built greenhouses from waste materials, taken part in fitness and wellbeing programmes and began to embed the best practices arising from the projects into their curriculum.</p> <p>But the pop-up farm concept goes further than Burnley. It is a diverse community of people and organisations all interested in finding ways to resolve different challenges that modern life puts in front of them. So it is in effect, you and me, anywhere on the earth. To date, we have Pop-Up-Farm projects around the world, in widely differing settings and climates. This diversity guides our understanding of varied habitats and regions.</p> <p>In Burnley, our network of 35 schools is soon to grow to around 50 with new schools joining this year. In Hong Kong we have a partner permaculture project called Ark Eden and we have links with indigenous communities in Uluru/Ayers Rock in Australia plus Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. In Uganda we have created a network of Pop-Up-Farm schools linked with small and displaced farming communities. We also have other businesses involved from sport (Liverpool and Burnley FC), to corporations (Mott MacDonald), to fellow charitable organisations (<a href=\"http://www.seedsfordevelopment.org/\">Seeds for Development</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dropinthebucket.org/\">Drop in a Bucket</a>).</p> <p>Through the Ugandan farmers connection we have created a direct trade Thoughtful Coffee Company, for which children in Burnley have designed a cradle-to-cradle business model to trade commercially at the Burnley Football Club and generate revenue which will then be returned to our network schools in northern Uganda.</p> <p>Essentially though there is only one pop-up farm, we are all connected to it, wherever we might be located, our actions inform and guide its progress. Each participating school gathers ongoing learning and know-how and uses this to create meaningful metrics that report, measure and celebrate progress and identify areas of need. These recording, measuring and story-sharing systems are designed to be relevant to the needs and resources of each participant group: they can be financial supporters, schools, communities, businesses and individuals of every kind.</p> <p>Our research and development approach ensures that the model maintains a robust methodology which can inform and advance human activity anywhere in the world at a time of global ecological challenge. Our network evolves with the ideas it creates.</p> <p>It is a simple yet powerful, constantly finessing instrument that people can use to inform the move towards more sustainable lifestyles.</p> <p>As the many and varied Pop-Up-Foundation solutions start to develop, a set of patterns of activity have emerged. These patterns form the basic developmental material that serves as the template upon which we develop and grow our sustainable communities. To date it shows energy, waste, water, food, buildings and well being as central themes of interest.</p> <p>The pragmatism and effectiveness of this approach means that children, families and communities learn, take action, share knowledge and make rapid, measurable progress, whatever their initial circumstances.</p> <p>We recognise that shared learning, designing, creating, developing and reaping of outcomes enthrals, interests and energises people. This creates a powerful momentum for change, owned by everyone, grown by everyone.</p> <p>Our farms continue to pop up in unexpected places and are always practical and solution-driven. They demonstrate that many of the challenges we face are inter-connected and can be optimised for efficacy, spread and speed of growth. Using methods, tools and equipment that are cheap and accessible for all, whilst being suitable for small-scale application yet available across entire systems, we can move decisively towards a more sustainable future.</p> <p><em>Dr Paul Clarke is the co-founder (with Alison Hall) of the Pop-Up-Foundation and is also a professor of education at St Mary's University College, London.

  "<p>Scientology's legal representative <a href=\"http://www.scientologynews.org/sites/default/files/1-Jeff-Riffer-Re-David-Miscavige-to-Gaydon-Carter-16-Aug-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">wrote an eight-page letter of complaint to Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter</a> over the magazine's recent Tom Cruise expos\u00e9, calling it \"shoddy\", \"bigoted\" and potentially libellous.</p> <p>In the missive, dated 16 August, Jeffrey K Riffer of Elkins, Kalt, Weintraub, Reuben and Gartside LLP also denied suggestions the organisation's leader, David Miscavige, might have interfered in the Top Gun star's love life since the former was far too busy travelling and being \"the leader of a dynamic global religion expanding across five continents\" to get involved in such minor matters. Vanity Fair's article, written by Maureen Orth and published earlier this month, alleged Scientologist leaders held auditions to find the Top Gun star a new partner in the wake of his split from Nicole Kidman in 2001.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/05/tom-cruise-wife-audition-claims-denied\" title=\"\"> Cruise has subsequently denied the claims through a lawyer</a>.</p> <p>\"Ms Orth's implications are demonstrably false,\" argued Riffer in his emailed letter. \"If she had considered for a minute the respective travel and work demands placed on both Mr Miscavige and Mr Cruise, she would have dismissed outright this \"third wheel notion\" \u2026 Mr Miscavige is the leader of a dynamic global religion expanding across five continents. His duties are herculean and accomplishments monumental. He is not a 'third wheel' to anything or anyone.\"</p> <p>Vanity Fair's story further alleged that Miscavige's wife Shelly recruited Iranian-born British actor Nazanin Boniadi to date the Oscar-nominated actor in 2004 following an exhaustive month-long process during which the latter thought she was being \"audited\", one of Scientology's essential components, via video interview for a training film. The piece suggests Boniadi was later punished for revealing the relationship to a third party.</p> <p>\"These alleged events never occurred \u2013 and, no credible person has ever said that they did,\" countered Riffer. \"There are no authentic contemporaneous documents evidencing such events (because such events never occurred). To be absolutely clear, Mr Miscavige never videoed auditing sessions, never saw videos of auditing sessions (since there are no videos), never read session reports aloud (since there are no such reports), let alone ever used such information to 'manipulate' anyone.\"</p> <p>Riffer goes on to accuse Carter and Vanity Fair of religious bigotry towards Scientologists and accuses them of ignorance. \"Scientology is a new religion and its beliefs not as well known as those of more ancient history,\" the email continues. \"That does not excuse you or Ms Orth for being ignorant. Rather, it demands you be even more sensitive to finding out what the true beliefs are of Scientology \u2013 which can only be told by the religion itself. Just because you don't think you are bigoted doesn't mean you aren't. Bigotry and ignorance go hand in hand and you are definitely and wilfully ignorant of the actual beliefs of Scientology and the activities of its churches.\"</p> <p>Cruise and Scientology have been in the media spotlight lately due to the former's divorce from actor Katie Holmes and the US box-office success of the Paul Thomas Anderson Oscar contender, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146341/master\" title=\"\">The Master</a>, which features a protagonist based on Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard. Anderson has said his film is not about Scientology, but has admitted that Philip Seymour Hoffman's character Lancaster Dodd is partially drawn from Hubbard, as well as other figures.</p> <p>Riffer's letter appears to have been a shot across the bows, as it was sent prior to the Tom Cruise article's publication in the October issue of Vanity Fair earlier this month. It assumes that the magazine \"will not publish anything defamatory\" and hopes \"we will not need to meet at a deposition or in a court\". There is no suggestion that Scientology has in fact taken such legal action in the intermediate period.</p>",
  "<p>Yes, my heart sank when I first heard Thomas Wehner say that his aim was to turn Occupy into \"a global brand: one message, one logo, one feel\".</p> <p>Wehner is in his early 40s, a marketeer, social entrepreneur and active in Occupy Money in Frankfurt. I met him earlier this week on the top floor of the Galeria Kaufhof, a coffee shop with great views of the Frankfurt stock market and all the shiny glass skyscrapers. He had come with Hajo K\u00f6hn, a food and children's education consultant in his late 50s who founded Occupy Money Frankfurt. The third was Occupy Money's communications guy, a cheerful retiree who signs off his emails with \"mit occupierenden Gr\u00fc\u00dfen, Thomas Occupy\".</p> <p>So my heart sank when I first thought of Occupy as \"a global brand\". If yours did too, you can ask Wehner all about it because he is happy to respond to you in the comments.</p> <p>But Wehner has a compelling case, which perhaps K\u00f6hn summarised best: \"We need to go mainstream.\" The initial Occupy movement has had fantastic success in capturing the world's attention, he says. But it has remained a marginal phenomenon, and in many cities it has broken up into different factions. In Frankfurt there's now Occupy the camp, Occupy Frankfurt and Occupy Money \u2013 and you can tell from the way my three interlocutors talk about the other factions that amid all the \"great respect\" there are very real tensions.</p> <p>Let's not go there. Instead consider Wehner's analogy: \"Occupy must become like Greenpeace. A global player that the mainstream can support, with small monthly donations, with their time, or by joining a demonstration.\"</p> <p>The time is ripe, they all believe. Thomas Occupy says: \"People in Germany still have far too much trust in their banks. They think the bank wants what's best for them.\" At the same time the three detect widespread disillusion among financial insiders: \"The short-termism is nearing its end. One of our people is a top banker. He says he really doesn't want to live in a gated community. He doesn't want to send his children to some exclusive school. He doesn't want his society to become more like America.\"</p> <p>It's important to realise that Occupy emerged in the US in response to specifically American circumstances. For one, Germany does not have the same gap between the ultra-rich and the rest. \"In our Rhineland model it's not between the 1% and the 99%,\" he says. \"It's a nice slogan but there is a middle class in Germany. This is about protecting the middle class from finance.\"</p> <p>Also, he says, Occupy's assembly model of decision-making doesn't work. \"It's na\u00efve. We need to accept that there are people who will to try to sabotage what Occupy is doing, and by having this ultra-democratic decision-making process, that's what you get.\"</p> <p>Another example of a typically American feature that didn't travel well to Frankfurt was the way Occupiers would repeat what the person in front said \u2013 a way to avoid illegal megaphones and still reach those in the back. Says Thomas the communications guy: \"People here in Frankfurt were going: what are they doing? Is this a church?\"</p> <p>Occupy Money Frankfurt is working with economists, professors, lawyers, experts and anonymous financial insiders to build up expertise. It is also hoping to stage high-profile actions on the model of Greenpeace. One idea is to offer a prize for whistleblowers. \"Think of how Greenpeace captures the world's imagination with its spectacular actions at sea,\" says Wehner. \"We need undercover people inside the banks who can reveal what's really going on there.\"</p> <p>Says K\u00f6hn: \"Frankfurt is going to be the centre of European-wide regulation and banking supervision. Many bankers will be able to go over to the other side and become regulators. Frankfurt can become the centre for sustainable finance.\"</p> <p>In a sense Wehner himself is a good example of what Occupy as a mainstream brand could bring about. \"In my 20s I was pretty conservative, the sort of person who in the UK would read the Times. I was working as an advertising consultant for a big multinational corporation and we would laugh at the Green party and call them the sock-knitters.</p> <p>\"Slowly I changed. This spring Occupy held a six-months anniversary, and I took my wife and kids there. Everyone brought some food. It was quite lovely. A newspaper took a picture of my family, and the next day five or six people in our neighbourhood came up to me and said: great that you're doing this. It occurred to me just how strong the support is among middle-class people.</p> <p>\"By now I am really engaged. I want to help turn Occupy into a global brand, and I am convinced it can be done.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Put your own question or comment to Thomas Wehner and he will respond below</p>",
  "<p>One of the best gauges of cycling's ever-increasing popularity is the explosion of \"commuter\" clothing ranges, designed to be functional both on and off the bike.</p> <p>My instinctive reaction is often sceptical: if I'm riding quickly or a long distance, nothing beats cycling gear, but there's no reason why other trips can't be tackled in ordinary clothes. There's nothing specifically bike-unfriendly about, say, a pair of jeans.</p> <p>This attitude has been reinforced by some unexceptional early examples of the genre. A couple of years ago I was cautiously positive about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2010/mar/15/bspoke-cycling-menswear\">Bspoke range of in-the office/on-the-bike clothes</a>. In retrospect I don't think moleskin trousers with a generously cut, MC Hammer-style gusset are the future.</p> <p>But equally, I've been proved wrong. One of the most-worn items in my cycling wardrobe is a pair of ultra-light, sleek and supremely versatile <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/surface-liquistretch-shorts/\">shorts by Surface</a>, the clothing arm of the Charge bikes empire, equally at home in the saddle, on the beach or mooching round the house. I've been stopped several times at traffic lights by riders asking where to buy them. This isn't the sort of thing that usually happens to me.</p> <p>After that long introduction, down to business. I've been trying out examples from two new ranges which offer something of a contrast, not least in origin. One is the <a href=\"http://eu.levi.com/en_GB/commuter?cid=ps_ps-ongoing_goo_brand_10-2011_UK&amp;utm_source=PPC&amp;utm_medium=GOO_UK&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_UK_GOO_BRAND_COMMUTER&amp;utm_term=levi%27s%20commuter&amp;utm_distribution=search\">Commuter series from Levi's</a>, the clothing behemoth's entry into the cycling world. </p> <p>The other comes <a href=\"http://www.vulpine.cc/\">from Vulpine</a>, a tiny venture set up by a cycling-mad couple who left their jobs to pursue their dream.</p> <p>It's fair to say that this difference shows. The two items I tried from Levi's bear the hallmarks of things designed by a committee given, from on high, the brief: \"This cycling stuff seems quite trendy, how can we get on board?\" Inevitably, the range's website shows a very cool model holding up a narrow-handlebarred fixie, albeit with front and back brakes, probably on the advice of the company lawyers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396370348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347981229289/levis1_460.jpg\" alt=\"Levi's Commuter series jeans\" width=\"460\" height=\"376\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trousers from the Levi's Commuter series</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two most obvious innovations on <a href=\"http://eu.levi.com/en_GB/shop/products/male-Bottoms-Jeans-&amp;-Pants/Commuter-505-Straight-19106-0001.html?insearch=true\">the jeans I tried out</a> were on the same lines: an extra loop of fabric on the rear waistband from which to hang the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kryptonite-York-Fahgettaboudit-Mini-Lock/dp/B000OZ9VLU\">ubiquitous mini-Kryptonite lock</a>, and reflective seams on the inside, for rolling the trouser up the calf in the approved courier-style fashion. The slightly stiff, crinkly fabric is supposedly more resistant to water, stains and odours, but to me mainly felt a bit hot.</p> <p>I was even less impressed with the grey <a href=\"http://eu.levi.com/en_GB/shop/products/male-Tops-Shirts/Commuter-Shirt-65079-0001.html?insearch=true\">long-sleeved shirt</a>, which seemed equally boil-in-the-bag despite a breathable mesh strip at the top of the back, hidden with a neat seam, and small mesh patches under the arms.</p> <p>I think it's wonderful that cycling is now seen as sufficiently aspirational for such a vast company to want to hitch itself to the bandwagon. I'm just not hugely enthusiastic about the clothes. Worse still, the Commuter series is currently a men's range only. Maybe the Levi's focus groups forgot to mention that women also ride bikes.</p> <p>By contrast the Vulpine range is clearly a labour of love. Even the items I was less keen on were well thought out and beautifully made.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396370349\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347981413817/vulpine4_460.jpg\" alt=\"Vulpine cotton rain jacket\" width=\"460\" height=\"376\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vulpine cotton rain jacket</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The star was a <a href=\"http://www.vulpine.cc/Shop/All/All/COTTON-RAIN-JACKET/ITM1005\">lightweight cotton waterproof jacket</a> which managed the near-unique trick of being both fairly impermeable to water but reasonably breathable. Even if you don't like the slim, almost militaristic styling \u2013 I think it works very well \u00ad\u2013 you can appreciate details like a neat bum-guarding flap, tucked out of sight when not in use with a magnet, and the ultra-cosy rings of delicate fleece around the inner cuffs. Vulpine also do a thicker <a href=\"http://www.vulpine.cc/Shop/All/All/SOFTSHELL-JACKET/ITM1000\">softshell jacket</a>, which again looks well-made, even though the one I was sent ended up being too big to try out properly.</p> <p>I even \u2013 and these are words I never anticipated typing \u2013 liked <a href=\"http://www.vulpine.cc/Shop/All/All/COTTON-VISIBILITY-GILET/ITM1002\">the gilet</a>, a clothing item I've previously scorned. Slim-fitting and lightweight it makes short work of chilly mornings and takes almost no space in a bag.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.vulpine.cc/Shop/All/All/MERINO-BUTTON-JERSEY/ITM1003\">merino button jerseys</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vulpine.cc/Shop/All/All/MERINO-T-SHIRT/ITM1004\">crew-neck T-shirts</a> were slightly less to my taste, if undeniably sleek and comfy. I found them a bit too snug to resemble something you might wear to work, unless maybe you work in a gym.</p> <p>There is, of course, a catch. The Levi's range isn't cheap, but \u00a380 for a posh pair of jeans is not so exceptional these days. The Vulpine range is that bit more: \u00a3195 for the rain jacket, for example. </p> <p>It's almost pointless rehashing the arguments over such prices. At one extreme some ascetics affirm a pair of sellotaped bin bags provide sufficient rain protection and it is immoral to pay more; others think \u00a3200 is worth it for a well-made, comfy jacket which will get a number of years' use. </p> <p>The more relevant lesson, I'd argue, is this: the more a company appears to genuinely love and be obsessed by cycling, the better their cycling gear.</p>",
  "<p>For all his achievements, there is a brittleness to Roberto Mancini's temperament that can hardly fail to communicate itself to the players in his charge. So often the soul of suave charm, the Italian responds to moments of adversity by letting his irascibility show, and he was at it again on Tuesday night.</p> <p>His target was Joe Hart, who had been unwise enough to suggest in a post-match television interview that Manchester City should not have conceded three goals in the last quarter of an hour of their match against Real Madrid, particularly the pair, in the 87th and 90th minutes, that converted a 2-1 win into a 3-2 defeat.</p> <p>\"You can't go 2-1 up with five minutes to go and lose the game,\" Hart had told ITV in the immediate aftermath of the defeat. \"We dug deep, got a lead twice, and we lost it, so we can only blame ourselves. It's hard to come off the field after losing 3-2 and be positive. I'm really sorry. We're not a team that should come here and pat ourselves on the back for doing well. We're a team that gets results.\"</p> <p>Mancini's response was instant and astonishing in its ferocity. \"I agree but I think Joe Hart should do his job,\" he said. \"I can criticise the team, not Joe Hart. Joe Hart should stay as goalie. I am the judge, not Joe Hart.\"</p> <p>Many observers would believe that Hart's words were exactly the sort of thing one would want to hear from a player after such a stunning reverse. City deserved credit for going ahead twice in such an environment, but it would not have been right for the players to congratulate themselves. The England goalkeeper's words seem to indicate the existence of a healthy degree of self-criticism inside the squad, and it seems bizarre that Mancini might think it appropriate not just to suppress such a tendency but to administer a public scolding to the man who spoke out.</p> <p>Hart had not criticised an individual team-mate. He had not criticised the manager. He had simply expressed his dissatisfaction in an entirely proper way, incorporating a gracious apology to the supporters both in the ground and at home. Mancini's waspish reaction made you wonder if there was more to the exchange than met the eye.</p> <p>The City manager may have realised the scale of the challenge facing his side in the minute before the hour mark, when, with the match still goalless, Real's players gave a hint of how the contest might turn out. First Cristiano Ronaldo chased a seemingly hopeless ball to the byline on the left of the Manchester City goal and, exploiting his remarkable technique, hit a cross that was just too high for Gonzalo Higua\u00edn at the near post. Then Angel di Mar\u00eda showed similar commitment as he sprinted in pursuit of what had looked like a lost cause on the opposite flank.</p> <p>With such players at his disposal, you had to think, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho cannot be too concerned about the much-discussed crisis of morale at the Bernab\u00e9u. As the evening entered its decisive stage it was the consistently scintillating and relevant Di Mar\u00eda who supplied the passes for Madrid's first two goals, scored by Marcelo and Karim Benzema, and Ronaldo whose last-minute run and shot confused Vincent Kompany and Hart into conceding the winner.</p> <p>What Mancini would give to see his players producing such moments in which high skill combines with instinctive willpower. Of the 13 outfield players he used in the Bernab\u00e9u, only Yaya Tour\u00e9 looked on this occasion like a man who belonged at the very highest level of the Champions League, although David Silva received a marvellously affectionate ovation from the home crowd in recognition of his contribution to Spain's successful summer when he left the field in the 62nd minute, with the match still evenly balanced.</p> <p>And, of course, there was Hart, who produced world-class saves to stop Ronaldo giving his team a two-goal lead in the first dozen minutes. He could do nothing about Real's first two goals \u2013 Mancini can shoulder whatever blame is going for those, with some questionable defensive selections and alignments \u2013 but he will want a conversation with Kompany about the way Ronaldo's shot was allowed to enter the net.</p> <p>Perhaps Mancini was riled by the failure of his side to give him a win against Mourinho and to begin the reversal of his own unimpressive sequence of performances in the Champions League over the past five seasons. But on this occasion he chose the wrong target on which to vent his exasperation.</p>",

  "<p>Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) today announces two changes to its executive team. David Pemsel, formerly group marketing director of ITV, takes up the new position of chief commercial officer. Tanya Cordrey, currently GNM's director of digital development, is promoted to the new executive role of chief digital officer.<br> David will lead all of GNM's commercial operations. He has worked with GNM for a year as interim chief marketing officer, during which time he managed and oversaw the creation of a strong audience proposition. In his new role David will continue to oversee the marketing function and will additionally oversee the sales organisation, which includes Guardian Professional, business development and brand extensions, and display. Tanya joined GNM in 2008 initially building the digital portfolio of environment products and most recently overseeing the product development team. In her new role Tanya will continue to have product oversight as well as supporting the strategic development of the organisation. She joined GNM from the start-up company Zopa.com and was previously on the UK executive team at eBay for five years. Adam Freeman, currently GNM's executive director - commercial, leaves the company in October after 10 years. Adam is leaving to launch a digital start-up called MutualMedia.co, a consumer-led social advertising platform being created in partnership with the development agency Future Building. Chris Pelekanou, GNM's global commercial director, also leaves the company in December, after 20 years with the company. Chris is joining advertising agency Clear Channel Outdoor as commercial director. Andrew Miller, CEO, Guardian Media Group, said: \"I am delighted that David and Tanya have joined the GNM executive. Both have worked tirelessly and with great creativity to make our digital-first strategy a reality, attract unprecedented numbers of global readers and create new revenue streams. These changes are part of our strategy to bring both GNM and GMG closer together as we build a stronger, more digitally-focused organisation. \"Adam and Chris have made huge contributions to the development of GNM's commercial operations and we wish them both the very best in their new businesses.\" </p> <p><strong>- ENDS -</strong></p> <p><strong>For further information please contact: </strong><br>Hayley Dunlop, Guardian News &amp; Media press office, +44 (0)20 3353 3818 / <a href=\"mailto:hayley.dunlop@theguardian.com\">hayley.dunlop@theguardian.com</a>.<br> <strong>Notes to editors:</strong><br>Guardian News &amp; Media is the publisher of the Guardian, The Observer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/\">theguardian.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardiannews.com/\">guardiannews.com</a>.

  "<p>It's coming, but developer 4J Studios won't say when exactly. The Scottish studio tasked with converting PC phenomenon Minecraft to the Xbox is currently working on update 1.8.2, set to be the biggest addition to the game since it arrived on the console back in May. And with over three million fans now waiting for the refresh, the studio is teasingly releasing new details over Twitter and YouTube.</p> <p>Among the key features to arrive next will be a host of extra mobs, the living creatures that inhabit Minecraft's procedurally generated worlds. The rare yet dangerous Cave Spiders, the sneaky silverfish and the dark, sinister Endermen will all be roaming the environment. There will also be a bunch of new foods, including apples, melon and fresh chicken \u2013 for the farmers among you. Animal breeding, however, is unlikely to be a part of this build, while enchantment and XP - the elements of the PC version that have given it more of an RPG feel \u2013 will also be arriving later. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xztzrn05MOE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xztzrn05MOE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The most keenly anticipated feature however, will be the long-awaited implementation of the Creative Mode, which gives players total freedom to zoom about the landscape building vast structures from limitless resources. PC owners have utilised this option to build immense marvels of virtual architecture, including the Starship Enterprise. The Xbox version will include the Superflat landscapes that facilitate easier construction. </p> <p>Talking about the conversion process, Paddy Burns, CTO of 4J Studios, told us about how console gamers are now helping to shape the update process. \"We are getting great suggestions from Xbox players both on Twitter, and on the forums,\" he says. \"Sometimes their ideas are so obviously right that we can't figure out why we didn't think of them! We have been changing various features within the game based on their feedback, and adding new features and options that have been suggested and debated between lots of forum users. Every now and then we even pitch in on the forums just to let them know we are following all the discussions and suggestions on there!\"<br> The big question now, is when we can expect to see the update. \"We're still finishing things off, and fixing bugs the testers are finding,\" says Burns. \"It won't be too much longer before we're ready to hand it over to the Microsoft Certification Testing team. We will be letting people know when we've handed over to the Cert Test team, and then we all wait with our fingers crossed...\"</p>",

  "<p>The debate over Olympic legacy and the controversy over the sell-off of school playing fields have thrown into sharp relief the question of how we get people to be more active, whether in competitive sports or informally.</p> <p>The arguments seem to fall along a spectrum from the behavioural to the structural. On the one hand it's down to personal motivation and on the other that the way society and especially places are organised actually discourages physical activity.</p> <p>The structural issues revolve around the question of whether the opportunity exists for physical activity. The phrase obesogenic environment was coined some time ago and it is characterised by a reliance on the private car, severance of neighbourhoods by roads, a high risk of road accidents and urban layouts that either privatise or exclude public space.</p> <p>The question is, what is the most effective combination of the structural and the behavioural?</p> <p>The benefits of physical activity have been known and valued for centuries. The value of physical exercise in pre and post heart attack patients and its contribution to tackling obesity are well understood. But there is still a disconnect between clinical and structural perspectives. A recent House of Lords report noted that GPs received little or no training in the value of physical activity and did not prioritise it.</p> <p>A couple of years ago Nice, concerned by this, looked for evidence of the efficacy of measures to encourage physical activity and published a report concluding that the evidence was convincing. NHS Gloucestershire and local partners responded to that review and wanted to translate it into practical crosscutting guidance.</p> <p>My colleague Rob Ballantyne and I, both practitioners in the rarified field of spatial planning and health, were commissioned to draw up some rules of thumb. The resulting <a href=\"http://www.glospct.nhs.uk/pdf/publications/2011/ ActivePlanningToolkit.pdf\" title=\"\">toolkit</a> looked at the evidence and pin pointed practical ways in which schools, cycling, transport and buildings design, the areas highlighted as instrumental by Nice, could be managed to facilitate physical activity.</p> <p>The approach inevitably links planning \u2013 the management of the physical environment and public health in new ways. It is through spatial planning that standards can be set and better outcomes negotiated in housing, neighbourhoods, shopping and business areas.</p> <p>Most planners, architects, designers and engineers will understand and factor in the need for movement and accessibility, but the crucial thing is to pay attention at all levels from the strategic down to the detail.</p> <p>Walking and cycling need to be safe at the town scale but school playgrounds can and have been designed so that play is more spontaneous, multi-story buildings can be designed so that stairs are right in front of you, not hidden away in a dark corridor.</p> <p>The toolkit is going from strength to strength. It brought many organisations together as it was developed and has recently won the regional Royal Town Planning award in the south west. It points the way to integrating physical activity in the way we organise our towns and neighbourhoods and maybe one route to Rio 2016.</p> <p><em>Neil Blackshaw is a consultant at Easton Planning</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest vacancies in your area</strong></p>",

  "<p>Development secretary Justine Greening's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/17/dfid-spending-consultants-scrutiny\" title=\"\">emergency audit of her department's spending</a> could be a welcome effort to bring some transparency to the grey world of development consultancy.</p> <p>A small group of mostly UK organisations have been taking millions from the public purse, while paying their chief executives six- or seven-figure salaries. Attention has focused on the activities of Adam Smith International (ASI), a \"leading international advisory firm\" that is dedicated to promoting the <a href=\"http://www.adamsmithinternational.com/content/our-values\" title=\"\">\"benefits of competition, good government and individual liberty\"</a>. Over 70% of ASI's income now comes from the Department for International Development. The ASI's managing director, William Morrison, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204239/The-fat-cats-foreign-aid-Ministers-target-consultants-paid-500m-taxpayer.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">received \u00a31.3m in total pay and dividends in 2010</a>.</p> <p>There's a certain irony in these defenders of free market virtue busily gobbling up public sector cash intended for development. But the brazenness of ASI and others should not be used as an excuse to clamp down on development aid in general, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9547162/Probe-over-millions-spent-on-foreign-aid-consultants.html\" title=\"\">as some are hinting</a>. If those working in development have learned to pay themselves fat salaries, they are following a lead set by the private sector.</p> <p>Over the past 10 years, the average pay of FTSE 100 chief executives has risen 160%, with total rewards up 10% in the past year alone, to \u00a34.8m. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18035125\" title=\"\">This does not reflect exceptional success</a>, or anything close to it: the value of those companies has risen only 6.8% over the same period of time. This isn't about incentives for visionary entrepreneurs, it's about corporate greed, and the lack of meaningful accountability over the behaviour of those running our largest companies. They now earn, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a752f2e-b883-11e0-8206-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26pbxbsf0\" title=\"\">120 times more than their average employees \u2013 up from 47 times more in 1998 [paywall]</a>.</p> <p>But soaring salaries in the corporate world \u2013 led, naturally, by big finance, with a third of the top 0.1% of earners employed in financial services \u2013 has a backwash effect. By over-rewarding CEOs, we drag up pay levels across the top of society. Will Hutton's recent review of public sector pay found that, even though recruitment from the private sector into senior roles was limited, it <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/indreview_willhutton_interim.htm\" title=\"\">\"contributed to senior pay inflation\"</a>.</p> <p>Expectations established in the private sector, with rewards for the most senior managers skyrocketing, have bled into the public and voluntary spheres. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/city-pay-culture-has-spread-to-charities-union-says-1817725.html\" title=\"\">One recent survey</a> found that more than 50 charity chief executives were paid in excess of \u00a3100,000 a year, with one charity paying its chief nearly \u00a3400,000. The charities executives' own organisation claimed this was necessary to attract \"high-calibre\" individuals into running large charitable concerns.</p> <p>Private sector firms, at least, have a clear goal: the bottom line. The gap between what a chief executive earns and the company's performance can be immediately assessed. It's exactly this extraordinary disconnection between pay at the top, and actual results, that has roused shareholders to revolt.</p> <p>Work in the public sector in general, and development work in particular, is by necessity harder to assess. Goals are varied, and there is no obvious, transparent target for assessment. The relationship between an intervention and a desired outcome is rarely entirely clear. Charities, too, find themselves tackling complex issues that are simply not amenable to easy tick-box accountability.</p> <p>But charities are accountable to trustees, and top public sector pay is increasingly open to public scrutiny. There are, at least, some checks on accelerating rewards at the very top \u2013 charity chief executives are still paid, on average, <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1092239/\" title=\"\">18% less than their private sector counterparts</a>. It is in the demi-monde between the public and private sectors that bad practice can flourish.</p> <p>Introduce a culture of excessive executive rewards to this murky environment and you create the ideal conditions for high and unaccountable pay to flourish. Throw in a deeply held belief in the superior virtues of the private sector \u2013 entertained by both this government and the preceding \u2013 and you create the peculiar situation in which former DfID employees are re-employed by their old department, on seriously increased pay, to \"perform essentially the same work as they did before\". They are out one door, and straight back in through another, all the while loudly trumpeting the joys of the free market. The demands of commercial and national security that accompany too many aid packages can cover the rest.</p> <p>Corruption in the developing countries is well known and well reported. It distorts aid and ruins lives. But there is a more insidious kind of corruption, widespread in the developed world, in which those at the top of society claim greater and greater rewards, justifying it by reference to the demands of the market. It leaks back into every other sphere of life. A review of aid payments may introduce some much-needed transparency to the system. Cleansing the deeper, systemic problem will take longer.</p>",
  "<p>Mortgages with a 30-year lifespan are on the rise. The Office for National Statistics reveals that 23.3%, or almost a quarter, of all new mortgages are spread over three decades or more.</p> <p>The 25-year mortgage has been dying since the early 1990s when it accounted for 70% of all mortgages. Today the figure is just 30%.</p> <p>It's a worrying process that shows an increasing proportion of mortgage buyers opting to pay over a longer period.</p> <p>After the financial crash of 2008 panicked borrowers appeared to be more debt-conscious. In 2008 and 2009 the proportion of 30-year mortgages went into decline for the first time and by 2010 accounted for 19.1% of mortgages bought in that year.</p> <p>But the figures for 2011 show 23.3% of mortgage buyers stretching their repayments again over 30 or more years.</p> <p>Bob Pannell, chief economist at the Council of Mortgage Lenders, says the lengthening of mortgage terms reflects the increasing cost of a mortgage.</p> <p>He warns against reading too much into the figures because the move to regular remortgaging every two years and the rise of interest-only loans complicated the picture before 2007. In this environment, saying you had a 25-year or 30-year mortgage was less relevant.</p> <p>However, it is still the case that monthly mortgage payments are calculated over a set period and the easiest way to cut the monthly bill is to tell the lender payments should be over 30 years and not 25 years as previously agreed.</p> <p>Does this tell us that there are more people on the edge of being repossessed whose only option is to almost turn their mortgage into a rental payment it lasts so long?</p> <p>Pannell says it shows that as house prices have risen and regulations become more stringent on the sale of mortgages, first-time buyers and existing home owners have decided to take longer to pay off their mortgages. It is an affordability issue. We cannot tell from the figures how many are distressed homeowners.</p> <p>But there is an argument that old rules stipulating 25-year terms over which the capital is repaid should be applied even more rigorously.</p> <p>The only result of lax mortgage rules is higher prices. It creates a demand where there would be none if people were told they don't have the income to cope.</p> <p>If we are wiser after the worst financial crash in modern times, it should be to say no more to higher loan-to-value calculations, teaser rates that are unaffordable over the longer term and a disregard for the borrower's ability to pay in a sensible timescale.</p> <p>Some people say it denies young people a mortgage and that living longer means you can take longer to pay down a mortgage.</p> <p>But the affordability issue can only be resolved by higher pay and not easier credit. It is a subject Ed Miliband is trying to address, if a little cack-handedly, with his notion of pre-distribution. It means people on lower incomes get a boost from higher pay, making them able to buy a home with help. A boost from lax credit only sows the seeds of the next crisis.</p>",
  "<p>My children told me during the Olympics that I could not cry every time a woman or someone on a horse won a medal. They then told me I could not keep crying every time anyone won a medal in the Paralympics.</p> <p>The compassion, empathy, sympathy and growing understanding we all experienced during the latter part of the summer must be sustained if we are to have a legacy from the Paralympics. It will not be good enough for us to have experienced those feelings so intensely and then forget them as we go back into our autumn routines.</p> <p>To hear my son explaining what cerebral palsy is and how it affects people's speech but not their understanding is part of that legacy and if it has achieved nothing else but a greater national empathy then it will have been worth it.</p> <p>But actually it has to be backed up with real support \u2013 emotions and understanding are not enough. Many people with similar conditions and disabilities will be fighting a daily struggle with organisations and people's prejudices, trying to live on ever-decreasing benefits, living in a world which is built for the able-bodied and enduring the pitying or evasive looks from people when they are out and about.</p> <p>Has this changed since the games? I hope so \u2013 what a legacy that would be if the government thinks again about its approach to disability benefits, if people didn't avert their eyes but smiled broadly when they saw someone without limbs or with a visible disability and if organisations made a real effort to employ disabled people.</p> <p>Behind every one of those athletes was a huge contribution from the NHS, social care, housing, the voluntary sector and family carers \u2013 all of which are under threat in the current political and economic environment and will struggle to continue to deliver the same level of services to create a new generation of Paralympians.</p> <p>It has not only been the Paralympics which has made me wish for people's attitudes to be changed. I visited some people recently who are the new neighbours of some young men with a learning disability who have moved into their community. Despite lots of preparatory work and bending over backwards to make life easier for all involved, the neighbours still believe that people with a learning disability somehow pose a threat to their children, make more noise than anyone else and bring down the value of their houses. In a previous authority I worked there was a similar reaction to a new independent living &#xa0;facility \u2013 that the residents were \"schizophrenics just waiting to kill someone\" .</p> <p>Sadly these prejudiced attitudes are within our communities and if there is a legacy to emerge from the Paralympics please let it be that we do not fear those who are different, but continue to celebrate their success in living ordinary and extraordinary lives.</p> <p>On holiday this year a man with Down's syndrome was having a surfing lesson on the beach. Every one of the children with us came up to point him out to me and say how great it was that he was learning to surf and how good he was at it.</p> <p>Without personal budgets and the policy of independent living, that man would have been sat in a chair in a day-room looking at a television. Instead he was high-fiving his instructor every time he stood up on a wave and laughing every time he fell off. Not a Paralympian but enjoying his success and achievement just as much.</p> <p>So in all this talk of legacy let it be all of us who change our attitudes to disability. Perhaps some will be shown the way by the children who will never forget this summer and who will hopefully have a different attitude to disability as a result.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

The day before there had been harrowing reports that some 40 people were left to drown by security forces when a leaking tugboat carrying refugees bound for the US had sunk seven miles off the Cuban coast. The reports, vigorously denied by the government, gave focus and immediacy to a simmering discontent that finally spilled into the open. Rarely, if ever, had anyone heard such calls for an end to Fidel Castro's rule.</p> <p>But the defiance was charged with desperation. In the aftermath that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's economy had gone into a tailspin. With the loss of its primary trading partner, 80 per cent of Cuba's trade came to an end. So did the billions in Soviet economic aid. Overnight Cuba was plunged into a period of such hardship and deprivation that there were stories of people eating the animals at the Havana zoo. It was christened, in characteristic state speak, as the 'Special Period in the Time of Peace'. That was 22 years ago, and the 'Special Period' is still in full effect. The uprising on the Malecon, although brief, was taken as a wake-up call by the leadership.</p> <p>Today, Cuba is at a crossroads. Caught in the opposing tensions of economic survival on one hand and adherence to its socialist revolution on the other, the country is embarking on a process that will either salvage the meaning of socialism, or bequeath the country to those who are waiting, once and forever, to bury the ideals of its revolution.</p> <p>It's not a new problem.</p> <p>Cuba, sheltered for so long under the umbrella of its Soviet protector, is among the last in a long string of socialist states that have had to confront the failures of centrally planned economies in the age of capital. But Cuba is utterly determined not to fall prey to the free-market fictions that led to such wreckage in Russia and in all those former Eastern Bloc countries that had been lured down the capitalist path.</p> <p>Cuba is taking a different route \u2013 one that seeks to reconcile socialist ideals with enterprise. Slowly, reluctantly, Cuba's leaders, spearheaded by Fidel's brother, Ra\u00fal Castro, are flirting with the market. They are relaxing the stranglehold of the state on the private economy. They are restructuring large swathes of Cuba's agricultural sector. They are devolving a measure of economic planning and control to municipalities. They are allowing the emergence \u2013 very limited to be sure \u2013 of private enterprise. But most interesting of all, they are paying serious attention to the role of co-operatives in transforming the Cuban economy.</p> <h2><strong>Co-op autonomy is key</strong></h2> <p>I was in Cuba as part of a Canadian delegation of co-operators that had come to learn what this transition to a co-op economy meant and to offer what support we could. It was my second trip to the country and I could immediately see the differences. There were caf\u00e9s, restaurants and small businesses everywhere. Fruit stalls and craft markets abounded. Havana was brimming with entrepreneurial life. Nevertheless, my own feelings about the new direction were mixed \u2013 a combination of sympathy with the stated goals of the effort, and misgivings about whether the particular brand of socialist ideas \u2013 and practices \u2013 that govern Cuba's political realities were at odds with the task.</p> <p>Can co-operatives save socialism in Cuba? Or will they suffer the fate of co-ops in other countries where they were used to serve the needs of the state rather than those of the citizenry? This was the question in my mind. In every case where governments have sought to bend co-operatives to state interests, three results have followed: a hollowing out of co-op principles and the reduction of co-ops to mere extensions of the government; the ultimate failure of these enterprises and a dependence on the state; and the defamation of the co-op model which came to be seen, quite correctly, as a means of state control. In the countries of the former Soviet Bloc, co-operatives have yet to salvage their reputation. Will this happen in Cuba?</p> <p>After the revolution and the expropriation of the big agricultural estates, co-operatives were viewed through a Soviet lens, as a way to achieve large-scale production through state-controlled collectivization. As a result, co-operation as a form of mutual self-help, independent from the state, is little understood \u2013 either by the state or the populace. Co-operatives are still viewed as a means of helping the government solve the failures of a command economy. But the questions of co-op autonomy and open markets are the keys that will determine whether co-ops will play the role that is hoped for them, or whether they will survive at all.</p> <p>Cuba's newfound affection for co-operatives is entirely understandable. Faced with the enormity of the economic challenges, the leadership realizes that something has to change. In sector after sector, inefficiencies and dysfunctions are staggering. In a country whose prime challenge is to feed its people, 50 per cent of the state-owned arable land is uncultivated and unproductive. Only 18 per cent of the land is irrigated. Since 1989, agricultural exports have declined from 80 per cent to 18 per cent of the national economy. The agricultural question is paramount in Cuba and it is here that much of the focus on co-operatives lies.</p> <p>In 2008 the government sought to improve agriculture production by turning state farms into co-operatives. These co-ops, called UBPCs, were turned over to the farm workers to own and operate under a lease arrangement with the state. But unlike co-ops that had been organized by independent farmers to share land, farm equipment and labour, many of these state-mandated co-ops floundered. There was no effort to teach former state employees how to run a co-op, no experience in managing an independent enterprise, no choice over where co-ops could purchase supplies, or what they could produce, or to whom they could sell their produce. Supplies were bought from state departments, quotas still had to be sold to state agents. And if a co-op wanted to pursue a new business that was not mandated in its charter, it could not do so. In short, the co-ops were hamstrung by a closed market system dominated by the state.</p> <p>But lessons are being learned. Constraints are being lifted and a more open system may emerge for co-ops to access supplies and sell produce independently. Comprehensive co-op training is underway across the country.</p> <h2><strong>Slow motion demolition</strong></h2> <p>Housing is another sector in deep trouble. When the 'Special Period' came, 80 per cent of skilled labour abandoned the farms and fled to the cities. A major housing crisis followed. In Havana today, 11,000 people are living in shelters. Almost 120,000 people are on waiting lists for housing. In all cases, including those who own their homes, people live in housing that is crumbling into the ground. This is why a visit to Havana can be such a heartbreaking experience. How to reconcile such elegance with the corrosion and decay that eats away at these colonial buildings that now linger, ghost-like, from another era? In Havana, an average of 3.1 buildings collapse every day. The graceful old city is caught in something like a demolition progressing in slow motion.</p> <p>Housing is clearly one area where co-operatives could play a crucial role. Others include the provision of much-needed social services \u2013 like childcare and services to the elderly and the disabled. What is still lacking, however, is a legal framework to allow for such collective and civic forms of property. It is rumoured that co-op legislation will be introduced in 2013. But unless these co-ops can independently access labour, capital and supplies it is hard to see how they could function as autonomous enterprises. This is even truer in sectors like light industry where the government hopes co-ops can kick-start new enterprises.</p> <p>Cuba has to marry the market freedoms that are the precondition for co-operative enterprises with the controlling reflexes of an anxious \u2013 not to say paranoid \u2013 state. Not that the paranoia is unfounded \u2013 only that it is unhelpful. The threats that crowd Cuba are very real and very obvious. The bellicosity of the US shows no sign of letting up. Expatriate fanatics still nurse their revenge fantasies from nearby Florida. And there are other, more subtle dangers.</p> <p>The 'Special Period' now comprises 40 per cent of the time since the 1959 revolution. An entire generation has grown up knowing nothing else. A survival mentality has taken hold that corresponds to what is essentially a war economy of scarcity and subsistence. It is a corrosive environment that breeds individualism and alienation, and undermines the social solidarity that is, in the final analysis, the last refuge of the revolution.</p> <h2><strong>Socialism was always a top-down affair</strong></h2> <p>The opening of new sectors like tourism and the adoption of a parallel dollar currency in the 1990s created new class divisions that separated those who had access to dollars from those who didn't. Moreover, decades of state paternalism have ingrained socialism as a philosophy imposed from above. As one Cuban economist told me: 'Socialism was always a top-down affair. It never developed as a change in the mutual relations among people at the level of community.'</p> <p>Co-ops are a key to making this possible.</p> <p>The political leadership today clearly understands what is at stake. Ra\u00fal Castro and his allies know that if the revolution is to have a legacy beyond them, change has to come and that they are its stewards. Despite the hardships and the discontent, the old revolutionaries still retain an allegiance from their people. The ideals of the revolution remain vital. But there are fears that those that come after will lack the moral authority to drive the changes that a new era demands. They are profound and mark a turning point for the country.</p> <p>Gone is the egalitarianism that Ra\u00fal Castro now says fostered a pervasive idleness that is distinctly unrevolutionary. Gone are the massive subsidies that propped up the state enterprises. They are required to earn their way or perish. Gone too is the use of government sinecures to absorb unemployment and to dispense patronage favours. The state intends to lay off 1.3 million workers in a system where the government, directly or indirectly, employs 85 per cent of the population. Where will these people go?</p> <p>Cuba's leaders hope that a combination of co-operative restructuring and independent entrepreneurship will take up the slack. Without further measures to free the economy from state controls this is not likely. But beyond this, there looms what is perhaps the single greatest threat to reform in Cuba \u2013 the state bureaucracy. For the thousands of functionaries that handle the patronage networks of the state and its enterprises, reform can only mean trimming back the powers that bestow their status and livelihoods. They will resist change at every turn.</p> <p>Ultimately, the future of socialism in Cuba rests on its leaders accepting that society is not the state and that the interests of the two are not the same. The survival of socialism depends on finding economic models that marry the ideals of solidarity and equity and social justice with that of open markets and free people. Co-operatives are a natural choice but it will take additional risk from its leadership and a trust in their people to make this bold experiment work.</p> <p>Despite the enormity of the challenge, and the grip the old socialist ideas still have on the political imagination, there is an unbounded pride in Cuba born of struggle and endurance against impossible odds.</p> <p>Cubans are survivors. They are resourceful and innovative, and among the most educated people in Latin America. Given the chance, they have created thousands of enterprises everywhere in the small spaces and crannies opened up by the new freedoms. And if Cuba's leaders can place their trust in their people, and in the endurance of the ideals they have fought so hard to protect, the co-operative economy they hope to build might yet forge a new kind of civic socialism for a world in desperate need of new visions.</p> <p><em>John Restakis is executive director of the </em><a href=\"http://bcca.coop/\" title=\"\"><em>BC Co-operative Association</em></a><em> in Vancouver and has been active in the co-op movement as a researcher, educator, writer and advocate for 20 years.

  "<p>Anti-poverty campaigners have hailed a <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/09/18/uk-eu-transparency-idUKBRE88H0L720120918\" title=\"\">vote on Tuesday by a European parliamentary committee</a> requiring EU oil, gas, mining and timber companies to publish their payments to foreign governments.</p> <p>They say the move brings Europe a step closer to putting a spotlight on payments worth billions of euros by extractive companies to governments, which have until now remained secret, allowing corrupt officials to pocket natural resource revenues.</p> <p>Parliamentary representatives will now negotiate with member states before a final version of the directive goes to all MEPs for a European parliamentary vote later in the year.</p> <p>\"I'm pleased the committee has overwhelmingly backed my compromises for a strong law on transparency and disclosure for the extractive industries,\" said Arlene McCarthy, a British Labour MEP and lead legislator on the transparency law, after Tuesday's vote in the legal affairs committee.</p> <p>\"We haven't given in to the pressure of industry and government lobbying for a weak transparency regime. We're insisting on project-by-project reporting with a low threshold of \u20ac80,000 for payment disclosure. We refused to accept exemptions which would create large loopholes in the law,\" she said. \"The vote was a clear rejection of the 27 EU member states' weak proposals for disclosure of country-by-country payments and reporting in the extractive industries.\"</p> <p>McCarthy said the vote gave MEPs a strong negotiating mandate to force member states and the European commission to accept parliament's amendments, putting the world on track to create strong global transparency standards with equivalent rules in the EU and the US. However, she criticised Conservative MEPs for failing to back the measure. \"This is another U-turn by Conservatives, reneging on Prime Minister David Cameron's call on Europe to bring forth country and project reporting,\" she said.</p> <p>Advocacy groups warmly welcomed the vote by the European parliament's legal affairs committee. Laura Taylor, <a href=\"http://www.tearfund.org/\" title=\"\">Tearfund</a>'s head of public policy, said: \"As many mining, oil and gas projects are in developing countries, this will ultimately lead to a better deal for the people who are currently in poverty but who are quite literally living on top of their country's wealth. When people are better informed they are able to hold their authorities to account and see resources released for development instead of being lost to corruption. This could mean essential services like clean water, healthcare and education, and help to reduce long-term dependency on aid.\"</p> <p>In 2009, exports of oil, gas and minerals from Africa were worth about five times the value of international aid to the continent ($246bn against $49bn), according to <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/library/extractive-sector-transparency-why-eu-needs-strong-set-rules\" title=\"\">Global Witness</a>, yet the wealth from natural resources is concentrated in the hands of the few \u2013 depriving benefits for the many in what has become known as the \"resource curse\".</p> <p>\"The European parliament has truly reset the debate on transparency in the EU, so now it's all eyes on member states to rubberstamp the rules,\" said Eloise Todd, Brussels director of <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/blog/?p=9667\" title=\"\">ONE</a>. \"The details really matter. Getting them wrong would leave millions in the developing world in the dark about what happens to the billions of dollars their governments received for oil and mining deals. Getting them right means local people can hold their governments to account and ensure the money goes to building schools and hospitals, not mansions and limousines for the chosen few.\"</p> <p>Nigeria's corruption agency says $300bn-$400bn has been stolen or wasted over the last 50 years and campaigners say the Democratic Republic of the Congo received only $86,000 in mineral rights in 2006, despite an estimated $1bn of mineral exports each year.</p> <p>But Javier Pereira, policy officer at Eurodad (European Network on Debt and Development) injected a note of caution. \"Despite today's promising progress, there is still a long way to go to ensure that this legislation effectively combats issues of corruption that keep people in developing countries in a cycle of poverty,\" he said. \"Tax dodging is not easily defeated, so companies should be required to report additional information like sales volumes, assets and profits to put their payments into context. EU governments must now raise the bar by adopting a strong proposal, which should be at least in line with the recently implemented US rules.\"</p> <p>The committee's position is similar to the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) rules adopted in August in four key areas. It reaffirms the principle of project-by-project reporting for large private and public listed European oil, gas, mining and logging companies; proposes a definition of project based on \"activities governed by a single contract, licence, lease, concession or similar legal agreement with a government upon which payment liabilities arise\"; deletes the exemption for companies reporting in countries where criminal law prohibits disclosure \u2013 the SEC said such an exemption would be \"inconsistent with the statute and would encourage countries to adopt laws specifically prohibiting the required disclosure\"; and proposes a minimum payment threshold of \u20ac80,000, almost identical to the SEC minimum of $100,000.</p>",
  "<p>Following the headlines this year on <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/go/charities_act_review\" title=\"\">Lord Hodgson's review of the Charities Act</a> \u2013 the proposed cap on tax relief, thinktank reports on charity lobbying and MPs deliberating in the press on the identity, role and characteristics of \"good\" charities \u2013 I sometimes wonder whether we have, as a sector, slipped into perpetuating polarised debate\u2013 either taking the position that all is rosy, denying a need for change, or alternatively, swallowing the line that charities are the authors of our own downfall. Or worse, we refuse to have the conversation at all.</p> <p>Such extreme generalisations don't give a realistic view of a varied sector that at times struggles to fit into everyone's idea of \"charity\". Are we having an identity crisis as a sector? Has the term charity past its sell-by date?</p> <p>For many of my friends outside the sector, the word charity conjures an image of ladies in twin sets and pearls hosting coffee mornings and rattling tins \u2013 or the equivalent of young \"chuggers\" urging pedestrians to sign up or send a text. Typically they have notions of organisations that don't pay tax and are run by volunteers, and while they may be familiar with campaigns by <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Oxfam</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/home/\" title=\"\">Cancer Research UK</a>, they do not stop to reconcile their notions of small and voluntary with the scale of the charities with which they are most familiar. They don't think of efficiency, of well-oiled machines, or of organisations that can be akin to big business.</p> <p>Perhaps this goes to the heart of the problem \u2013 charity is not just one single thing. It can be micro or massive, volunteer-run or manned by staff who are both highly skilled and well paid. It can be highly efficient and highly effective or less efficient and inward-looking. Some may have lost focus on their principle reason for existence \u2013 their beneficiaries.</p> <p>The disconnect between perception and reality unsurprisingly runs through the debate, whether it's on public service delivery, pay, fundraising, tax reliefs or a string of other issues. We fail to tackle this to our detriment. For example, the debates around tax reliefs and payment of trustees illustrate the extremes of public views regarding charities.</p> <p>As a sector we should be fully engaged in the debate, tackling these views. We should not be claiming all is rosy in the garden, agreeing we're not very good or, worse, burying our head in the sand, refusing to have the conversation because it's too difficult, or too high-risk.</p> <p>There are some examples where we've tried to get sector-wide agreement to address misconceptions with honesty and transparency about what we do and how we do it. These have been successful in varying degrees. This transparency, in my opinion, is the only way; but we need everyone to take the risk.</p> <p>One cyclical question is on pay. \"Is it right that any charity chief executive should be receiving more pay than the prime minister?\" is a frustrating question as it presumes a yesor no answer.</p> <p>We should, of course, be transparent with our salaries and pay \u2013 we are spending money given to us on trust, to serve beneficiaries. We should be able to justify that a salary is appropriate and should resist suggestions that paid positions should only be created if a volunteer cannot be found.</p> <p>Charity should not be something the rich and privileged do for the poor and vulnerable. We should be inclusive\u2013 a sector which supports, connects, and uses skills from a diverse workforce. If a paid position is needed we should prepare to stand by it. Running a charity efficiently, professionally and effectively is highly unlikely to fall into the category of not serving beneficiaries.</p> <p>All too frequently we hear that there are too many charities. Charities are not one homogenous group; big and small serve different purposes, economies of scale will not meet all situations and duplication on paper may actually read into local and niche in reality.</p> <p>To set an arbitrary perfect number of charities or dictate size is to try and squeeze charities into pointless pigeon holes. The size, shape and number must be dictated by the cause, need and the availability of those willing to take action.</p> <p>Finally, the assertion that market forces will save the best charities is equally damaging. Charities don't exist in a normal market economy; social factors always play a part.</p> <p>Well-run charities, with excellent financial management, good governance and efficient business models, are better placed to survive and thrive in a difficult economic environment. In tough times, the ability to adapt speedily will rely on such excellence, making the difference between success and failure. I will also accept that in times of plenty you may get away with inefficiency more easily.</p> <p>I have known so-called well-run charities that had lost sight of what they were there to do. I also have known apparently poorly-run charities serving their beneficiaries wonderfully through high-quality service levels and passion on the front line. The term good is therefore not simply limited to efficiency and ability to adapt. There will always be causes where resource simply can't meet need; often, organisation and administration are first to be compromised by those charities that don't want to risk frontline service provision to beneficiaries.</p> <p>All in the garden is not rosy, and yes, we do need to grasp the odd nettle in amongst the blooms. The current and continuing financial pressures give an opportunity and incentive to refocus on mission, improve efficiency and effectiveness, ensure greater impact and improve outcomes for beneficiaries. But we do ourselves no favours if we take the line that those who fail have no-one to blame but themselves.</p> <p>So let's have the debate, let's welcome it and be open-minded. Let's tackle some of these difficult questions and be prepared to make changes where we need to, resist unfair criticism and respond with one voice.</p> <p><em>Caron Bradshaw is chief executive of the </em><a href=\"http://www.cfg.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Charity Finance Group</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
