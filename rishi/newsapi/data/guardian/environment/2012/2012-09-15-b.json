  "<p>Rumer, in a restaurant, is sensitive to events on other tables. The clang of dropped cutlery, a hand raised a little too long when calling for the bill, these are things that make the singer momentarily break from her own meal and eyeball the waiter, just make sure he's on the way. \"I can't relax when someone needs the salt,\" she says, because for many years, before she had a hit record, back in the days when she was still known as Sarah Joyce, Rumer made her living as a waitress.</p> <p>\"I loved it,\" says the 33-year-old, dressed this lunchtime in a green-patterned dress over jeans, long, messy brown hair falling to reach the table. \"The morning shift especially \u2013 pulling down the awning, setting out the chairs, putting on the music. Loved it.\"</p> <p>We are eating in the lounge of <a href=\"http://www.unionclub.co.uk/\" title=\"the Union\">the Union</a>, a members' club in Soho: a curious, cluttered place with faded red walls and a general sense of its having an eccentric history. Rumer looks unimpressed when the young waiter fails to provide any background facts; a nugget or two of building trivia should, clearly, be a part of his professional arsenal. I bet Rumer was a good waitress.</p> <p>\"Depends who you ask,\" she says. \"If you ask the chefs, they'd say I was awful. Chefs didn't like me because I tried to please the customers.\" She'd let people order off the menu, and then \"have to dodge missiles when I got into the kitchen\".</p> <p>A good thing, really, that after 10 years of after-hours gigging, even working for a while as a popcorn vendor in a cinema, she got a deal with Atlantic Records two years ago. Her debut album, the mellow, 70s-influenced MOR of <em>Seasons of My Soul</em>, was a great success, selling more than a million copies. No more waiting on tables for you, I suggest, as our main courses arrive.</p> <p>\"I actually did a shift at my old restaurant a few months ago. <a href=\"http://www.pullens.biz/\" title=\"Pullens\">Pullens</a>, in south London. Does fantastic steak\u2026\"</p> <p>Sorry?</p> <p>\"Pullens. It used to be a gentlemen's outfitters before it was a restaurant. The manager, Alan, used to be a fisherman so everything's \u2026\"</p> <p>But I'm not after background facts. Rumer, a few months ago, would have been tweaking her follow-up to <em>Seasons of My Soul</em>, an album of surprising cover versions called<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/15026d98-4096-4c64-89ff-329171ab462c\" title=\" Boys Don't Cry\"> <em>Boys Don't Cry</em></a> that at the time of our lunch is on its way to No 3 in the UK album chart. An odd time, you'd think, to start moonlighting at her local steak joint. What was she up to? \"Just helping out,\" she says. \"They were short-staffed. It was interesting \u2013 I was polishing cutlery and I thought, well, how many times have I done this? I used to stand doing the cutlery and dream about getting away, being a singer.\"</p> <p>I wonder if her still relatively new career as a pop star, which recently included <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOqnCns59Y\" title=\"\">performing for President Obama at the White House</a>, has been everything she expected. \"Nothing ever is. There are times, now, when I wish I didn't have any of the pressure. All these experiences that I'm having \u2013 shaking Obama's hand, having a lovely chat with Michelle \u2013 they're amazing. But they're also laced with fear. Some people love performing but I don't have that confidence. Because I don't think that I'm amazing. I don't think everything that comes out of my mouth is perfectly executed.\"</p> <p>Fame came late, at 30, and up until then Rumer's life had been disjointed: false starts with bands; bouts of depression; a slow year as a kitchen assistant at a hippie-ish retreat, cooking bean stews for visitors signed up for \"gong camp, past-life regression, whatever\". Now she is hurried around the world to sing and promote and glad-hand, \"one minute Helsinki, the next New York\". But self-confidence doesn't always develop as quickly as a career urged on by massive sales.</p> <p>\"Someone from my record label said to me: 'This bit about fame being hard. It's an interesting angle.'\" Rumer hoots with laughter. \"I said: 'An angle? It's not an angle, it's true. What are you talking about an angle ...\"</p> <p>I doubt, though, the label's angle-man got off with the affectionate chuckle she's using today. Rumer is, by most accounts, quite exacting when it comes to her music, and hands-on at every stage of her album's creation. Nothing irks her quite like her label telling her something can't be done.</p> <p>\"I ask them: 'Really? Or are you just a quitter?' I have the attitude that everything is doable. I've got a rogue gene. I've got these mountain goat herding genes from Pakistan.\"</p> <p><strong>These last comments need some </strong>explaining, if you're unfamiliar with the singer's past. Born to English parents in 1979, she grew up in an expat community in eastern Pakistan, where her father, an engineer, worked on the Tarbela Dam. They moved back to England to live in a house in the New Forest. \"You know the expression 'fur coat no knickers'? That was us. We looked like we had money. Big house but it was falling apart. There was a swimming pool with no water in it.\"</p> <p>At the age of 11, Rumer learned that she was the result of an affair her mother had in Pakistan. Her biological father was a man from the local village and the family cook. \"We're talking about somebody who used to make my dad's jam roly-poly,\" she says. \"Every night. And it was rock hard. He was the worst chef. Didn't know how to cook. Completely not interested in obeying rules. Did his own thing.\"</p> <p>She bursts out laughing. \"My mum told me once that he went shopping [for the family] and when he unpacked it he didn't know what to make of a box of Tampax. So he put it in the cupboard with the rice.\" Her mother and the man \u2013 who Rumer won't name \u2013 grew close, she says, because her mother was clever and frustrated. \"They got on well because my mother was a linguist. The cook taught her Urdu, and the Qur'an. They studied together.\"</p> <p>In her mid-20s, Rumer travelled to Pakistan to try to find her father, there to learn he'd recently passed away. Her mother had died from cancer only months prior. \"I'd like to think I've buried all my sadness in this record,\" says Rumer, who worries she's spoken a little too often about her curious parentage. She says she has a tendency to \"go dark\" in interviews, especially when the subject comes up. \"I haven't really got any skin left, you know?\"</p> <p>She says there's a third album in the works, a more cheerful one, but before she can finish it, \"I just want to observe life again. Feel a part of the natural rhythm of life.\" With this in mind I ask if her brief return to restaurant work was an effort to recapture the calm before the clamour brought on by <em>Seasons of My Soul</em>. \"I think I just like doing my own thing,\" she says. \"I'm not very interested in being famous. It's good to make up for lost time, all the years I didn't earn money. But the fame \u2026 You can keep that. Not bothered.\"</p> <p>Of course this is the sort of thing it's easy for an artist to say once they're successful. And if it came from a younger musician, you'd smile and nod and think: sure. Rumer, though, gives the impression of someone fairly honestly processing two bountiful but stressful years that followed a decade of meandering \u2013 polishing cutlery, cooking for hippies, handing out popcorn.</p> <p>\"There are good points and bad points to coming in late in the game,\" she says. \"You adapt better when you're younger, you let it mould you. But I can't let it mould me because I already know what's real. I know what it's like to sit on the tube, going round and round on the Circle Line not wanting to get off and go to work. I know what it's like to wonder: where's my life going? To feel like you're getting older.\"</p> <p>At this the waiter swoops in to take our plates, pleased to have a nugget of information to deliver. The Union opened in 1990, he tells us. Not a great fact, but Rumer checks the bill to ensure it includes a decent tip.</p> <p><em>Boys Don't Cry is out now on Atlantic</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>The dilemma </strong><em>Years ago I used refillable tubes of mascara. Then this product disappeared \u2013 I assume the company realised it could make more money selling a single-use, disposable version. This is very irritating for a&#xa0;conscious consumer. </em><strong><em>Vivienne</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Lucy replies </strong>The road to a dewy complexion and smoky eyes is littered with single-use plastic receptacles, hygiene layers of yet more composite plastics, rigid boxes and over-engineered mascara wands (some with batteries and integrated mirrors). Globally the cosmetics and personal-care industry racks up some 120.8bn units of packaging a year. It is nearly all of the single-use variety. Even if make-up seems a small part of your life, its trail of debris is nearly visible from space.</p> <p>But the tub (as I'm inexpertly naming any cosmetics receptacle) doesn't generate much income for cosmetics companies. In many cases they'd like to minimise this cost in favour of greater margin. Plus, internationally, cosmetic manufacturers increasingly find themselves under pressure from governments and consumers to minimise packaging (it's not just the UK where landfill taxes are growing each year).</p> <p>If I were an eco designer I'd be looking at the world of cosmetics to make my fortune. Almost every brand is experimenting with a greener way of delivering its lotions and potions. Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, packages a range in bioplastic derived from \"sustainable\" South American sugar cane and Aveda claims to save&#xa0;more than 450 tonnes of virgin plastic per year by using post-consumer recycled plastic. Neal's Yard also follows this strategy.</p> <p>With so much eco innovation going on, I can't help thinking your much-missed mascara company was&#xa0;a bit hasty in removing your favourite product from sale. Don't be too surprised to see it back.</p> <p>While you wait for this happy day, I'm pleased to tell you that there are still refillable mascara tubes on the market such as Tana (from <a href=\"http://makkicosmetics.com\" title=\"\">makkicosmetics.com</a>). There's also a&#xa0;recently launched high-end version, Noir G de Guerlain. Its components look over-engineered to me but the headline still stands: it's refillable!</p> <p>The courageous brands challenge the very notion of cosmetics swaddled in packaging and dare to go bare. I'm thinking of the semi-naked and naked products of Lush (<a href=\"http://lush.co.uk\" title=\"\">lush.co.uk</a>). The company campaigns for environmental sanity \u2013 when it does resort to tubs, they are later converted into stationery. These are the true beauties. Sadly, Lush doesn't seem to do a refillable mascara.</p> <h2>Green crush of the week<br></h2> <p>Apparently National Nut Day, 22 October, is a&#xa0;big deal in the US, but it is tragically overlooked on these shores. Our nut consumption isn't what it could be either, according to fairtrade-nut producers <a href=\"http://www.chooseliberation.com/\">Liberation Foods.</a> Nuts and \"nutty\" legumes such as Brazil nuts, cashews, peanuts and walnuts are a helpful low-impact alternative to meat. \"A key to sustaining our planet is for the richer half of the world to switch some meat consumption to relatively unprocessed plant-based products such as nuts,\" says agri-environmental scientist Dr Donal Murphy-Bokern.

  "<h2><strong>BUZZWORDS/SLOGANS</strong></h2> <p>\"Rebuilding Britain\" will be Labour's catchphrase for Manchester 2012. The message is that Ed Miliband is not just a wonk but a man of action \u2013 the political version of Bob the Builder. Less catchy is Miliband's latest favourite word, if it can be called that, \"pre-distribution\": by which he means spending more on young people, early on, so they are equipped better for the world of work.</p> <p>The Tories will stress how difficult it is governing when there is no money (the slogan may be \"leadership in tough times\"). With Boris Johnson on the prowl, they have to gently trash the mayor of London. \"Serious people for serious times\" is a message they put out to dig at him. As for the Liberal Democrats, expect \"fairness\" and \"fair taxes\" to be themes as they desperately try to show they really are taking on the Tories.</p> <h2><strong>DODGY FRINGE PLOTS</strong></h2> <p>Johnson is not a subtle man. He has chosen to talk at a fringe meeting entitled \"Re-elected and Olympotastic\" along with Cameron's arch-critic Tim Montgomerie from the website ConHome. Johnson is expected to talk with great wit, some self-deprecation, and many references to the classics, about his brilliant summer outshining the prime minister. Meanwhile, the oh-so-coy mating games of figures in Labour and on the left of the Lib Dems will be on display. Miliband's policy man Jon Cruddas and Lord Adonis will be flashing some political leg at an event about the age of pluralism in politics at the Lib Dems, while Simon Hughes is expected to flirt wildly at the Labour conference.</p> <h2><strong>FOLLOW MY LEADER: THE BIG SPEECHES</strong></h2> <p>Cameron will need to hit the Tory sweet spot if he is to send everyone home happy \u2013 and that means avoiding incendiary issues in the shires, such as gay marriage and the green agenda. Expect him to be anti-EU, anti-wind farms, tough on crime, tough on spending. Rightwing, in other words. Miliband will need to show he will be as tough as the Tories on spending while helping low earners and the squeezed middle. Nick Clegg has to show that, after losing on electoral reform and the House of Lords, he can now fight to the death for something else: a wealth tax or Vince Cable's mansion tax?</p> <h2><strong>THE NEW GURUS</strong></h2> <p>Now that Steve Hilton is gone from No 10, gurus are pretty much out in Tory land. But in Labour land they still come and go with regularity. Not long ago Miliband was embracing Maurice (now Lord) Glasman, until he dropped a brick or two over immigration and other things. Now Australian philosopher Tim Soutphommasane is suddenly the rage. American philosopher Michael Sandel, author of <em>What Money Can't Buy</em>, will be speaking at Labour. For the Lib Dems there will be interest in Ryan Coetzee, previously of the South African Democratic Alliance, headhunted as a new adviser to Clegg.</p> <h2><strong>PARTY ANIMALS</strong><br></h2> <p>Best bashes this year: the Spectator party at the Tories and the New Statesman at Labour. News International parties are not quite what they were.</p> <h2><strong>NEW WONKS</strong><br></h2> <p>Conservative Voice, a joint venture of disaffected Tory big beasts Liam Fox and David Davis, was launched with much fanfare and, no doubt, no small amount of wincing by Cameron last week. It says it exists to help promote policy. But it might just help promote Fox and Davis, too. The Resolution Foundation is independent but with Gordon Brown's former deputy chief of staff, Gavin Kelly, at its head, Labour is likely to learn most from its work. The leftwing of the Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, is on the rise and the Social Liberal Forum's members, including the irrepressible Lord Oakeshott, will no doubt be stirring again.</p> <h2><strong>STAR TURN</strong><br></h2> <p>Nadine Dorries is warming up nicely for Tory conference. While she is unlikely to find herself on the platform, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire last week suggested the party needed a \"kill Cameron policy\". She has been quick to insist that she was talking metaphorically, but her rhetorical flourishes are set to enliven conference on the fringes.</p> <h2><strong>COLOUR SCHEMES</strong><br></h2> <p>Expect a little less of the green tree motif and a lot more of the deep dark blue of Tory yesteryear on display in Birmingham for the Conservatives \u2013 and don't look for evidence of once fashionable \"Red Tory\" ideas. Conveniently, the venue, the International Conference Centre, already has blue as its colour scheme, so there won't be any confusion.</p> <p>Some leftwing Lib Democrats were suspicious of that last year when their party conference was staged there. The purple of New Labour has been resolutely ditched. \"Red Ed\" is sticking with what he knows, though he continues to flirt with \"Blue Labour\" attachment to communities. Intriguingly, on the agenda for the Liberal Democrat conference there is a large picture of a smiling Nick Clegg \u2013 wearing a red tie. Is he trying to tell us something?</p>",
  "<p>He did it very well, did David Cameron. One of the dimensions of being prime minister at which he excels is crafting the right language and striking the appropriate tone on grave or shocking occasions or, in this case, responding on behalf of both government and country to a shockingly grave report. He delivered a model statement of penitence for what he correctly called \"the double injustice\" done to the victims of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a> stadium crush.</p> <p>It is always easier, mind, to say sorry for a disaster that was someone else's fault. The bigger test is what happens next. It is wrong to think of Hillsborough, and the disgusting conduct of some members of the South Yorkshire force, as a tragedy to be deeply regretted and then filed away as an event belonging to the distant past. It is true that stadium design has been massively improved and methods of crowd control have become more sophisticated. Football hooliganism, fear of which was a contributory factor, has largely disappeared from Britain. So a tragedy of that type is less likely to happen now.</p> <p>What cannot be said with so much confidence is that the police would never behave like that again. It would be a comfort to think that Hillsborough was an isolated example from long ago of officers attempting to conceal their own neglect and incompetence by lying about what had happened and smearing the victims of their mistakes. It would also be a false consolation. What happened at Hillsborough was not an isolated one-off, but a particularly horrific example from a pattern of policing scandals over many decades. The very long list includes multiple miscarriages of justice such as the false imprisonment of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham-six\" title=\"\">Birmingham Six</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/guildford-four\" title=\"\">Guildford Four</a>. The shooting of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/oct/01/demenezes\" title=\"\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> and the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">Ian Tomlinson</a> at the G20 protests are two more recent cases where the police made appalling errors and then tried to cover up their mistakes. Scotland Yard's failure to properly investigate the hacking scandal exposed alarming lacunae in the ethical and professional judgment of some of the most senior officers in the Met. Other officers face trials for corruptly selling information to newspapers.</p> <p>There are many dedicated men and women doing a job which can be highly demanding, often dangerous, and sometimes life-threatening, and they do it in a spirit of public service. But that cannot be said of the police as a collective. Hillsborough is a particularly grotesque illustration of a culture that to this day too often puts its own interests before those of the public it is paid to serve. Repeated scandal is what happens when you have a closed profession highly resistant to scrutiny or criticism whose default instinct is to protect its own.</p> <p>It is also the result of a failure of political will to pursue reform. The approach of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair was not to challenge police working practices or culture. For her, they were \"one of us\" and crucial allies in her epic battles with the trades unions. Mrs Thatcher responded to an earlier report about Hillsborough by telling her then home secretary, Douglas Hurd, to mute the government response to devastating evidence of police misconduct. For Tony Blair, being pro-police was a vital ingredient of being New Labour. He loaded them with many additional powers and generously increased budgets. To a reform-minded home secretary, Mr Blair once demanded: \"Do we really want a fight with the police?\"</p> <p>To see what he was frightened of, you only have to look at the trade union of their rank-and-file officers, the Police Federation. Visiting the Federation's annual conference is the scariest date in the home secretary's diary. Earlier in the year, they boorishly humiliated Theresa May when she tried to make her voice heard through the booing and heckling. She should not take that personally. They dealt out the same treatment to Labour home secretaries too.</p> <p>Millions of employees in the private sector have learnt that there is no longer such a thing as a \"job for life\" while millions in the public sector have been challenged to justify their existence. Working practices have been revolutionised; organisations radically restructured; pay and conditions dramatically changed. Teachers, nurses, ambulance drivers, doctors, local authority workers and firefighters have all felt bracing blasts of government-driven change. The big exception has been the police.</p> <p>There has been some progress, including a serious effort to purge racism since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case</a>. But compared with everyone else, the police are the last unreformed public service.</p> <p>Because Labour prime ministers tend to become nervous of looking anti-police, it probably takes Conservative ministers to reform the forces of law and order. David Cameron and Theresa May made a bold start when they commissioned the first fundamental review of police pay and practices in 30 years by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/27/tom-winsor-chief-inspector-constabulary\" title=\"\">Tom Winsor</a>, the former rail regulator. They have also demonstrated a seriousness of intent about implementing his recommendations by making him chief inspector of constabulary, an appointment which has provoked fierce outrage in the ranks. When he takes up the post this autumn, it will be the first time that the role has been performed by someone from outside the police since its creation in 1856.</p> <p>The government has also set great store by the novelty of elected police and crime commissioners, the most dramatic change in police governance ever. Making chief constables accountable to commissioners, so it is believed, will challenge the whole culture of policing. Forces will have someone independent constantly looking over their shoulders. One minister who is an enthusiast for commissioners says: \"What would have happened in South Yorkshire in 1989 had there been an elected person in charge? Their whole purpose in life would have been to find out what the hell happened.\"</p> <p>I would certainly hope so, but there are problems with the commissioners even before a single one is in post. The quality of the candidates is patchy, ranging from people with the potential to be excellent invigilators to old party hacks. The number of people turning out to vote is going to be abysmal because, when the original timetable slipped, the government took a crazy decision to make these standalone elections in the inclement month of November rather than combine them with the county council elections next May. Most informed people I talk to, including those running the campaigns, reckon they will be lucky if turnout averages 15%. Commissioners elected on such a small vote may have legitimacy issues which will embolden the police to try to ignore them.</p> <p>An even more important question is whether the Winsor reforms can be pushed through against the ferocious hostility of many officers. They don't like his proposal to widen the pool of talent from which police leaders are drawn by allowing direct entry into the higher ranks, breaking the tradition that all officers must start out as a beat constable. Another resisted reform is that officers should be rewarded for their skills, performance and hours spent on the front line rather than the length of service. Were we talking about any other part of the public sector, ministers could just get on and implement these changes. They can't do this with the police because of the no-strike deal. So the fate of Mr Winsor's most crucial recommendations are being determined by a body called the police arbitration tribunal.</p> <p>On top of which, the minister most passionate about reform has just quit. <a href=\"http://www.nickherbert.com/\" title=\"\">Nick Herbert,</a> who had a real zeal for the challenge, left the government in the recent reshuffle. He has been replaced by <a href=\"http://www.damiangreenmp.org.uk/galleryflash.aspx?id=25\" title=\"\">Damian Green</a>, who was moved to the police brief from immigration, and must think that all the clich\u00e9s about the frying pan and the fire apply. A few years back, Mr Green was the target of a ludicrously misconceived police operation when officers raided the MP's home and parliamentary offices. So Mr Green is probably not the sort to go soft on police reform. In the end, though, the outcome of this battle will most depend on the mettle of his seniors, the home secretary and the prime minister. The police never come quietly. As one former chief constable puts it, there is an \"inbuilt conservatism\" about the service which makes it \"often risk-averse, process-dominated and defensive.\" It is a big thing for governments to take on the police, which is why ministers have so rarely done it.</p> <p>David Cameron demonstrated how accomplished he can be at making a pitch-perfect parliamentary statement with his eloquent apology for Hillsborough. Getting the police to accept and implement reform will require different leadership skills. This will be a test of how much steel there is in his spine.</p>",
  "<p>Chinese leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping has reappeared in public following an unexplained two-week absence.</p> <p>His impromptu speech on Saturday ended an absence that had sparked rumours about his health and raised questions about the stability of the country's succession process.</p> <p>In a brief English-language report that broke the official silence on his whereabouts, the Xinhua news agency said the vice-president arrived at China Agricultural University in the morning for activities to mark National Science Popularisation Day.</p> <p>A picture on the government's website showed a healthy-looking Xi, with a slight smile and wearing a black informal jacket over a white shirt, walking around the university. A second picture, from Xinhua, showed a relaxed, laughing and gesticulating Xi inspecting some ears of corn.</p> <p>Sources said Xi hurt his back while swimming earlier this month and that he had been obeying doctors' orders to get bed rest and undergo physiotherapy. Xi had not been seen publicly since 1 September, when he made a speech at the ruling Communist party's official training academy.</p> <p>Since then, he has cancelled meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries including the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton; the Singapore prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong; and the Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. The Chinese government has yet to explain Xi's public absence.</p> <p>Speculation over Xi's absence highlights the scrutiny China's succession process is under, tempered with uneasiness about the country's opaque political system, which often seems at odds with its rising global importance. \"The leadership needs to realise how the world perceives this. They may have their own reasons for keeping secret, but it is not beneficial to China's global status and position as a world power,\" said David Zweig, an expert on Chinese politics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p> <p>Xinhua said Xi, while visiting the university, spoke about food safety and made an impromptu speech in which he praised the university for sharing science with the public.</p> <p>Xi is due to take over as head of the Communist party at a leadership congress this year, the first step in a generational power transition that will see him assume the presidency next spring, embarking on what is expected to be a decade at the helm of the world's most populous nation.</p>",
  "<p>If ever there was a tale of two diaries, it's now. Both Edwina Currie and Sally Burton are to publish diaries \u2013 the former, her second volume, the latter, those of her husband, the late actor Richard. Both tomes exude a background hum of ulterior motivation so obvious that it's almost delicious.</p> <p>First, Currie's diaries, the \"good bits\" already filleted out by the <em>Daily Mail</em>. Currie has every right to publish. In a way, I applaud her refusal to dissemble, and spare fellow politicos' blushes. Her unceasing conceit and dearth of self-awareness are also priceless. On Planet Edwina: she's only passed over for jobs because people are intimidated by her; almost every man she meets desires her; and all other women are judged on whether they have the job she wants and/or their weight. Oh, and John Major could have been \"great\" had they remained lovers.</p> <p>Currie muses: \"If I'd stayed by his side, would he have retained his imagination, the drive and risk-taking ability?\" Edwina, pet, who knows? What we do know is that she used the \"I bonked Major\" line to flog the first set of diaries. This time, despite the fact that the relationship is over, Currie doesn't stop rattling on about Major. Everything he says and does is viewed through the Currie filter of \"I've seen you naked\". Jeez \u2013 if ever a man was punished for his infidelity. No wonder Major has spent most of his post-PM life hiding behind cricket stumps.</p> <p>But never mind him. After enduring it the first time around, his wife Norma has to be wounded and humiliated afresh, just to hawk Edwina's diaries. After seeing Norma somewhere, Edwina writes condescendingly: \"Norma looked lovely \u2013 she's really grown into her role\". Unbelievable. Note to Norma: if you ever finally exploded, and wanted to fight Edwina, may I be the first to offer to hold your coat for you.</p> <p>Moving on to Richard Burton's diaries. Dickie isn't slow with the acerbic one-liners (Marlon Brando is a \"self-indulgent obese fart\"; Lucille Ball \"a monster of staggering charmlessness\"). Then there is the Liz Taylor circus. Sally has previously vented her irritation about this, and who could blame her? Imagine having your life defined by your late husband's former wife (twice), relentlessly banging on about their \"grand amour\", as if you were just the housekeeper who came in at the end to run his baths, and heat up the Ovaltine?</p> <p>For Sally, LT must have been the ultimate nightmare ex \u2013 an old flame that just wouldn't go out however many damp tea towels you tried to throw over it. Saying that, one suspects that Sally may be being a tad disingenuous about wanting these diaries published to show Burton's \"love for words\". While the diaries relate Burton's big passion for Taylor they also reveal that he disparaged, ridiculed and despaired of her towards the end, while he was with Sally - writing that Liz was fat, \"sloshed\", \"lonely\", a \"mess\", \"losing her teeth\", \"beginning to bore.\"</p> <p>The suspicion forms that Sally's unspoken motivation was to derail, once and for all, the Liz-Dickie show. To demonstrate that, despite all those tales of Burton's sending secret final love letters to Taylor, in which he wrote of yearning to \"come home\" to her, in truth, he had gone right off her, and, considering what he was writing, near despised her. To my mind, this none-too-subtle attempt to undermine the Burton/Taylor-myth looks a bit vindictive \u2013 especially considering that Taylor is dead now, and can't flash those violet eyes, and open that fabulous fishwife mouth, in reply.</p> <p>So, what we have here are two women producing books, both with somewhat unsavoury agendas, with the result of either hurting a woman who is still alive (Norma), or having a vengeful pop at one who is dead (Taylor). A tale of two diaries, indeed. Well played, ladies.</p> <h2>Please tell me it's not true about Vlad the imposter </h2> <p>How disappointing to learn that Vladimir Putin has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19591179\" title=\"\">admitted to staging </a>some of his infamous Action Man stunts. It seems that antics such as <a href=\"http://travel.aol.co.uk/2012/09/14/putin-admits-his-tiger-shooting-stunt-was-staged/\" title=\"\">frolicking with a snow leopard </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/12/vladimir-putin-greek-urns-ridicule\" title=\"\">diving to retrieve Greek urns</a> might have been a tad contrived to make him look good.</p> <p>What a shame for those of us who relished Putin's displays of machismo. Who could forget him overcoming a judo rival in that totally natural unforced-seeming way? Or such images as Putin, topless on horse; Putin, topless with hunting rifle; Putin, topless fishing and, my personal favourite: Putin, topless in weird hat, while fishing and looking sternly into mid-distance. There really was something for everybody.</p> <p>To think that this was all put on, and Putin wasn't just casually going about his daily business, topless, with random fishing rods, rifles, leopards and Greek urns \u2013 which just happened to be lying around \u2013 is a bitter blow. To make amends, Putin should put out a sexy 2013 calendar, perhaps called Just Putin or Vlad Unveiled. The August shot could be of him, topless, imprisoning Pussy Riot. Don't be shy, Vladimir, show those One Direction upstarts how it's done.</p> <h2>Is bread good for you? Use your loaf</h2> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nutrition.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Nutrition Foundation</a> report says that it's fine to eat bread, even white bread \u2013 it doesn't wreck blood sugar, or trigger obesity or wheat allergies. In response, there's been criticism of the BNF, for their links with food companies. It also bears mentioning that most modern bread has about as close a resemblance to what was once our daily staple as a wimple does to a vajazzle.</p> <p>Still it's oddly refreshing to see bread not receive its customary bashing as the anti-Christ of baked goods. Personally, I don't like white bread because it tastes like bad cake. Nor do I care for gluten-free bread, which I know some people have to eat, but I find the texture akin to loft-cladding.</p> <p>However, what I dislike most are the bread-deniers. People who pointedly push away bread baskets in restaurants, as if they've been offered sliced strychnine. These are often the same people who fall for any old \"health\" baloney, seemingly validated by new ways of eating strangely (\"I eat zero carbs, therefore I am\"). The type who approach dieting as a sinister cult, and are suckers for gurus with The Answer.</p> <p>In truth, there seems nothing inherently wrong with most bread, otherwise the baguette-obsessed French would be in trouble, as opposed to regularly ranking among the slimmest in Europe.</p> <p>What may be wrong is binge-eating 15 slices of toast and jam, all washed down with four litres of fizzy Cola \u2013 but that's enough of my last dinner party. As is so often the case, it's the overeating that's the problem, not what's being eaten. (Who knew?)</p> <p>With this in my mind, please look out for my forthcoming global diet sensation: \"Hey, perhaps we shouldn't eat so much crapola. Just saying!\"</p> <p>DVD and exercise ball to follow, naturally.</p>",
  "<p>Vince Cable's business investment bank, announced last week as part of the coalition's latest stab at an industrial strategy, was yet another desperate attempt to bypass the broken British banking system that remains one of the major obstacles to economic recovery.</p> <p>Project Merlin, the painfully choreographed deal between Cable, George Osborne and the biggest banks announced in February last year, was meant to result in a surge of new loans to small businesses; yet net lending continued to fall.</p> <p>Osborne used his autumn party conference speech last year to promise a new policy of \"credit easing\", launched as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/20/george-osborne-scheme-boost-lending\" title=\"\">National Loan Guarantee Scheme in March this year</a>. Not all the banks agreed to participate; the negotiations with lenders about how they would pass on cheaper borrowing costs from the Treasury were long and fraught; and again, nothing happened.</p> <p>A few months later, at the annual Mansion House dinner, Osborne and Sir Mervyn King used their speeches to the black-tie-wearing dignitaries to announce yet another scheme, known as<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/13/george-osborne-funding-for-lending-scheme\" title=\"\"> funding for lending</a> (or FLS), aimed at cutting the cost of borrowing for the banks and persuading them to lend.</p> <p>It's too soon to say whether FLS is having an impact, since it was only launched in July \u2013 though there is some evidence in the housing market of a modest decline in mortgage rates, and a rise in loan-to-value ratios, as a result of government intervention.</p> <p>However, the fact that the Treasury is willing to countenance setting up a new state-backed institution to lend to businesses suggests there remains deep anxiety in Downing Street about the pace of business lending.</p> <p>And if companies are still struggling to borrow, it doesn't just matter because it puts jobs at risk and delays Britain's recovery in the short-term, but because the kind of adjustment the economy must make \u2013 from finance to industry, domestic consumption to exports \u2013 requires a radical transfer of resources. That can't happen if the financial plumbing is blocked.</p> <p>All the suggestions are that, just like another of Cable's cherished ideas, the Green Investment Bank, the new institution will be hemmed in by tight financial restrictions imposed by a nervous Treasury that believes governments should not be in banking.</p> <p>But a new report by the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), due to be published later this week, suggests that \u00a340bn would be the minimum size worth bothering with if the new bank is to make a serious difference to the economy, and urges Osborne to allow it to raise funds on capital markets to boost its lending power to \u00a3100bn.</p> <p>Like Cable, the IPPR's Tony Dolphin sees the bank as a solution to some of Britain's long-term economic problems, rather than a rapid cure for the slump. It could help to boost investment levels, for example, which are far too low in the UK relative to our international rivals, at just 15% of GDP. A state-backed bank could also take a more long-sighted approach than small firms are accustomed to seeing from high street lenders, with their computerised loan models and centralised management.</p> <p>So Cable is to be encouraged for floating the idea, and we should wish him luck as he tries to persuade the Treasury to be bold; but it also serves to underline the unfortunate truth that Britain's banking system is failing \u2013 and for two reasons.</p> <p>The first is a direct legacy of the boom-bust cycle of the past 10 years. The big four banks, which control an extraordinary 75% of the small business market, still have billions of pounds' worth of assets on their books from the happy-go-lucky days before the Great Recession, when they lent so freely to everyone from first-time buyers with no wage slips to show to the cash-strapped Greek and Spanish governments.</p> <p>The Bank of England's financial policy committee has expressed concern about what has popularly become known as \"extend and pretend\" \u2013 the banks' practice of showing lenience to borrowers who can't make repayments, rather than write down the value of their loans and face the knock-on effects across their balance sheets.</p> <p>That's a relief to struggling debtors, whether homeowners or companies; but the banks will remain reluctant to make new loans while they're loaded up with dodgy debts from the past. And it means the risk remains of another hugely costly taxpayer bailout if the economy fails to recover.</p> <p>Secondly, the flip side of Cable's argument \u2013 that a state-backed investment bank could take a longer-term approach and help to boost investment levels \u2013 is that despite Britain's banking sector being one of the largest relative to the size of the economy of any developed country, it has failed to channel savers' funds into productive, long-term investments that boost the economy's growth potential.</p> <p>Instead, as <a href=\"http://www.cresc.ac.uk/publications/an-alternative-report-on-uk-banking-reform\" title=\"\">the work of the Cresc group of economists</a> has shown, banks devoted themselves to recycling cash around the financial system \u2013 or, as Martin Wheatley, who will be boss of the new Financial Conduct Authority pointed out <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2012/0905-mw.shtml\" title=\"\">recently</a>, trying to flog consumers risky products they didn't need.</p> <p>This government, like the last, has been far too timid in getting a grip on the style, culture and scale of British banking, despite owning a large part of the industry as a result of the bailouts of RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. All power to Cable's elbow \u2013 but building a shiny new lender with his name above the door won't give Britain's businesses the banks they deserve.</p>",
  "<p><strong>In your new book, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/07/david-byrne-how-music-works?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"><strong><em>How Music Works</em></strong></a><strong>, you begin by asserting that context is an overlooked element in creativity\u2026</strong></p> <p>Context is much more important and ubiquitous than I'd realised. Forces that you might think are utterly unrelated to creativity can have a big impact. Technology obviously, but environment too. Even financial structures can affect the actual content of a song. The making of music is profoundly affected by the market.</p> <p><strong>That sounds close to a Marxist reading of music production.</strong></p> <p>[Laughs] Well, Marx is having a comeback. I hear him mentioned a lot in terms of the global financial situation and the general sense of injustice out there. A lot of economic experts in America refer to him without actually using the M word, but he's around.</p> <p><strong>The notion that environment determines creativity is interesting in terms of the audience as well as the performer. </strong></p> <p>Oh, yeah. I write about certain venues in the book, from a dingy New York dive like CBGB, where Talking Heads played their early shows, to auditoriums or opera houses or the great outdoors. All those physical contexts affect the way music is played and heard. That is self-evident to me.</p> <p><strong>What about your notion that musicians are almost programmed to make music for certain contexts and formats? </strong></p> <p>That's where it gets interesting, yes. With pop music, the format dictates the form to a big degree. Just think of the pop single. It has endured as a form even in the download age because bands conform to a strict format, and work, often very productively, within the parameters. Dance music stretched that form with the extended remix but it's the form that drives the content as much as the other way around.</p> <p><strong>You believe that context is of equal importance as having something to say or expressing emotions?</strong></p> <p>Yes. Emotion is moulded by the format, too. The format is the starting point. It pre-exists. In a 3 minute pop song, the form exists first to the point where we hardly even acknowledge it. In an interview format, say, the journalist and the musician tend to talk about the meaning of a song in terms of the lyrical or emotional force. That is often elevated above the form, but, to me, the two are of equal importance. A song might be about a divorce or a death or whatever, but the emotion is always expressed within the form. The two are of equal importance.</p> <p><strong>How does that apply to maverick geniuses like Sun Ra, say, or Ornette Coleman, where the song is, to say the least, a very flexible concept?</strong></p> <p>Oh yeah. They are the beautiful exceptions. Unconventional geniuses. There is a great beauty in their music because they think differently about the form and the idea of composition. They are working so far beyond the things that we take for granted. I mean, you could not point to a Sun Ra song and say, \"Oh yeah, that's the one about the divorce\".</p> <p><strong>You lay out the ground rules for creating a music \"scene\": the right venue to suit the music; an audience that is alienated from the prevailing music culture; cheap drinks. You seem to like rules. </strong></p> <p>That surprised me too. In writing this book, I realised I'm very fond of rules. I was really interested in discovering the underlying conditions that generate a scene.</p> <p><strong>Do they still apply in today's music culture? </strong></p> <p>Yes, the word certainly gets out a lot quicker now about the hip new band.There has been a huge change in the way music is discovered and then disseminated in the past decade. It used to be so word-of-mouth and you had to seek stuff out that you heard or read about. So in terms of creating a scene I do think something has probably been lost. One of the benefits of playing to small audiences in small clubs for a few years is that you're allowed to fail. For Talking Heads I can&#xa0;now see that was a crucial element&#xa0;in our development. But things move very fast now. Groups do seem to come and go.</p> <p><strong>Yet people still gravitate towards a scene\u2026</strong></p> <p>People still need a scene, yes. But now it could grow around a person making incredible music on a laptop in their room. And yet there's something about the communal thing, the performance thing that draws people to go out and see a band. As people feel isolated in the online world, perhaps they need that more. Physical contact is a human necessity. That's my sense of what's happening as I travel around. There are still lots of little scenes, all vibrant in their own way, all based around performing.</p> <p><strong>Could you envisage a scene like punk ever happening again? Something that had a wider cultural significance than just playing and consuming music.</strong></p> <p>I could see something like punk, yes. Not the same, of course, but some kind of eruption. I mean, with the economy tanking and that sense of anger that was around the whole Occupy thing ... But I think punk was also about young people being completely alienated from the music around them. There was a sense of cultural, as well as economic discomfort.</p> <p><strong>The music you made with Talking Heads is still one of the touchstones for a lot of the \u2013 how shall I put it \u2013 artier young groups. Do you have a young audience coming to your gigs, though? </strong></p> <p>I meet young people who know me and are familiar with my stuff. They know the package. They might have cherry-picked five or six key tunes. That's how it seems to work. I sometimes wonder if they realise they are not getting the whole context.</p> <p><strong>The album?</strong></p> <p>Yeah. The album was a context too, of course. You lose a lot of the world view if you just cherry pick songs. The experiential thing is entirely different.</p> <p><strong>In one chapter you cite a feature on <em>Pitchfork</em> that criticised you for collaborating with anyone and everyone at the drop of a hat. Any truth in their accusation?</strong></p> <p>I guess so. But I like collaborating. It's what music has always been essentially about. Even a band is a collaboration. I do like collaborations that are unlikely and therefore might yield interesting results. But I would have to say that there have</p> <p>been some that have not worked as well as others.</p> <p><strong>Any real disasters?</strong></p> <p>There was one with Paul van Dyke, the techno DJ. I sent back his track to him at the wrong speed. Accidentally. It was a technical glitch. It had been reconfigured by the software and I didn't know it had happened. The thing is, I liked it but, perhaps unsurprisingly, he didn't. The boundaries are pretty fixed in that kind of dance music.</p> <p><strong>You've collaborated with Brian Eno both as a solo artist and with Talking Heads.Could you sum up his way of working?</strong></p> <p>Probably not [laughs]. He's good at making suggestions. Often with a band, he will come in and make a few sweeping changes quickly, then leave the room. It can be disorienting at first but he definitely has a transformative impact. No one else I have encountered has it in the same way.</p> <p><strong>Your </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/08/david-byrne-st-vincent\" title=\"\"><strong>new collaboration with St Vincent </strong></a><strong> (<em>Love This Giant</em>, released last week) is a concept album insofar as all the songs are built around a brass band. Do you still think in terms of albums? </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I do, which probably makes me old-fashioned. And a concept album? That's a kind of scary term.</p> <p><strong>It runs counter to the prevailing drift in which the listener-consumer seems to have a curatorial role, picking and choosing songs from the past and the present. How do you feel about that? </strong></p> <p>With pop music now, it sometimes feels like the end of history. You can shuffle and reconfigure continuously. But it's interesting that in the midst of all this technologically-driven creativity there is a surge towards performance. In a way, we're going back to how it was before there was recording technology, when the song or piece of music existed only in performance and&#xa0;reinterpretation. People seem to want the communality of the live experience. They want to get out and be together as opposed to sitting alone, looking at a screen. The neurologist, Oliver Sacks, says that music is something that is never an isolated thing. You can organise a group and play and it can make you feel better in all sorts of ways. It can spread out into your whole life. That's an incredible thing.</p> <p><strong>What is the biggest change in pop music in your lifetime? </strong></p> <p>Wow. That's a big one. I've just been talking about the surge towards performance but with a lot of music being produced now, you don't need to be a performer at all. When we formed Talking Heads, everyone had to be a performer. That's no longer the case. I mean, just the laptop scene. People make incredible music without ever setting foot on a stage. Or outside their bedroom. That's a great thing too. It means you don't even have to have an image. We forget how important the look was to punk and to glam or whatever. The look was the attitude as much as the music. The look was a kind of context too.</p>",
  "<p>It's hard to imagine a less glamorous interview location than the little room where I meet Ashley Jensen to talk about her new play in the West End. Hidden away in the bowels of a gloomy old youth club in south London, the room smells overpoweringly of damp. Wires dangle down through missing ceiling tiles. Apparently there was a flood in here a few weeks ago. Jensen wrinkles her nose when she comes in. \"This is a horrid little room, isn't it?\"</p> <p>She's happy to be here though. Upstairs, she's been rehearsing her part in an Alan Ayckbourn play directed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/trevor-nunn\" title=\"\">Trevor Nunn</a>. In <a href=\"http://achorusofdisapproval.com/\" title=\"\"><em>A Chorus of Disapproval</em></a>, she plays the wife of an amateur operatic society director who is struggling to stage The Beggar's Opera in a middle England town. Rob Brydon (\"absolutely brilliant\u2026 such a team player\") is the husband; Nigel Harman, formerly of <em>EastEnders</em>, plays the handsome newcomer whose arrival stimulates more drama than anyone's bargained for.</p> <p>Jensen last graced the stage 11 years ago. Since then, she's been off making a name for herself on television \u2013 she played the chronically tactless Maggie in <em>Extras</em> with Ricky Gervais and then she went off to the States to star in <em>Ugly Betty</em>, as Betty's Scottish seamstress friend Christina. After six years in Hollywood, where she married her long-term actor boyfriend <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066591/\" title=\"\">Terence Beesley</a> and had a son, she moved back to London in June and now she's relishing the chance to work in theatre again.</p> <p>\"This is the fifth week of rehearsal,\" she says, \"which is an absolute indulgence compared to TV and film. Listening to Sir Trevor Nunn on the first day talking about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gay\" title=\"\">John Gay</a> and London in the 1720s \u2013 I can't remember the last time I sat down in a working environment and talked about things like that.\"</p> <p>The glamour of Hollywood \u2013 going to the Emmys, hanging out with Ted Danson on a plane \u2013 was fun in its way but she's happy to be back in the UK, even if it means doing interviews in horrid little rooms. \"You're able to do a bit more here.

I was on that little conveyor belt and I was like, I don't know if I really want to be doing this really.\"</p> <p>After the play finishes in January, she has only a sketchy idea of what's next \u2013 possibly a movie in the Scottish Highlands with Kevin McKidd, if the funding comes through \u2013 but she seems relaxed about the future.</p> <p>If Gervais asked her to reprise her role on <em>Extras</em>, what would she say? \"I would say yes, of course I would, I'd love to don that pink beret again.

The one where he had Johnny doo-dah [Depp] on?\" Her eyes glitter mischievously. \"But it's healthy. I have very fond feelings about Extras because it was the show that changed things for me.

  "<p>One unwelcome consequence of life in a coalition, almost certainly overlooked by David Cameron and Nick Clegg when they announced their political marriage in May 2010, was that under this system there can be two leadership crises in the same government at the same time.</p> <p>Two and a half years on, neither man can ignore this awkward reality any longer. In coalitions made up of two parties, things happen in twos. When times are good both leaders benefit, but when they are bad there is double the trouble.</p> <p>After a summer in which politics was largely forgotten in a bubble of Olympic ecstasy, it is back with a vengeance and in a form more visceral and irrational than ever. Cameron and Clegg are suddenly, from almost nowhere, in the firing line; their ability to remain as leaders of their own parties and the country in question.</p> <p>MPs and activists in both governing parties are restless and some are thinking dark thoughts. Last week in the House of Commons a young Conservative backbencher, who until now would have been listed in the \"thoroughly loyal\" column on the Tory whips' office blackboard, was asked about talk of Boris Johnson being installed again as an MP so that, at the right moment, he could mount a coup and replace Cameron as leader and prime minister. \"There are lots of MPs who would fall on their swords to allow Boris in,\" said the MP. \"Things are that bad. Lots of people don't know whether they want to be here any more. People are very fed up.\" Another member of the 2010 intake \u2013 now packed with individuals who, following the reshuffle, fear they will never enter government \u2013 said merely: \"For me, it is anyone but Cameron.\"</p> <p>It is true that for every Tory MP who plays up the threat to the prime minister's leadership from Johnson or A&#xa0;N&#xa0;Other Tory there are several who will dismiss the idea out of hand. \"It is for the birds,\" said one normally vociferous critic of the prime minister. \"Look how well he did on the Hillsborough announcement. I had people coming up to me from the Labour side saying how brilliant he was, and it is true. He was. It is all bonkers.\" In Clegg's case, his MPs are more solidly supportive, though they are not uniformly so. In many respects the discipline of the Liberal Democrats is remarkable, given their position in the polls and the Tory blows they have taken over electoral reform, House of Lords reform, and now the apparent systematic throwing overboard of green policies by No 10 and the Treasury. But there are some notable Lib Dems \u2013 and not just Lord Oakeshott \u2013 who believe Clegg is now so toxic that the party will be wiped out unless it installs Vince Cable in his place well before the next election.</p> <p>Before what is bound to be a gossip-fuelled party conference season in which Lib Dem flirtation with Labour (and vice versa) will be added to the mix of plotting, irresistible visions of the future home into view. Could dishevelled Boris, with his wild and abundant blond hair, and bald Vince come together in the Rose Garden to renew the coalition? What exciting deals could be struck? Would Cable \u2013 an opponent of Heathrow expansion \u2013 back a Boris Island airport in the Thames estuary in return, perhaps, for Johnson supporting a new push on the environment, maybe with Boris bikes extended nationwide? Or, after the next election, will it be Vince and Ed (Miliband) in the \"progressive coalition\" so longed for by many on the centre left?</p> <p>As yet, the Tory insurgency against Cameron is small and incoherent. Around a dozen MPs are believed to have signed a letter to Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, calling for a leadership contest, although he refused to tell anyone what the number was at a meeting of the executive last week.</p> <p>Another 15 to 20 are believed to be considering doing so, but, in the words of one colleague, \"will almost certainly be too cowardly when it comes to it\". Brady must have 46 letters before a leadership contest is triggered. The word is that the dozen signatories are from all wings of the parliamentary party, reflecting a spectrum of discontent. The right wants Cameron to give a referendum on Europe and commit to the seizing back of more powers from Brussels. It is unhappy with the pro-EU Lib Dems and wants taxes cut and spending slashed even more. The left, on the other hand, is fed up that much of Cameron's \"modernisation\" agenda (including green policies) has been abandoned and at the self-inflicted damage of unpopular health service reforms.</p> <p>Many Tory MPs say that following months of U-turns they do not know what to tell their constituents to believe in any more. They complain that the party has no direction. But even among the most critical there is, to date, no sign of a united view emerging about who might take on Cameron. The mini-revolt is more an expression of broad unhappiness than a well-formed plot with a clear plan of action behind it. Some like the idea of Johnson as leader because he would cheer up the party and be, initially at least, massively more popular in the country. Others from the right would like to see former defence secretary Liam Fox or David Davis taking over. There is also an idea being put around that a unity candidate might run and Brady's name is being mentioned. Such ideas provoke wildly mixed reactions. \"I like old Graham,\" said one senior Tory. \"But that is mad. He's a real plodder.\" The lack of coherence is, however, no reason for Cameron to rest easy. The leadership issue will not go away. As we report, Johnson, fresh from outshining Cameron at the post-Olympics rally, is planning a series of appearances both at the Tory party conference in Birmingham next month and afterwards during which he will focus on his successes in 2012 \u2013 securing re-election as London mayor in May and fronting the Olympics. The theme will be how Tories (under Johnson) can win against Labour when there is not much money around and how they can organise things (under Johnson) better than anyone else in the world. While the mayor will cast it all in a loyal frame, he \u2013 not Cameron \u2013 will be the darling of the conference.</p> <p>Downing Street is edgy, to say the least, and its dismissive line that \"serious times require serious people\" is not likely to help. Johnson is bound to milk his conference appearance to the maximum. He will arrive on the Monday and attend a rally and a fringe, amid huge media attention. In the evening he is due to speak at an event staged by the ConservativeHome website, which is edited by Tim Montgomerie, a regular critic of Cameron. The event is entitled \"Boris Johnson's 2012. Re-elected and Olympotastic\". Then on Tuesday he will speak to conference once more on the themes of how to win in austerity and how to get re-elected against Labour. Provocative?</p> <p>The mayor's biographer Andrew Gimson, author of <em>Boris \u2013 the Rise of Boris Johnson</em>, believes it is. It would, he says, be \"quite out of character\" for Johnson to miss this chance to upstage Cameron. \"These occasions are perfect for such an operation: you have hundreds of journalists with nothing much to write about except for dreary speeches by careerists who reckon the way to get to the top is to stay on message. Boris reckons the way to get to the top is to go off message.\" The pattern of Johnson causing trouble was set at Cameron's first conference as Tory leader, in Bournemouth in 2006. Cameron praised the TV chef Jamie Oliver. Johnson then told a fringe meeting: \"If I were in charge, I would get rid of Jamie Oliver and tell people to eat what they like.\" Again in 2009, he infuriated the leadership by playing to the Eurosceptic gallery with calls for a referendum, just as Cameron was trying to sweep the issue under the carpet in the runup to the general election. Finally, on 7&#xa0;November, Johnson will address the 1922 Committee, where another thunderous reception can be expected, at the invitation of Brady.</p> <p>Johnson's autumn addresses will unsettle Cameron, who is already worried that others around him, including education secretary Michael Gove, are manoeuvring. A cabinet minister said last week that the word was that the PM deliberately sacked two of Gove's ministers in the reshuffle without his say so because Gove had leaked several policy stories without telling No 10 first. It was a message about who was running the show.</p> <p>With both party leaders vulnerable, the party conference season presents them with tactical challenges and dilemmas. Some in the Tory party think the threat from Johnson will make Cameron move further to the right and persuade him to take harder lines on Europe, on immigration and on crime, while backing deeper spending cuts to get the deficit-cutting strategy back on track. The reason would be to buy some time with the parliamentary party, where the right is larger and more vociferous than the left. But that approach will have other knock-on effects that will not help the prime minister and the coalition.</p> <p>Most of all it will make it even more difficult for Clegg to persuade his party that it can deliver on Lib Dem values and policies in a coalition with Cameron's rightward-drifting Tories. At the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, which begins on Saturday, Clegg will have to stand firm against Cameron on Europe, on the environment, on civil liberties, on preventing further cuts in welfare, because if he doesn't his party could well ask whether it is all worth it, and turn against him.</p> <p>And where will it turn? Increasingly, perhaps, towards Cable, who is beginning to talk more and more with Labour about future co-operation. Those text exchanges with Ed Balls will become more regular. The real problem for Cameron and Clegg is that, in seeking to keep their own parties united behind them in the face of leadership threats, they may have to take them in opposite directions. The bigger question then becomes whether the coalition can survive the strain.</p>",
  "<p>Congratulations to Rowan Moore for exposing one contradiction at the heart of the house building mantra (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/rowan-moore-planning-laws-economy\" title=\"\">We need proper planning, not jerry-built economics</a>\" (Comment). There are two others in the government's objectives. First, they say they aim to emulate the 1930s, but to the extent that house building did, for a few years, raise levels of growth at that time, it was in the context of unprecedented levels of protectionism.</p> <p>Second, the government wants to encourage private development for owner occupation and they rail against \"restrictive\" targets for \"affordable\" housing. But the root of the housing crisis is inequality. There are 750,000 empty homes in Britain and about the same number of second homes.</p> <p>The top 250,000 households have eight or more rooms per person, while the average figure is 2.22 rooms per person and the median is 1.88. Officially 100,000 people in the UK are homeless (charities place the figure much higher).</p> <p>The alternatives to unplanned private development are major changes to property taxes, renewal and maintenance of existing housing stock and, where necessary, council building of social rented homes. Councils and other providers should use local direct labour, including proper youth apprentices and conditions. Such a programme could make a real contribution to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Dr Helen Mercer</strong></p> <p>Business School</p> <p>University of Greenwich</p> <h2><strong>Eating steak can save lives</strong></h2> <p>Despite being a beef farmer, I enjoyed Ed Vulliamy's viewpoint on vegetarianism (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/08/my-life-as-a-vegetarian?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Fifty years as a vegetarian show me it's the way to stay close to nature</a>\", Viewpoint). However, much of western Britain is only really suitable for growing grass. The best way to convert grass into food is by grazing it with livestock to produce milk and meat. Increasingly, farms (including this one) are using rare breed cattle and sheep to maintain and enhance the environment for wildlife, often as part of stewardship schemes overseen by Natural England, and to provide food with greater nutritional benefits.</p> <p>On this farm we are supported by the RSPB, the Wildlife Trust and Leaf (Linking Environment And Farming).

  "<p>As Brian McDermott told his life story at Reading's training ground it was hard to reconcile the image of the talented teenager he talked about \"fighting the demons\" at Arsenal, or the retired footballer that signed on the dole before applying for a job he knew nothing about, with a man who seems so comfortable in his own skin that it was no surprise to hear he felt completely at ease at his first Premier League managers' meeting last month.</p> <p>\"Sir Alex Ferguson, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Roberto Di Matteo and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas were there \u2013 I spoke to them all,\" McDermott says. \"That was a hundred times easier walking into there than it was walking into the Arsenal dressing room years ago. I'll never forget when I first did that \u2013 I was trying to compete with these people and I didn't feel on a level. Don't get me wrong, I'm not on a level with some of these managers. All I'm saying is that I'm comfortable going into that environment.\"</p> <p>McDermott, 51, is a man without an ego, full of self-deprecating anecdotes and clearly in love with his job. He knows the club he has worked at for the past 12 years inside out and he speaks with total conviction about his approach to management, which is not surprising given his remarkable record since he replaced Brendan Rodgers in December 2009.</p> <p>McDermott dragged the club clear of the relegation zone that season and got Reading to a first FA Cup quarter-final in 83 years. The following year Reading reached the play-off final, and the last eight of the FA Cup again. Last season Reading were promoted as champions, despite selling Shane Long, their leading scorer, and Matt Mills, the captain, the previous summer.</p> <p>It has been an extraordinary two and a half years, although life has not always been so satisfying for McDermott, who cringes at the memory of how things unravelled when he hung up his boots. \"When I came back from playing in Hong Kong [in the early 1990s], I had two weeks where I signed on. I got \u00a340 a week,\" he says. \"I don't know why I did it. I think I was told 'You've paid all your tax ...' I went to a Post Office, it was absolutely horrendous. That's the only two weeks I've been out of work.</p> <p>\"I went for an interview at Pitney Bowes to sell franking machines. This guy interviewed me and I was so useless. I didn't have a clue about anything he was talking about. He said: 'Where do you see yourself in five years?' which is a question I hate anyway. I said: 'I wanna be like you.' I didn't even know what he did.</p> <p>\"I didn't have that much money at the time because you didn't earn much in those days. A guy that I bought my pension from asked me to work with him in London. I went on a sales course for two weeks and I sold pensions and insurance. It was a great year as far as learning what I didn't want to do.\"</p> <p>Football has always been McDermott's natural home. He was good enough to make his debut for Arsenal in 1979 at the age of 17 but was gripped by self-doubt in a dressing room of household names. \"I was always fighting the demons in an Arsenal shirt and the longer I stayed there, the more accepting I was of the fact that I was never going to be a regular,\" he says. \"I played 70-odd games and the crowd liked me because I came off the bench now and again and scored a goal. But I was kind of comfortable in that environment where I was in and out.</p> <p>\"I'd approach it completely differently now. Talent-wise, I had no problem. But mentally I would work a lot harder. I wouldn't let what people said affect me. It's really important how you say things because people won't necessarily remember what words you used but they'll remember how you made them feel. I know a lot of the time I didn't feel great about myself when I was playing. I played for one particular manager who made it his business every day to make my life miserable and a number of other players as well.\"</p> <p>McDermott had a nomadic career that included playing in Sweden, where he was named player of the year in 1984, and winning promotion with Oxford, Cardiff and Exeter. After retiring and enduring the disaster that was selling pensions, he joined his local club, Slough Town, where he set up their Football in the Community scheme before taking over as manager. He eventually moved on to Woking but was sacked in 2000.</p> <p>Later that year McDermott received a phone call from Alan Pardew, the Reading manager at the time, offering him the positions of chief scout and Under\u201117 manager. He threw himself into both roles and during his time as chief scout, travelling Europe and beyond, became friendly with Villas-Boas, who will be in the opposite dug-out when Reading host Tottenham on Sunday.</p> <p>\"I remember seeing Andr\u00e9, who was Chelsea's chief scout, at Levski Sofia,\" McDermott says. \"I thought he was texting someone on his BlackBerry but he was doing stuff on it constantly so I went up and spoke to him. He told me he was doing his scouting report. That was the first time I'd ever seen that. I used to write it down, go back to the hotel and type it up. I looked at Andr\u00e9 and thought 'I've got to get good at that', so I started to do the same. I've got about 1,000 games on my BlackBerry.\"</p> <p>McDermott had an impressive record as a scout. He discovered Long and Kevin Doyle, back in his native Ireland, as well as several others that excelled under Steve Coppell, although there was a sense that outside the club in particular he never got the credit he deserved. He shakes his head. \"Credit? Just give it away, I'm genuinely not bothered. Once people start thinking about credit, that's when you have a problem. I don't believe in an 'all-about-me' culture. It's about the group.\"</p> <p>That has been McDermott's mantra ever since his appointment as manager. Reading have made great strides but McDermott is always pushing for more. He has visited Google and Mindshare to give speeches but also to find out about the way they operate while his bedtime reading \u2013 Rob Yeung's The Extra One Per Cent and Matthew Syed's Bounce \u2013 is helping him gain a better understanding of the mental side that tormented him so much when he was younger. \"Football is played there,\" McDermott says, pointing to his head.</p> <p>Well as McDermott has done at Reading, he admits he wondered if his time was up when it emerged in January that Anton Zingarevich, a Russian multi-millionaire, was taking over the club. \"When new owners come in they generally change the manager. I thought that might have been the case.</p> <p>\"Anton had his views, I had mine. We had a frank conversation and said we'll see how it goes. We've got a good working relationship now \u2013 it had to evolve and it has evolved. He's coming over for the game and he loves his football.\"</p> <p>McDermott is not the sort of manager to waste time speculating about what may or may not happen this season; the only promise he makes is that Reading will be bold and take games to their opponents, just like they did when they were unfortunate to lose 4-2 against Chelsea last month. \"If we didn't have that mentality we wouldn't have won the league last year. You don't win 15 games out of 17 by being frightened of losing,\" he says. \"We have to prove that we belong here. And I believe we do.\"</p> <p><strong>Reading v Tottenham, 4pm </strong>SS1</p>",

  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This weekly blog is for those who have been watching the new series of Doctor Who. Don\u2019t read ahead if you haven\u2019t seen episode three \u2013 A Town Called Mercy</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/sep/08/doctor-who-dinosaurs-on-spaceship\" title=\"\">Dan Martin\u2019s episode two blog</a></p> \n<h2>\u201cAnachronistic electricity, Keep Out signs, aggressive stares \u2013 has someone been peeking at my Christmas list?\u201d</h2> \n<p>Another week, another \u201cblockbusting movie poster\u201d that actually delivered on its premise, as Doctor Who did the western. And A Town Called Mercy was a proper western. One glimpse of a cyborg in this environment immediately brought to mind <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0070909/\" title=\"\">Michael Crichton\u2019s 1973 movie Westworld</a>. But while that was set in a theme park in the future, this was the real deal. With no eventual reveal that the whole thing was a spaceship, or the result of any perception filters, this was the full-blooded tale of a real town under real siege from a lone gunman \u2013 and it came complete with its own noble sheriff, the Doctor on horseback, and, irresistibly, its own High Noon moment.</p> \n<p>Writer Toby Whithouse delivered a complex morality dilemma fizzing with sharp dialogue, Adrian Scarborough\u2019s Kahler-Jex brought some British eccentricity, and director Saul Metzstein did an effective job of recreating the look of classics of the genre. If anything, A Town Called Mercy was more effective as a western than as a Doctor Who episode.</p> \n<h2>\u201cToday I honour the victims first. His, the Master\u2019s, the Daleks\u2019, all the people who died because of my mercy\u201d</h2> \n<p>One of the classic western tropes is the wounded traveller confronting his demons. Here that role fell to Kahler-Jex, reflected off the Gunslinger \u2013 with both sides of that struggle refracted through the Doctor himself. This was also the source of the episode\u2019s emotional wallop, drawing excellent performances (once again) from Matt Smith and Karen Gillan. In fact it was Gillan who emerged as the real star of the episode: pratfalling with the pistol but facing off against the Doctor.</p> \n<p>Seeing the Doctor holding a gun is never going to be a comfortable sight, but Whithouse pushed him to that point deftly \u2013 certainly with more delicacy than displayed in the previous episode\u2019s clunky business with Solomon, which was presumably designed as the build-up to this week\u2019s events. The end point, however, was worth it \u2013 with it now falling to Amy to be the Doctor\u2019s keeper. Her line: \u201cThis is what happens when you travel on your own for too long,\u201d was genuinely moving. And fans can\u2019t help but worry about what\u2019s going to happen to the Doctor when Amy\u2019s gone. Because given that she\u2019s a blown-up Dalek, Jenna-Louise Coleman\u2019s Oswin isn\u2019t going to be much immediate use.</p> \n<h2>Pond watch</h2> \n<p>The Tardis crew ended up in the Old West because the Doctor misfired in his mission to take them to the Day Of The Dead festival in Mexico. That\u2019s the sort of cultural reference Whithouse is good at, because that is <em>exactly</em> the sort of place a couple like the Ponds would choose to holiday if they had a space-time machine that made money no object. It says a lot about their changing relationship with the Doctor that he has become a travel agent for them.</p> \n<h2>Fear factor</h2> \n<p>Again, being a Whithouse script, this was full of paranoid philosophising of the kind we\u2019re used to from Being Human. Jex was great for this \u2013 I liked the \u201cWe all carry our prisons with us\u201d line in particular. But this was not really one for behind-the-sofa moments. The Gunslinger was cute as much as anything else. In the end, he found a kind of nobility.</p> \n<h2>Mysteries and questions</h2> \n<p>Well done to <strong>@FindOutForYourself</strong> in the comments for picking up the repeat pattern of the malfunctioning light-fitting. I must say I\u2019d made a link between its appearance both here and in Asylum Of The Daleks, but had completely missed the significance in Dinosaurs On a Spaceship. It seems inevitable that it will play into the Ponds\u2019 exit, since their final adventure is with the Weeping Angels. What happens when a light flickers? It goes dark and you can\u2019t see!</p> \n<p>Mind you, while we\u2019re all theorising about the terrible end possibly facing the Ponds <strong>@xandaca</strong> pointed to their \u201cfading interest\u201d in travelling with the Doctor \u2013 something that\u2019s borne out both here and in the Next Week trail.</p> \n<p>And yes, <strong>@PhaseShift</strong>, it was you who made the connection last week that maybe Oswin is <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Jagaroth\" title=\"\">a Jagaroth</a>!</p> \n<h2>Time-space debris</h2> \n<p>\u2022 A Town Called Mercy was filmed at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabernas_Desert\" title=\"\">Desert Of Tabernas</a> in Almeria, Spain, which also provided the location for A Fistful Of Dollars, and For A Few Dollars More.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cCan everyone who isn\u2019t an American please drop your weapons?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Doctor Who has been to the Wild West before, in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/gunfighters/\" title=\"\">1966 William Hartnell story The Gunfighters</a>. Whithouse did reconsider watching it, but was advised by Moffat and Mark Gatiss not to, because: \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a jewel in the crown.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 A noble and moving performance from Ben Browder as poor Isaac. Browder of course has sci-fi form as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRFqXigg_do\" title=\"\">the star of Farscape</a>.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Was anybody else a bit befuddled by the exact nature of the plan? Confuse The Gunslinger by all putting Jex tattoos on, then drive him mad by shorting his blaster with the sonic screwdriver? Surely they would have been stumped if Jex hadn\u2019t done what he did?</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cNo, his name\u2019s Susan and he wants you to respect his life choices.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Next week!</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s At Home With The Ponds time with The Power Of Three and \u201cthe year of the slow invasion\u201d. It features not only the return of Brian, but Rory in his pants.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6d7356c-35df-444b-aa63-782a4127441b\"

  "<p>The patient sits on a hospital gurney. The doctor asks how she feels, takes her blood pressure and gives her a capsule to swallow. She is then led to a brain scanner that resembles a giant washing machine, and she lies in front of it before it sucks her in. Doctors study a series of vivid images of her head and brain, looking for activity before she is allowed to leave the scanner. The patient is asked who she would like to have with her at this moment. She replies: \"My husband.\"</p> <p>When asked how she feels, she replies: \"Light. It's pleasant. There's an airiness and openness to the senses. A slight heightening of sensory perception, which I liked. The visual feeling is vivid. The colours are lush, which I enjoy. I might be a bit more alert to sounds. I feel physically relaxed and that is a pleasure.\"</p> <p>The patient is the writer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/lionel-shriver\" title=\"\">Lionel Shriver</a>, and she has just taken the drug MDMA as part of an experiment that will be shown on Channel 4 at the end of this month. She is one of six volunteers who also include the actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/keith-allen\" title=\"\">Keith Allen</a> and a former MP who will be shown taking the drug and undergoing a series of tests, some of which will be done in the scanner in order to see the change in brain activity caused by MDMA.</p> <p>The experiment has been designed by Val Curran, professor of psychology at University College London, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/david-nutt\" title=\"\">David Nutt</a>, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London. It will feature 26 volunteers, only a small number of whom will appear on television.</p> <p>The broadcasting of controversial research will seem to many like a publicity stunt, an easy way to court controversy and increase viewing figures. But there is a real concern among many scientists that the government's classification of the drug as Class A overstates the danger it poses to society and inhibits important research that could help people suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office disagrees: \"Televising the use of illegal drugs risks trivialising a serious issue. Our licensing regime allows legitimate research to take place in a secure environment so that harmful drugs can't get into the hands of criminals. There is no evidence to suggest that the current listing of MDMA as a Schedule 1 substance is a barrier to attracting funding for legitimate purposes.\"</p> <p>Nutt insists that without funding from Channel 4 the study wouldn't have been possible: \"We have failed to get money for research from conventional sources, which is why the Channel 4 intervention is fantastic. Nearly half a million people are believed to take ecstasy or MDMA every year in the UK, but there has been very little research into what it does in the brain. These experiments will give us a much clearer picture of the fundamental effects of MDMA on the resting brain than anyone has been able to get before.\"</p> <p>Yet to some, the prominence of the experiments on primetime television might be seen as an endorsement of drug-taking. Professor of psychology Andy Parrott of Swansea University, who has researched MDMA for 15 years, says: \"Once people start writing that MDMA is being used for therapy, kids will look at that and think it's a safe drug.\"</p> <p>MDMA, or methylenedioxy- methylamphetamine, was first patented in 1912 by German scientists looking for a substance to control bleeding. The US military experimented with it in the 1950s and this may have led to instances of it being used recreationally in the US in the 1970s. In 1976, an American chemist, Alexander Shulgin, who became known as the godfather of ecstasy, took MDMA himself as part of a personal investigation of psychoactive substances. Shulgin was an industrial chemist who had personal experience of psychedelics and worked closely with America's Drug Enforcement Agency. He described the feelings MDMA induced as \"an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones\". In his journal he wrote: \"I feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. The cleanliness, clarity, and marvellous feeling of solid inner strength continued\u2026 through the next day. I am overcome by the profundity of the&#xa0;experience.\"</p> <p>Shulgin promoted MDMA among psychologists, who began to use it as an aid to psychotherapy. But its use in therapy was about to become overshadowed by its popularity as a recreational drug. MDMA became popular in nightclubs in Dallas in the early 80s and then spread through the rest of the world. By 1987, rebranded by clubland as ecstasy and often mixed with small amounts of other drugs such as ketamine, heroin and acid, and fillers and binding agents such as corn starch and cellulose, it had become a major part of British youth culture.</p> <p>Drugs like MDMA (but not MDMA explicitly) were made illegal in 1977 in the UK and in the US in 1985, but this did little to prevent its immense popularity as a recreational drug.</p> <p>The case of Donna Kilgore was the first <a href=\"www.maps.org/news-letters/v18n3/v18n3-20to22.pdf\" title=\"\">widely publicised success of MDMA</a> in treating a psychiatric condition. In 1993, she was raped by a stranger who burst into her home in Alaska. Her cries alerted the police who caught the rapist. After the attack, Kilgore tried to get on with her life, which was made easier by the fact that she could not remember much of her experience. After four years, she began having flashbacks, panic attacks, fits of anger, migraines and faints. She consulted a series of psychiatrists who prescribed a series of drugs. Some of the drugs dulled the pain, others exacerbated it. Finally, in 2002, a new psychiatrist linked her condition to her rape for the first time, diagnosed her with PTSD, and sent her to Dr Michael Mithoefer in South Carolina. Mithoefer was one of many therapists who were convinced that MDMA could play a major role in curing patients of a range of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. He was licensed to carry out experiments with MDMA and Kilgore was his first patient.</p> <p>The result was dramatic. \"What MDMA did was clear the fog so I could see. Down there was guilt, anger, shame, fear. And it wasn't so bad. I thought, 'I can do this,'\" she said in an interview. \"'This fear is not going to kill me.' I remembered the rape from start to finish \u2013 those memories I had repressed so deeply.\" Clearly, this is just one patient's experience: many more, larger studies would be needed before MDMA is adopted as a treatment.</p> <p>The dangers of MDMA, or at least ecstasy, had already been highlighted in the UK by the death of Leah Betts who died at the age of 18 in 1995 after taking an ecstasy tablet which contributed to her death. The tragedy of Leah Betts and other similar deaths has tended to be the driver of government policy rather than the experience of Donna Kilgore. The government has rejected expert advice on two occasions to change the classification of the drug from Class A, which also includes heroin and cocaine, to Class B, which includes cannabis.</p> <p>The division between some scientists and government was demonstrated in 2009 when David Nutt was chairman of the government's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. He pointed out that horse riding was more dangerous than taking ecstasy, pointing to statistics that showed that horse riding had an adverse event once in every 350 outings while social ecstasy use led to an adverse event once in every 10,000 experiences. The then home secretary, Jacqui Smith reacted angrily to Nutt's remarks and insisted he apologise to the families of people who had died after taking ecstasy. Later the same year, Nutt was dismissed after he issued a paper that classified drugs according to the harm they caused, placing alcohol and tobaccos as more harmful than drugs such as ecstasy and cannabis.</p> <p>In Nutt's study, volunteers' pre-drug experience, unlike that of clubbing ecstasy users, is deliberately sterile. For the documentary they undergo two days of tests, one with MDMA and one with a placebo (clearly what might make good television doesn't make the most rigorous of trials). Both days are identical. They arrive at Hammersmith hospital where they change into medical scrubs and begin a series of tests. First their breath and urine are analysed to ensure they have not been taking alcohol or drugs. Some of the volunteers failed and were told they could not participate in the experiment.</p> <p>The volunteers have more medical tests and fill out questionnaires before a nurse arrives with a brown envelope containing a capsule. The patients and researchers do not know if it is MDMA or a placebo.</p> <p>According to the researchers, some of the volunteers have behaved as if they had taken MDMA even when they have taken the placebo, describing a sense of euphoria and even showing similar brain activity during the scan to people who have taken MDMA.</p> <p>The volunteer waits for about an hour before the first of series of scans and tests. The tests are commonly used by psychologists, but the volunteers undertake them in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. This allows the researchers to track the movement of oxygen-rich blood to parts of the brain.</p> <p>The volunteers were also asked to write down six positive and six negative memories before they began the trial. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, who oversaw the experiments, explains: \"They are presented with these memories in the scanner. The instructions are very short: remember the crash, remember the beach. They closed their eyes and we instructed them to go back there and to try and relive it as much as&#xa0;possible.</p> <p>\"The reason we are doing that is that MDMA has been looked at in terms of psychotherapy and in particular in terms of PTSD. People have horrible memories, and in psychotherapy the idea is that they should be able to talk about them. In PTSD, when faced with that prospect, it can be so overwhelming that they can't do it. So the rationale for using MDMA is that it allows people to open up. We are using the bad memories from healthy people who don't have trauma associated with PTSD to see the effect on brain activity.</p> <p>\"The prediction that it would make positive memories more positive and negative memories less negative is true. To shift the recollection of memories in a positive direction is what we wanted. People become very emotionally tender under MDMA, and that is the kind of space which would be ideal in psychotherapy. This would allow people to revisit a traumatic memory and overwrite it or control it.\"</p> <p>While psychologists have worked on this theory previously, this is the first time it has been examined using fMRI. The researchers are still analysing their findings. The broadcast experiments are part of a larger six-month study that will be described in detail in a peer-reviewed article next year. Nutt isn't alone in this line of study: in the US the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies is conducting a phase 2 pilot study using MDMA-assisted pychotherapy to treat war veterans suffering from PTSD.</p> <p>Another area where MDMA could be useful is in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Scientists believe it could be successful at targeting the part of the brain that causes rumination and repetitive thinking about negative experiences. MDMA or a similar drug could act as a switch that would shut off depressive or anxious thoughts. \"We all have low moods, we all have bad things happen to us, but we don't dwell on them, we are able to switch them off. When it gets to a disorder like depression or PTSD, you can't switch them off because this network is over-engaged,\" says Nutt.</p> <p>\"We think that switching these things off even transiently, reducing that process might be therapeutic, but also it might be a way of helping individuals to see there is another way. Depressive people generally believe they are worthless. If they could be allowed to believe for a few hours that they are not, this could give them a sense that there is another world.\"</p> <p>The researchers are also examining the low that many ecstasy takers say they experience after taking the drug. They want to see if taking MDMA in a clinical setting as opposed to a nightclub, combined with other drugs, dancing, dehydration and not sleeping, produces a significant low.</p> <p>\"When you take MDMA,\" says Val Curran, \"you get a massive release in the brain of serotonin, and there's a huge dip shortly after you take the drug. It takes your brain time to build up those of levels of serotonin. In a rat it takes three weeks, but in a human it's probably more like three days. We want to know if there is a function impairment because that has never been tested.\"</p> <p>To explore this all volunteers are being examined three days after they take the placebo or MDMA to see if they are experiencing a low and taking tests to see if they have any symptoms.</p> <p>Andy Parrott says that any stimulant that works on the central nervous system may have unpredictable results. \"MDMA releases material in the brain; the effect depends on what else is going on in the brain. MDMA is very like LSD. If you have it in a good frame of mind, you have a good trip; in a bad one, you have a bad trip. So with MDMA if you have a patient with a lot of bad material in their brain that might well be heightened.\"</p> <p>Parrott also highlighted a specific problem that arises if a patient is given a therapeutic drug for a limited period. \"Suppose the therapy ends, the patients feels low, wants another drug, therapist says no. Patient just goes out on the street to get one. It's only 50p a tablet in Liverpool and it's almost pure. You will always get a certain amount of people that will self-medicate.\"</p> <p>Nutt does not think that there are any dangers in the setting of the experiments or the dose (85mg of MDMA), and fMRI findings would be added to other existing studies. \"One of our reasons for doing this is to get an underpinning in neuroscience to strengthen the rationale for doing more studies, more trials on patients, and we are trying to gear up to do that in the next year. Once you can show what the brain responses are, you have some sense that what you are doing is meaningful in terms of the illness and also that the drug is safe and well&#xa0;tolerated.</p> <p>\"We are getting meaningful changes in some of these tasks. The changes in the brain are in the regions we predicted, so that does suggest that the underpinning theories are right. This gives us the confidence to go out there and look for money to make up for the missed opportunities of the last 30&#xa0;years.\"</p> <p>Lionel Shriver at least appears to have tolerated it well. Four hours after taking her capsule, she leaves the hospital, looking slightly dishevelled and with a thin veneer of perspiration on her forehead. She says: \"I can tell there is a little buzz going on. Long may it last.\"</p> <p><em>Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial is on Channel 4 on 26 and 27 September at&#xa0;10pm</em></p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 15 September 2012 to remove a spelling error in the headline</p>",

  "<p>Vince Cable likes to proclaim that he acts as a check on his coalition partners' \"nasty\" tendencies when it comes to all of our rights at work, but he is pushing ahead with the majority of the recommendations in the flawed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/beecroft-report\" title=\"\">Beecroft report</a>, produced by No 10 adviser Adrian Beecroft.</p> <p>The business secretary has already been consulting to introduce fire-at-will for micro-businesses and he's bringing forward a number of measures from the controversial report too, through the enterprise and regulatory reform bill currently going through parliament.</p> <p>When Beecroft was summoned to explain himself in parliament, he admitted there was little evidence to support his proposals. That is why parts of his report have been criticised by business groups, including the Federation of Small Businesses, Institute of Chartered Accountants and the manufacturers' organisation, the EEF. But what do these changes mean in a practical sense for all of us in the workplace?</p> <p>While protection against dismissal on grounds of discrimination begins for employees on day one, unfair dismissal exists to protect people at work against all other forms of unfair treatment and against being fired for any reason other than performance, redundancy or conduct. The government started its attack on employee rights by implementing legislation earlier this year which doubled the qualifying period needed to claim unfair dismissal from one to two years.</p> <p>The attack on our rights continues in this bill by giving the business secretary powers to cap compensation awards when someone has been unfairly dismissed to a maximum of a year's pay (regardless of how much they have lost). The Law Society has said \"this cap will prevent a substantial number of claimants who have been unfairly dismissed from recovering their full losses\". He is expected to announce that he plans to use these powers immediately, drastically weakening the deterrent effect of the unfair dismissal regime.</p> <p>Cable has also talked up his new plans for compromise agreements. At the moment, these are a useful tool which allow employees and employers who are in a dispute to reach an agreement. However, he is now trying to sell us a new version, which he calls \"settlement agreements\". What he doesn't tell us is that these are different and dangerous. His vision seems to allow for unscrupulous employers to offer employees a pay off, simply because they don't like them; if this is refused, the employee would simply be expected to go back to work, leaving a cloud over the relationship. What's more, if this resulted in a dispute at an employment tribunal, the employee wouldn't be able to mention that the employer had done this. Frank conversations between employers and employees take place in workplaces across the country every day, but there is potential here of a no-fault dismissal bribe.</p> <p>And in situations where things do go drastically wrong, many employees will not be able to afford the costs of the new tribunal fees. The reality is that Cable is making it easier for employers to push employees out the door with a poorly compensated \"settlement agreement\", while making it more expensive and complicated for staff to get a fair hearing. Even if they are judged to have been unfairly dismissed at a tribunal their compensation would be restricted making it easy for employers to gamble.</p> <p>These proposals have been rushed together to appease Beecroft's champions within the Tory-led government. They ignore that there is no evidence that this will boost growth and jobs. They ignore the impact on the millions working in businesses who will have less security and less confidence in the future. And they ignore the fact that we are not going to compete in the global economy based on insecure and low-paid jobs.</p> <p>We need to reform the economy so that it works for all. We can improve our already flexible labour market. We support compulsory Acas pre-conciliation, for example. And there is much support needed for businesses \u2013 like unlocking finance \u2013 to enable them to start and grow, but that doesn't mean throwing away the rights at work for all. The UK already has the third most deregulated labour market in the world according to the OECD, but is just one of two G20 countries in recession. The blame for this lies squarely with this government's failed economic policy \u2013 we are in a recession made in Downing Street, but this has been caused by ministers' failed policies, not protections at work.</p> <p>Cable was right when he said in February that the government doesn't have a \"compelling vision\" and it's true today. But her was wrong last weekend when he said Beecroft's proposals were dead. They're not. They're alive and well as he implements Beecroft by the back door, and employees should be worried.</p>",

The impact of policy actions can play out over long periods of time and in the current climate it is crucial that members and leaders are supported to understand how social value and impact affect people's lives in the long term \u2013 and in turn how that evidence can be used as part of future policy design.</p> <h2><strong>Tim Gilling is acting executive director of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.cfps.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Centre for Public Scrutiny</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>How councils embrace the act will influence the extent to which culture change is achieved.</strong> Compliant councils are likely to simply meet the legal duty.

To some extent it is a political judgement about where the balance of short-term and long-term actions sit in those plans.

A huge number of the providers are very cost effective, and already generate a lot of social value, but just don't communicate this to the local authority. (Or they do, and feel there isn't a mechanism within the commissioning process to take account of it).

If as an organisation you have to relearn a process every time you do it, it is inefficient and discourages innovation<strong>.</strong></p> <h2><strong>Kate Denham is a manager in the </strong><a href=\"http://www.bdo.uk.com/sectors/public-sector/local-government\" title=\"\"><strong>BDO local government advisory team</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Trust will be essential for social value commissioning to work.</strong> One of the biggest issues we have been finding in practice, rather than on the research and theory side has been that councils may think that they want to commission for outcomes (including social, environment and economic) but there is a challenge when it comes down to the actual phrasing of a contract or specification, when the realisation dawns that this might mean you can't specify outputs.</p> <p>This perceived loss of control is something that authorities must become more comfortable with if they genuinely want to move towards an outcomes-focused model \u2013 working with providers to acknowledge that for some of these social value type outcomes, there is no easy qualitative measure to monitor on a monthly basis whether it is being delivered. This could be a much longer process of councils and suppliers developing the mutual trust to enable this to happen.</p> <p><em>You can read the discussion </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/sep/11/live-discussion-social-value-act\" title=\"\"><em>in full here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and the latest job vacancies</strong></p>"
