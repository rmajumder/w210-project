  "<p>It was hard not to approach the Closing Ceremony of the Paralympic Games with some trepidation.</p> <p>The equivalent event at the Olympics had felt slightly underwhelming, perhaps because no spectacle could possibly live up to the athletic spectacles that had preceded it, partly because the air of mystery surrounding what was going to take place led people to expect a surprise that never actually came: if you'd listened to the wild talk of appearances by David Bowie and Kate Bush and holograms of Freddie Mercury, it was hard not to be even more disappointed when it became apparent what you were actually going to get was Jessie J.</p> <p>The latter issue was circumvented here by announcing who was going to be performing in advance. Nevertheless, you didn't have to be one of those people who thinks Coldplay are the cloven-hoofed musical emissaries of satan himself to have been slightly concerned about how appropriate a booking they were.</p> <p>On one hand, they are one of the biggest bands in the world \u2013 a suitably global success for a global event \u2013 they stir vast stadiums full of people for a living, and it is a churlish character that claims they are anything other than very good at it. On the other, the key piece of music at the Paralympic opening ceremony \u2013 the track that seemed to hit on something vital about the Games to come \u2013 was Orbital and the Graeae Theatre Company's retooling of Ian Dury's Spasticus Autisticus, a song that is brutal, startling, furious and many other things that Coldplay's music are not. Thanks to their ubiquity on TV soundtracks \u2013 tinkling away as someone departs The X Factor or the DIY SOS tells their tragic back story \u2013 a lot of their songs have become musical shorthand for \"oh, isn't it a pity\", designed to elicit sympathy for whoever is on screen. The Paralympics have incited a vast array of emotions in viewers, but pity isn't among them, as anyone who caught a glimpse of the frankly terrifying wheelchair rugby will attest.</p> <p>As it turned out, their set got better the more upbeat it became: the triumphant arena-filling guitar riff of Charlie Brown seemed to fit the event more than the more ponderous ballads, while it would take an effort almost as superhuman as the athletes had put in over recent days not to be moved by their collaboration with the Paraorchestra on Strawberry Swing, -\u2013 one of their loveliest songs, its melody boasting a subtlety that the bands' detractors would have you believe they don't possess \u2013 or the crowd singing along with Viva La Vida while fireworks exploded and confetti fluttered from above.</p> <p>The staging meanwhile, felt noticeably darker, less cosy and self-congratulatory than the Olympic closing ceremony. There was a lot of stuff with fire and steampunk costumes, rusty vehicles cannibalised from old cars and farm machinery and people pretending to be crows on stilts.</p> <p>A seasoned festival-goer might note that it all had a whiff of the kind of thing you see at 3am in the outlying fields at Glastonbury: a definite improvement on the Olympic closing ceremony, which carried a whiff of a bad night at the Brits.</p> <p>In the event that you felt bored by Coldplay, there was always something to distract your attention: ice skating, high-wire artists dangling from motorbikes, aerialists twirling from bunches of oversized light bulbs that sprayed out fire, people running out of the mouth of a giant fish carrying huge cardboard cutouts of insects on sticks. There was interpretative dance, which was nowhere near as disheartening as interpretative dance to Coldplay looks on paper.</p> <p>The same was true of Rihanna's solo appearance. We Found Love is a decent pop song that's become rather a victim of its own success: one way of giving it some added interest in the teeth of its ubiquity is to have her perform it while flying around the stadium on what looked like a vast garden swing.</p> <p>The other special guest was Jay-Z. With Rihanna and Coldplay, he played Run This Town. Not the most obvious choice, but recontextualized by its surroundings it felt weirdly appropriate: as anyone who visited London during the Games and noted an almost tangible sense of excitement in the air knows, that's precisely what the Paralympics appeared to do.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's leading manufacturing lobbying group has attacked the government for its lack of a growth strategy and warned the UK economy has \"hit the buffers\".</p> <p>The EEF called on ministers on Monday to come up with a long-term industrial strategy that would provide the same \"relentless and clear-sighted\" approach to expanding the economy that has been devoted to deficit reduction.</p> <p>Terry Scuoler, the EEF's chief executive, said: \"We all know that we need stronger growth built on firm foundations, but the economy and rebalancing have hit the buffers. We will only get back on track if the government demonstrates the same clarity and single-mindedness on growth that it has done on reducing the deficit.</p> <p>\"Business is seeking certainty to invest, but too often it is left with the impression that government is responding to events, rather than leading on growth.\"</p> <p>The EEF urged the creation of a cabinet committee for growth, jointly chaired by the prime minister and deputy prime minister, and for progress to be assessed against a small number of measurable benchmarks managed by the National Audit Office.</p> <p>Publishing The Route to Growth, the EEF identified 10 areas that needed action, including support for business through the tax system, better access to finance, reforms of energy pricing, cutting red tape, investing in modern infrastructure, greater banking competition, a new approach to public procurement, and the development of a well-resourced skills system.</p> <p>The business organisation said recovery and progress towards a rebalancing of the economy towards investment and exports had stalled in 2011. While accepting the economic environment had been affected by the debt crisis in the eurozone, the EEF said Britain's performance had been more sluggish than other developed countries, including some that are part of the single currency.</p> <p>It added that the government's plan for growth lacked the clarity and consistency of its programme of tax increases and spending cuts designed to reduce public borrowing.</p> <p>\"Despite positive measures for growth, the programme has lacked visibility. In contrast to the fiscal mandate, it fell short of communicating an unambiguous message on the type of growth our economy needed to rebalance. Nor did it offer a clear plan to address the barriers in the business environment \u2013 from access to finance and tax, to regulation and skills shortages \u2013 that stand in the way of the private sector delivering it.</p> <p>\"Furthermore, government actions on growth are not wrapped in credible accountability structures. Progress reports on departmental websites contrast with the rigour applied to the fiscal mandate, with the external review of the Office for Budget Responsibility.\"</p> <p>The report said that while there would be times when the government should aim to support individual technologies, a modern industrial strategy should focus on measures to help the widest number of companies grow by investing and exporting.</p> <p>The EEF said ministers should have four ambitions: more companies bringing products and services to market; a lower cost of doing business; more globally focused companies expanding in the UK; and a more productive and flexible labour market.</p> <p>Scuoler said: \"Clearly we need measures to get growing now and priorities should include encouraging business investment, increasing access to finance, reducing energy prices and rebuilding infrastructure. But these need to be part of an overall industrial strategy for growth and rebalancing our economy and not a series of unco-ordinated initiatives.\"</p>",
  "<p>Many of Britain's gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools are \"no-go zones\" for disabled people and will struggle to cope with an expected surge in interest in fitness activities, following the Paralympic games, campaigners have warned.</p> <p>A crowdsourced survey of hundreds of gyms across the UK by charity volunteers suggests that many local facilities are partially inaccessible, difficult to navigate and expensive to join. Some did not have specialist gym equipment and nearly half lacked staff trained in disability awareness.</p> <p>One of the key legacy aims of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics-2012\" title=\"\">Paralympics</a> is to increase participation in sports by Britain's 11 million disabled people. Just 18% of disabled adults undertake physical activity for more than 30 minutes a week, compared with 38% of non-disabled adults,<a href=\"http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/our_news/%C2%A38_million_legacy_investment.aspx\" title=\"\"> according to Sport England</a>.</p> <p>The success of the Games has raised hopes of a surge in interest in disability sports participation, but the survey of gyms and leisure centres, carried out on behalf of the charity <a href=\"http://www.lcdisability.org/\" title=\"\">Leonard Cheshire Disability</a>, found that many facilities are unprepared to capitalise on the potential demand.</p> <p>The charity said: \"Gyms and leisure facilities are a crucial 'first point of entry' to sports and physical activity for most adults. Yet for many disabled people they are 'no-go zones'. Inaccessible changing rooms, steps, poor staff training and lack of usable sports equipment are some of the common barriers that can prevent disabled customers from getting involved.\"</p> <p>Guy Parckar, the charity's head of policy, said that while most gyms were \"broadly accessible\" and complied with disability discrimination laws to fit ramps and lifts, many had failed to get right small but crucial details. These could make all the difference when it came to attracting or retaining disabled customers.</p> <p>Although most gyms provided disabled parking spaces, for example, the survey found that some bays were not wide enough to enable a wheelchair to be unpacked from a car. Parckar said in many cases, improvements such as installing easy-to-read signs or colour contrast markings on steps, would be relatively inexpensive. It was crucial that gyms sought advice from local disabled people on how to improve access, he added.</p> <p>The survey of 300 UK leisure facilities found that:</p> <p>\u2022 Nearly a third of gyms did not have an automatic door at the entrance to the gym, while some were fitted with heavy internal doors that were difficult to open. One survey reporter said he watched a wheelchair user forced to open such a door by pushing it with his head.</p> <p>\u2022 Although many gyms had lifts, just over one in five were not working properly. A common problem was that lifts were too small for larger wheelchairs and control buttons were set too high. In one case, it was reported that a lift leading to the gym area of a leisure centre did not appear to have been working for more than a year.</p> <p>\u2022 A quarter of swimming pools did not have hoists to support disabled people to get into the water, while 31% of gyms did not have any fitness equipment that was suitable for disabled people.</p> <p>The survey, carried out as part of Leonard Cheshire Disability's <a href=\"http://www.actionforaccess.org/gyms\" title=\"\">Exercise Your Right</a> campaign, also highlighted instances where gyms provided excellent services to disabled people. Highly rated gyms were identified as such, not just because they had accessible buildings or equipment but because they practiced good \"customer care and management.\" They also employed staff who were trained to be aware of disabled people's needs.</p> <p>There is a potentially huge appetite for sport and exercise among disabled people, according to a separate survey of nearly 1,000 disabled people, carried out this week by Leonard Cheshire Disability. It found more than two thirds of respondents said they would like to take part in sport more regularly. Although a quarter said they exercised twice a week or more, a third of those surveyed said they never took part in sport or exercise.</p> <p>Some 85% of respondents were not members of gyms or leisure centres. Asked why they did not consider joining, more than half said it was too expensive, while 26% said difficulty in accessing facilities put them off</p> <p>Just under half of respondents said the Paralympics had inspired them to get more involved in sport or exercise, and 26% thought that the Games would encourage more disabled people to take part. But while 89% felt the Games would leave a \"positive legacy\" overall, just 12% believed it would lead to improved accessibility.</p> <p>David Stalker, chief executive of the Health and Fitness Industry Association, which represents more than 3,000 UK gyms and leisure centres, said it was concerned at the findings.</p> <p>Stalker said the association would be continuing its work with charities to get more disabled people active: \"We will continue to work with our operator members to go above and beyond the minimum requirements to deliver a user friendly environment for all their customers.\"</p>",
  "<p>Some senior Taliban figures are ready to negotiate a ceasefire and might be ready to accept a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan as part of a comprehensive peace deal, according to a report to be published on Monday based on interviews with Taliban officials and negotiators.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/talibanbriefing2012\" title=\"\">The report</a>, published by the Royal United Services Institute, finds that the Taliban is determined to make a decisive break with al-Qaida as part of a settlement and is open to negotiation about education for girls, but is adamantly opposed to the constitution which it sees as a prop for President Hamid Karzai's government.</p> <p>The Taliban insurgents will not negotiate with the Karzai government largely because of its record of corruption. They do not trust Kabul to run fair elections, which suggests that, even if the moderates interviewed in the study prevailed within Taliban circles, serious obstacles to a peace deal would remain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/talibanbriefing2012\" title=\"\">The institute's report</a>, entitled Taliban Perspectives on Reconciliation, is the product of interviews with four unnamed figures, two of whom were ministers in the former Taliban government and are still close to the inner circle of leadership. One is described as being \"closely associated\" with Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban leader. A third is portrayed as \"a senior former mujahideen commander and lead negotiator for the Taliban\", although not part of the movement itself, and the fourth is said to be \"an Afghan mediator with extensive experience negotiating with the Taliban\".</p> <p>The report concludes: \"The Taliban would be open to negotiating a ceasefire as part of a general settlement, and also as a bridge between confidence-building measures and the core issue of the distribution of political power in Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"A ceasefire would require strong Islamic justification, obscuring any hint of surrender,\" it adds.</p> <p>Even more surprising, in view of the official Taliban propaganda portraying it as leading a struggle against foreign invaders, the report says the insurgents are \"prepared to accept a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan\".</p> <p>According to one interviewee, described as a founder member of the Taliban, a settlement that left US troops operating out of five primary military bases \u2013 Kandahar, Herat, Jalalabad, Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul \u2013 might be acceptable as long as the US presence \"does not impinge on our independence and religion\". In other words, the Taliban might accept continuing US counter-terrorist operations targeting their former ally, al-Qaida, as long as the bases were not used as a launching pad for attacks on other countries or for interference in Afghan politics.</p> <p>The report even suggests that the Taliban would co-operate in tracking down al-Qaida members, noting that the leadership and base \"deeply regret\" their past association with the global jihadist group.</p> <p>Michael Semple, one of the report's co-authors and a former EU envoy to Afghanistan, said that interviewees represented a significant but not yet dominant strand in Taliban views. \"We are not saying that this is some kind of poll that says three out of four Taliban members are in favour of a ceasefire,\" he said. \"But there is a part of the movement who see there is no prospect of a military victory and so ceasefire would make sense. This is not the official line, but rather the outer fringe of Taliban thought. It's not mainstream yet.\"</p> <p>Semple, now at Harvard University, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/taliban-commander-i-was-relieved-death-osama?quicktabs_most_read=0\" title=\"\">interviewed another Taliban commander in July</a>, who also admitted there was no prospect of an insurgent victory, but he said that commander was not part of the institute's study.</p> <p>Contacts between US officials and Taliban representatives have stalled largely because of failure to conclude a confidence-building deal to exchange five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay for a US soldier captured by insurgents. Substantive talks, which were due to be held in Qatar, are expected to remain on hold until after the US presidential election in November, but senior US officials said they were holding discussions this week with Pakistan, where the Taliban leadership is based, about the safe passage of insurgent officials for future peace talks.</p> <p>\"Reconciliation remains a key component of our strategy,\" a senior US official said. \"The safe passage working group was meeting this week alone as a piece of that, and Ambassador [Marc] Grossman [the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan] will embark on an upcoming trip at some point to continue to pursue this in a very robust manner.\u2026\"</p> <p>Another senior official stressed that the official US designation on Friday of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/haqqani-network-terrorist-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">the Haqqani network</a>, a Taliban faction based in the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, would not rule out future talks with the group, and would not lead to the financial sanctions against Pakistan. The official disowned <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/taliban-commander-i-was-relieved-death-osama?quicktabs_most_read=0\" title=\"\">allegations made last year</a> by Admiral Mike Mullen, the outgoing chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who described the Haqqani network as \"a veritable arm\" of Pakistani intelligence.</p> <p>\"I want to just unequivocally state that this in no way is the consensus, unanimous view of this administration; that we are making absolutely no effort to begin a process to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism,\" the US official said.</p> <p>Semple said he did not think the designation of the Haqqanis would have any serious impact on future peace talks.</p> <p>\"The US have already given them a good few chances to to do politics,\" he said. \"They are really at the heart of the nastiest part of the armed struggle.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>1 The Great British public love sport</strong></h2> <p>Had conkers or tiddlywinks been ordained as an Olympic sport by the panjandrums in Lausanne, one suspects there would have been a scramble for tickets and endless discussion of the home team's chances in the good natured queues snaking through Westfield to the Olympic Park. Part of the success of the London Games was down to the fact that every session of every sport (except football) was sold out and packed with knowlegable , noisy fans. If one side effect of the sometimes controversial ticketing policy was residual frustration, another was that people who entered any of the venues felt as if they had a golden ticket and acted accordingly. The remarkable atmosphere was aided by presentation, from the tone of the MCs to the excellent music. Not only was every morning session in the stadium across both Games packed with noisy fans but, when the \"house full\" signs went up for a meaningless goalball clash between Sweden and Japan in the Copper Box, organisers knew their work was done.</p> <h2><strong>2 Athletics can fill and thrill stadiums</strong></h2> <p>London provided a glorious reminder that, staged properly and featuring a cast list of genuine global stars, athletics can still thrill huge crowds. Lord Coe essentiallybuilt himself the ideal athletics bowl, at once intimate and imposing. As was well documented, the atmosphere on the biggest nights \u2013 from Mo Farah and Usain Bolt during the Olympics to David Weir and Oscar Pistorius during the Paralympics \u2013 rivalled any sporting event anywhere in the world. At times it also felt as though the crowd was reconnecting with a sport embedded deep in the British DNA but with which they had become disenchanted over time. Aided again by intelligent programming and presentation, the field events also got the recognition they deserved. The challenge for those taking over the operation of the stadium from spring 2014 is to work out how athletics can co-exist with football and pop concerts and other sports. But they will do so in the knowledge that if they get it right then the rewards could be huge. Lord Coe, likely to be the next president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will take a close interest.</p> <h2><strong>3 Investment in elite sport is a no-brainer</strong></h2> <p>Any debate over whether the \u00a3312m invested in Team GB over the four years to London 2012, or the \u00a349.2m poured into Paralympic sport over the same period, from lottery and exchequer funds is good value for money appears all but over. The former prime minister John Major deserved the warm reception he got as a result of being the man who introduced lottery funding to British sport. The cheers for Gordon Brown were more of a surprise but perhaps they also knew he was the chancellor who approved a major uplift in investment once the London Games were won. That money, allied to a \"no compromise\" approach pioneered by UK Sport's Peter Keen, and put into practice by a generation of enlighted performance directors in individual sports, has delivered in spades. Whether it can continue to do so without the focus of a home Games is another matter. Keen, who has now moved on to a part-time advisory role, insists it can.</p> <h2><strong>4 Paralympic sport has gone mainstream</strong></h2> <p>The 2.7m people who thronged the venues for the Paralympics may have bought their tickets for all sorts of reasons. Some wanted a cheap family day out, others had missed out on tickets to what they saw as the main event. But all soon became enraptured by the sport on show. Soon enough the Park echoed to the sound of groups of ticketholders discussing David Weir's tactics or waxing lyrical about Ellie Simmonds's turn of speed, as well as the inspirational life stories of those involved. That they no longer saw any differentiation between Olympic and Paralympic sport is one of the enduring triumphs of the second act of London's sporting summer. All involved claimed a lasting impact on perceptions of Paralympic sport and disability. The huge challenge, both for ParalympicsGB and for the International Paralympic Committee, is to work out how to use the momentum generated if they are not to slip from view for another four years. There are pressing issues around classification and technology to deal with and much work to be done to develop a competitive and media friendly programme of international events. But London is a great launch pad.</p> <h2><strong>5 Co-operation is not a dirty word</strong></h2> <p>One of the major reasons for the success of London's two Games was the fact that they were delivered in a spirit of co-operation. Coe and his chief executive, Paul Deighton, decreed very early on that cross-party co-operation was vital to the success of the project. Politicians of all hues deserve credit for ensuring that the line largely held, even if it is unlikely to do so in the legacy debate that follows. This was also true of the delivery of the team. Britain's sports administrators largely put their petty politicking aside in the knowledge they had to deliver on the biggest stage of all. Already there are signs the uneasy peace that resulted is breaking down. But, if the same spirit can be shown towards the delivery of an enduring legacy by those politicians so quick to don a Team GB shirt and grab a slice of the action, then there may be a chance that the \"inspire a generation\" mantra could become more than just rhetoric.</p>",
  "<p>Will the Paralympics help challenge the daily pain and discrimination millions of disabled people have to contend with? Or will the celebrated sporting achievement of some be used to hide the fate of those considered less worthy? In his excellent article about the neglect of ill and disabled people in prison (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/seriously-ill-prisoners-denied-healthcare\" title=\"\">Comment is free</a>, 5 September), Eric Allison describes as \"the worst I have ever come across\" the suffering of Daniel Roque Hall, a severely disabled 30-year-old man with complex healthcare needs. Despite assurances by the governor of Wormwood Scrubs that it could and would provide him adequate care, he has been in and out of hospital since he was taken to prison, and has ended up on life support.&#xa0;</p> <p>Daniel Roque Hall's mother describes what he has faced: \"Tortured and taken to doctors to be saved so he can be taken back to prison and tortured again.\" This has been raised with the prisons minister and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. To save his life, his mother and friends have had to fight through the censorship, the callousness and the political opportunism that demonise prisoners.&#xa0;</p> <p>No Paralympic medals can make up for the fact that those who are most vulnerable are being denied their dignity and their rights. People with disabilities, also demonised as a precursor to being targeted for savage cuts and hate crimes, are already fighting for their lives. As Allison makes clear, no one is more vulnerable than a severely disabled prisoner. If care institutions, be they hospitals, prisons, or residential or retirement homes, are able to neglect, torture and even kill with impunity, then none of us is ever safe. To send Daniel Roque Hall back to prison would amount to cruel and degrading punishment and a death sentence. He must be allowed to serve his sentence at home.<br><strong>Niki Adams </strong><em>Legal Action for Women</em><strong> </strong><br><strong>Emily Burnham </strong><em>Non-practising solicitor</em><br><strong>Peter Chappell </strong><em>Homeopath </em><br><strong>Claudio Chipana </strong><em>Member, Latin American Recognition Campaign (LARC)</em><br><strong>Lord Dholakia </strong><br><strong>Niamh Eastwood </strong><em>Release</em><br><strong>Lisa Egan</strong><br><strong>Joan Faber </strong><em>Religious Sister</em><br><strong>Tara Flood </strong><br><strong>Diane Frazer </strong><em>Psychotherapist</em><br><strong>Claire Glasman </strong><em>WinVisible (women with visible and invisible disabilities)</em><br><strong>Professor Paul Higgs </strong><em>Sociology of Ageing, University College London</em><br><strong>John Hirst </strong><em>Prisoners' rights advocate</em><br><strong>Selma James </strong><em>International Wages for Housework Campaign</em><strong> </strong><br><strong>Anver Jeevanjee </strong><em>Retired immigration judge</em><strong> &#xa0;</strong><br><strong>Lord Judd </strong><br><strong>Michael Kalmanovitz </strong><em>Payday men's network</em><strong> </strong><br><strong>Bruce Kent </strong><br><strong>Flo Krause </strong><em>Barrister</em><strong> </strong><br><strong>Nina Lopez </strong><em>Global Women's Strike</em><strong> </strong><br><strong>Ian Macdonald QC </strong><br><strong>Daniel Machover </strong><em>Solicitor</em><strong> </strong><br><strong>Baroness Masham of Ilton </strong><br><strong>Francesca Martinez </strong><em>Comedian and writer</em><br><strong>Anna Mazzola </strong><em>Solicitor</em><br><strong>John McArdle </strong><em>Black Triangle Campaign</em><br><strong>John McDonnell MP </strong><br><strong>Anne Neale </strong><em>Queer Strike</em><br><strong>Robert Nind </strong><em>Progressing Prisoners Maintaining Innocence</em><br><strong>Julie O'Keefe </strong><em>Occupational therapist in neuro-disability and palliative care</em><br><strong>Pat Onions</strong><br><strong>John O </strong><em>Miscarriages of Justice UK (MOJUK)</em><br><strong>Angela Qasir </strong><em>School principal</em><strong> </strong><br><strong>Lord Ramsbotham</strong><br><strong>Lord Redesdale</strong><br><strong>Professor Graham Scambler </strong><em>Medical Sociology, University College London</em><br><strong>Professor Michael Thorndyke </strong><em>Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</em><br><strong>Baroness Wilkins</strong><br><strong>Benjamin Zephaniah</strong></p>",
  "<p>Just the victory parade to go, and then Britain's summer of love will be over. London 2012, the capital's greatest party in living memory, is done. At the risk of using up the entire annual quota of Guardian editorial schmaltz in one go, this past month it feels as if most of us have been (as Boris Johnson would have it) cropdusted with serotonin, the happiness hormone. The Olympics held the country rapt but, against all expectations, the Paralympics made them feel like a mere warm-up act. From July's opening ceremony to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/08/paralympic-closing-ceremony-coldplay\" title=\"\">the festival of flame</a>, the venues have been packed and the TV audiences, national and global, have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/15/bbc-olympics-coverage-third-viewers\" title=\"\">broken all records</a>. There has surely been no comparable event in this country since the coronation nearly 60 years ago.</p> <p>The athletes are the most obvious but far from the only factor in this success. In a world of professional sport where every aspect is commodified, the Olympic ideal is extraordinarily resilient. A handful of the global superstars \u2013 Usain Bolt and now Mo Farah \u2013 have enhanced their personal value, but most have driven themselves relentlessly for the glory alone. So they are interesting not as, say, some abstract transfer deal with a gambling habit, but as individuals who, like all true heroes, might be any one of us. The Paralympics have overlaid this already astonishing substance with their personal tales of sudden grief and disaster overcome \u2013 although their particular triumph has been to make us disregard altogether the athletes' disabilities and shift the focus to their capacity to compete and win. Or to lose. For every victory there are a score of defeats, where the years of sacrifice have turned to ashes. These are more accessible tales, and the more telling. If sport can be said to have a moral purpose, it is that it can show it is worth more to try and fail than not to try at all, and the devastation and the fortitude of the losers is more moving even than the easier joy of the victors. The irresistible human stories of the past weeks have simply erased the scepticism of the previous seven years.</p> <p>Of course, if you have \u00a39bn to spend on a party, surely only a dolt could fail. But a single day of the widely anticipated public transport chaos or of fractious queues or malfunctioning lavatories would have soured the event. Instead, the least attractive aspects of London 2012, the ZiL lanes and the Visa-only policy and McDonald's and Coca-Cola as purveyors of sustenance to a sporting nation, were smothered not only by the competition but by the ocean of good humour fostered by the joviality of the volunteers, the inspirational architecture and the attention given to the natural landscape (with apologies to those who had to move to make room for it all).</p> <p>Now it is all about the legacy. Some things that once seemed improbable may now be within reach. Boris Johnson really could be in Downing Street within the decade, where perhaps the experience of being suspended on a zip wire might inform his attitude the frequent failings of public transport policy towards people in wheelchairs. Seb Coe has become an interesting candidate for mayor. More substantially, there is the promise on the local economic legacy, of regeneration of homes and recreation of jobs, and there is the equally important promise to translate the amplified passion for watching sport into an equal passion for doing it.</p> <p>But there is more. Danny Boyle's description of Britishness as something that is as much an achievement of its ordinary citizens as it is of empire and monarchy was exactly right for the festival of sport that followed because both are reminders of what the state can achieve. Britain's athletes have been the beneficiaries of what amounts to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/osborne-pay-heed-olympics-triumph\" title=\"\">an industrial policy for sport</a>, millions channelled through expert organisations to find and train stars. London 2012 itself was initiated, orchestrated and largely funded by the state. It was a collective national effort, where successive governments of different political persuasions stuck to a common policy and showed just what, with imagination and ambition, can be done.</p>",
  "<p>A leading British academic has called for accelerated research into futuristic geo-engineering and a worldwide nuclear power station \"binge\" to avoid runaway global warming.</p> <p>Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at Cambridge University, said both potential solutions had inherent dangers but were now vital as time was running out.</p> <p>\"It is very, very depressing that politicians and the public are attuned to the threat of climate change even less than they were 20 years ago when Margaret Thatcher sounded the alarm. CO<sub>2</sub> levels are rising at a faster than exponential rate, and yet politicians only want to take utterly trivial steps such as banning plastic bags and building a few windfarms,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I am very suspicious of using technology to solve problems created by technology, given that we have messed up so much in the past but having done almost nothing for two decades we need to adopt more desperate measures such as considering geo-engineering techniques as well as conducting a major nuclear programme.\"</p> <p>Geo-engineering techniques such as whitening clouds by adding fine sprays of water vapour, or adding aerosols to the upper atmosphere have been ridiculed in some quarters but welcomed elsewhere. Wadhams proposes the use of thorium-fuelled reactors, being tested in India, which are said to be safer because they do not result in a proliferation of weapons-grade plutonium, experts say. Also, under certain circumstances, the waste from thorium reactors is less dangerous and remains radioactive for hundreds rather than thousands of years.</p> <p>Wadhams, who is also head of the polar ocean physics group at Cambridge and has just returned from a field trip to Greenland, was reacting to evidence that Arctic sea ice cover had reached a record low this summer.</p> <p>This latest rate of loss is 50% higher than most scenarios outlined by other polar scientists and coincide with alarming new reports about a \"vast reservoir\" of the potent greenhouse gas, methane, that could be released in Antarctica if the ice melts equally quickly there. Greenpeace said last night that it agreed with the academic's concerns but not with his solutions.</p> <p>\"Professor Wadhams is right that we're in a big hole and the recent record sea ice low in the Arctic is a clear warning that we need to act. But it would be cheaper, safer and easier to stop digging and drilling for more fossil fuels,\" said Ben Ayliffe, the group's senior polar campaigner.</p> <p>\"We already have the technologies, from ultra-efficient vehicles to state-of-the-art clean energy generation, to make the deep cuts in greenhouse gases that are needed to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Unfortunately, we're still lacking the political and business will to implement them,\" he added.</p> <p>Wadhams, who has done pioneering work on polar ice thinning using British naval submarines from 1976 onwards, said these latest satellite findings confirmed his own dire predictions.</p> <p>And they feed into the alarming scenarios that the Arctic Methane Emergency Group have been warning about.</p> <p>\"What we are now seeing is a fast collapse of the sea ice that means we could see a complete loss during the summer by 2015 - rather than the 20 to 30 years talked about by the UK Meteorological Office. This would speed up ocean warming and Greenland ice cap melt and increase global ocean levels considerably as well as warming the seabed and releasing more methane.\"</p> <p>Asked whether the latest evidence made a ban on drilling for carbon-releasing oil and gas necessary as Greenpeace has contended, Wadhams said \"philosophically\" such exploration made little sense. \"We have been conducting a global experiment with the burning of fossil fuels and the results are already disastrous and this would accelerate them,\" he argued saying that there were also practical worries because of the enormous difficulty of dealing with any spillage or a blowout under moving ice where oil would get trapped inside the ice in a kind of inaccessible \"oil sandwich'.</p> <p>But he said at least that companies such as Shell had shown some responsibility by carefully planning its expected exploration in the Chukotka Sea off Alaska and had shown a willingness to use ready-made containment domes that could cap off a well if anything went wrong. He was more fearful about drilling methods in the Russian Arctic where environmental concerns were lower down the agenda.</p>",
  "<p>The London mayor, Boris Johnson, has been forced to deny that he discussed a plot with Tory MP Zac Goldsmith that could have seen him return to Westminster on an anti-Heathrow expansion ticket.</p> <p>Reports suggested that Goldsmith had offered to stand aside, forcing a byelection that would allow Johnson back in, putting him in pole position to succeed David Cameron if he failed to win an overall majority at the next election.</p> <p>It was revealed that a backbench MP, Bob Stewart, had been approached by two colleagues in the summer to act as a stalking horse challenger to Cameron, but had told them to \"get lost\".</p> <p>Johnson's aides admitted discussions between the mayor and Goldsmith, a fierce opponent of Heathrow expansion, had taken place, but said talk of a plot was fanciful. Reports had suggested that Goldsmith had proposed the deal, which was dismissed out of hand by Johnson.</p> <p>The London mayor insisted that he would serve a full term \u2013 a decision that would leave him out of parliament until after the 2015 election. \"I've said, as I said in the election about a billion times, being mayor is the best job in British politics and it's what I want to do.\"</p> <p>Goldsmith also insisted he had not offered to resign, but reiterated his longstanding threat to force a byelection if the government undertook a U-turn by backing Heathrow expansion.</p> <p>Cameron has tried to park the Heathrow issue by appointing the former head of the financial services authority Sir Howard Davies to conduct a review into airport capacity in the south-east to be completed after 2015. But Davies has been asked for interim proposals by 2013, including the possibility of dual use of runways at Heathrow, a proposal that might be regarded by Goldsmith as a betrayal of an election promise by the Conservatives. Vince Cable, the business secretary and MP for Twickenham, also asserted baldly : \"Heathrow expansion is not going to happen.\"</p> <p>But in a sign that the Conservatives may face a wider backlash over plans to promote growth at the expense of the environment, Cheryl Gillan, the former Welsh secretary, said the High Speed 2 rail link would be a disaster. She added: \"In my own constituency in Chesham and Amersham, it would benefit by a third runway at Heathrow much more than it would benefit from a high speed rail link going right through an area of outstanding natural beauty with no stops in Buckinghamshire whatsoever.\"</p> <p>Sir Merrick Cockell, the Conservative leader of the Local Government Association, also stepped up his attack on proposals published on Thursday to strip councils of the right to make local planning decisions. He warned that the Treasury plan would lead to a \"super quango\" that would ride roughshod over the wishes of local people.</p> <p>\"This is a blow to local democracy,\" Cockell said. \"Suddenly, without any discussion, the government is threatening to take power away from local communities and place it in the hands of a super quango. It is deeply worrying to see policy being made on the hoof in Whitehall, rather than by a government working closely with councils who know what is happening on the ground.\"</p>",
  "<p>According to Victoria Pendleton, British <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/cycling\" title=\"\">Cycling</a> has already sold off her bike. Some staff members will probably never speak to her again. She suspects they will be relieved not to have to deal with her any more. She tells me all this with a twinkly, tinkling laugh, the kind people adopt when they are trying especially hard not to sound bitter. The words ring in my head as I hang up the phone after our second conversation. I feel unexpectedly gutted. I had anticipated writing a fairly straightforward story about a champion \u2013 a complicated champion, yes, but one who had experienced familiar ebbs of struggle and glory on the way to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/19/olympics.cycling\" title=\"\">Olympic gold</a> at Beijing, followed by those wild, psychological battles in London, where she won gold in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/03/victoria-pendleton-london-olympics\" title=\"\">keirin</a>, silver in the sprint. Instead, the tale of Queen Vic feels much darker.</p> <p>This hadn't come across so strongly at our first meeting. At that stage I had only been given the first half of her autobiography, Between the Lines, written with Guardian sports interviewer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/donaldmcrae\" title=\"\">Donald McRae</a>. This covered some difficulties in her path to Olympic success, but nothing too extreme or extraordinary.</p> <p>Pendleton is immensely friendly when we meet at the St Pancras Renaissance hotel, London, with an openness people probably either find brilliant or totally unnerving. She is renowned for being nakedly emotional, sobbing when she loses \u2013 sobbing when she wins. \"I'm someone who wears their heart on their sleeve,\" she says. \"I find it hard to act other than the way I feel.\"</p> <p>She is suffering from a throat infection, which flared up predictably in the wake of her Olympic training, so pops a few pills as we start. If some of her comments have an obvious, umbilical connection to past problems \u2013 she never bites a medal for photographers, she says, because it would be like \"licking a handrail\", reminding me of her compulsive teenage hand washing \u2013 well, none of it seems too troubling either.</p> <p>What comes across from the start is her quest for approval, specifically from men. The more desperate she has been to achieve this, the more it seems to have pushed people away. We talk about her earliest memory, and she says it is probably of watching her father race. Max Pendleton was a star amateur cyclist when she was growing up, and the book begins with him riding away from her up a hill, as she struggles to catch him, with the words \"he doesn't love me, he doesn't love me,\" beating through her head.</p> <p>Her other earliest memory is of being on the back of a yellow tricycle, ridden by her father, alongside her twin brother Alex. When they were four, Alex was pricked by a wild rose thorn that caused blood poisoning; he then had leukaemia. The illness came on suddenly, she says, and she remembers the moment he was rushed to hospital with perfect clarity. Was she worried? \"I was <em>very</em> worried.\" She began praying intently, night and day.</p> <p>Alex recovered, but their parents continued to watch him carefully; Pendleton writes that she sometimes \"had to fight to get noticed as much\", although life was pretty rosy beyond that. She began cycling at six, on the back of her dad's tandem, then racing with Alex, aged nine. For years he and the rest of the field \u2013 the juvenile group went up to 16 \u2013 would usually beat her. But Pendleton pursued cycling anyway, because she just \"wanted to be good at something,\" she says, with a note of desperation. \"I was just, like, all I want to do is be really good at something. Really, really good at something, so people are vaguely impressed by me.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395899805\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347042363599/Pendleton-in-action-in-th-010.jpg\" alt=\"Pendleton in action in the velodrome.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pendleton in action in the velodrome. Photograph: Visionhaus</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By her mid-teens she was beating Alex, and when they were 15, he gave up cycling, as their older sister Nicola had before. She uses an interesting phrase to describe this, writing that Alex \"saw his chance and took it\", as if he was escaping a kidnapping. Did she wish she had given up then, too? \"At times I felt like, 'Ah, I wish I'd been first to get out,' and then I was like: 'No, but those two would have both quit anyway, and Dad would be left with no one to cycle with.'\" Couldn't he have cycled alone? She laughs. \"Yeah, I know! He had lots of friends to cycle with anyway.\"</p> <p>But there was no giving up. She felt responsible for her father's mood. Did the pressure bother her? \"Oh gosh, yeah.\" If she was invited out on a Saturday night by friends, it meant she wouldn't be properly rested for cycling, and she would \"be filled with guilt,\" she says. \"Should I go, shouldn't I go? I really want to, but no. I'll go with Dad, and I'll go to the race, because that's more important, keeping him happy, than it is keeping [a friend] happy, and yourself happy ... You know, I didn't have to do it. If I'd had the strength of character to say, 'Actually, no, I'm not going this weekend,' I would have done. But I didn't.\"</p> <p>When she was 16, the national track team noticed Pendleton's talent, and she was invited to Manchester to ride at the velodrome. But she wasn't set on pursuing a track career yet. One of her most interesting qualities is her ambivalence about cycling. Where most champions seem powered by a blinkered obsession, she is much more clear-eyed. For instance, she fully recognises that sport is essentially entertainment, and finds this comforting. \"When you're in that bubble, training in that environment, with all those personalities who want you to win <em>so</em> desperately ... You think it's life or death. It feels like if you don't win you're going to be hung, drawn and quartered.\"</p> <p>But she remembers watching track cycling on television last year, \"and I was like, this is the most ridiculous sport on earth. Riding around a wooden bowl, with a bike with no brakes ... And it was just like \u2026\" She takes a big sigh. \"Aaaaaah, it doesn't mean I don't take the training incredibly seriously. But at the end of the day, it's just a bike race.\"</p> <p>She arrived at Northumbria University to study sport science, and started going to the gym every day. By her final year she was spending a week each month training with the British cycling team in Manchester. It was a male-dominated environment, and it is clear she felt an unworthy outsider at first, training alongside the men's elite squad, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/chrishoy\" title=\"\">Chris Hoy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/bradleywiggins\" title=\"\">Bradley Wiggins</a>. \"I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm rubbish. I don't even know what I'm doing' ... It really didn't feel like I fitted in. Not that they made me feel that way \u2013 the guys were always very friendly, but I did feel like a complete novice.\"</p> <p>In 2002, she came fifth in the sprint at the World Cup in China. Not long afterwards she went to train at a sprint academy in Aigle, in the Swiss Alps, under French cyclist, <a href=\"http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ma/frederic-magne-1.html\" title=\"\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Magn\u00e9</a>. \"Within the first two weeks,\" she says. \"I thought I was going to die. My eyes were totally sunk in the back of my head. I had bags under my eyes. I was so tired. I was like: how do people do this for a living?\"</p> <p>As the months went on, she began to doubt herself. She felt she needed to work on her core strength, and began to exercise outside her prescribed training programme. This angered Magn\u00e9. \"I had always feared letting down figures of authority,\" Pendleton writes, \"my dad most of all, and so I felt diminished by disappointing Fred.\"</p> <p>She had started cutting her arms with a Swiss Army Knife, and as their relationship deteriorated she continued. \"I'd been training really hard,\" she says, \"and my progression had been very slow ... I just dwelled on the negativity of being stuck in that little room in Switzerland, by myself, feeling like a failure ... Thank the Lord, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/may/08/4\" title=\"\">Steve Peters</a> came along, because if I hadn't met him, I think I probably would have left Switzerland, and given up.\"</p> <p>Peters, a psychiatrist, had been sent out to see her by British Cycling; the two connected instantly. So much so, he apparently introduced her once to his students as his \"greatest success\". He gave her \"some options,\" she says. \"'You are in control of this Vicky. You do have the power, and the ability, to retrain the way you think right now, and get out of this situation'.\"</p> <p>Pendleton headed home in 2004, before a disappointing first Olympics in Athens, where she came ninth in the sprint. But it wasn't long before she hit a winning streak, claiming the world championship in the event the next year. She has won nine world titles altogether, six in the sprint. Then, in 2006, she met Scott Gardner, an Australian performance analyst who had joined the British team, and after a frosty start, they fell in love.</p> <p>Both knew this wasn't allowed; a relationship between a member of the coaching staff and an athlete was considered unprofessional. \"We knew Scott would lose his job,\" she says, \"so that was an accepted part of us deciding to go on a date for the first time.\"</p> <p>Once they had decided they were serious, they told <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/01/shane-sutton-red-white-blue\" title=\"\">Shane Sutton</a>, head coach at British Cycling; he and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/dave-brailsford\" title=\"\">Dave Brailsford</a>, the performance director, agreed the relationship should be kept quiet in the buildup to Beijing. There, at the Games, Pendleton rode to triumph, confirming her position as a towering champion, the best female sprinter in the world.</p> <p>It should have been a moment of celebration, but all she felt was \"deadened incomprehension\", she writes. And these feelings didn't improve over the next few days. Sutton and Brailsford decided the news of her relationship with Scott had to come out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395899806\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347042216748/With-boyfriend-Scott-Gard-010.jpg\" alt=\"With boyfriend Scott Gardner after winning silver in the sprint this summer.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With boyfriend Scott Gardner after winning silver in the sprint this summer. Photograph: Andy Stenning</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Stenning</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the part of Pendleton's book I had reached when we first met, but I knew some of what happened afterward: the fallout from the revelation of their relationship, Scott having to leave his job. I just couldn't work out what was behind the continuing rift with the team's staff. After she won her medals at the London Olympics this summer, for instance \u2013 medals that marked the end of her cycling career \u2013 she and some of the senior staff didn't even exchange proper goodbyes.</p> <p>One was Jan van Eijden, her full-time sprint coach, the man responsible for holding her on the bike at the start of each race. They had a great working relationship before she became involved with Gardner, so it was difficult to understand why he would be so angry. Towards the end of her book though, the chronology breaks, as she reflects back on the night after she won her gold medal in Beijing. At this point, parts of the picture become clearer.</p> <p>Van Eijden had just found out about her relationship with Gardner, and the three were having a furious row. \"I was so shocked at the severity of his reaction,\" she tells me, when we speak again over the phone. \"I thought he might be a bit annoyed, but the fact that he was literally raging, livid, was shocking. He was disgusted in what we'd done, thought we were unprofessional, disrespectful and we'd betrayed him. All these words which, personally, for me, they're not words that people use. Because I'm not that kind of person. I'm very by the book, you know? I don't like breaking rules. For someone to describe my character, and Scott's character, in such derogatory terms, was very hurtful.\"</p> <p>She was so upset that she found a pair of nail scissors and cut herself in front of the two men. I wonder if, after this, some staff were scared of her. A colleague who reacts to a row by cutting themselves is someone you might be both worried for, and wary of. When I suggest this, she says she doesn't \"think anybody knew about it apart from Jan\". Perhaps that's true, but it's the sort of story that has the potential to spread quickly around a workplace, particularly one where psychology is so central. \"I don't think anyone will know until they read it,\" she says, \"if they read it.\"</p> <p>Has she had any reactions to the book yet from the team? \"No, I don't imagine they'd speak to me any more, anyway, to be honest. I'm not imagining I'll have much contact with them. As it is, they've sold my bike already.\" She is close friends with some of the team, but there are certain key members, \"who I am sure will be very happy not to have to deal with me ever again, and I think they'd probably be quite open about expressing that too. And I don't blame them, because if I've hurt them with my actions, I can't change it. It's something I'm going to have to live with, and I'm sorry it caused people such distress. But I'm in love with Scott, and I wouldn't change that. I'm very happy with him.\"</p> <p>The hardest part was \"if it had been any other kind of job, I might have been able to change organisations, and carry on doing the job somewhere else. But I had no other options. I can't change nationality, and I wanted to represent Great Britain.\" There were times when her relationship with Van Eijden was so bad that she almost felt: \"I don't want to win because he takes the credit for it, and really I don't feel he's part of my performance, any more, in some respects. But I would never do that, because I would never compromise my end result. But these thoughts would run around my mind sometimes, when I was feeling particularly low.\"</p> <p>She is \"pretty worried\" about the book coming out, she says. \"Because I have been fairly open and honest about a lot of issues \u2013 but I haven't told any lies \u2026 I was worried about British Cycling being annoyed that I've kind of, well, not talked them down, but haven't necessarily portrayed them in a glowing light ... For so many years I've had to talk about how amazing the programme is, and how well supported I am, and at times I haven't really felt 100% supported by that, but it's my job, it's what I have to say. And I'm still performing, so people are like \u2013 well, why are you still producing gold medals then, if it's so bad? It makes for a very difficult situation, and I don't want to be coming across as the whingy whiner, but I'm the only one to complain, so no one else has a problem.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think that I'm a particularly complicated person to work with,\" she says. \"But I'm not a robot. And if they've learned anything, I hope they've learned that they need to approach working with the girls in the team a little bit more sensitively than they have in the past. Because if everything I've been through has done that then it's been a success. And it would be nice that it's been worth it in the long run, because I do feel that somewhere that a lot of sports, and my sport in particular, fall short is the level of support for the men and the women is so different. They seem to know what men need, but they don't really seem to understand how to get the best out of the women.\"It can't help that so few of the senior staff are women. \"There's nobody with any power, female,\" she replies bluntly. \"And they need that, in my opinion.\"</p> <p>Pendleton is such a mixture of parts; a rock and indie kid, with a Smashing Pumpkins lyric tattooed on her wrist, who also revels in fashion. She says it's going to be liberating, to do whatever she wants, \"and not feel responsible! The only person I'm going to let down is me, if I don't do very well at my next job. I'm just going to have a whole year of trying new stuff.\" She plans to marry Gardner in 2013, and after that she'll start thinking about a serious career choice. \"I've always had this one thing overriding my lifestyle since I was nine. I have never missed a racing season since 1989. Having a year to make up for all that commitment is not unreasonable.\"</p> <p>She loved her Olympics experience this year, despite the disappointment of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/02/victoria-pendleton-pain-olympic-sprint\" title=\"\">disqualification</a> in the team sprint, and relegation in the first race of the individual sprint final too. When she won gold in the keirin, she says she felt: \"Oh, I'm so happy right now. This is amazing. I sung the national anthem, because I would anyway, but it was the only thing that stopped me from blubbering completely on the podium\".</p> <p>It would have been so easy to leave the self-harm material out of the book. It's not as if she's short of drama. But she says she wanted to send a message to other people that you could have problems like these, get past them, and succeed. \"I'm not the perfect model of what an athlete should be, mentally or physically,\" she says, \"but I've worked very hard to be as close to that as I possibly can, and it's taken time, effort and practice. It's not something that comes naturally, I wasn't born with it ... If you're willing to work, you can be better. You can be the best, there's nothing stopping you.\" The question is, would you want to?</p>",
  "<p>The international system is often accused of failing to give adequate early warning; of being myopic and not furnishing the appropriate powers with data and analysis that would allow an effective, timely response to predictable disasters. With the recent publication of the report, <a href=\"http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=1423\" title=\"\">Gaza in 2020: a Liveable Place?</a>, it would be hard to level these accusations at the UN country team in the occupied <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories\" title=\"\">Palestinian territory</a>. The report is a trend analysis based on data from authoritative sources, such as the UN's specialised agencies, the World Bank and the IMF, which sets out where Gaza will be in less than eight years' time. This is early warning writ large.</p> <p>By 2020 the population of the tiny Gaza Strip will grow by half a million people: 500,000 more to be fed, housed, educated, employed. More than half of the population will be under 18, with one of the highest youth populations as a proportion anywhere in the world.</p> <p>The lack of safe drinking water is the most urgent concern in Gaza today and it will only get worse in the years to come. The coastal aquifer is the main water source, but 90% of its water is not safe for drinking without further treatment. Three times as much water is currently extracted from the aquifer as is recharged from rainfall every year. Thissituation is not sustainable. By 2016, the aquifer may become unusable, and damage to it may be irreversible by 2020 without remedial action now. Already, people have to drill deeper and deeper to reach groundwater. The UN Environment Programme recommends resting the aquifer immediately, as it would otherwise take centuries for it to recover. At the same time, demand for water is projected to grow to 260m cubic meters per year in 2020, 60% more than is currently extracted from the aquifer.</p> <p>Only one quarter of sewage is currently treated. The remaining three quarters are dumped into the Mediterranean sea. Based on population growth, the amount of sewage and waste water that is generated per year could increase from 44m cubic meters today to 57m cubic meters in 2020. Current treatment plants need to be expanded and improved, and new ones built.</p> <p>These predictions have profound implications for all humanitarian and development organisations in Gaza, in particular the <a href=\"http://www.unrwa.org/\" title=\"\">UN Relief and Works Agency</a> (UNRWA) which works with Gaza's refugee communities. Some 70% of the population are refugees, with UNRWA's current caseload of over 1.2 million expected to rise to some 1.5 million by 2020. This 30% increase in refugees will require massive investment to maintain current levels of service.</p> <p>Take health: in 2011 there were over 4.4 million patient visits to UNRWA health centres, that could be expected to rise to over 5.7 million annual visits at current rates. UNRWA's 21 health centres currently have an average catchment of approximately 57,000 registered refugees; without new clinics that would rise to over 74,000 by 2020. To bring UNRWA closer to WHO standards, the agency currently needs an additional 90 doctors and 95 nurses. To maintain current service levels by 2020, UNRWA would need to add five new health centres, 220 doctors and over 300 other health professionals, and that is without improving the present level of service (over 100 patient visits per doctor per day).</p> <p>In the education sector, urrently UNRWA has 247 schools in 130 buildings, with 93% double shifting \u2013 the same building serving two separate shifts of students and teachers each day. To maintain our current student teacher ratio we would need over 2,000 teachers and support staff.</p> <p>On social protection UNRWA distributes food to over 900,000 refugees, after which some 44% remain food insecure because of a lack of jobs. Without improvements in the economy that can only come about with the lifting of the blockade that figure will rise to over 1 million. An additional 350,000 refugees by 2020 means some 20,000 new shelters will be required.</p> <p>Our prescription to avert this looming but avoidable catastrophe is simple. While the UN has condemned the rockets many times, we continue to demand a lifting of the blockade, which is costing the international community hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Allow the people of Gaza to enjoy the standards of development and economic prosperity for which they yearn. They are capable of self-sufficiency. They do not want the current levels of 80% aid dependency to continue and neither do the world's taxpayers who fund the international aid agencies. Let us address the root causes of this looming disaster rather than expecting the international community to foot the bill to mitigate their disastrous consequences.</p> <p><em>Robert Turner is Gaza Director of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees </em></p>",
  "<p>There is one good reason for Greece to stay in the euro: to combat corruption. It is a sad fact that the country is riddled with it and needs outside pressure and support to sort things out. Athens is not the only place in Europe wrestling with corruption, but we'll come to that later.</p> <p>Even if Greece and its prime minister, Antonis Samaras, could overcome the huge loss of pride and reap some of the economic benefits of quitting the single currency, they would still be left with a corrupt economy, much of which strengthens the power of unions and trade associations.</p> <p>City economists tend to ignore the problem when they assess the pros and cons of euro membership. They have arrived at the collective opinion that leaving the eurozone is the best, if not the only, option for Athens. Central to the argument is that an independent drachma would immediately be devalued, making Greek exports more competitive and at a stroke wiping out many, if not all, of the country's debts.</p> <p>There is also a political dimension that is centre stage at the moment, following proposals for closer union and control from Brussels and, in Greece's case, by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p> <p>Yet these economists ignore the challenges that beset a nation where very few people pay their taxes, where public-sector jobs are secured through family ties and where contracts for work, public or private, are rarely signed without someone in a position of power asking for a backhander.</p> <p>Greek banks are at the centre of the problem, as in Italy and Spain, where bankers perpetuate all the worst corrupt&#xa0;practices.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fe52b940-d59c-11e1-af40-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">Martin Sandbu</a>, chief leader writer on economics at the Financial Times, recently chided the southern Europeans for not jumping at the chance to join a European banking union. He argued that the loss of control over a crucial pillar of the economy to a higher EU authority was worth it when set against the chance to end the insidious and corrupt relationship between bankers, politicians and the professional classes, which had so far proved impossible to break.</p> <p>It may seem conspiratorial to argue that corruption is at the heart of the Greek malaise, but it is one of the main reasons Berlin is adamant Athens has had all the help it is going to get, without some evidence the cuts are going through. For German politicians, cuts to sacred state subsidies and increases in tax revenues are a crude indicator that corruption is being tackled, however tentatively.</p> <p>Supporting the view that Greece is beyond helping itself, an <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/09/04/1145251/greek-tax-evasion-mapped-and-crunched/\" title=\"\">in-depth study</a> of how Greek banks, politicians and professional workers behave was published last week by two economists from the Booth school of business at the University of Chicago and a Greek academic based at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</p> <p>Interestingly, their report, Tax Evasion Across Industries: Soft Credit Evidence From Greece, which documents the hidden, non-taxed economy, blames the current malaise not on dodgy taxi drivers or moonlighting refuse collectors, but on the professional classes.</p> <p>They found that \u20ac28bn (\u00a322.4bn) of tax was evaded in 2009 by self-employed people alone.</p> <p>As GDP that year was \u20ac235bn and the total tax base was just \u20ac98bn, it is clear that this was a significant sum. At a tax rate of 40%, it amounted to almost half the country's budget deficit in 2008, and 31% in 2009.</p> <p>The chief offenders are professionals in medicine, engineering, education, accounting, financial services and law. Among the self-employed documented in the report are accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers.</p> <p>The authors, Adair Morse and Margarita Tsoutsoura from the Booth school of business and Nikolaos Artavanis from Virginia Tech, were given unprecedented access to the records of one of the top 10 Greek banks. They found that, when professionals approached the bank for a loan or mortgage, their tax returns showed their debts almost exceeded their incomes ( debt payments ate up 82% of their incomes). For the beleaguered tax authority, this meant their income was too low to qualify for income tax.</p> <p>On average, they found the true income of self-employed people to be 1.92 times their reported income. Under generally accepted loan criteria, home ownership figure than the UK (80% versus 68%).</p> <p>customers would need to show that their debts, after their mortgage payments were taken into consideration, were less than 30% of their income.</p> <p>Of course, several countries lost control of banking regulation in the runup to the financial crash, including the UK, Ireland and Spain. But it is noticeable that the two countries that have so far done the least about the corrupt relationship between banks and their customers \u2013 Greece and Spain \u2013 are the two countries in the worst trouble.</p> <p>Unlike Ireland, which has exposed a wealth of corrupt practices, Spain continues to hide the extent of its bad loans, especially to property developers who are friends of the bank chiefs who sanctioned their loans.</p> <p>To emphasise the global scale of the problem, the authors point out that World Bank studies show that 52% of corporations worldwide hide some of their income from the tax authorities, and 36% of European companies do so. Corruption is everywhere as companies and individuals seek to preserve their status, incomes and standard of living.</p> <p>Brussels, while enforcing strict rules on Athens, has struggled to contain the rampant corruption that infects its own business and farming subsidies. With that in mind, it may seem a bit rich to lecture the Greeks, but an appreciation of paradox has never been the eurocracy's strong point.</p> <p>The Greeks have begun to crack down on tax evasion. Only this weekend, raids on 11 people found tens of millions of euros' worth of undeclared property and assets in New York, London and various offshore tax havens.</p> <p>The Greek finance ministry's financial crimes unit conducted the raids, and says it has many other groups in its sights.</p> <p>However, broader attempts to crack down on the professions were blocked last year by the Greek parliament. MPs voted against a bill mandating tax audits on people who had incomes below a minimum threshold. The bill targeted 11 professions, including vets, architects, engineers, economists, doctors, lawyers and accountants.</p> <p>The authors found, almost as an aside to their central examination of tax evasion, that the occupations represented in parliament \"are very much those that evade tax, even beyond lawyers\".</p> <p>They said: \"Half of non-lawyer parliamentarians are in the top three tax-evading industries, and nearly a super-majority in the top four evading industries.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was seeing the Spectator's reshuffle live blog that did it. How many of these things are there, one couldn't help but wonder amid a deluge of desktop tweets and rolling news ticker feeds? Planning had one, as did Wales Online, and LibDem Voice \u2013 all cheerfully competing with the BBC and, yes, the Guardian. And why not, they are easy to produce \u2013 one hard-working person, Sky News, a Twitter account and a live-blogging widget for WordPress and you are away. The traffic is higher than most other types of content, and as long as you don't do sums everything feels good.</p> <p>The arithmetic, though, can be disturbing. If the web adverts on the page are yielding \u00a35 per thousand (a decent number in truth), then those handy-looking 100,000 page views (for those who can get them) suddenly don't add up to much money. Well, \u00a3500. The bigger brands, of course, have other financial advantages \u2013 but also those legacy overheads supported by that supposedly out-of-date print business. Yet as everything goes to digital, there really ought to be some other ideas rather than everybody just doing the same thing. If you thought the reshuffle was bad, wait until you count the number of sites liveblogging the iPhone5 launch.</p> <p>Thomas Hobbes had a phrase for this (as did James Murdoch, who called it the \"all-media market\"), but the Hobbesian \"war of all against all\" cannot be good for the economics of the news business, which has always prospered on the back of some sort of regulated or practical oligopoly, from network broadcasters to local newspapers. Maybe Leveson will find a Leviathan regulatory solution compelling, but it seems unlikely. After all, the internet makes the bedroom v newsroom competition inevitable.</p> <p>Creatively there is so much to celebrate, and it wouldn't matter much if one blog site disappeared in favour of another. Nobody would miss LibDem Voice's reshuffle blog if it was absent next time, in the way nobody misses the Morning Post or Daily Sketch, as long as the overall news ecology is healthy. But it is hard to shake the notion that there is too much similarity of approach around when political coverage is reduced to embedded tweets, and no product launch from Apple can go unblogged, possibly even as much as a day in advance.</p> <p>Mail Online, interestingly, doesn't go for in political live blogs, or indeed live blogs at all \u2013 which does no harm to its traffic or its success. Other spheres of British life will have to hope that the celebrity steamroller of Derry Street shows no interest in them too. Meanwhile, the Times and other subscription publishers have chosen to chase after a different pool of revenues, which at least keeps them out of the traffic game. But while it may matter less for the already wildly profitable Mail (in print, that is), it may eventually matter rather more for everyone else, given how many people will be reading from a free tablet phone in 10 years' time.</p> <p>Well, that's a start of sorts, but there needs also to be a more honest recognition of how hard it will be to get to digital scale, as originally produced news doesn't come cheap. The music industry solved this problem by reducing itself to three global companies, which is not an option in the news game. But is it not possible to share more costs? Perhaps sales forces or technological development \u2013 although, given the way things are heading, perhaps it is Apple that will take over all these tasks in return for a 30% rake-off. Or even swap content, and not just nicking each other's tweets. The Guardian still remembers the day when Mail Online linked to a couple of phone-hacking stories from its front.</p> <p>None of this reduces the need for editorial differentiation because, to be honest, all the other newspapers are wrong. But at the moment, the news industry is converging on content while each organisation shells out for its own overheads. Surely that is the wrong way round.</p>",
  "<p>Shell has been accused of \"stock-car racing recklessness\" after apparently undertaking only the most limited testing of a key piece of equipment aimed at preventing a Gulf of Mexico-style blowout during its controversial drilling in the Arctic.</p> <p>Documents obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request suggest field-testing of a containment dome took place over two hours on 25 and 26 June. The dome, known as a \"capping stack\", would be dropped over any stricken wellhead.</p> <p>Two officials from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSSE) \u2013 an arm of the US interior department \u2013 were present with Shell officials at the tests in Puget Sound, Washington, but there was no independent verification of the tests.</p> <p>Shell reportedly started work yesterday on the $4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) drilling programme in the Chukchi Sea, 70 miles off Alaska's north-west coast. It does not yet have permission to drill into oil reserves.</p> <p>Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer), a US group that helps federal and state employees raise the alarm on environmental protection issues, said it was shocked by the single page of notes from the government agency after it filed a federal lawsuit against the BSSE asking for all documents relating to the capping tests.</p> <p>This \"slim production\" belied the agency's [BSSE] claim in press statements that it had conducted comprehensive testing to meet \"rigorous new standards\", added Peer. \"The first test merely showed that Shell could dangle its cap in 200ft of water without dropping it,\" said Kathryn Douglass, a Peer staff lawyer. \"The second test showed the capping system could hold up under laboratory conditions for up to 15 minutes without crumbling. Neither result should give the American public much comfort.\"</p> <p>Shell did not contest the assumptions made by Peer about the testing but said the containment cap was only one of various pieces of equipment assembled over a long period of time to deal with any emergency.</p> <p>\"Approval of our Chukchi Sea oil spill response plan [Orsp] \u2026 validates the huge amount of time, technology, and resources we have dedicated to assembling an Arctic oil spill response fleet second to none in the world,\" said a Shell spokesman.</p> <p>\"It reinforces that Shell's approach to Arctic exploration is aligned with the high standards the department of interior expects from an offshore leader. Specifically, Shell's Orsp includes the assembly of a 24/7 onsite, nearshore and onshore Arctic-class oil spill response fleet, collaboration with the US Coast Guard to test roles and responsibilities and newly engineered Arctic capping and containment systems.\" Environmental campaigners Greenpeace said the limited testing of the crucial sub-sea cap displayed a \"total disregard\" for even the most basic safety standards.</p> <p>\"Such recklessness wouldn't look out of place in a stock-car race,\" said Ben Ayliffe, senior Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace. \"The only option now is for the US government to call a halt to Shell's plans to open up the frozen north because the company is so clearly unable to operate safely in the planet's most extreme environment.</p> <p>\"Whatever Shell is able to do in the narrow window between now and when the sea ice returns, it won't erase the clear evidence we've seen in the past two months that there's no such thing as safe drilling in the Arctic.\"</p> <p>The company was granted permission to starting digging with its drill ship in the Chukchi Sea but only into the layer of ocean bottom located above oil reserves.</p> <p>Shell can dig 20-by-40ft mud-line cellars, which will eventually hold and protect a well's blowout preventer 40ft below the seabed. The US interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said he had made his decision after an exhaustive review of Shell drilling rigs and safety equipment, including a capping stack.</p> <p>\"Any approved activities will be held to highest safety, environmental protection and emergency response standards,\" he said.</p> <p>Shell hopes to drill exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in this year's open-water season, rapidly drawing to a close.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2012.

  "<p>In Turkey, outside big cities, social life concentrates on coffee houses, that is, if you are a man. This week, the customers of a coffee house in a village in the Mediterranean region saw a young woman carrying a bloody sack. Inside was a severed head. She hurled the sack towards them and said: \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2199244/I-saved-honour-Mother-shot-decapitated-rapist-pregnant-dumped-head-village-square.html\" title=\"\">I saved my honour</a>. Do not talk behind my back any more.\"</p> <p>The woman was 26-year-old Nevin Yildirim, a mother of two. Her husband had been away working at a seasonal job in another town. In his absence Nurettin Gider, aged 35 and a father of two, had raped her repeatedly, taken photos of her naked, and blackmailed her. She had become pregnant. He had been boasting about his visits to her house to his drinking buddies, and there were people in the village who knew what was going on.</p> <p>She shot him 10 times, stabbed him in the abdomen and cut off his head. She turned herself in, and told the police she would rather die than have the baby. Her seven-year-old daughter was about to start school this autumn. She said she didn't want anyone to call her children \"the whore's kids\". Instead, they would be seen as \"the children of a woman who had cleansed her honour\".</p> <p>The case has caused an uproar in Turkey. Women's organisations have rallied to her support, her story has received wide coverage in the media, the social media has buzzed with remarks, and an appeal has been made for her to have an abortion. As I write, the court has announced its decision against the appeal. Yildirim turned out to be 29 weeks pregnant, past the legal limit to terminate a pregnancy, which is 10 weeks. In cases where a woman's health is endangered, abortion can be allowed at up to 20 weeks.</p> <p>The court's decision sparked a debate with deep moral, social and political implications. Not long ago, members of the government discussed limiting, if not banning, both caesarean section and abortion rights in Turkey. The health minister, Recep Akdag, had said that should any children be born as a result of rape or violence, the government would take care of them. The proposal on abortion was fiercely opposed across society, as a result of which it was shelved. The laws regarding C-section, however, have been changed and the procedure greatly limited.</p> <p>The truth is, recent debates on women's bodies and reproduction rights have left a bad taste in the mouths of us Turkish women. The suddenness of the proposal and the lack of a genuine, pluralistic debate left many women uncomfortable and worried about the future. Turkish women have enjoyed greater rights than their sisters in other parts of the Muslim world. But all of a sudden, women realised the rights they had taken for granted could one day be taken away.</p> <p>For women in Turkey who are victims of domestic or sexual violence, there are few doors to knock on. There are few women's shelters, and too often society tends to judge the victim, not the perpetrator. Every year women are killed or forced to commit suicide in the name of honour. In a context as unfair as this, we need politicians who are sensitive to women's problems and dedicated to solving them. However, unlike other areas of life in Turkey, local and national politics remains stubbornly patriarchal.</p> <p>Yildirim's baby needs to be treated as a free individual and raised with love and care in a healthy environment where he or she won't be stigmatised. Yet Turkey is far from there. This is a male-dominated country where codes of honour run deep and it is always women who pay the price \u2013 women, and at times their innocent children.</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the more bizarre and pathetic policy ideas of modern times: the notion that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/06/david-cameron-planning-laws-growth-plan\" title=\"\">economy</a>, which has stubbornly resisted the CPR of many billions of quantitative easing, might suddenly be revived \"kick-started\", to use the inevitable term, by a rush of people sticking extra-large kitchens and conservatories on their houses.</p> <p>That, however, is what David Cameron suggested when he called for \"planners to get off our backs\" as part of his and George Osborne's plan to ride to prosperity on a wave of plasterboard and PVC windows. The proposal is to double the size of extensions that can be built without planning permission. This relaxation is time-limited and will last 12 months. Perhaps it is to be expected of a government whose new health secretary thinks that hugely diluted remedies can cure disease, as this plan is like homeopathy for heart attacks. One of the questions it raises is: if the fundamental problem is that banks won't lend, why will they lend to this extensions boom? Perhaps there are some savings to be unlocked, but hardly enough for all that kick-starting.</p> <p>Another question is: how obstructive, really, are planners to extensions to buildings that are not in conservation areas? Existing policy does not give them much power to refuse such things and 90% are approved. It's queer, too, that an early triumph of this government was the abolition of \"garden grabbing\", the practice of building new homes in back gardens. The extension rush will also grab gardens, albeit in a different way.</p> <p>Consequences will include a new form of email spam, as unsolicited offers to exploit the new opportunity will join invitations to claim for mis-sold insurance and personal injury; mortal feuds between neighbours; TV investigations in subsequent years into collapsing/leaking/over-budget/unfinished extensions and the lives they have ruined.</p> <p>It's not that the liberalisation of planning policy should never be considered. What are questionable, however, are the one-year time limit, which is an invitation to rushed and ill-considered building, and the idea that the coalition's conservatories will do for the British economy what FDR's dams and bridges did for America in the 1930s. In this respect, the hoped-for B &amp; Q New Deal is a new version of an old fallacy, that the economy can be changed by twiddling a knob on the planning system.</p> <p>The latter is too sluggish and unresponsive for that. It is by nature about the long term and to treat it otherwise is to abuse it. The results are likely to be shoddy and the possibility of good planning \u2013 the balanced consideration of competing forces and interests, preferably with some positive end in view \u2013 becomes ever more remote.</p> <p>It has also thoroughly exposed how, for three decades, economic policies in Britain and America have relied on house prices and house building, with disastrous results. \"The built environment helped create the economic crisis,\" said Shaun Donovan, the US secretary of housing and urban development, and the coalition's latest idea is simply another spasm of this inglorious obsession.</p> <p>To use the planning of homes as a short-term economic instrument is bad planning and bad economics. Is it too much to ask to have an economic policy not based on house prices and house building and a housing policy not based on economic targets?</p>",
  "<p>For once Lord Coe appeared lost for words when the London 2012 chairman was asked for his highlight of the Paralympic Games. \"It's all been pretty bloody good, actually,\" he said eventually.</p> <p>The British Paralympic Association unveiled plans on Saturday to try to capitalise on the unprecedented success of the London Games, including a new UK-wide talent search to find the next Jonnie Peacock and grow grassroots disability sport.</p> <p>London 2012 organisers sold 2.7m tickets for the Games amid huge media interest, with Channel 4 revealing that a peak audience of 6.7m tuned in to watch Peacock's victory in the T43/44 100m final on Thursday.</p> <p>\"They come into the Park and they're excited. They watch the sport and the excitement moves to exhilaration,\" said Coe, who said he had been told by friends that Peacock's performance was one of the best British sporting moments ever. \"Then they are educated, if you like, into the nature of the elite level sport and then leave edified. I don't think anybody will see sport or disability in the same way again in this country.\"</p> <p>The BPA's chief executive, Tim Hollingsworth, said the joint approach to the two Games taken by the organising committee, but with an emphasis on marketing them separately, and the media coverage had enabled the Paralympics to grip the nation.</p> <p>A series of British Paralympians have burst into the public consciousness with performances that helped the team meet their target of bettering the 102 medals they won in Beijing with four days of competition to spare. Hollingsworth said the organisation had met its twin goals of meeting performance targets while also changing the perception of the population towards disability.</p> <p>In particular, added the BPA's corporate relations manager, Jane Jones, it had been a vehicle to engage children in Paralympic sport and shape their view of disability. There have been many more children in the Park during the Paralympics, owing to special rates for schools and cheap family tickets.</p> <p>But Hollingsworth said the Games had also proved how much the depth of competition had improved. He said that made it even more important to find and develop new talent, while at the same time growing grassroots participation and, in the words of Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, \"defending the rights of disabled people to be rubbish at sport\".</p> <p>Peacock, who lost his leg to viral meningitis at the age of five and delivered one of the standout moments of either Games in the Olympic Stadium, was discovered at a talent identification day at Mile End Stadium in the wake of the Beijing Games. \"About 100 came through the door in Mile End, one of whom was a 15-year-old boy called Jonnie Peacock. That was his first exposure to disability sport in an organised fashion,\" Hollingsworth said. \"It was that inspirational impact of Beijing that got him into it and we hope that we can find not just the next Jonnie Peacock, but many like him.\"</p> <p>The expanded festivals, one in each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, are likely to take place in December. The BPA is also in talks with a number of London 2012 sponsors about continuing their involvement with Paralympic sport.</p> <p>Hollingsworth and Coe said they hoped the media would continue to cover disability sport, but the former also recognised it was incumbent on the Paralympic movement to make its product as attractive as possible.</p> <p>The BPA and the IPC hope to reap a commercial dividend in signing up sponsors. The BPA will hear in December from UK Sport how much it will get from public funds to prepare the team&#xa0;for the next Games in Rio. It received \u00a31.8m for London, with the sports themselves receiving another \u00a349.2m. The IPC has committed to trying to simplify the classification system further, removing combined events from the athletics programme over the next four years, and introducing more international standard competitions between Games.</p> <p>Hollingsworth said: \"It's a fast-moving journey. The challenge now is to learn from all the positives that have come out of London, to create an environment where the competition is robust. Ultimately you would want to have the separation of classes, to have singular events where people are competing on a level playing field.\"</p> <p>Coe said that continuing the upward trajectory of Paralympic athletes and sport would depend on continued media focus. \"It's the big challenge, it's the challenge for Olympic sport and Paralympic sport. The speed with which we reverted to back page leads for England v Moldova, that relegation happened too quickly last night.\"</p> <p>Challenging broadcasters and the press to continue their coverage, he added: \"We have moved this on. We could not have done more in the last 10 days to move this on.\"</p> <p>Channel 4 has committed to returning its magazine programme <em>That Paralympic Show</em> to the schedules from next year and will invest \u00a3250,000 in finding further opportunities for the new disabled presenters recruited to front its coverage.</p> <p>According to a survey carried out for Channel 4 by BDRC Continental and YouGov, two-thirds of viewers said its coverage of the Paralympics had had a favourable impact on their perception of disabled people. More than four in five agreed that disabled athletes were as talented as non-disabled athletes, rising to more than nine in 10 among those who had watched the event on Channel 4, and 64% of adults agreed that the Paralympics was \"as good as the Olympics\", rising to 79% among those who had watched Channel 4's coverage.</p>"
