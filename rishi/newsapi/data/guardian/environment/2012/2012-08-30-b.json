  "<p>Britain's business community is urging the government to accelerate plans to boost growth after its own forecasts predicted that the UK economy will shrink this year.</p> <p>The CBI warned in its quarterly outlook that unemployment would continue to rise until the middle of 2013 after it downgraded growth this year from 0.6% to -0.3%. Without the expected lift in high street spending from the diamond jubilee and the Olympics, the CBI said that declining exports and the ongoing euro crisis would take their toll on GDP growth.</p> <p>The economy is expected to rebound next year, but by a lacklustre 1.2%, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which revised down its previous prediction of 2% growth in 2013.</p> <p>Revealing a growing frustration among business leaders at the lack of urgency in government, the BCC said \"bold action\" was needed to \"help UK companies overcome the current global headwinds and lay the groundwork for a stronger future\".</p> <p>John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said the economy was stagnating under the coalition, when it was the duty of ministers to foster \"a virtuous cycle of higher growth and reduced borrowing\".</p> <p>He said the government needed \"to get some political backbone and show leadership\" with short-term stimulus measures. He added: \"Companies now accept they are operating in a tougher and more uncertain environment, but they need an enterprise-friendly government with bold policies if they are to drive recovery.\"</p> <p>As if to emphasise the gloomy picture, figures from the Bank of England showed borrowing on credit cards suffered its biggest drop in almost six years in July, declining \u00a3147m \u2013 the first fall in three months and the biggest since August 2006.</p> <p>The Treasury is working on a range of measures to boost credit and investment in road building and other infrastructure projects, though few are likely to get under way before 2015.</p> <p>George Osborne is keen to establish new forms of public-private partnerships to replace state infrastructure investment, which he has almost halved since 2009. The Treasury has embarked on discussions with pension funds and other cash-rich investors to support higher infrastructure spending. However, the complex arrangements are also likely to take several years before they bear fruit.</p> <p>In the meantime, the chancellor has relied on the Bank of England to ease credit conditions and make it easier for companies to borrow. A funding-for-lending scheme to boost the mortgage market and a scheme to encourage housebuilding are expected to make an impact later this year.</p> <p>CBI boss John Cridland said his members wanted to see an end to talk about initiatives in favour of \"spades in the ground\". He said: \"While we have got to get used to the fact that growth will be lower than it was before the crash, there are things we can do to boost growth. Measures to boost supply are needed, but there also needs to be measures that support households and household expenditure.\"</p> <p>Labour and the unions said the BCC's demand for a stimulus package revealed a breakdown in the previous alliance between business and the coalition. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"There is now a growing consensus that the government's strategy is failing, and the real man-or-mouse test is whether the chancellor will relax austerity and invest for growth and jobs.\"</p> <p>Labour said that Britain was one of just two G20 countries in a double-dip recession and that the shrinking economy had pushed up government borrowing by a quarter so far this year.</p> <p>Shadow chief secretary to the treasury Rachel Reeves said: \"Ministers must stop dismissing policies to boost jobs and growth which Labour and business groups have been calling for, such as examining the case for a British investment bank, tax breaks for small firms taking on extra workers and bringing forward infrastructure investment.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2012, because the original incorrectly suggested that Labour had said the shrinking economy had pushed up the cost of borrowing by a quarter so far this year.</p>",
  "<p>Adam Johnson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/24/sunderland-confirm-steven-fletcher-wolves?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">agreed to swap Manchester City for Sunderland</a> when he realised Martin O'Neill made him feel special. \"As soon as I spoke to Martin he gave me confidence,\" said the \u00a310m England winger. \"He's a manager I can have a good relationship with. He made me feel wanted.\"</p> <p>And for Johnson, that approach is in clear contrast to the experience of working under Roberto Mancini's colder, more distant regime at the Etihad Stadium, where the lack of communication with City's title-winning Italian manager ultimately proved counter-productive.</p> <p>\"It's always nice to be praised as well as criticised,\" Johnson said. \"You can only take so much criticism and no praise as a player, it doesn't matter who you are. I'm sure the gaffer will tell me when I've done something wrong here, but you have to have that balance.\"</p> <p>An imbalance in Johnson's working life has drawn him back to his native north-east. \"The last few weeks, I've done a lot of thinking,\" said the 25-year-old who won Premier League and FA Cup winners' medals in Manchester but spent far too many games warming the bench.</p> <p>\"Leaving City, leaving the champions, was one of the biggest decisions of my life, but hopefully coming here will make me a better player. Martin O'Neill doesn't want us to just be a mid-table team \u2013 and I want to play week in, week out. Coming here, I know I can enjoy playing football again.\"</p> <p>The latter words were heartfelt. \"Being dropped after playing well was difficult at City,\" he said. \"There were games when I deserved to be playing, but obviously there is a lot of money being spent on world-class foreign players and, relatively speaking, I wasn't a massive signing.</p> <p>\"I think it was always going to be difficult for me to get a run in the team, no matter how I did. There are a few other players still in that same boat now. I was disappointed I didn't play more. I felt I could have given a lot more. I was capable of more, but it didn't work out.\"</p> <p>Johnson's suspicions that the Etihad was perhaps not a true meritocracy were heightened by a lack of explanations from the manager. Asked if he was given reasons for being dropped, he replied: \"No, not really. We didn't really speak.\"</p> <p>So was Mancini overly harsh on the former Middlesbrough winger he signed for \u00a37m in January 2010? \"I don't know,\" said Johnson. \"I think all the lads there would say that. That is how he was with certain players, the other players couldn't say anything to him. It was obviously difficult, but he demanded the best from his players and that will stand me in good stead coming here. It has progressed me as a player.\"</p> <p>Johnson hopes the responsibility of being Sunderland's biggest star will accelerate his progress further. \"I think I probably played my best football at Middlesbrough, when I was that sort of guy,\" he said. \"When you go to City, you're playing with world-class players across the pitch, so I didn't have that same responsibility. I don't mind having that sort of pressure.</p> <p>\"I had the choice to sign for City or Sunderland when I left Boro, but looking back, I think anyone in my position would have signed for City at the time,\" said Johnson, who was born and brought up in Easington, just down the road from his new club.</p> <p>\"City were the team to go to and I had some great days there. The players are great and most of the staff were brilliant with me. It's a fantastic club and I hope they win the league again. I'd do it again if I had the choice because I won the Premier League and the FA Cup and that was my aim as a kid growing up. At least when I finish playing I can say I've done that.\"</p> <p>He cannot say he was part of England's Euro 2012 adventure and acknowledges that his omission from Roy Hodgson's squad hurt. \"It was difficult, it was tough,\" Johnson said. \"Hopefully I'll get another chance, though. Hopefully I'll be going to Brazil for the next World Cup.\"</p> <p>Johnson believes he is now working for the man who can help him get there. \"The other night when I made my debut [at home to Morecambe in Tuesday's Capital One Cup win] Martin O'Neill gave me confidence and freedom,\" said the winger. \"It was as if I'd had the chains taken off me.\"</p>",
  "<p>A gently mesmeric set in which the Malian guitarist Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 teams up with Israeli keyboard player Idan Raichel for a series of improvised, largely instrumental pieces in which both musicians quietly extend their range. Raichel has become something of a hero across the Middle East for his&#xa0;adventurous fusion of Israeli, Arab&#xa0;and African themes, though his&#xa0;band, the Idan Raichel Project, sometimes veer towards classy global easy-listening. Here, he allows the African guitar hero to dominate many of the tracks, with Tour\u00e9 moving away from his driving, electric-guitar blues-rock style to concentrate on laid-back acoustic riffs and improvised flurries that at times echo the work of his legendary father, Ali Farka Tour\u00e9. Raichel adds sensitive piano embellishments, and the duo are backed by insistent bass and calabash percussion, with added harmonica work and vocals from Ethiopian-Israeli singer Cabra Casey. Ideal for late-night listening or meditation.</p>",
  "<p>Len Wiseman's futurist thriller is a new version of the famous Philip K Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale; the result recalls Ridley Scott's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76627/blade-runner\" title=\"\">Blade Runner </a>and Christopher Nolan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135706/inception\" title=\"\">Inception</a>, without, sadly being quite as distinctive as either. And as for the&#xa0;famous 1990 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80204/total-recall\" title=\"\">Total Recall </a>by Paul&#xa0;Verhoeven starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, well, the effects are far flashier here, of course, although watching the first film is a reminder of just how much special effects can&#xa0;date. Now it is Colin Farrell playing Doug Quaid, the ordinary guy in a boring construction job, in a future&#xa0;world where a cramped and deteriorating urban society depends on&#xa0;exploiting the mineral reserves of subject colonies.</p> <p>Perhaps Farrell is better at playing&#xa0;\"ordinary\" than Arnold Schwarzenegger, who always looked so uncompromisingly extraordinary in any film he was ever in, but Farrell doesn't quite have Schwarzenegger's weird, almost extraterrestrial charisma. Quaid is married to Lori, played by Kate Beckinsale \u2013 the role was memorably taken in 1990 by Sharon Stone \u2013 and in&#xa0;this movie Doug's wife is a far more&#xa0;important character, in the action pretty much all the way through. Doug&#xa0;is bored and unhappy, plagued with bad dreams and on a whim visits a&#xa0;creepy company called Rekall that&#xa0;promises to implant vivid \"fantasy&#xa0;memories\" of exciting events&#xa0;in your brain. Quaid decides on&#xa0;a \"spy adventure\" memory, and this&#xa0;triggers a chain of terrifying events, which causes him to question the reality of his own life.</p> <p>One oddity of the film is that, in the&#xa0;future, the ruling empire is \u2026 us! The United Federation of Britain, which is busily exploiting a place called \"The Colony\". From the map in&#xa0;the opening sequence this would appear to be Australia. And why is it that Britain has attained such global importance? Well, the reason is that the plot involves terrorists, or freedom fighters, and they are supposed to be the good guys. Even so long after 9/11, distinctions have to be drawn and contemporary associations carefully managed. Having said this, the vision of London in the movie is interesting: a&#xa0;vast, ugly sprawl, as if a million Shards have been imposed on the city&#xa0;from above; it might not be so far from the future truth.</p> <p>It's a bit of a flavourless CGI-fest, without the character and comedy of the Arnie version, and it never really gets to grips with the idea&#xa0;of&#xa0;\"reality\" as a slippery, malleable concept.</p>",
  "<p>Spurs jangling and lances poised, the coalition partners are off, tilting at each other for the delectation of their party conferences. So far, it's only ornamental jousting, not war. So far. David Cameron charged first with his party-pleasing speech calling for another round of 17 new benefit cuts that the Lib Dems will not agree. In retaliation, here comes Nick Clegg charging down the lists with a wealth tax on the tip of his lance that the Tories will never agree.</p> <p>These great autumn \"differentiation\" games don't signify an imminent split \u2013 not yet. Hanging together for fear of hanging separately, both sides hang on hoping something will turn up, above all an upturn in the economy. Clegg gives Lib Dem discontents a wealth tax to appease those stunned by the austerity they voted for \u2013 and at how little their leader won in exchange. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/liberal-democrats-must-back-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Paddy Ashdown's high-flown support</a>, also in Guardian comment, is out of date. Those who thought they were in an uncomfortable coalition to save the country in an emergency now find Chancellor George Osborne's disastrous policy has made that emergency worse, the deficit rising, growth dead. Nor has the Lib Dem presence prevented the pain falling almost all on the poorest, in cuts the Institute for Fiscal Studies calls \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/01/tresuary-rejects-ifs-tax-cut\" title=\"\">without historical or international precedent</a>\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, Tory backbenchers' cup of loathing for the Lib Dems overflows. Their headbanging idiocy has inflicted a serious self-injury. By voting down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lordreform\" title=\"\">Lords reform</a> they have (almost certainly) lost the one really important prize \u2013 boundary changes in their favour, yielding 20 extra seats. With that, the Tories could have won a parliamentary majority on a 7.6% lead, but now need a 10.5% lead. Surely they could have negotiated some acceptable Lords reform for such a prize? Or they could have tolerated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/av\" title=\"\">AV</a> electoral reform instead of throwing all their resources behind a no vote. But visceral detestation got the better of them. The sheer pleasure of bullying Clegg was better than a Bullingdon night out.</p> <p>Now it's hangover time. The full import of their folly dawns on some of the brighter sparks. When Clegg said he would block boundary change in revenge for their reneging on the Lords, the Tories blustered in indignation. But you can hear them puzzling how to get out of this hole. Could they offer Clegg anything else? Might he consider party funding? State funding goes against every fibre of the Tory soul, but it could be a price worth paying for 20 seats.</p> <p>The boundary change is a skilful gerrymander. Technically it's fair, the only kind of fairness Tories ever like, one that does them good. But its rigid 76,000 voters per constituency leads to absurdities that abandon subtle boundary commission work balancing the number of voters with constituencies that make sense, keeping within one local authority and natural communities. Strict numerical dictatorship was like drawing colonial boundaries in Africa, with districts split from natural neighbours. The bill ordained this great earthquake every five years, breaking the \"sacred\" link between MP and constituency \u2013 which is the Tories' great excuse for opposing proportional representation.</p> <p>So we wait to see if Clegg sticks to his guns, avoiding the extra losses boundary change inflicts. On a 10% vote, his party shrinks to just 10 MPs; even on 15% it only holds 28. His conference activists see their councillors executed by the tumbril-load. As for party funding, reform is long overdue, but the next scandal may tip the balance anyway.</p> <p>Labour look on with glee at coalition jousting, relishing the lion's share of fleeing Lib Dem voters, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/lib-dems-ruthless-nick-clegg-loser\" title=\"\">1.6 million defectors so far</a>. Labour's conference will be less fractious than the others, with good poll ratings and relative unity. But the time for tribal trashing of the Lib Dems is over. The shadow treasury team's response to Clegg's wealth tax proposal was an infantile ya-boo of the kind that makes voters cringe: \"Nick Clegg is once again taking the British people for fools. He talks about a tax on the wealthiest, but he voted for the tax cut for millionaires in George Osborne's budget.\" True, but no longer to the point. Since Ed Balls backed Vince Cable's mansion tax, Labour should have seized this easy chance to embrace Clegg's wealth tax and build on it \u2013 it's popular and right to tax immovable wealth. They must never again let the Lib Dems pretend to voters to be the more radical.</p> <p>Any chance Labour gets to suggest a future phalanx with the Lib Dems further isolates Osborne and Cameron on the failing economy. Labour can steal the moral high ground by taking any policy agreements with the Lib Dems seriously. Wiser Lib Dems should stop repeating Danny Alexander's mendacious \"the mess Labour left us with\" mantra. Britain's public spending did not crash the global economy, and those who listen to Cable know the damage Osborne is doing. Nor does staying in the coalition require the Lib Dems to oppose Labour except where there are genuine disagreements.</p> <p>With a little more dignity and less knee-jerk tribalism, both sides should anticipate a possible future coalition which, shorn of Clegg and Alexander, would suit both well enough. All Labour's firepower should have the Tories in its cross-hairs: too many in the shadow cabinet lack street-fighting gut outrage. Whingeing at Lib Dem collaborators misses that target, while a more respectful tone on both sides greatly threatens the Tories.</p> <p>Leaders rarely walk the plank when they should \u2013 but thoroughly broken by what he has led his party into, Clegg should step down some months before the election to give Cable \u2013 during a leadership honeymoon \u2013 a chance to save what's left of their party. Labour might capture fewer Lib Dem votes as a result, but it needs the Lib Dems to hold seats that otherwise fall to the Tories: that's the hard electoral arithmetic.</p> <p>Take Norman Baker, Lib Dem transport minister, MP for Lewes, a little yellow enclave in the great blue of Tory Sussex. Boundary changes would abolish it, carving two new Tory seats. He needs Clegg to hold firm, and he is adamant: \"It's quite clear the Tories have broken the coalition contract.\" End of story, end of boundary change. Labour can never win such a seat \u2013 so needs its Lewes supporters to keep lending their votes to Baker. Easing off anti-Lib Dem bile is an electoral necessity \u2013 unless Labour tribalism renders them as stupid as the self-destructive Tory backbenchers. Lib Dem MPs have voted for terrible things, but small centre parties are destined to be Play-Doh in coalitions. Labour must learn to forgive, and Ed Miliband knows that. Grown-up politics are difficult.</p>",

  "<p>Britain's most powerful advertising man, Sir Martin Sorrell, is a step closer to relocating the headquarters of WPP back to London from Dublin, with a shareholder vote to seal the move due in December.</p> <p>Sorrell, chief executive of the world's largest advertising and marketing group, said the board approved the move, leaving shareholder consent as the final hurdle.</p> <p>He moved WPP's tax domicile to Ireland in 2008 in protest at the prospect of \"double taxation\" of overseas profits \u2013 once abroad and again in the UK.</p> <p>\"The UK coalition government has now enacted legislation covering the taxation of foreign profits from 2013,\" said Sorrell . \"This will mean that, at least for the life of this government, there will be no tax cost to the group by returning its headquarters to the United Kingdom from Ireland.\"</p> <p>But Sorrell was critical of the government's wider tax strategy after this week's call by Nick Clegg for a wealth tax.</p> <p>\"The government's troubles started with the budget,\" he said. \"One of the budget provisions was to move the income tax marginal rate down from 50% to 45%. From an entrepreneurial view it didn't make sense. If you want to improve entrepreneurial activity, reduce the rate of capital gains tax. Don't mess about with income tax \u2026 The government has shot itself in the foot. \"</p> <p>Sorrell said investors will vote on the move at a WPP extraordinary general meeting planned for \"early December\".</p> <p>He said: \"If shareholders think it is a bad idea they will vote it down. But I don't think they will.\"</p> <p>When WPP moved to Dublin in 2008 it was with the support of 99% of shareholders, Sorrell said, indicating there would almost certainly be overwhelming support for the board's decision this time.</p> <p>Sorrell also addressed the issues raised following WPP's annual general meeting in June, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/wpp-shareholders-vote-against-sorrell-pay?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">nearly 60% of shareholders voted to reject his \u00a36.8m annual pay packet</a>.

I still call Australia home but I'm used to English life. And in a way Australia feels quite foreign to me now, both in an exotic sense but also when you've been away from somewhere for a long time, it's not so much that the place has changed but it's a different era. You're nostalgic for that.</p> <p><strong>You're a patron <em>(2)</em> of this year's </strong><a href=\"http://www.filmfestaustralia.org.uk/#/ffa-2012/4567157855\" title=\"\"><strong>Australian film festival</strong></a><strong>. What do your duties involve?</strong></p> <p>Not much, really, to tell you the truth. Having my name on it, for whatever that's worth, and occasionally talking to people like yourself. I'm doing it out of some sort of patriotic sense of duty. It's a great festival and they're all doing it voluntarily this year. And the industry is important. Lots of Australians go to Hollywood after making a few films. It's a really good training ground, partly because the budgets are small, so they have to rely on a decent script and acting and plotting rather than throwing a bunch of special effects at it.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like a elder statesman? </strong></p> <p>I felt old. I feel elder. Being an ambassador isn't a title I'm particularly comfortable with because I'm not generally a diplomatic personality type.</p> <p><strong>There seems to be a bit of a grisly new wave of Aussie cinema <em>(3)</em>.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, that's probably a generational thing. It's like when, say, Lock Stock came out here, everyone wanted to make East End gangster films, and one of the definitive films for those Aussies is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84937/chopper\" title=\"\">Chopper</a>. Which is superb and so when you have a film like that, it makes producers more comfortable with financing darker scripts. And undoubtedly those scripts are a reflection of a certain aspect of Australia. Prior to&#xa0;that there was an era of big landscapes and horses.</p> <p><strong>You were in </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141656/red-dog\" title=\"\"><strong>Red Dog</strong></a><strong>, too: that was pretty popular.</strong></p> <p>Well, people like dogs, don't they?</p> <p><strong>Do you? </strong></p> <p>They're alright. Take or leave em. I'm more of a cat person.</p> <p><strong>Is it right that before your first films <em>(4)</em>, you wanted to join the army?</strong></p> <p>That was my one real ambition, and I got it from reading war comics. I think they have a magazine aimed at under 15s and they did a study and a high percentage who joined had read it, which is a little scary. But that idea faded when I became a teen and I realised I didn't really like getting up early and being told what to do.</p> <p><strong>And you play music <em>(5)</em> and paint<em> (6)</em>, too.</strong></p> <p>I play about once a month in pubs and I've got a little studio. I do lots of different things but I don't do them with any great ambition or plan to succeed. Just in the past couple of years I've tried to be a bit more serious. You have a lot of time on your hands as an under-employed actor and I don't like sitting round doing nothing and at a certain point if you're not doing anything with your hobby it becomes a dull. Even if you're not having any particularly great success it's good to get things out there it legitimises it a bit more.</p> <p><strong>But your music is quite successful. </strong></p> <p>It depends how you define success. If&#xa0;it's by making money, it's very unsuccessful but it's almost impossible to make money from music unless you are a chart-topping global sensation or a super-cute boy band, or their manager, and you have a good line in ring tones.</p> <p><strong>Could you make your songs into ringtones? </strong></p> <p>Not pleasant ones.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIrFfwc9BN4\" title=\"\"><strong>Your song Fuck You</strong></a><strong> <em>(7)</em> is pretty catchy. Do you ever hear people singing it? </strong></p> <p>I never have, it's a shame. I had my first singalong experience the other night \u2013 I&#xa0;did a cover of Like a Virgin and these Aussie girls joined in. So I felt like a genuine pub entertainer.

  "<p>During the inspiring (and often moving) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/paralympic-games-opening-ceremony-britain\" title=\"\">opening ceremony</a> of the London 2012 Paralympics, news began to filter through on Twitter that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/29/border-agency-eu-ban-university?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University (LMU) had had its status as a Highly Trusted Sponsor for international student visas revoked</a> by the UK Border Agency. Some might say it was a cynical attempt by government to bury bad news at a time of national celebration. Rumours had been rife that an announcement was due since the <a href=\"http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/news/news-releases/2012-press-releases/response-in-regard-to-the-sunday-times-story-on-london-metropolitan-universitys-highly-trusted-status.cfm\" title=\"\">Sunday Times broke the story on 26 August</a> \u2013 even before London Met had been told.</p> <p>The irony of timing was a poignant reminder of our nation's contradictory mindsets. On the one hand, London has greeted the Games in a way few had predicted. Athletes, officials and spectators from around the world have been welcomed to what may be the world's most multicultural city. We are told it is the first time in Olympic history that the host city boasts a permanent resident from all 204 competing nations. Games makers received a roar of appreciation at the London 2012 closing ceremony, and their contribution was surely key to the joyous atmosphere evident in the capital during those remarkable days in July and August.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another viewpoint is reflected in the embattled islander approach of the Home Office, resistant to appeals from chancellors, vice-chancellors, sector-wide organisations and concerned citizens that international students should be removed from the migration statistics since the vast majority leave the country after graduation.</p> <p>Arguments have fallen on deaf ears, whether due to the significant contribution international students make to our economy, the soft political influence international alumni spread around the world or the growing 'internationalisation' agenda. Universities have been encouraged by David Willetts to develop branch campuses and other partnerships overseas \u2013 a case of 'yes' to internationalisation, but only at a distance?</p> <p>The revoking of LMU's licence for international students will have a number of far-reaching consequences, not least financial. What looks like a political decision, or even scapegoating of LMU to satisfy right-wing immigration rage, will have unforeseen consequences across the university and for the individual students within it.</p> <p>Coming just days before the start of term, the inpact on incoming students will be considerable. Some will have worked hard to secure funding and support to achieve their dream of studying abroad, others will have packed and sent things ahead, some may even have arrived in the UK ready for the start of term. As for those already on courses, their search for another university will be complicated by the ease or difficulty with which existing credits are recognised by an equivalent course in a university that is still accepting applications.</p> <p>These are the immediate difficulties for international students but let us also spare a thought for the depleted international environment which domestic and EU students, as well as staff, will face on their arrival or return to LMU.</p> <p>One important aspect of internationalising higher education is to encourage home students to see beyond a parochial worldview, to open their minds to alternative perspectives and ways of thinking, to challenge stereotypes and confront prejudice, to become 'global citizens'. Nationality, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disabilities have all been used as forms of discrimination or a basis for exploitation and persecution. Foreign students can support our efforts to create a better world by helping us to confront preconceptions and bigotry.</p> <p>Universities have a key role to play in providing a crucible for debate and for large-scale contact with difference or 'otherness', opportunities which can be employed and extended through an inclusive curriculum which incorporates internationalisation alongside other aspects of equality and diversity. How will inclusivity across the curriculum be affected by this perverse decision?</p> <p>The Paralympics opening ceremony reminded us that nationality is only one aspect of diversity, alongside disability. In the words which rang around the stadium, \"I am somebody, I am what I am\", we were encouraged to see people not as able-bodied or disabled, but as individuals. Worryingly, the government seems to have failed to consider this nuance in students, whether home or international. That the news should arrive at a time when diversity was being celebrated to such stunning effect makes the paradox even more poignant.</p> <p><em>Elspeth Jones is emerita professor of the internationalisation of higher education at Leeds Metropolitan University and has published widely, including the edited collection, Internationalisation and the Student Voice</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The World Bank issued a global hunger warning last night after severe droughts in the US and eastern Europe sent food prices to a record high.</p> <p>Damage to crop harvests from exceptionally dry weather this year raised sharply the Bank's food price index taking it above its peak in early 2011.</p> <p>The Washington-based bank blamed the drought in the US for the 25% price rise of maize and 17% price rise in soya beans last month, adding that a dry summer in Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan lay behind the 25% jump in the cost of wheat.</p> <p>\"Food prices rose again sharply threatening the health and well-being of millions of people,\" said World Bank group president, Jim Yong Kim. \"Africa and the Middle East are particularly vulnerable, but so are people in other countries where the prices of grains have gone up abruptly.\"</p> <p>The bank said food prices overall rose by 10% between June and July to leave them 6% up on a year earlier. \"We cannot allow these historic price hikes to turn into a lifetime of perils as families take their children out of school and eat less nutritious food to compensate for the high prices,\" said Kim. \"Countries must strengthen their targeted programs to ease the pressure on the most vulnerable population, and implement the right policies.\"</p> <p>He added that the Bank was spending $9bn this year supporting agriculture and pledged that help to poor countries affected by food price hikes would continue.</p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney will use his primetime speech at the Republican national convention on Thursday night to address the biggest of his perceived weaknesses: his Mormon religion and his record as chief executive of Bain Capital, the company where he made his fortune.</p> <p>Republican party strategists said the main aim of the final day of the convention was to try and reverse the negative perception not only in relation to his Mormonism, but his image as a rich, uncaring businessman.</p> <p>Over the past few months, the Obama campaign has sunk $120m in ads that portrayed Romney as a out of touch elitist with questionable tax practices who made his fortune by shutting down businesses and leaving thousands of workers redundant.</p> <p>Mormonism is an especially sensitive issue, with many Christian evangelicals still queasy about the prospect of backing a candidate whose religion some have described as a cult. Instead of ignoring the issue as in the past, the Republicans have decided to address it head on at the convention.</p> <p>Republican officials, briefing reporters ahead of Romney's speech, said a senior member of the Mormon church would address the convention as well as two Mormon families who would tell how Romney helped them in their time of need.</p> <p>Paul Ryan, Romney's Catholic vice-presidential running-mate, touched on the issue in his contentious speech on Wednesday night, saying the two \"shared the same moral creed\".</p> <p>The convention will also address other perceived vulnerabilities, such as his time as governor of Massachusetts, when Romney introduced, to the disgust of many conservatives, a form of healthcare similar to that later introduced by Barack Obama.</p> <p>Thursday night is make-or-break for Romney. His speech, watched by tens of millions of Americans, provides one of the few remaining chances for him to open up a poll lead after months in which he has been tied with Obama. The convention, intended as launchpad for the autumn campaign, has so far been patchy, with the first day lost through Hurricane Isaac and a lack of energy in the days that followed, mainly because many delegates remain unconvinced by Romney as a candidate.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Ryan and Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state in the Bush administration, finally created some buzz with speeches that brought the delegates to their feet. But Ryan's speech, intended as a warm-up for Romney, left him at the centre of a major political row <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/paul-ryans-speech-audacious-untruths\">over a series of inaccuracies and misrepresentations</a>.</p> <p>Even as Ryan was delivering his speech, reporters, political analysts and members of the public were pointing out the misleading statements, in particular that Obama had robbed Medicare, the popular healthcare programme for those who are 65 and over, to help pay for his own healthcare plan. Ryan's own budget plan anticipates the same cuts.</p> <p>Ryan also suggested the closure of a car plant in his home town of Janesville, Wisconsin, was Obama's fault, even though it was shut down before Obama took office.</p> <p>The Obama campaign's deputy manager, Stephanie Cutter, at a press conference Thursday morning, said: \"There is no delicate way to put this: last night Paul Ryan lied.\"</p> <p>In a letter to potential Democratic donors, the Obama campaign manager Jim Messina wrote: \"If you've seen any coverage of Paul Ryan's speech in Tampa, you know that the consensus among journalists and independent observers is that it was \u2026 factually challenged.</p> <p>\"He lied about Medicare \u2026 he even dishonestly attacked Barack Obama for the closing of a GM plant in his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin \u2013 a plant that closed in December 2008 under George Bush.\"</p> <p>Russ Schiefer, the organiser of the convention, in a conference call with reporters, said that in spite of losing the opening day of the convention because of hurricane Isaac \"we have had a very good week\".</p> <p>In his first response to an incident in which two Republicans threw peanuts at black CNN member of staff, he said: \"It was absolutely deplorable.\" </p> <p>Romney was scheduled to be introduced by senator Marco Rubio, one of the most high-profile Latinos in the Republican party. The Republicans have another, mystery speaker lined up ahead of Romney's speech. Schiefer refused to disclose the identity of the speaker, but Oscar-winner Clint Eastwood, who backed the Republican presidential challenger John McCain in 2008 and also endorsed Romney, is in Tampa.</p> <p>The convention organisers said the build-up to Romney's speech would include business associates talking about his time as head of Bain Capital, including the founder of the Staples office supply company that Romney helped build up, his rescue of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics and his tenure as governor of Massachusetts.</p> <p>Also warming up the convention for Romney are the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who was one of Romney's challengers in the primaries and caucuses earlier this year, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush.</p> <p>Bush, in a round of television interviews on Thursday morning, acknowledged the difficulties Romney faced, given his lack of oratorical skills and failure to lack of warmth in public. He acknowledged he was never going to be \"a new-age kind of guy\". Bush said: \"Where it matters is connecting with other people's concerns.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ministers and universities have joined forces to help legitimate students affected by London Metropolitan University being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students\" title=\"\">stripped of its powers to teach and recruit students from outside the European Union</a>.</p> <p>London Met's vice-chancellor said the action threatened the UK university \"brand\", but the <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2012/august/28-LMU-revoked1\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency</a> insisted that problems over the enforcement of visa rules lay with one university, not the whole sector.</p> <p>The government and university chiefs have begun trying to help up to 2,700 students from abroad affected by the UKBA ruling which means London Met is no longer able to teach even its current international students. It is the first UK university to be stripped of this licence.</p> <p>Those affected need to find alternative courses elsewhere and get new visas within 60 days of receiving \"curtailment letters\", or leave Britain voluntarily. Otherwise they will be removed from the country.</p> <p>The Home Office clarified that the 60-day deadline would only begin once the letters had been delivered to individual students. The Guardian understands it could be weeks before the notices, which are a legal necessity, are sent out in order to give genuine students more time to relocate.</p> <p>The government has also set up a taskforce consisting of the UKBA, the Department of Business, Universities UK, the higher education funding body HEFCE, and the National Union of Students to deal with the situation. It is expected to have its first meeting on Friday to attempt to go through every London Met international student file to identify legitimate cases and help them enrol at other universities.</p> <p>About 290,000 students and dependent visas are issued by the UKBA each year, and 110,000 extensions to such visas.</p> <p>Malcolm Gillies, London Met's head, said the loss of its ability to authorise visas \"sends a fear through many universities in a way that I think is going to be detrimental to their confidence as higher education institutions, but also the projection of brand UK abroad.\"</p> <p>He said responses from other universities included \"commiseration, worry, anger, but also a feeling of probably, 'well thank God it wasn't us this time'. I think that shows the nervousness that many in the sector have, especially at a time when clearly government policy is changing but also when the [UKBA] guidelines have been changing very rapidly.\"</p> <p>Gillies has warned that the future of the university, which has 30,000 students, is at risk because the punishment for its immigration failures will leave a \u00a330m hole in its annual budget, a fifth of the total. The UK's lucrative higher education business in teaching international students involves about 300,000 students and is worth an estimated \u00a35bn a year to the economy.</p> <p>About 500 private higher education colleges have already lost their power to recruit abroad following crackdowns on bogus students.</p> <p>The immigration minister Damian Green said London Met had displayed a \"serious systemic failure\" to know whether its students had the right to be in the UK. He denied making the university a political football over immigration controls and insisted such action would not be replicated across the university sector.</p> <p>Green said people entering Britain as students but seeking work exploited one of the biggest loopholes in the immigration system.</p> <p>UKBA audits of London Met found that more than a quarter of cases sampled had no leave to remain in Britain. There was also no proof that a significant proportion of international students had satisfactory English. In more than half of the cases the university did not know whether students were attending lectures.</p> <p>Green said \"any of these three breaches would be serious\" and that it was important to ensure \"not just private colleges but universities obey the law\".</p> <p>\"What we found here is a serious systemic failure where it appears that the university doesn't have the capacity to be a proper sponsor [of international students] and to have confidence that the students have the right to be here in the first place,\" Green said.</p> <p>University funders and leaders said the first priority was to sort out the future of genuine students. It is understood the HEFCE and London Met have been in talks for weeks over the crisis, which began when the UKBA suspended the university's right to be a \"highly trusted sponsor\" of students on 16 July.</p> <p>Professor Eric Thomas, the president of Universities UK, said the organisation was committed to eliminating any abuse of the student visa system, but there were alternative ways to address UKBA's concerns and revocation of a university's licence should only be a last resort.</p> <p>\"We will be working with UKBA to ensure that compliance issues can be addressed in a more constructive way in the future,\" Thomas said.</p> <p>Syed Rumman, vice-president for education for London Met's student union, accused the government of \"chucking students' lives into the bin\".</p> <p>Liam Burns, president of the NUS, said: \"It is disgusting that international students continue to be used as a political football by politicians who seem either incapable of understanding, or are simply uncaring about the impact of their decisions on individuals, universities and the UK economy.</p> <p>\"This decision will create panic and potential heartbreak for students not just at London Met but also all around the country.\"</p> <p>The UKBA said it been working with London Met to put right shortcomings since March, the same month the <a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/1012/points_based_immigration.aspx\" title=\"\">National Audit Office</a> issued withering criticism of the agency's performance for taking \"little action\" in enforcing immigration rules for students. It said that in the first year after introducing the current system that licenses schools, colleges and universities to sponsor students in 2009, up to 50,000 students were thought to have entered Britain to work rather than study.</p> <p>Between February 2010 and October 2011 sponsoring institutions made 62,000 notifications to the agency that students were not attending college. The agency did not know how many students had left after their leave to remain had expired, although 2,700 students and overstayers had been removed from 1 April 2009.</p> <p>MPs on the <a href=\"http://Public Accounts Committee - UK Parliament\" title=\"\">Commons public accounts committee</a> will be reporting on the same issue on Tuesday, although the London Met crisis came too late for them to include it in their verdict on whether matters have improved in recent months.</p> <p>London Met has set up a helpline for worried students \u2013 +44 (0)20 7133 4141 \u2013 and the UKBA <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsfragments/72-LMU-student-page\">has posted advice for students online</a>.</p>",
  "<p>In Stockholm, 2,500 delegates have gathered for World Water Week to discuss the global water crisis and its effects on food security. Droughts and floods from America to Australia have devastated farms, frustrated civic leaders and caused food prices to skyrocket at a disturbing rate. Now companies are realising that water stewardship is both a moral imperative and makes smart business sense. With the world confronting a <a href=\"http://www.2030waterresourcesgroup.com/water_full/Charting_Our_Water_Future_Final.pdf\" title=\"\">40% gap</a> between the planet's supply and demand by 2030, the time to confront water scarcity is now.</p> <p>But for many companies, finding the best strategic approach to minimise water risk and engage local communities is still a struggle. Still undervalued, water issues challenge the smartest minds in business who have mastered the intricacies of finance and supply chain management. Understanding the complexities behind a company's overall water risk is often beyond the capacity of even the most brilliant employees. More companies have accepted that they need to work with civil society, academics and government agencies to reduce risk from water exposure and strengthen the communities in which they operate.</p> <p>For a multinational company, however, the development of relationships with partners can prove fruitful. As brewer SABMiller's water expert, David Grant, explains: a partner on water stewardship issues must have a wide breadth of international experience, while exhibiting the most granular knowledge of local issues.</p> <p>In SABMiller's case, such an organisation must exhibit the capability and commitment to work with a company on the ground for the long term. An understanding of the various water challenges from country to country is valuable, but local knowledge and connections are also key because most projects are managed at the community level.</p> <p>With the contentious issues that surround water rights and access, an effective partner must be agile in dealing with a wide variety of stakeholder groups, from local activists, business associations and, of course, government agencies. For a large beverage company such as SABMiller, working with a reliable NGO such as WWF is beneficial because of the perspective that organisation has gained from working on water scarcity problems years before they emerged on the brewing company's radar.</p> <p>An example of a project SABMiller could not have completed alone was a <a href=\"http://www.sabmiller.in/news-new2.html?pageid=946\" title=\"\">groundwater restoration project</a> in India. In the state of Rajasthan, groundwater reserves are disappearing at a distressing pace as water has been pumped out at a far more rapid rate than can be replenished.</p> <p>The sudden storms that hit the region are of little help because the local topography cannot handle the heavy rainfall, and therefore most of it washes away. For centuries local farmers built simple recharge structures that could capture storm water, but the region's recent surge in agriculture required a more modern take on these contraptions. To that end, SABMiller partnered with the Confederation of Indian Industry to develop both a plan and a more effective design for water recharge structures that would assist farmers with coping with the increasing rate of water scarcity.</p> <p>Meanwhile, German federal enterprise <a href=\"http://www2.gtz.de/dokumente/bib-2011/giz2011-0188en-climate-change-india.pdf\" title=\"\">GIZ</a> joined the collaboration and advised local government agencies on the business case for building these simple but critical devices to harvest rainfall. These recharge structures, each of which can add up to 80,000 kilo-litres to local aquifers, have provided farmers with a more reliable source of water with which they can irrigate their farms. SABMiller is now an involved local stakeholder seen as a problem solver instead of yet another giant company seeking profits at the expense of communities.</p> <p>Such partnerships also benefit civil societies. US-based <a href=\"http://water.org/country/india/\" title=\"\">Water.org</a> had long strived to help the poor gain access to clean water by working with poor families to provide their households with access to water. The NGO advocates micro-finance schemes that include household connections to water utilities, toilets and rainwater harvesting systems. But the donor community's insistence on digging wells, as well as the fierce competition to win philanthropic grants, posed huge challenges for Water.org's staff.</p> <p>In 2006 Water.org approached the PepsiCo Foundation to help scale its <a href=\"http://water.org/post-v/india-watercredit/\" title=\"\">WaterCredit</a> plan, an initiative that brings safe water and sanitation to India's poor. Two years later a PepsiCo grant helped launch a pilot program. Half of the monies went towards conventional well digging projects at PepsiCo's insistence; the rest funded the WaterCredit micro-finance market-driven solution. The results far exceeded Water.org's expectations, and last October, the PepsiCo Foundation awarded an $8m (\u00a35m) grant that promises to provide <a href=\"http://water.org/post/pepsi-foundation-8-million-grant/\" title=\"\">800,000 people access to safe water by 2016</a>.</p> <p>Indeed, PepsiCo can now say the company is on the path towards establishing a sustainable business model in India and other emerging economies. But Water.org's partnership with PepsiCo opened doors to more strategic partnerships with organisations such as Caterpillar, MasterCard and Silicon Valley's Skoll Foundation. Chevenee Reavis, Water.org's director of strategic initiatives, explained in an interview that the synergy these partnerships inspire between corporations and non-profits create a whole far greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>The sharing of technical expertise, finance and local knowledge boost economic opportunities, ensure more responsible and sustainable development, and bolster a company's long-term viability. No company, and of course no human, can survive without water. And the intractable problems that water scarcity poses guarantee that today no organisation can solve the problems it faces on its own.</p> <p><em>Leon Kaye is founder and editor of </em><a href=\"http://greengopost.com/\" title=\"\"><em>GreenGoPost.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>BBC Olympics presenter Gary Lineker has expressed his regret that the corporation is not broadcasting the Paralympics, after Channel 4's live coverage of the opening ceremony attracted a peak audience of more than 11 million for the rival broadcaster.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/30/paralympics-opening-ceremony-8m-viewers\" title=\"\">Channel 4's coverage attracted a peak audience of 11.2 million just before 9pm and averaged 7.6 million over more than four hours</a>, as the opening ceremony overran by an hour, finishing at about 12.20am. The previous peak audience for a Paralympics opening ceremony was 2.8 million for the BBC's coverage of the Beijing Games in 2008.</p> <p>Despite complaints on Twitter from some viewers about advertising breaks and the tone of Jon Snow's commentary on the parade of athletes, Channel 4 executives were delighted with the ratings, which vindicated their surprise bid for the TV rights to the London Paralympics two years ago.</p> <p>The audience for the Paralympics opening ceremony was about five times what Channel 4 would normally expect on a Wednesday night. Channel 4 was also the most watched UK channel on Wednesday with an audience share for the whole day of nearly 20%, giving the network a rare ratings victory over BBC1 and ITV1.</p> <p>Lineker, part of the BBC's highly-praised coverage of the London Olympics, said yesterday that he had been inundated with queries about why the BBC was not also the TV home of the Paralympics.</p> <p>\"Lots asking why BBC TV's not covering Paralympics? Strong bid was put in but organisers chose Channel 4,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/241148080152518656\" title=\"\">he tweeted on Thursday</a>. \"Shame for Beeb but wish C4 well.\"</p> <p>Channel 4 effectively left the BBC in the starting blocks with a knock-out bid for TV rights to the 2012 Paralympics of \u00a38m-\u00a39m, following a tender process run by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games. The BBC has the radio rights, with live coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live, 5 Live Extra and online.</p> <p>However, two years after losing the TV rights to the Paralympics regret still runs deep at the BBC, with one senior TV industry executive describing it as \"one of the biggest mistakes of all time\".</p> <p>\"From a remit and prominence point of view it has to be viewed as one of the biggest mistakes of all time for the BBC,\" he said. \"It is part of the BBC's remit to support exactly this sort of minority event, and given the massive momentum of the Olympics it is a giant lost opportunity to not be able to continue seamless weeks of promotion to drive the Paralympics after such a spectacular Olympics.\"</p> <p>A BBC spokesman admitted the disappointment lingers, but said the corporation is glad that the Paralympics went to a free to air rival rather than pay-TV.</p> <p>\"The BBC are disappointed to have not been awarded the rights to the 2012 Paralympic Games,\" said a spokesman for BBC Sport. \"We're proud of our traditions and record in covering disability sport. However we are pleased that the Games will be available to free-to-air audiences, and we congratulate Channel 4 on securing the rights. We are sure the 2012 Paralympics will be a great success. We wish Channel 4 the best of luck.\"</p> <p>There has been limited cooperation between the two broadcasters to promote the Paralympics, with the BBC twice airing Channel 4's Meet the Superhumans promo for its coverage during its programme.</p> <p>In its 2010 bid, the BBC had drawn up plans to give the event a similar level of mainstream coverage as Channel 4, with programming running all day on BBC1 switching to evening coverage on BBC2.</p> <p>BBC director of London 2012, Roger Mosey, has previously described its planned offering as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/rogermosey/2010/01/paralympics_rights.html\" title=\"\">\"our most extensive ever live Paralympic coverage\"</a>.</p> <p>\"People were absolutely gutted at not getting the TV rights,\" said one BBC source. \"There was surprise and disappointment, shell-shock, as there were big plans. It was regretted at the time and it is regretted now, but it was a big bid by Channel 4.\"</p> <p>In April Locog revealed that it had <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/media-centre/article=record-breaking-figures-for-paralympic-broadcast-rights-1254028.html\" title=\"\">brought in more money than ever from global TV rights deals for a Paralympic Games</a>, with foreign media including China's state broadcaster CCTV on board.</p> <p>\"Locog came to us, all the public service broadcasters were offered to tender,\" says Martin Baker, director of commercial affairs at Channel 4. \"It was a fair fight.\"</p> <p>Channel 4 expects to do a little better than break even commercially with its Paralympics coverage, but in terms of viewing the broadcaster has high hopes good ratings will continue to be delivered.</p> <p>\"We are optimistic,\" said Baker. \"We have got a fantastic inheritance from the Olympics because it was so successful. It is true it is a smaller event, but there is so much passion and interest that we are hoping it will do well.\"</p> <p>Responding to criticism of the number of commercial breaks during the opening ceremony, a Channel 4 spokesman said that a decision had been taken to reduce advertising airtime to a minimum in order to reduce interruptions to the coverage.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>It's been 50 years since James Bond first appeared onscreen in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/85424/dr-no\" title=\"\">Dr No</a>. In that last half-century, Bond may have got variously taller, and sillier, and nastier, and smarmier, and wiggier, and more fond of safari suits, and briefly more Australian, but despite these superficial changes the character has endured like no other.</p> <p>That's why, on 5 October \u2013 the exact 50th anniversary of Dr No's initial release \u2013 EON, MGM, Sony and 20th Century Fox are planning a global James Bond day. It's a chance for fans around the world to revel in cinema's most beloved alcoholic aristocratic borderline-misogynist state-sponsored murderer, and there will be a raft of glitzy events to accompany it.</p> <p>So far, these events include the release of a new documentary entitled <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/everything-nothing-untold-story-007-140000037.html\" title=\"\">Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007</a>, a charity auction at Christie's, a movie retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, a Music of Bond night in Los Angeles hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and a style exhibition at Toronto international film festival. And there'll be a survey to find the best Bond film. And all the Bond films are coming out on Blu-ray. And there will inevitably be lots of interviews with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144416/skyfall\" title=\"\">Skyfall</a> cast all over the place too.</p> <p>That's all well and good in principle, but all these planned events sound a little bit la-di-dah to me. Because, really, the common man on the street won't be able to enjoy the Music of Bond night, or the TIFF exhibition. Unless they live in New York, they won't be able to see the retrospective. Unless they're rich beyond their wildest dreams, they won't be able to buy anything at the auction. And unless they're too stupid to realise that it'll be on TV every single bank holiday afternoon until the end of time itself, they won't rush out to see Everything or Nothing. For such a global occasion to mark a character with such broad appeal, James Bond day comes with an undeniably off-putting veneer of elitism.</p> <p>That's why I'm proposing an alternative James Bond day, full of activities that people such as you or I \u2013 normal people, the people whose wages helped turn 007 into such an enduring icon in the first place \u2013 can easily celebrate in our own homes. For example, who needs to go all the way to Toronto to look at a James Bond style exhibition when they can simply put on their dad's old wedding suit, construct a makeshift girdle out of belts and clingfilm and spend the day wobbling around their house being sexist to women young enough to be their daughter?</p> <p>Or why not celebrate the day with a vodka Martini? Can't afford the ingredients? Put some WKD in a vase and just drink that instead. Planning a fish pedicure? Why not ask to be lowered slowly into the pool feet-first like Jane Seymour in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78442/live-and-let-die\" title=\"\">Live and Let Die</a>? Or, to really capture the true spirit of the James Bond series, why not just buy as many Sony products as you possibly can and show them to people logo-up for just the right amount of time \u2013 long enough to break their concentration in the wider story but not long enough to actually make them want to go and buy any Sony products themselves? James Bond would be proud.</p> <p>There. The official James Bond day might be hopelessly alienating to anyone who isn't a super-rich Hollywood mogul, but together we can create a better, more faithful, more recession-sensitive day of our own. Who's with me?</p>",
  "<p>With her open manner, easy smile and unshowy dark shift, Katherine Butler cuts a welcoming figure \u2013 hardly the default image of the hardnosed studio executive. Look closer, though, and you realise the pattern on her dress comprises clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. Butler is a gambler, then. As head of Film4's low-budget feature department, she has to be.</p> <p>\"You're always going to fail,\" she says matter-of-factly, cradling a paper cup of fizzy water in one of the goldfish-bowl conference rooms at Channel 4's Horseferry Road headquarters. \"You're going to win some and lose some. What you have to do is swallow really hard and say: 'With risk comes failure as well as success and if we're doing the films for the right reasons then you can learn from mistakes and move on.' That said, we've been pretty lucky so far. I'm waiting for the big disaster.\"</p> <p>Since Butler took on her role in 2009, Film4's low-budget slate has turned out award-winning titles including Tyrannosaur, Kill List and Dreams of a Life and brought Terence Davies back to the screen with The Deep Blue Sea. Its latest release, The Imposter, about a French conman who passed himself off as a missing Texan teenager, has just enjoyed the year's strongest opening weekend for a documentary that didn't feature Katy Perry.</p> <p>Hopes are also high for Peter Strickland's Berberian Sound Studio, a kind of baroque fusion of The Conversation, Mulholland Dr and giallo horror starring Toby Jones, released in the UK this Friday. Berberian gets its North American premiere next month at Toronto, where two more films from Butler's stable are also playing: Sophie Fiennes and Slavoj Zizek's Pervert's Guide to Ideology and Kill List director Ben Wheatley's Sightseers, which has been described as \"Nuts in May meets Badlands\".</p> <p>Taken together, these titles arguably stand for a bold new wave of British filmmaking: cinematically confident, generically tricksy, compelled by disturbing, ambivalent subject matter. Butler's description of one \u2013 \"it's an extraordinary story rooted in how people believe what they want to believe and how that desire can be manipulated, and the filmmaking creates Chinese boxes of narrative around that\" \u2013 could apply to most.</p> <p>These features' collective assurance is notable given their directors' relative inexperience \u2013 Davies being the obvious outlier \u2013 but Butler won't take too much credit. As Film4's head of development between 2005 and 2009, she had a hand in the likes of Slumdog Millionaire, Submarine and Attack the Block. (Before that, she worked in development at Ruby Films and the New Zealand Film Commission; she was also once \"chief tea-maker\" at John Cleese's corporate video company.) But the landscape for new talent has shifted comprehensively in the past few years.</p> <p>\"In 2009,\" Butler recalls, \"I saw several amazing micro-budget films \u2013 [Wheatley's] Down Terrace, [Strickland's] Katalin Varga, Tony by Gerard Johnson, who we're developing a project with at the moment \u2013 that were already pushing boundaries with strong directorial voices.</p> <p>\"Every year since then, two or three really strong, self-financed pieces come through because technology is enabling that to happen.</p> <p>\"Look at Andrew Haigh with Weekend or Tom Kingsley and Will Sharpe with Black Pond. New voices from outside the mainstream can get noticed and it's only in the last four years that that's become possible. The job for places like Film4 and the BFI is to nurture people coming through this route \u2013 to help enable filmmakers who have already found their voice to continue to work with the most freedom possible in an industry that is a business as well as a place of artistic endeavour.\"</p> <p>What counts as low-budget for Film4 \u2013 less than \u00a32m \u2013 can still mark a massive increase for a previously self-financed filmmaker, without introducing the kinds of pressure that tend to stifle experimentation. \"Low-budget is a very risk-friendly environment,\" Butler says. \"It's an engine room for innovation. You don't have commercial necessities hanging over your head as much as you do when you're working with bigger budgets. Of course, you want every film to find its audience, even if that's a niche audience, but there are other criteria for success. We want to work with directors again and again and again, so providing a home for filmmakers at the start of their career is really exciting. And pushing at boundaries is a key priority \u2013 low-budget is the only place you can do that so you have to be working with directors who want to take those risks with you.\"</p> <p>This is where the philosophical approach pays off. \"There are always those films like Tyrannosaur and Kill List which don't necessarily reach the highest box office,\" Butler grants. \"But those films are so acclaimed, they're such important stepping stones for their filmmakers, and they'll also have a really long life. I believe both those films will sit on people's shelves for years to come.\"</p> <p>Filmmaking calibre aside, these titles aren't exactly feelgood. \"I think Sightseers will surprise you with how feelgood it is,\" Butler laughs, not entirely convincingly. \"These films are all exploring different aspects of today. Kill List is really about a couple in hard financial straits and a guy who's forced to take a job he doesn't want to keep his family afloat. There is so much of now in each one of these films and maybe it's saying that Britain at the moment is not the most feelgood of places. But I would love to find new comedy talent that audiences latch on to with love and engagement \u2013 it's not a conscious decision, it's more responding to the filmmakers that are coming through and the stories they want to tell.\"</p> <p>Butler also reports that \"we're talking to Ken Loach about Spirit of '45, a documentary about the origins of the welfare state, the NHS and nationalisation of industry and its resonances for now, and we're looking at building a digital project around that with him.\" Shane Meadows's Stone Roses documentary is also in the editing phase and, Butler says, \"it looks absolutely beautiful. Again, it will be really flexing the muscles of the documentary form. It will be a music documentary unlike any other. It will be really personal.\"</p> <p>It's the up-and-coming directors, however, who really get Butler animated. \"These filmmakers are so cineliterate and so confident in the way they take genre on, whether it's comedy, thriller, horror or documentary,\" she enthuses. \"They're pushing those boundaries, reinventing conventions, evolving recognisable forms of cinema into something unique and completely their own. That's what really excites us \u2013 that search for a new generation of directors with the ability to take British cinema on to the next stage.\"</p>",

Students and teachers protesting over education were supported by the Chilean Trade Union Congress, which called on members to join the march. It ended with police turning <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/massive-chile-student-protest/story-e6frgcjx-1226460877213\" title=\"\">water cannon and teargas</a> on the protesters. But the protests aren't going away. For over a year now, this revolt has been developing. Mass protests and general strikes have shaken the government, as when 600,000 workers walked out last August.</p> <p>The main frontline of conflict is the country's education system. In 1981, the Pinochet regime dismantled free public education. Primary and secondary education is paid for by a vouchers system, which involves the government paying private sector providers to educate the young. Higher education is dominated by private professional and technical colleges, which cost up to \u00a3530 a month to attend. The state exists primarily as a regulator rather than a provider. As a result, working-class Chileans often receive at best a poor education, and students end up burdened with debts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395464266\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346335532918/Chilean-students-throw-st-006.jpg\" alt=\"Chilean students throw stones at a police vehicle in Santiago during a demonstration\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chilean students throw stones at a police vehicle in Santiago.

The students and workers say that the country's tremendous copper resources should be used to pay for reforms rather than to enrich investors. The struggles to change the constitution reflect a recognition that the political framework established by the dictatorship is itself part of the problem. Protesters look longingly abroad to Bolivia and Venezuela, where constitutional change has been part of the struggle against the old regimes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.globalissues.org/news/2012/03/23/13108\" title=\"\">Regional protests</a> have focused on the problem of \"centralism\", in which local needs are seen as being subordinated to the requirements of elites in the capital. In February, an <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/02/24/chile-aysen-region-and-the-call-for-decentralization/\" title=\"\">uprising</a> broke out in the Ays\u00e9n region of Chile, in a <a href=\"http://www.santiagotimes.cl/chile/politics/23428-chile-orders-special-cabinet-meeting-to-defuse-aysen-uprising\" title=\"\">struggle over privatised hydroelectric projects</a>. But the demands of the citizens' assemblies went far beyond the specific issues at stake: they assailed the constitution imposed during the dictatorship, demanded subsidies for the poor, employment opportunities, and the democratisation of regional decisions on the exploitation of natural resources.</p> <p>Workers' struggles have erupted with surprising militancy. Earlier this week, workers at the construction company Skanska <a href=\"http://www.elmensajero.cl/2012/07/27/trabajadores-de-skaska-se-tomaron-la-ruta-b-1-y-se-enfrentaron-a-carabineros-con-retroexcavadora/\" title=\"\">used backhoe diggers</a> against police during a strike over working hours. This is especially significant as union rates are extremely low in Chile, and legal industrial action is very difficult. Last week, the relatively conservative president of the Chilean Trade Union Congress, Arturo Mart\u00ednez, was defeated by the Communist party member B\u00e1rbara Figueroa. Mart\u00ednez's reign had been disfigured by corruption, and he was seen as a pawn of the Socialist party. A number of militant student federations have appeared to challenge the moderate, Socialist party-aligned Confederaci\u00f3n de Estudiantes de Chile (Confech), which initially led the protests. An increasingly visible leftist student movement is Consejos Estudiantiles, linked to the far left Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria, formerly a guerrilla movement which sought to build armed resistance to Pinochet.</p> <p>The demands of the movement are extremely popular. But Chile's president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, is a billionaire who is estranged from the needs of most Chileans. Having been a supporter of the rightwing opposition to Pinochet, he has sought to continue the dictator's neoliberal policies. And, like Berlusconi, his wealth and free-market policies are tied to media interests: he purchased Chilevisi\u00f3n, now leased to the US media giant TBS, prior to assuming office. His approval ratings <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/kirsten-sehnbruch-sofia-donoso/chilean-winter-of-discontent-are-protests-here-to-stay\" title=\"\">have plummeted</a> throughout this season of unrest.</p> <p>In many ways, the pattern of unrest in Chile is repeating that in Quebec, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/13/spanish-miners-strike\" title=\"\">Asturias</a>. In Quebec, an <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/articles/item/11040-the-quebec-student-protest-movement-and-the-power-of-the-radical-imagination\" title=\"\">ongoing</a>, <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/the-biggest-student-uprising-youve-never-heard-of\" title=\"\">militant student revolt</a> centred on opposition to increasing tuition fees broadened into a call for a \"social strike\" bringing workers' demands to the fore. The student leaders asserted that the issue was one of <a href=\"http://youtu.be/74JQQf4zfg4\" title=\"\">class</a>. Unions have provided logistical and legal support for the students, and the protests have spread through working-class neighbourhoods throughout Quebec. The unrest has already matured into a restless, broad-based social movement. Likewise, the Asturian miners' revolt escalated from a dispute over jobs into a wider conflict with the government, drawing in supporters across the country with a march on Madrid that attracted tens of thousands of supporters. A protest camp inspired by the Indignados movement was created by supporters in the regional capital, Oviedo.</p> <p>The tendency in these cases is for struggles that would previously have remained local, or sectional, to ignite a wider social rebellion aimed at concentrations of class power. In the context of a global crisis, localised flashpoints can no longer be contained. Diverse constituencies, from students and workers to local community groups, are finding that their aspirations are contiguous, their struggles linked. They have sought ways to unify their demands into a wide, frontal assault that cannot be contained or co-opted. In Chile, this has produced an incredibly optimistic, energised and combative left that dares to challenge the country's social order in a fundamental way for the first time in decades. The country that Pinochet terrorised is no longer afraid.</p>",
  "<p>Great Britain, with a disabled population roughly 11 million strong, is predicted to clean up in the Paralympics medal tally thanks to years of encouragement and investment in its disabled athletes.</p> <p>But while the achievements of the athletes are to be celebrated, millions of non-sporting disabled people face an ongoing battle in finding success and competing at the highest level in industry.</p> <p>According to government statistics, in 2011, just 48.8% of people of working age with physical or mental impairments were employed, next to a national average of 77.5%</p> <p>Although figures for the private sector are difficult to obtain, the gulf is probably worse still if you exclude public sector workers, suggests Liz Sayce, chief executive of Disability Rights UK and the author of <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/ newsroom/press-releases/2012/mar-2012/dwp022-12.shtml\" title=\"\">a recent government-sponsored review</a> which recommended expanding state funded access to work support for disabled employees.</p> <p>The problem, she says, is due in part to a \"built-in risk aversion\" among many companies. \"Big organisations sometimes have a lot of procedures around safety. [Others] don't really know what is involved and have anxieties about what it would mean to employ disabled people.\"</p> <p>Even when a disabled person makes it onto the payroll it can be tough to break through the corporate glass ceiling, she says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.radar.org.uk/publications/doing-seniority-differently/\" title=\"\">A survey</a> of over 1,400 professionals conducted by Disability Rights UK's predecessor, Radar, in 2010, found that non-disabled staff are three times more likely than disabled counterparts to earn over \u00a380,000 and are twice as likely to become board-level directors.</p> <p>\"The odds are stacked against you,\" concludes Sayce, who blames a corporate culture of overprotectiveness and lowered expectations.</p> <p>\"Managers, with the best intentions, just overlook people for promotion. They think, 'Oh, we wouldn't want to put more stress on the person.' Of course for a disabled person who is ambitious, they want the opportunity. It's not at first discrimination, but it results in discrimination.\"</p> <p>Companies that fail to encourage disabled employees are however missing out, insists Tim Taylor, diversity and inclusion manager at Lloyds Banking Group, Britain's largest retail bank.</p> <p>In refusing to take a chance on perfectly well qualified disabled candidates, firms put themselves at a competitive disadvantage, he says.</p> <p>\"Many of our customers have disabilities and if we are going to understand their needs it helps us to have disabled people in the organisation. [In addition] a lot of disabled people bring a unique life experience: they can be good at problem solving, innovation and planning. These are all skills which are really helpful to us.\"</p> <p>Lloyds was one of the founders of <a href=\"http:// www.radiate-net.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Radar's Radiate</a> national network for senior and talented disabled professionals. The business also has its own internal employees network, a personal development programme and a workplace adjustment scheme to help disabled staff adapt office space and IT.</p> <p>Taylor explains that the company, which has over 104,000 employees, is hoping to raise the level of debate among employers and managers across the country. \"For too many people it is about wheelchairs and white sticks [and] not about people who are actually very talented and happen to have a disability.\"</p> <p>This is not to say that Lloyds is quite there yet. Internal surveys show that only about 3.5% of staff \u2013 and just over 1% of senior managers \u2013 identify as being disabled. Under-reporting could be an issue here, he suggests. Employees may choose not to disclose an impairment or may not recognise that a minor condition even qualifies. But with the right support he is confident of improvements.</p> <p>Leadership from the top has been vital, he says. But Lloyds' standpoint does not come from a sense of corporate social responsibility. \"[CSR] has been the traditional approach and there is a lot of merit in that, but at Lloyds we tend to want to lead on the business case. It's good for the customer, it's good for colleagues, and it can help to make or save money. That argument resonates more.\"</p> <p>Susan Scott-Parker, founder and chief executive of the Employers' Forum on Disability, an NGO with 120 global firms of the likes of Barclays and Accenture among its members, is one leading advocate who sees the potential of business as a driving factor in instituting positive change.</p> <p>\"What [employers] can do differently that will make it easier [for people] to succeed, get promoted and contribute to the business is the essence of this new approach to disability,\" she says, pointing to the <a href=\"http:// www.efd.org.uk/about-us/business-taskforce-accessible-technology\" title=\"\">Business Taskforce on Accessible Technology</a> EFD launched in 2008. The initiative commits members to only buy technologies that conform to a common accessibility standard.</p> <p>Another case in point, Scott-Parker says, is drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, which has adopted a work placement scheme known as Project Search. The initiative helps young people with learning or other disabilities to gain the skills that will enable them to make the transition from education to work.</p> <p>\"What GSK is doing,\" she says, \"is enabling a group of, say, 10 people with disabilities to become more employable. They may take six or eight of them in the knowledge that the rest will go on and work for other employers.\"</p> <p>The idea is to not just recruit good people for the company but to also build a pipeline of talent for the entire community. \"The point is, it has to be right for the person, and right for the company. We don't want companies to think that when they do something in this space they are doing people a favour.\"</p> <p>But while much onus lies with business behaviour, other sectors also have a vital role, the chief executive adds, noting the challenge facing employment agencies such as Job Centre Plus in educating unemployed disabled people \u2013 and in turn firms \u2013 about available government funded access support.</p> <p>\"Business has to behave differently, welfare to work agencies have to behave differently, and government has to learn how to fund the system in a different way. All three have to change their behaviour,\" she says.</p> <p>In this way, improving the lot of disabled people in the workplace and giving companies the best possible pool of talent is not quite a marathon, much less a sprint. It's more of a relay. Those affected will be hoping that business doesn't drop the baton.</p> <p><em>Will Henley is a journalist, communications specialist and executive member of the Commonwealth Journalists Association.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2>New trends for the new term</h2> <p>It's been a good few years since I left the world of education, and yet I always get that new term feeling once the last August weekend has passed. The holidays are over, the strange sweets from foreign airports consumed, and we all desperately search for the next thing to look forward to. For makeup fans, the start of term is something that gets them through these post-holiday blues because the new collections are trickling into shops and the trends are there to be studied. So let's take a minute to do some advanced reading and pick three new term trends that might work for us in real life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395424723\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/30/1346324586530/Aquascutum-and-Anna-Sui-006.jpg\" alt=\"Aquascutum and Anna Sui\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models for Aquascutum and Anna Sui, with looks courtesy of MAC Cosmetics (left) and Max Factor (right) Photograph: MAC/Max Factor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MAC/Max Factor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bold accents</strong><br>Every season I feel like there's some bright colour trend that would only transfer to a handful of teenage fashion students from Central Saint Martins. But this year us ordinary folk could be in luck. Pockets of bold colour were seen either on eyes or lips - not both at the same time, thankfully, and not too crazy, either. Our professor in this subject is Pat McGrath, Global Creative Director for Max Factor. For the Anna Sui models, McGrath created a gorgeous retro flick of purple liner on the upper lid (and also a dot in the middle of the lower but let's make this optional). At Nina Ricci, it was the lips that did the talking with McGrath creating a beautifully deep crimson on fresh faced models. It's a look that's surprisingly easy to wear for all skin tones. It's just a question of finding the right red for you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395424724\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/30/1346330687441/Fashion-Michael-Kors-Fall-001.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion Michael Kors Fall 2012\" width=\"215\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Kors autumn/winter 2012 Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Vintage English</strong><br>This subject has variations on the main theme depending on who you're listening to. Also known as, 'Healthy Glow' or 'Modern Neutrals', this look is very user-friendly. In fact you may well be rocking the look already without consciously trying. In which case, A* to you. If not, it's really quite simple. Take inspiration from the looks created by Dick Page for the Michael Kors show using Shiseido. The cheeks had a rosy flush, eyes were left almost bare with a slight emphasis on the brow, and lips were given a stained red look. Basically, it's about looking like you've just come in from the cold without actually being out in the cold in the first place. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395424725\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/30/1346325089265/Moschinos-heavy-eyeliner--001.jpg\" alt=\"Moschino's heavy eyeliner look\" width=\"215\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moschino's heavy eyeliner look from autumn/winter 2013 Photograph: Michele Morosi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Morosi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Graphic eyes</strong><br>It's no secret that I'm a massive fan of black eyeliner but I always do the same flicky shape and so it's time for change. Terry Barber, MAC's director of artistry, coined the term 'Arti-tech' for this trend of new shapes for eyeliner. Weird and wonderful lines were drawn on the eyes at Aquascutum, Erdem and Moschino to name just three. They may look a little daunting at first but a bit of practice and we'll all be top of the class at eyeliner control in no time. Our tip from teacher Terry? Apply the eyeliner and then re-shape by removing with cotton wool and eye makeup remover. It's easier than building up line after line.</p> <h2>New launch news</h2> <p>There's a lot of love for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/nov/14/brief-history-of-nars\">NARS</a> makeup, and as of this weekend, there's going to be a lot more with the launch of a new collection of skincare, <strong>NARSskin</strong>. In sleek white packaging, the products are top quality. My pick of the range is the <strong>Aqua Gel Luminous Mask</strong> which I've been using religiously every night after cleansing.

  "<p>Games that emerge from development hell are rarely dull. You get the true monstrosities \u2013 Duke Nukem Forever, Daikatana, Too Human \u2013 but you also get those flawed gems such as Spore, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Gran Turismo 5, games that speak of greatness while still baring the scars of mid-cycle calamities and vast engine rebuilds.</p> <p>Then there the unqualified success stories, titles such as Half Life 2 and Resident Evil 4, that manage to overcome nightmarishly protracted and complex back stories to achieve greatness. </p> <p>Somewhere toward that end of the spectrum is Sleeping Dogs, the unexpected summer hit that's keeping Darksiders 2 from the top of the charts. This engaging thriller started out two years ago as Black Lotus, a mature open-world adventure set in Hong Kong and heavily influenced by the city's action movie directors: Ringo Lam, Johnnie To, John Woo.</p> <p>It was an ambitious project for United Front Games, a Vancouver studio that had been formed only a couple of months before by ex-staff from nearby publishers such as EA and Rockstar. But it was a dark, brutal and interesting concept. It had promise.</p> <p>And then came Activision, a tarnished license and, eventually, the threat of cancellation. </p> <p>So how did UFG create such a solid and entertaining gangland romp, despite the chaotic development process? We spoke to the game's senior producer, Jeff O'Connell to find out.<br><br><strong>So, how did Black Lotus become True Crime: Hong Kong? What happened?</strong><br>The first meetings around this game were in the fall of 2007. It was a very small crew at that point; there were about 10 of us in a tiny little office. We met with Activision and back then, they knew they wanted to get back into the urban open-world genre; they had a prototype on the go, but they asked us to come up with a concept \u2013 which we did. And amazingly, that concept was very similar to the game we ended up releasing. </p> <p>But what happened was, they liked the idea, but at the time they wanted to push it more toward the flavour of True Crime \u2013 and obviously they attached the brand to it. We wanted the tone to be more like an HBO cop show. </p> <p><strong>But, I suppose Activision had enjoyed some success with True Crime, which was much more of a Hollywood-style treatment of the genre.<br></strong> Obviously, while those games were enjoyed by a lot of people, we felt our concept was different. Of course, they were both about cops, but we thought that times had changed and that people wanted something else; it felt like the opportunity was there to make a more mature title. </p> <p><strong>Certainly TV was going in that direction at the time.</strong><br>Absolutely. Look at the cop shows that have been successful \u2013 The Wire, The Shield \u2013 every character is ambiguous. Look at the latest James Bond movies, and the way Daniel Craig plays the character \u2013 is he really a good guy? He's sort of a mercenary. That to us was really interesting. And we were fortunate enough in having an actor like Will Yun Lee who could pull off that sort of performance. </p> <p><strong>But you made changes to the feel of the game to fit with True Crime \u2013 and then in February 2011, the game was effectively canned. How did that go down internally? Did you think it was all over?</strong><br>It was a terrible time really. Activision were very respectful in how they went about informing us of the decision; they let go hundreds of their employees that same day, they cancelled Guitar Hero \u2013 you could tell that it wasn't an easy decision to make. But it was rough times for us, we had to downsize our team within a couple of weeks, and you begin to question a lot of things \u2013 we'd been working on the game for three and a half years at that point and you pour your heart and soul into it.</p> <p>But within a couple of weeks we heard that Square had played the game and were interested in it and they wanted to speak to us \u2013 it was a ray of hope. We talked to them on the phone, they came to Vancouver and met with us. Right away it felt like a very different relationship to the one we had with Activision. Their producers really were old-skool gamers; they'd been working in games since the eighties, as had many staff in our studio. So right away there was a personal connection and they got what we wanted to do with the game. And throughout the development we benefitted form their experience working on titles like Just Cause 2. We just clicked. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395540098\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346333846574/Sleeping-Dogs-005.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>So they really understood the dynamics of open-world game design?</strong><br>Yes. They didn't feel there was any need to make everything obvious right away; an open-world game is one that unfolds over 30 hours \u2013 you don't have to set it all up in the first sixty minutes, you don't have to have a singular motivation \u2013 the characters can develop.</p> <p>I think the biggest change was in the overall tone of the story, the presentation of the game flow, how the game ramps up. We start with action, certainly, but we hold your hand a little to get you into the mechanics \u2013 there are a lot of mechanics! Previously, we were pushed to go for high octane action upfront which we think hurts the game, because it's annoying when that's taken away from you. </p> <p><strong>And it seems like you were able to make changes to the design right through until the end?</strong><br>Yeah, open-world development is challenging and there were things even late in development, with a few weeks to go, that we looked at and said, \"We need to up that system!\" Things come together very late \u2013 it's like a giant jigsaw puzzle and you kind of only see it in its entirety with a few weeks to go. </p> <p><strong>So what were some of the key gameplay changes you made to the game, after its reformation as Sleeping Dogs?</strong><br>Well, very late, we looked at the UI of the upgrade system: how it was laid out, how you were made aware of upgrades, how you used the upgrades menu, how you discovered what you did and didn't have, encouraging you to spend points and accompanying that process with appropriate UI and audio moments.</p> <p>That sort of stuff was really overhauled late in production, not because were unhappy with it, but because it was a big part of the game and we felt it was under-realised. The other thing was the lock boxes hidden around the world. Originally, most had cash in them, not weapons or clothes, so there was less surprise and satisfaction \u2013 it was a minor change but it altered the way people played the game. </p> <p><strong>Developing a good upgrade UI and a decent loot system are RPG elements \u2013 it's interesting those should have been altered after the creator of Final Fantasy became your publisher!</strong><br>(Laughs) Yes, that's true! I think that's the great thing about working with Square. Producer Chris Dillon and Alastair Cornish, the design lead \u2013 they really focused on the little things, the game systems \u2013 they were constantly playing and given us feedback. Alastair spent a lot of time talking to our design director, Mike Skupa, who's ex-Rockstar and lead designer on Bully. </p> <p>It's interesting as an aside \u2013 everyone says the combat system is like Batman, but if you think back to Bully that was the genesis of this kind of open-world combat. That's really where the impetus came from. But the loot system was Mike and Alistair talking and finding ways to make the feedback loop more obvious and compelling to the player, more enticing, more fun. And if we were to do a sequel, which we'd like to do, we'll push that RPG aspect of the game even further. </p> <p><strong>It's definitely the strength of the game systems, the mechanics of the game, that people are responding too, isn't it?</strong><br>Open-world games have a lot of stuff in them \u2013 in Sleeping Dogs, between the main missions and all the collectibles and everything else, there are around 300 things to do; there are hours of cut-scenes and it's a big game world. We've got all these mechanics that we spent time on. As a developer, you can get lost in all that stuff and just put it out there.</p> <p>But working with Square and having the extra time allowed us to look at the feedback loops and say, there's an opportunity that's under realised here \u2013 we have the basics, but it's not as good as it could be. I think the reason the systems are there in the first place is that Mike, our design director, spent a lot of time looking at social and mobile gaming and saw that the feedback loop is really what makes those games entertaining and playable \u2013 it's even the same with titles like Starcraft and Diablo. And looking to the future, with the new consoles coming, developers really need to be thinking about the feedback loop \u2013 especially for open-world games. That's where the addiction element comes in \u2013 it's not just about twitch anymore, it seems. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395540099\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346333640686/Sleeping-Dogs-003.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>So is there a secret to building compelling feedback loops within action adventure game designs?</strong><br>The big picture is, if you break down the core mechanics - fighting, shooting, driving \u2013 we brought in expert designers and gameplay engineers who had worked on those areas. We had Mike from Bully \u2013 and a lot of the other engineers also worked on that game. Our driving designer was from Need For Speed; that's where the pick-up-and-play driving and the car tuning came from. And for shooting we have guys from Max Payne, Scarface\u2026 we really tried to assemble a team that could deliver best-in-class mechanics. We were fortunate that the personalities clicked - if that hadn't happened we would have been in trouble! </p> <p>I'd love to say there's a secret recipe, but these guys just worked their butts off. I think they did that because, when the game was cancelled, they took it personally \u2013 we'd never had a project axed before. We knew the game was good \u2013 these guys felt they had to prove themselves to their peers in the industry, to their families... and they went the extra mile. </p> <p><strong>The game is very big on environmental combat moves \u2013 being able to smash opponents into walls and other scenic objects. That could have been a gimmick, but here it really seems to ground you and connect you with the surroundings.</strong><br>That was something we knew would be critical for us. We had a movie clip that provided the goal of our fighting mechanic \u2013 it was from a Tony Jaa movie called the Protector. The lead character is fighting his way up a circular staircase around the parameter of a large room, and it's all done in one shot so it feels like an action game.</p> <p>But the point is, in this sequence, he uses everything \u2013 railings, vases, sinks, televisions \u2013 any stuff in the environment. And when we started to go deeper and really look at Hong Kong cinema, Jet Li does the same thing, so does Jackie Chan \u2013 look at Police Story, that fight in the mall, he's using clothing rails, he's using escalators. It's just such a signature of Hong Kong action cinema, we felt we had to do it. And again if a sequel happens, I'd love to push that ever further. </p> <p><strong>Ultimately, what has Sleeping Dogs taught you about game development?</strong><br>We all learned that the industry has changed. When we started, a couple of months into UFG's operation, the iPhone came out, and later the iPad, and Facebook had risen in prominence. How gamers entertain themselves \u2013 that whole model has changed. It forces publishers to be more careful with how they develop games and spend their money. Developers of triple A titles have to be on their A game all the time \u2013 every single member of the team needs to realise what's at stake. There are no free launches any more \u2013 if there ever were. </p> <p><strong>Do you think, as we enter the next console generation that it's going to become almost impossible for publishers to bet on original IPs from small studios? The development costs are going to rise enormously.</strong><br>There aren't as many opportunities. And for studios who do get the opportunity, there's more pressure than there ever has been. The end of original IP would be incredibly depressing, but look at Watch Dogs, that's an exciting new property \u2013 it has captured the imagination of gamers. Every time there's a new generation of consoles the processing power opens up new opportunities for gameplay. I think we'll see new franchises spawn, some designer somewhere will be inspired in a new way.</p> <p><strong>And will we see a Sleeping Dogs 2 on the next-gen hardware?</strong><br>There has been such a great response to the game. We feel like there are more stories to tell and we think from a mechanics point of view the next generation consoles present possibilities that will work really well for us. We're optimistic, that's for certain.</p>",
  "<p>Among the diverse sessions on offer at World Water Week in Stockholm, I've noticed a thread of common thinking: nexus thinking. The water-food-energy nexus, which places ecosystems and their services to people at its very heart, isn't just an abstract theory - it really is being applied to the way the water community is tackling the issues. Such alignment and the debates it generates have been a long time coming, and it's certainly exciting to be in the middle of it.</p> <p>Personally, I think the nexus is a really useful way to apply an integrative cross sector approach to water security. Focusing on the nexus makes it easier for us to make integrated water resource management operational, and the discussions at World Water Week reflect this.</p> <p>I can relate the nexus thinking I'm seeing at the conference to our work on the ground in river basins. Stakeholders engaged on water security issues, even in one particular basin, often have quite different needs, which means a clear solution is not always immediately obvious. By applying a nexus approach, we have a framework to run with. It also allows us to tap into similar nexus learning from across the globe, more effectively bringing together the best thinking for a truly integrated perspective.</p> <p>Let's take an example. Whereas previously we may have only considered irrigated agriculture to meet local needs for food security, joined up thinking now gives us a far larger pool of solutions from which to draw, such as increasing rain-fed crop productivity together with safeguarding our valuable natural food production systems, such as river fisheries.</p> <p>The nexus of water, food and energy is one way of looking at a problem locally, but as part of it we have to consider the connections with local interests and concerns. From discussions in Stockholm, it is clear that we need to continue to build advocacy among civil society. Local people have to be part of the answer and other stakeholders must empower them to do this. We know from our own work that opening up to this grassroots experience and knowledge is very much a part of the solution. In some cases, this happens naturally, but in other places we need to help ensure this voice is heard. </p> <p><em>Rebecca Tharme is senior aquatic ecologist on the Global Freshwater Team at The Nature Conservancy</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Antony Jenkins, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/30/barclays-new-chief-executive-antony-jenkins\" title=\"\">new chief executive of Barclays</a>, is a career banker, having started as a graduate recruit at the bank's South Kensington branch almost 30 years ago. Unlike his predecessor Bob Diamond, however, Jenkins comes from the \"safer\" retail side of the industry rather than buccaneering investment banking that has caused Barclays so much trouble. He is the very antithesis of the brash American \u2013 a mild-mannered Brit who says he <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8332414.stm\" title=\"\">listens to rock to get pumped up for big meetings</a>, but switches to jazz or classical music when he needs to think through a difficult problem.</p> <p>\"From big-hitter Bob to safe-pair-of-hands Jenkins,\" said Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners. \"He is both a retail banker through and through and a Barclays man,\" and his appointment \"may even suggest that boring retail banking has become sexy again in the difficult investment and trading environment,\" she added.</p> <p>While Jenkins' main expertise is in retail banking and he is seen as the best internal choice for the CEO job, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/09/barclays-sir-david-walker-new-chairman\" title=\"\">Barclays' chairman-elect, Sir David Walker</a>, a 72-year-old City veteran, comes from outside and has spent much of his career in investment banking. The two will work closely together.</p> <p>The 51-year-old marathon runner has been described <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">as the \"nice guy\" of banking</a> by former Citigroup colleagues, and as a family man. He is married with two children.</p> <p>Jenkins, who comes from Stoke-on-Trent, had until now been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/03/barclays-boardroom-shakeup?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">in charge of Barclays' global retail and business banking</a>, including its retail business in Africa, and is credited with streamlining the division.</p> <p>Jason Napier, banking analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: \"He is well known to the market, businesses under his care have performed well, he possesses experience within and without the group, and his reputation and retail heritage provide a base for rebuilding the bank's reputation over time.\"</p> <p>Jenkins has a masters in PPE from Oxford and an MBA from the Cranfield Institute of Technology, and started his career in 1983 when he completed the Barclays management development programme. He went on to hold various roles in retail and corporate banking. He moved to Citigroup in 1989, working for the American bank in London and New York.</p> <p>He was lured back to Barclays by its former chief executive John Varley, who promised Jenkins a seat on the executive committee in late 2005 if he moved his young family from New York back to London. However, that promise was broken - another ex-Citigroup banker, Frits Seegers, became head of the retail and commercial bank with a seat on the four-strong executive board instead. Jenkins still joined the bank as head of Barclaycard and in 2009 his gamble paid off when he emerged as the big winner of a management shakeup and became Seegers' successor.</p> <p>\"The first job on Mr Jenkins' to-do list must be to get a grip on the investment banking business that is still one of the biggest in the world and a significant profit generator for the bank,\" said Cooper.</p> <p>\"The loss of Bob Diamond was a big blow to this division so the key profit generating staff need to feel confident in the new CEO... Personally, Mr Jenkins needs to be able to handle media scrutiny and parliamentary questioning. He will need to get a grip on the current investigations and massive regulatory changes facing the banking industry. He must also get used to having a much greater profile - he is relatively unknown - anonymity has now gone.\"</p>",
  "<p>At <a href=\"http://learning.littlekingshill.bucks.sch.uk/\">Little Kingshill Combined Primary School</a> in Buckinghamshire they're seriously green. Having achieved its <a href=\"http://www.eco-schools.org.uk/\">Green Flag Eco School</a> accreditation in 2009, the school is now working to fundraise for solar panels to be installed on the roof. Teacher Helen McCammond said: \"All being well, these will be on and working by around Easter next year.\"</p> <p>Here, teachers organise an Eco Week each year; a chance for the entire school to do nothing but green projects. Helen said: \"Last year my class did activities relating to their local environment. We also have visitors in, talking about their travels and about environmental impact. Basically, inspiring our children to think of the world in which they live.\"</p> <p>\"The school had a visit earlier this year from Re-cycler.\" Helen explains: \"This is a robot and 'friend' who come in to a whole school assembly to teach the children about the importance of reducing what we use and reusing before recycling. Of course the children adored this and, fun as it was, it also reinforced all they'd learnt.\"</p> <p>While the school had, for years, had green as a goal, the big eco push started soon after Helen joined the school in 2008. \"We have the full backing of the headteacher, Mrs Grishma Sutaria.\" Grishma has a hybrid car in the car park and is clearly on-message and sharing in Helen's passion.</p> <p>\"Back in 2008 the first project we tackled was to transform an area of wasteland in the school into an eco garden,\" said Helen. This project commenced with clearing days at the weekends, when parents came and helped, alongside their children, to clear the area. Then the children designed what they wanted and, as Helen said: \"Through fantastic co-operation, what they wanted was achieved. We ended up with an eco garden and an outdoor classroom.\"</p> <p>Building on the level of all-round positivity the environmental projects were accumulating, it seemed logical to run a specific club for green issues each week. Helen runs the Environment Club (and, she tells us, she's even talked her dad into helping her) for children from year one to year six.</p> <p>They have a packed schedule. \"We do different things each week, we're always busy; we might be taking cuttings for growing, or discussing ideas around how to improve the school site.\" There's often arrangements made for litter picking or putting up new hanging baskets, or planting in certain areas. Helen explains: \"It's about getting them to think about the school environment, respecting it and, ultimately, taking ownership of it.\"</p> <p>With gardening and planting comes tools. With tools come responsibility. Helen said: \"The children relish using the tools, it feels so grown up. They soon pick up the correct names for them as well as the skills they need to protect themselves.\"</p> <p>\"We love to plant fruit and veg and everything we grow is organic.\" They've planted potatoes, strawberries, tomatoes, raspberries, beans, spinach, rhubarb - the list goes on. \"This becomes a fantastic science lesson. They learn how to look after the plants so they give the best yield. The children experience caring for living things, about when to harvest and which parts of the plant are safe to eat. Seeing the children's faces when they harvest the first potatoes is priceless - especially those who think that all food comes pre-packed from the supermarket.\"</p> <p>What's more, all this growing, has the knock-on effect of boosting healthy eating. \"One of my own highlights is when we harvest some of the vegetables and then together cook them. The children find they are trying (and actually liking) things they wouldn't usually. \"My class made rhubarb crumble this year, as well as leek and potato soup for <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/comenius-about-us.htm\">Comenius</a> visitors (teachers from five European countries) as well as spinach and runner bean soup - surprisingly tasty.\"</p> <p>\"Recycling's on our list of priorities too\", says Helen. They currently recycle plastics, tins, paper, school uniform, printer cartridges, mobile phones, and \"lots more\". They compost their fruit peelings from the key stage one fruit scheme and then use the compost on their crops.</p> <p>Speaking to schools that push for a greener environment all mention this notion of team work, of pulling together. Little Kingshill sees this as one of the most fundamental gains. Helen notes that at the eco club all the children work well together, across both year groups and genders. She delights in the fact that they all love to be busy working towards a shared, hugely positive goal.</p> <p><strong>We would love to hear about environmental initiatives going on at your school.

  "<p>Speaking to Ian Warder it's no surprise he once taught at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerhill_School\">Summerhill</a> in Suffolk, perhaps the UK's most famous 'alternative' independent school. Indeed his eldest children went there and it was when they left that he left for <a href=\"http://www.stchris.co.uk/\">St Christopher School</a>; this was 2003. There he took up as a regular maths teacher, but quickly expressed an interest to become involved in the environmental work which was already thriving under teacher <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6765089.stm\">Betsy Reid</a>, who became something of a green hero to him.</p> <p>Since taking over, and renewing the school's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Flag_Award\">Eco Schools Green Flag</a> accreditation (Ian is now an assessor for the Eco Schools Award) he's not had time to stand still. From creating a school wormery, which is he says composts much of the school's waste, to leading campaigns with titles ranging from the simple Ban the Bag to the intriguing Biscuits for Batteries Ian's only complaint is that he just wishes there was more time.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaker\">Quaker</a> who practises mindfulness and teaches meditation and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi\">tai chi</a> in his spare time, believes: \"Learning about the effect we have on the rest of the world as a result of the way we live, and how we can choose to change this, is the most important lesson we can possibly teach.\"</p> <p>Father of a new young family (he has three girls all under the age of four) Ian says: \"Empowering children to be self-aware and confident, to try and create a fairer, more just and sustainable world is what I hope to do, as I try and do the same myself. Teaching children to be kind and respectful to each other is a fantastically important opportunity that is continually challenging, refreshing and rewarding. What we teach is important, but so is how we do it.\"</p> <p>So, Ian Warder is no ordinary teacher. But then <a href=\"http://www.stchris.co.uk/\">St Christopher School</a> in Hertfordshire is no ordinary independent school. This school is a 100% vegetarian and teachers here are Linda and Jeremy \u2013 not a sir or miss within ear shot. Here the school is committed to creating mindful citizens, active members of the community, critical thinkers. And the lessons learnt here by the privileged pupils are having a real impact.</p> <p>For starters, the school has interactive assemblies, dedicated solely to environmental topics, and it's serious stuff. \"We cover issues like hazards of incineration, economy and the environment and reduction of carbon footprint,\" Ian says.</p> <p>It's not all discussions though. \"It's not all doom and gloom. It needs to be fun for the young people to get engaged and enthused.\" And Ian feels this essentially means getting them to discover for themselves.</p> <p>Last summer, for instance, the school had No Power Hour when all the electricity went off. He said: \"Through such activities they're learning why they need to be responsible, about how green issues will affect them if they don't take action.\"</p> <p>Science is learnt through testing and experimenting around observations and questions that have been raised organically. One such example is the student's uncertainty around whether paper towels or hand-driers would be more environmentally friendly. This became their topic\u2026 real science for a real problem.</p> <p>(The fast-drying dryers won the environmental debate, by the way.)</p> <p>Being political, finding confidence to question about environmental issues, is a clear objective of Ian's. \"A group of students organised a petition that collected more than 300 signatures in 2011, which was sent to our local MP, asking him to question the government's stance on the effects of pesticides on bee populations.\"</p> <p>In March 2011, the school hosted the first <a href=\"http://www.stchris.co.uk/index.php/home/news/191-first-plant-for-the-planet-academy-in-the-uk-takes-place-at-st-christopher-school--march-21-2011\">UK Plant for the Planet</a> conference and climate ambassador training. Around 80 young people from 15 local schools attended and as a result, and Plant for the Planet now has children representing it in 98 countries. Its message has two themes: global warming and climate justice. Climate justice is the idea that it is only fair and just that each of us in the world should have an equal amount of allowable CO2 emissions.</p> <p>\"The conference is a day of information, but also practical training in public speaking, planning and taking action. It's empowering for young people and inspiring for adults to see,\" says Ian. \"An essential action that emerged is the need to plant more trees to increase the carbon 'sink' on the planet. The school has done fundraisers, talked to other students about it and planted some trees at school. The five presenters have gone on to do a second conference for six schools in Edinburgh, with more conference presentations planned for next year.\"</p> <p>Ian is under no illusions about the fortune bestowed on the students here. \"Of course we're lucky. We know that. We've got fantastic grounds \u2013 even an orchard which the children harvest, making apple juice to sell.<br>\"We are anything but complacent though. We like to talk to other schools about our work and theirs.\" He firmly believes that the curriculum grows from the students and their wishes to improve not only their world but the world around them too.</p> <p><strong>We would love to hear about environmental initiatives going on at your school.

  "<p>One Sunday afternoon this summer, my mum and I got onto the topic of my fascination with art. Why am I such a huge fan? Would I have found it by myself if I wasn't pointed in the right direction growing up? And why are there not more people like me: young independent gallery-goers?</p> <p>My mum always talks about me and my brother as young children \u2013 how she'd talk to us everywhere we went so we'd pick up language quickly; how she'd keep us busy with activities while she tidied the house. A favourite technique was to occupy us with crayons. We took to drawing like Bolt took to the 100m sprint world record \u2013 without a thought and pretty darn fast! To this day I still find old pictures and colouring books under piles of notepads and boxes in my room.</p> <p>Practically every other weekend we'd be in a free gallery or museum and we'd always get the children's activity boxes \u2013 they were brilliant. Guessing how many creatures made up the devil in Saint Michael Triumphs over the Devil by Bermejo, leaping around the National trying to spot \"the big horse\". Then there's my grandma, the most cultured lady anyone will have the pleasure to meet. She was very keen on getting the grandchildren into the arts.</p> <p>I'll never throw away my collection of postcards she's given me from all the exhibitions she visited and I distinctly remember my first Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. We stumbled upon an off-white used candle. As we stared, a stranger engaged my grandma in a discussion about its meaning, how it \"symbolises life and triumph\" and some other poncey art nonsense. I was confused, irritated and hungry.</p> <p>That didn't put me off for long though. I now have my own Royal Academy membership, courtesy of said grandma, which is very handy for my art A-Level. Art has always been my favourite subject, despite putting up with comments like \"this is so stupid\" and \"what's the point?\" from fellow class members for six years. Many of my friends are not such big art fans as me, and for some I'm the target of the \"what's the point?\" question. I don't know if they were paraded around exhibitions as a child \u2013 is that why I have this love of art?</p> <p>There must be an age, for all budding art fanatics, when we eventually go to our first art exhibition without our parents. It's almost like that first independent shopping trip with your friends. The difference between galleries and shopping though is that you'll always need new shoes or jeans but, some might argue, you may not need to see the newest Hockney or Hirst.</p> <p>Personally I do but others my age don't. This could be down to laziness, but equally it could be disinterest or distractions. There are plenty of other things kids could be doing than going to a gallery, like social networking or playing video games, and it doesn't help that most exhibition posters are aimed at older audiences and teens won't think twice when they ignore one.</p> <p>Walking into a large silent room full of intellectuals can be very intimidating if you're not familiar with gallery etiquette. How are teenagers meant to know how to act if they weren't brought up in that environment?</p> <p>There seems to be a gap in gallery audiences from about twelve to sixteen when peer pressure makes being 'cool' a priority. Kids drop off, uninterested in what galleries have to offer. They never have that first 'shopping trip' experience \u2013 but by making galleries a more comfortable place to visit and educating young people of what they have to offer, that gap could be filled.</p> <p>I still managed to be seduced by the spectacle. And I may end up being one of those ponces approaching elderly ladies and young girls, engaging them in discussions about the symbolism behind fake candles! But so what? I was lucky enough to find my passion. I'm still not sure whether I love art because it's who I am or because I grew up around it, or whether it even matters. But what could the arts world be doing to make sure there are more of us? Young independent gallery-goers and proud of it.</p> <p><strong><em>What was your first art experience, and how do you think venues and galleries could be more inclusive of young people? And what are arts organisations doing to convert teenagers from family visitors to independent ones?

  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Ryan galvanized the conservative base without frightening swing voters'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422720\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For much of the night, it appeared that convention planners had deliberately designed a snooze-fest intended to make Paul Ryan's acceptance speech look better.</p> <p>The painfully unfunny Tim Pawlenty, the achingly dull Rob Portman, and depressingly banal John Thune all emerged to remind us they wouldn't have been better vice-presidential picks than Ryan. John McCain took the stage to lament the wars he didn't get to start after losing the 2008 presidential election, fervently hoping Mitt Romney will make up for lost time. Republicans you have never heard of enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame, though it often seemed much longer.</p> <p>In the early going, the only positive moments were an artfully done (even if foreign policy-free) video tribute to Ron Paul, a cautious but well-received address by his son Rand Paul, and George HW Bush doing an impression of <a href=\"http://www.danacarvey.net/\">Dana Carvey</a> doing an impression of him. (If you're curious, the 41st president nailed it.)</p> <p>But as the program moved toward prime time, the speakers picked up the pace. Mike Huckabee started slow, as if Romney's censors had edited out the former Arkansas governor's charm. But his attack on the Obama administration's HHS contraceptive mandate was powerful, and his attempt to rally evangelicals behind a Mormon and a Catholic was sincere. Condoleezza Rice gave one of the strongest speeches of the convention. Susana Martinez, the first-term governor of New Mexico, was likeable, down-to-earth, and impressive.</p> <p>Paul Ryan, nevertheless, remained the star of the show. Ryan is still honing his skills as a big event speaker and attack dog, but he did a good job delivering some of the most effective and specific anti-Obama barbs heard yet in Tampa.</p> <p>\"College grads shouldn't have to live out their 20s in childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters,\" he zinged. \"There is no shortage of words from the White House. What is missing is leadership from the White House,\" was another good Ryan line. Finally, on Barack Obama's tendency to blame his predecessors: \"The man assumed office nearly four years ago. Isn't it time he assumed responsibility?\"</p> <p>You could quibble with some facts: the GM plant Ryan mentioned actually closed down before Obama took office, though Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has pointed out that the president said he would save it. The line itself serves as a reminder that Ryan himself voted for the auto bailout. But overall, Ryan did what he needed to: he galvanized the conservative base without frightening swing voters, all while amplifying the ticket's attack on Obama's economic policies.</p> <p>The biggest blunder of the night was spending so much time reliving George W Bush's presidency. Bush himself appeared in an innocuous video. McCain channeled Bush on steroids. And for all Rice's rhetorical talent, she was essentially promoting warmed-over Bushism and a revisionist take on the 43rd president's \"forward strategy of freedom\", which didn't grapple with the general failure of his foreign policy in the Middle East.</p> <p>Romney and Ryan should want to get clear of Bush.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Ryan's speech was a good example of just how far the GOP has strayed from the truth'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422721\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Listening to Paul Ryan's vice-presidential speech this evening, I think I came within an inch of having a full-blown aneurysm. Never have I heard a major political speech so brazenly and stunningly dishonest. Others will want to talk about Ryan's strong performance and the wild crowd reaction from the assembled GOP delegates, but I'll just spend a few minutes chronicling his cavalcade of lies.</p> <p>Ryan began with a doozy: implicitly blaming Obama for the closing of a General Motors plant in his town of Janesville, Wisconsin. First, that plant was closed when George W Bush was still president. (In fact, here's a <a href=\"http://paulryan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=200270\">press release</a> from Ryan decrying the closure in June 2008, six months before Obama took office.) So, in a sense, Ryan was complaining that Obama didn't re-open it \u2013 a fairly amazing charge from a candidate and a party that have spent the last two days <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/they-built-that-republicans-big-lie\">decrying the role of government in the private sector</a>. It's an even more amazing when you consider that Ryan's running-mate opposed the auto bailout and even penned an op-ed titled \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.\"</p> <p>Ryan then quickly pivoted to the stimulus, which he described as \"a case of political patronage, corporate welfare, and cronyism at their worst \u2026 What did the taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted \u2013 it was borrowed, spent, and wasted.\"</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/27/why-obama-should-run-success-stimulus\">I wrote about a few days ago here</a>, what the stimulus did provide taxpayers with was 2.5m jobs and an economic boost out of the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This is not to mention all the long-term investments in healthcare, transportation, infrastructure and energy innovation. To argue that the stimulus was <em>wasted</em> is just a breathtaking bit of dishonesty.</p> <p>Then came Ryan's attack on Medicare. He lied about Obama taking money out of the program to pay for Obamacare. He lied about the fact that <em>his</em> budget has the exact same $716bn in cuts for which he attacked Obama. He vowed to protect and strengthen Medicare and honor its promise \u2013 even though his budget would end Medicare's federal guarantee and turn government-supported seniors' healthcare into a voucher program.</p> <p>And perhaps most amazingly, Ryan criticized Obama for creating a bipartisan debt commission and ignoring its recommendations \u2013 recommendations that Ryan voted against <em>as a member of the commission</em>.</p> <p>I could go on. The GOP has done more than create an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/they-built-that-republicans-big-lie\">alternate reality</a>; they have built it on a host of political lies, misstatements and untruths. Ryan's speech was a good example of just how far the GOP has strayed from the truth \u2013 and of how debased our political discourse has become.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'The bar is set extremely high for Romney this Thursday night'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422723\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a strangely imbalanced night in terms of quality: the early speakers were barely noticed by the conventioneers \u2013 even John McCain, who had some strong critiques of Obama's foreign policy \u2013 and worsened with a speech by near-veep Senator Rob Portman of Ohio (utterly forgettable) and other near-veep Tim Pawlenty (a seemingly endless stream of bad jokes, landing with one THUD after another). About halfway into Governor Mike Huckabee's remarks, it looked like the evening would be a cavalcade of bad-to-mediocre speeches, wondering if we needed even a third night to this abbreviated convention.</p> <p>And then Huckabee got better, with some funny lines and some warm lines \u2013 best was, \"I care less about where Mitt Romney goes to church than where he's going to take this country.\" But the unexpected grand slam was Condi Rice, who at first appeared to be speaking to check a few boxes: foreign policy speech, check; acknowledgement of the Bush administration, check. Instead, Rice offered perhaps the best speech on the country's problems since Lehman collapsed in late 2008, an acknowledgement that the country had stumbled badly and been bruised but was more than capable of picking itself back up and returning to greatness. It was a speech with vision, and the best of the convention.</p> <p>So, the bar was set high for Paul Ryan; yet he cleared it \u2013 with a distinctly different, personable, more intimate style. He started out shaky, but watchers observed that the turning point was discussing his mother \u2013 and then he seemed to relax, and recognize that he knew the story he wanted to tell. Some funny lines will stay with us \u2013 the fading Obama poster on the unemployed grad's childhood bedroom wall \u2013 and I suspect all of the \"granny-killing extremist\" charges are going to have a much tougher time sticking, because Ryan seems so normal: even-keeled and warm and pleasant.</p> <p>Wednesday night left two thoughts: one, the bar is set extremely high for Romney this Thursday night (remember, he's being introduced by Senator Marco Rubio, another one of the GOP's best speakers); and then \u2026 how do Democrats respond to this? Can they go negative and focus on tax returns and contraception and some Seamus jokes after the Republican message has been so focused, realistic, optimistic and bold?</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p>",
  "<p>When the glass doors swing open at Porsche Centre Luanda, in the capital of Angola, Esmeraldo Chinguto jumps to his feet in the hope of another sale. On display in the showroom this week was a model priced at around $170,000 (\u00a3107,390).</p> <p>\"The Angolan people like some luxuries and some can afford a Porsche,\" said Chinguto, who has sold around 50 since opening two-and-a-half years ago. \"We thought we'd have problems selling but now there is demand. More and more people want sports cars.\"</p> <p>A decade ago this would have seemed like fantasy. Angola was shattered by five centuries of Portuguese colonialism and a 27-year civil war between the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), backed by Russia and Cuba, and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita) rebels, aided by the United States and apartheid South Africa.</p> <p>Today it is the third biggest economy in sub-Saharan Africa, having expanded by an average of 15% between 2002 and 2008. Despite a subsequent slowdown, growth is predicted to rebound to between 8% and 10% this year. On Friday Angola goes to the polls with President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, Africa's second longest-serving leader of 33 years, on course to secure another term. He clams credit for stabilising the country and making it a model for the continent. But Angola's story is also much of Africa's story, warts and all.</p> <p>The spectacular growth has created few jobs and entrenched or even deepened inequality. Angola is China's biggest trading partner in Africa with some $24.8bn in 2010, an uneven oil-for-infrastructure relationship that has brought tangible benefits but underlined that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/18/angola-jimmy-mubenga-human-rights?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">natural resources can be both a blessing and a curse</a>. None of this appears to have a causal link to reducing corruption or enhancing human rights and democracy \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/05/angola-elections-threaten-instability\" title=\"\">elections are seen by many as a sham</a> intended to buy superficial legitimacy.</p> <p>Similar observations have been made about Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and other fast-growing \"African lions\". \"In most African countries, Angola is very symbolic,\" said Elias Isaac, country director for the <a href=\"http://www.osisa.org/angola/osisa-angola\" title=\"\">Open Society Initiative of Southern Africa</a> (Osisa). \"This economic growth is not synonymous with political democratic development. We are starting to understand that economy and democracy don't have much to do with each other.</p> <p>\"We have double-digit growth but do we see the same in political development or in the human rights arena? Can we say there has been the same growth? You can see infrastructure and growth in the oil sector, but how much has this really bettered the lives of the people? The elections are far from being fair, transparent and just.\"</p> <p>Angola is following the Chinese development model, Isaac argues, and the authoritarian Dos Santos's embrace of Beijing is visible everywhere. Chinese-built towers are rising in Luanda \u2013 numerous cranes dotting the skyline promise more to come. Roads and railways have been laid across the country. Isaac estimates that more than 300,000 Chinese people have moved here in the past decade, although the MPLA says the official figure is 40,000 to 43,000.</p> <p>Nowhere has China changed the landscape more emphatically than Kilamba, a city 18 miles outside Luanda built from scratch in three years for a reported $3.5bn. It contains 10,000 apartments so far, in blocks that might appear Soviet but for shades of blue, green and yellow. There are smooth roads and pavements, working traffic lights and basketball courts, and plans for schools, medical centres, a shopping mall with cinema and a five-star hotel.</p> <p>Romulo Bedago, commercial manager for the onsite estate agent Delta Imobili\u00e1ria said: \"I think it's a beautiful city. The apartments are good. We are giving an example to Africa and the world that it's possible.\"</p> <p>Asked if Kilamba was somewhat soulless, he insisted: \"It has character. The soul is coming.\"</p> <p>Despite the promise of reliable electricity and water and respite from Luanda's traffic jams, take-up was slow when the apartments went on sale last October. \"It was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18646243\" title=\"\">a ghost town</a>,\" Bedago admitted. \"But now people are moving. We want people to move in because the city needs to be alive.\"</p> <p>A three-bedroom apartment costs $125,000; a five-bedroom costs $200,000 \u2013 cheaper than in Luanda, but beyond the means of the majority of Angolans living on less than $2 a day. Stung by criticism, the authorities subsequently created a rental option for civil servants \u2013 a three-bedroom flat costs $603 per month \u2013 and intend extending this to the public.</p> <p>Bedago says 2,200 apartments have now been allocated, although only 500 people are living on site. Among them is Antonio Santos, 43, a government public relations officer who rented five bedrooms two weeks ago. \"The Chinese are building for my country,\" he said. \"They are having a positive impact on Angola.\"</p> <p>Not everyone agrees. Critics say Africa's second-biggest oil producer got a raw deal and is selling to China at around $60 a barrel, well below global prices, with infrastructure alone an insufficient return. They question why unskilled Chinese labourers have taken jobs that could have gone to Angolans, sowing resentment.</p> <p>Angola's boom has also driven a dangerous wedge between the haves and the have-nots. BMWs, Porsches and Land Cruisers meander through Luanda past beggars missing limbs due to the civil war or polio. Designer shops and luxury beachside restaurants sit cheek-by-jowl with crammed, tin-roof shantytowns strewn with rubbish and resembling Brazilian favelas.</p> <p>Luanda has been dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2183616/Luanda-The-capital-Angola-expensive-city-world.html\" title=\"\">most overpriced city in the world</a>. \"If this city is expensive for expats, can you imagine for Angolans?\" said Isaac of Osisa. \"It's hell.</p> <p>\"Angola doesn't have a middle class. If I earn $4,000 to 5,000, I'm not middle class. My rent would be $2,000 to 3,000, I'd need to budget $500 for water and $400 to 500 for two electricity generators in my house. Doctors, lawyers and economists can't afford to save. You ask an Angolan doctor or lawyer how often he can afford to take his family to a restaurant: it's two or three times a month.\"</p> <p>Dos Santos stands accused of abusing the oil wealth to enrich himself, his family and a narrow elite while failing to deliver housing, education and jobs to the majority. Vanity projects include an ocean bay promenade with manicured lawns and imported palm trees that he officially opened this week.</p> <p>But the politically astute Dos Santos has begun to address the social frustrations ahead of the election, where his MPLA faces Unita at the ballot box. \"I am the first to admit the difficult reality that many families face,\" he told supporters in a campaign speech last weekend. \"We will not stand and watch while there are situations of huge inequality in our land.\"</p> <p>Campaigning under the slogan \"Grow More, Distribute Better\", the MPLA has pledged to introduce a minimum wage and subsidies for the elderly. The party airs video adverts listing its achievements: 2,700 km of railways, 148 railway stations, 10 renovated airports, 400 bridges, 6,500 km of roads.</p> <p>The MPLA also claims it has cut poverty from 68% of the population in 2002 to around 39% in 2009, and raised average life expectency from 42 to 52. \"We have to be serious and sincere,\" said Rui Pinto de Andrade, a party spokesman, speaking at its headquarters on Ho Chi Minh Street. \"In your country, is there still hunger or not? Did you know Angola when it was a destroyed place? It was difficult to go 2km from here because of the state of the roads. In that scenario, what would you do first, helping the people or building infrastructure? If you don't first have a water supply and rebuilt roads and power plants, how do you help people?\"</p> <p>Describing China's help as \"wonderful\", he continued: \"We are working hard to minimise poverty. Nowhere in the world is everyone rich. Everywhere in the world has people who are well educated and who are not. The other kind of society doesn't exist. If it does, give us the formula and make us a paradise country.\"</p> <p>Back at the gleaming Porsche Centre Luanda, Esmeraldo Chinguto is among those reaping the rewards of Africa's new economic dynamo. \"We have to follow the constitution and we have to remember one thing: in Africa we look at our head of state as our father and it is very difficult to change,\" mused the former army lieutenant colonel. \"The Angolan people look at our head of state as a father.</p> <p>\"He gives confidence to all Angolans and makes them happy. This shouldn't be changed or it will stop all development programmes and plans for three or four years. The machine is running at such speed that if we broke it \u2013 oh, my goodness.\"</p>",
  "<p>They might involve athletes from 164 countries, but Paralympic officials concede the London Games are still some way from being a truly global event. Developing nations remain under-represented, with competitors facing obstacles ranging from prejudice against disability to the prohibitive cost of high-tech wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs.</p> <p>\"We're aware that we do need to increase not only the number of countries competing in the Paralympic Games but also the number of athletes coming from the smaller nations,\" said Craig Spence from the <a href=\"http://www.paralympic.org/\" title=\"\">International Paralympic Committee</a> (IPC).</p> <p>\"To put that into perspective, in Beijing 51% of the athletes came from just nine of the countries, and we had 146 countries competing. Clearly we need the smaller countries to start producing athletes who are good enough to compete.\"</p> <p>Four years on and the statistics are slightly better: the biggest nine teams in London account for just under 40% of the 4,200 athletes taking part.</p> <p>However, Paralympic sport remains almost overwhelmingly a pursuit for richer countries \u2013 something brought into sharp relief just before the opening ceremony when it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/30/paralympics-malawi-botswana-withdraw-teams\" title=\"\">teams from Malawi and Botswana had withdrawn</a> due to funding problems. Of the biggest 25 squads at the Games, 19 belong to countries who are members of the OECD industrialised nations' club, with the remainder coming from either emerging economic powerhouses \u2014 China, Brazil, Russia and South Africa \u2013 or, as with the Ukrainian and Iranian teams, from countries with particularly strong Paralympic traditions.</p> <p>The imbalance is especially evident in the more high-tech sports. Five cycling medals were up for grabs at the velodrome on the first day of the Games but none of the world's poorer countries were taking part.</p> <p>Nonetheless, great strides have been made since 1988 when Seoul became the first city to host a unified Olympics and Paralympics. Then, only 61 nations sent competitors.</p> <p>In London 16 nations will be making their debut, including North Korea, which is a particular advance given claims by defectors from the hermetic, Stalinist state about disabled people being banished to detention camps.</p> <p>Prejudice remains a major barrier in other developing countries. Charles Narh Teye, a 35-year-old powerlifter who is part of a four-strong team from Ghana, grew up using prosthetic legs after an undiagnosed infection led to double amputation when he was a baby.</p> <p>\"The most difficult thing was that in school people thought that if you were physically challenged it could easily be transferred to other people,\" he said. \"People wouldn't sit near me. They thought that if my prosthetics should touch them they would have an amputation. I had to sit at the back of the class with the teachers. I couldn't play, because no one wanted to come close to me. I was lonely all the time. It was very difficult.\"</p> <p>His life improved dramatically when he took up powerlifting as a teenager. With the help of a Ghana-based sporting charity, <a href=\"ttp://www.righttodream.com/\" title=\"\">Right to Dream</a>, he qualified for London on merit, lifting the 140kg qualification weight.</p> <p>Such attitudes can affect even elite athletes. Ade Orogbemi, a member of the British wheelchair basketball squad, recalled meeting his peers in Nigeria, the country where he was born and where he now tries to assist Paralympic sport.</p> <p>He said: \"I found them training on a concrete court, outside, in the full heat of the day. I said: 'Don't you have an indoor court you can use?' They said there was an indoor court, but the officials wouldn't let them use it because they through the wheelchairs would scratch the wooden floor. It's hard to believe people still have to face attitudes like that.\"</p> <p>Another significant obstacle is equipment. With their carbon-fibre wheels and lightweight frames, the wheelchairs used in athletics or sports such as basketball and tennis can easily cost more than \u00a34,000 each. A pair of prosthetic racing legs of the sort used by Paralympic poster-boy Oscar Pistorius comes in at around \u00a315,000.</p> <p>Thus, when poorer countries do send athletes to the Paralympics, they tend to be restricted to certain classifications. Virtually all of Kenya's 13-strong squad are blind or partially-sighted runners. Just one uses a wheelchair.</p> <p>\"We realise that equipment is an issue,\" said the IPC's Spence. \"Paralympic sport can be quite cost prohibitive.\"</p> <p>Five years ago the IPC tasked a British-based charity, <a href=\"http://www.motivation.org.uk/our-products/sports-wheelchairs/\" title=\"\">Motivation</a>, with developing lower-cost sports wheelchairs. The result was specialist tennis and basketball wheelchairs selling for \u00a3435 each. At the Paralympics the charity will launch its first racing wheelchair, the Flying Start. While such chairs usually cost \u00a33,000 or more, this is priced at \u00a3590.</p> <p>One of the crueller paradoxes is that the nations that can least support Paralympic sport are often the ones with the bigger potential pool of athletes, due to factors such as a higher incidence of disease, unsafe roads and the consequences of wars or civil conflict.</p> <p>It is notable how some less developed nations' success in Paralympic events has come directly from war.</p> <p>Sitting volleyball is enormously popular in Iran \u2013 the country has won five out of six gold medals since 1988 \u2013 and has long been popular with injured veterans from the country's brutal conflict with Iraq. Iran's main rivals, Bosnia and Herzegovina, who won the 2004 title, are captained by <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/athlete/delalic-sabahudin-5514443/\" title=\"\">Sabahudin Delalic</a>, who lost a leg in 1992 in the Balkan conflict.</p> <p>The IPC is working with individual Paralympic committees in developing nations to try to make them financially self-supporting, with the hope that over the years they will produce more elite athletes.</p> <p>In the meantime there is a system of wildcard entries for competitors who do not achieve qualification marks, but these are used sparingly, with just 61 issued for London.</p> <p>This can cause complaints. Cambodia \u2013 a country which has one of the world's highest ratios of amputees due to landmine blasts \u2013 was granted just one place, excluding athletes good enough to win medals at regional tournaments.</p> <p>Such decisions, said Spence, were tough but necessary. \"At the end of the day the Paralympic Games is an elite sporting event and we want the best athletes in the world to be competing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Henry Morris and I come from different ends of the socio-economic spectrum. Whilst at a top independent school Henry and his peers were encouraged to join clubs for aspiring accountants, lawyers and doctors \u2013 my comprehensive struggled to cobble together a woodwork club, let alone anything related to selective professions. By the age of 16, Henry had completed work experience at multiple top firms. One week at the local bike shop had to suffice for me.</p> <p>Our backgrounds may have been different, but we met and became friends at university. There, we were struck by the contrasting aspirations and successes in clinching the elusive graduate job offer amongst our peers. To us, these different outcomes weren't all down to chance. Those from better off backgrounds, with the family contacts and parents who had \"been there\", were likely to be in with a better shot. Through no fault of their own, those from less privileged backgrounds at university started the race for top jobs later and struggled to catch up.</p> <p>Our personal experience is one thing, but what about the evidence? Studies by Bristol University and others have shown that undergraduates from less privileged backgrounds perform at least as well academically as their more privileged peers. For example, at Bristol <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075070903414297\" title=\"\">88% of state school educated graduates received a 2.1 or above, compared with 85% of independently educated graduates</a>. However, equal academic attainment is not matched by equal graduate outcomes; fewer graduates from less privileged backgrounds progress into the professions relative to their more privileged peers. They also tend to earn less; <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2566136?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101009699733\" title=\"\">3\u00bd years after graduating, 33% of independently educated professionals earn over \u00a330,000, compared to 14% of state educated professionals</a>.</p> <p>Whilst students do equally well academically, could it be that different levels of knowledge, soft skills, networks and professional experience explain the difference in graduate outcomes? This isn't a point about the recruitment process \u2013 we've come a long way from the outright bias in selection processes of the past. But what if our economy's top talent are not applying to the professions proportionally and when they do they underachieve against their potential?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.upreach.org.uk/Access%20to%20the%20Professions%20once%20at%20University%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Issue.pdf\" title=\"\">The evidence shows that there are differences in the level of the key non-academic competencies required for access, and we know that the professions themselves are not socially representative</a>. For example, whereas <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/the-educational-backgrounds-of-500-leading-figures/\">only 7% of the pupils attend independent schools, 54% of UK chief executives and 70% of finance directors were independently educated</a>.</p> <p>Reflecting upon our experiences, both Henry and I knew that there was a problem. Henry was acutely aware of the advantages he had in his journey towards job offers after graduation. For me, it was only through part-time work behind a desk at the university careers office that I really became aware of the breadth of career possibilities open to graduates of any discipline. Even then, this presented its own problem \u2013 how could I possibly make sense of all the different options available to me? The career-chooser computer software didn't really help either: despite my economics degree, one suggested that I should consider midwifery. The simple fact was that I had fewer sources of insight for advice on the careers that I was considering.</p> <p>Inspired by the emergence of social enterprise and its commercial approach to making positive impact, we explored the issue further. The first stage was to develop a tangible idea of how we could make a difference. After researching third sector, government, university and employer programmes, it became clear that there is no overarching programme that supports students who have overcome the odds in reaching university to fulfil their career potential. Indeed, it looked like the impact of social background in the transition from university to professions was the least explored area of the wider equality agenda.</p> <p>On the one hand, being at the forefront of this thinking was exciting \u2013 on the other, the challenges of explaining the significance of social background to employers was not always easy. Some were sceptical, suggesting that the barriers didn't exist and the fact that selection processes were fair was enough in itself. Others recognised that, in the battle for the best graduates, recruiters were missing out on top talent \u2013 many of whom will have demonstrated incredible resilience and adaptability just to get to university.</p> <p>Universities quickly recognised that ensuring undergraduates from less privileged backgrounds fulfil their career potential was a natural extension of their widening participation efforts. Indeed, in the world of \u00a39k fees, many universities have committed to this extension in their <a href=\"http://www.offa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">OFFA</a> agreements.</p> <p>Just a few months ago, both Henry and I had full-time jobs. Our time was limited, idea generation was slow, and developing new connections was painstaking. Soon our paths diverged.</p> <p>For Henry, working full-time and developing our idea on the side was unsustainable. He left his role at a tech startup to focus exclusively on turning the idea into reality. For me, the practicalities of moving to London to get involved full-time were more problematic, I remain in my post at Exeter University and offer support from a distance.</p> <p>Currently, <a href=\"http://upreach.org.uk/\" title=\"\">upReach</a> is engaging with employers, universities and policymakers to run a pilot programme in January 2013. We're honoured to have caught the imagination of influential leaders and are connecting with some of the UK's most prestigious graduate employers and universities. We've built a great team and are flourishing in our working environment, surrounded by an inspirational mix of founders and enterprises.</p> <p>I genuinely feel that upReach has the potential and people behind it to make a real difference to the lives of thousands of students across the country every year. upReach's journey began with our experiences in the past, but now we're working for a future where social background is no barrier for undergraduates to fulfil their career potential.</p> <p><em>Dale Potter works for the University of Exeter and helped <a href=\"http://www.upreach.org.uk/about.html\">Henry Morris</a> found <a href=\"http://www.upreach.org.uk\">upReach</a> \u2013 a social enterprise which aims to improve access to the professions for undergraduates from less privileged backgrounds.

  "<p>Francis Upritchard's rainbow-skinned figures may have stooped shoulders, sagging bellies and bald heads, but they never stop dancing. These hand-modelled, marionette-sized creations bend their knees and wave their arms, raver-style, absorbed in trance rhythms only they can hear. Others around them strike tai chi or meditation poses. But they all keep their eyes shut, refusing to connect.</p> <p>They're normally rendered naturist nude (but for the occasional tie-dye cloak) then painted all over: anything from bright purple to <a href=\"http://www.katemacgarry.com/uploads/1729_n.jpg\" title=\"\">harlequin patterns</a>. They could be the descendants of an off-grid commune, evolved in the wake of a nuclear disaster so their skin has taken on hippy hues. Or are they wandering minstrels from the middle ages? They seem both ancient and futuristic, as if they've not only tried to buck the system but have moved outside of time altogether.</p> <p>Born in New Plymouth, New Zealand, in 1976, the now London-based Upritchard grew up in a hippy environment where the local hub of crafters and alternative therapists was offset by the oil industry. The failure of the 1960s peace and love dream, bringing in the \"me\" generation in place of a communally minded world, is one of the key ideas behind her figurines.</p> <p>Upritchard made a name for herself in the early 2000s by turning consumer tat into ritualistic objects \u2013 a biscuit jar reworked as a funeral urn; an ancient Mummy whose tributes include a pack of B&amp;H instead of a gold bar. She often referenced tribal cultures like New Zealand's M\u0101oris. Turning the tables on colonial anthropologists, she drew analogies between the cheap trinkets westerners amass and talismans and amulets traditionally used to protect against evil spirits.</p> <p>Her clay figures made a splash on the international scene in 2009, when she represented New Zealand at the Venice Biennale, suggesting a shift away from her interest in magic objects and folk beliefs towards doomed ideals and utopian dreams.</p> <p><strong>Why we like her:</strong> For the <a href=\"http://membership.contemporaryartsociety.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/NOTTINGHAM-EDIT.jpg\" title=\"\">mysterious soldiers in her current show, A Hand of Cards</a>.

  "<p>The UK should delay its plan to kill thousands of badgers this autumn so experts can consider whether the cull is in line with a European conservation law, actors and celebrities have urged in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/30/badger-cull-complaint-ruling\">open letter</a> to the government.</p> <p>The pilot culls, designed to reduce tuberculosis in cattle, could be in breach of the Bern Convention that protects EU wildlife and habitats \u2013 despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/12/badger-cull-high-court-ruling\" title=\"\">being ruled legal by the UK high court this summer</a> \u2013 argue signatories to the letter including actors Joanna Lumley and Dame Judi Dench, TV presenters Chris Packham and Mark Carwardine and author Jilly Cooper.</p> <p>The secretariat of Bern said it believes there are grounds to consider whether the shooting of badgers by trained marksmen in Gloucestershire and Somerset as early as September breaches the convention, which the UK is a contracting party to, but its decision-making committee does not meet until November.</p> <p>\"The vast majority of available scientific evidence indicates that culling badgers \u2026 is not an effective way of controlling bTB [bovine tuberculosis] in cattle and can in fact increase incidence of bTB in some circumstances,\" says the letter.</p> <p>It continues: \"If, as it states, the government takes seriously its responsibilities to wildlife and respects the authority of the Bern Convention, it is logical that any badger cull be delayed until after the Convention has decided whether or not it might constitute a breach.\"</p> <p>Since the environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/19/badger-cull-caroline-spelman-shooting\" title=\"\">gave the green light in July last year for badger culls in England</a>, the proposals have faced criticism from scientists and high-profile public figures including Sir David Attenborough. Campaigners have hoped that the government would back down after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/20/badger-cull-wales-abandoned-vaccination\" title=\"\">the Welsh assembly reversed its decision to cull badgers</a> following strong public opposition.</p> <p> Farmers and the government say the disease, which can be spread by badgers as well as among cattle, has become a huge cost to the industry. In 2010-11, nearly 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in England at a cost of \u00a391m in government compensation.</p> <p>In July, the high court ruled against the Badger Trust in a judicial review that challenged the legality \u2013 rather than the scientific basis \u2013 of the plan to cull badgers, clearing the way for the pilots to go ahead.</p> <p>Humane Society International (HSI), which organised this week's open letter to Spelman, hopes it may stop large-scale culling by taking its battle to Europe.</p> <p>Mark Jones, veterinarian and HSI's UK director, told the Guardian: \"We believe that indiscriminately shooting these iconic creatures at night and potentially wiping out badgers altogether in some areas, must surely breach the convention. We're asking the government to have the decency to delay the killing so that Bern can properly consider the matter. With so many animals' lives at stake and in the face of such overwhelming scientific and conservation opposition, it would seem incredibly arrogant of the government not to do so.\"</p> <p>HSI submitted its complaint to Bern in January, but it is far from a foregone conclusion that it will be successful in using the convention to stop the culls. Bern's bureau meets on 17 September and will decide on evidence submitted by the HSI and the UK government whether to refer the issue to its standing committee in November.</p> <p>A spokesman for Bern said: \"It would then be for the committee to decide whether there is a suspicion of a breach. It seems unlikely the committee would take a formal decision on whether to declare a breach \u2013 they would ask for it to be investigated further if there was a suspicion.\"</p> <p>Badgers are listed as the lowest ranking of protected species under the convention \u2013 appendix III \u2013 which allows for species to be culled or hunted, provided certain methods are used and the \"ecological characteristics\" of the species are not affected.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \"Nobody wants to cull badgers, but no country in the world where wildlife carries TB has eradicated this devastating disease which forced the slaughter of over 25,000 cattle last year, without tackling it in wildlife too.</p> <p>\"Culling will only take place where it will help control this disease. The government will specify the maximum number of badgers that can be controlled in the area, and this will be monitored to ensure there is no local disappearance of them. The UK takes its responsibilities under the Bern Convention very seriously and we are confident our plans are consistent with its requirements.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September to change references in the headline and opening line of the story from the EU to Europe.</p>",

  "<p>The outlook for many people in Ethiopia seems less than bright following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-renaissance-meles-zenawi\" title=\"\">the sudden death of the prime minister Meles Zenawi last week</a>, yet as far as the country's natural resources are concerned, the outlook is golden. Gold reserves could be a source of greater development for the country.</p> <p>British firm Nyota Minerals is about to become the first foreign company to receive a mining licence to extract gold from an estimated resource of 52 tonnes in western Ethiopia. Its chief executive, Richard Chase, was involved in Tanzania's gold boom in the 1990s. He believes Ethiopia has similar potential. \"There are huge areas of relatively underexplored and unexplored prospective ground, and the infrastructure is not too dissimilar [to Tanzania], although the availability of cheap electricity is a definite plus,\" he says.</p> <p>Ethiopia also boasts gemstones such as diamonds and sapphires; industrial minerals including potash; and other precious and base metals. The development of these resources is a key plank of the government's export-orientated growth strategy and allows <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/coffee/map.html\" title=\"\">Africa's biggest coffee grower</a> to diversify its economy to reduce reliance on agriculture, which accounts for 43% of Ethiopia's gross domestic product.</p> <p>\"We expect our rich mineral wealth to contribute to economic development in Ethiopia,\" says the state minister of mines, Tolesa Shagi. Ethiopia's openness to foreign investment over the past decade is beginning to pay off, Tolesa believes. \"As an African country we have not had the knowledge or the resources until recent years,\" he says.</p> <p>A recent survey increased estimates of gold resources to 500 tonnes. The government says production could rise to 40 tonnes a year from just over four tonnes last year, earning the country around $1.7bn (\u00a31.1bn) at current prices. This could dramatically boost development and reduce dependency on imports. In the meantime, the mining sector is forecast to increase exports and earn foreign currency.</p> <p>The largest gold mine in Ethiopia is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/aug/30/gold-mining-ethiopia-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Lega Dembi</a> in the Sidamo province of southern Ethiopia. It was transferred from the government to a company called Midroc Gold, owned by billionaire Saudi businessman Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi, for $172m in 1997. In 2010, Midroc began its second gold mining operation in Sakaro, near Lega Dembi. Amoudi has also made huge investments in Ethiopian agriculture, cement and transport. The relationship between the billionaire and the government has attracted fierce criticism from government opponents.</p> <p>After gold, tantalum is the next most sought after mineral in Ethiopia. Chinese firms are eyeing a deal with a state-owned company that claims it is the world's sixth-largest producer. Up to 80% of this precious metal is sold for use in the production of transistors for Chinese-assembled mobile phones, cameras and computers.</p> <p>Ethiopia has licensed 250 foreign firms, from countries including China, South Africa, the UK, the US and Canada, to prospect for minerals. Investment in the sector reached $1bn in 2009, according to official figures. An overstretched mines ministry is not accepting any further licence applications while it deals with assessing existing applicants and monitoring investments. Companies are now required to include an environmental and social impact assessment in their applications.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/gold-prices-soar-but-africa-loses-out-says-afdb-paper-9044/\" title=\"\">A recent paper by the African Development Bank</a> said a large number of resource-rich African countries are seeing little benefit from their mineral wealth. It also said some have not been accruing maximum benefit due to cushy deals for corporations.</p> <p>However, this could change if new legislation focusing on regulating the excesses of transnational mining companies has the desired effect. Ethiopia is planning to sign up to <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/\" title=\"\">Publish What You Pay</a>. The international initiative, subscribed to by more than 70 countries, holds governments accountable for the management of revenues from the oil, gas and mining industries. Once fully signed up, Ethiopia will be expected to divulge all company payments and government revenues from its extractive industries.</p> <p>\"We want the mining industry to be for the people and not just for big business,\" says Tolesa. \"We have to be concerned about our community, our environment and the industry's contribution to the development of our nation.\"</p> <p>The Ethiopian Mining Proclamation states that the government requests 5% free equity shares with every licensed mining company operating in the country, as well as 35% income tax and 8% royalties.</p> <p>As well as <a href=\"http://www.et.undp.org/index.php?option=com_mdg&amp;Itemid=152\" title=\"\">more money to plough into development policies</a>, by opening up the mineral wealth to foreign investment Ethiopians could benefit from improved infrastructure, such as roads and greater employment opportunities.</p> <p>Investors see Ethiopia as a stable, investor-friendly country in the volatile Horn of Africa. Under Meles it attracted significant overseas investment \u2013 particularly from China \u2013 to help drive growth. Whether it will be business as usual in Ethiopia under Meles's successor, Hailemariam Desalegn, will be interesting to watch. As Nyota's Chase says: \"Ethiopia is undoubtedly a frontier for exploration in Africa.\"</p>",
  "<p>Another of the big fallers this morning was car insurance company Admiral, which also operates the Bell, Diamond and Elephant brands, and price comparison website Confused.com. The shares dropped 2.4% to \u00a311.67.</p> <p>Overall, the group posted a 7% increase in pre-tax profit to \u00a3172m in the first half, beating analyst estimates of \u00a3168m. But growth slowed at its core UK car insurance business with the number of vehicles rising 7% compared with the first half last year to just over 3m. That means vehicle numbers rose by just 1.6% in the first half, implying a slowdown in the company's key market. Admiral said:</p> <blockquote> After favourable conditions during 2010 and the first half of 2011 in the group's core UK car insurance market, there has been a marked change in 2012, with premium rates falling and competitors seeking to add market share. In this environment it was appropriate to moderate the rate of growth in the UK. </blockquote> <p>Revenue from so-called ancillary products \u2013 such as personal injury referral fees, breakdown cover and car hire cover \u2013 also dropped, though it is unclear by how much as the company now includes \"instalment income\" under this heading. Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital \u2013 who estimated that ancillary products actually fell by between 5% and 10% in the first half \u2013 said this was worrying as it was this part of the business that had driven the valuation in recent years.</p> <p>Analyst reaction was mixed but, notably, some brokers took a very dim view of the results. Flanagan, for one, wrote:</p> <blockquote> Admiral reported interim results which were well below our expectations and included a number of features which reinforce our concerns over the group's business model within the UK motor insurance industry, especially in the context of the group's very punchy valuation metrics. These include a slowdown in the rate of growth reported by the group, an increase in the overall loss ratio and, most worryingly for valuation purposes, a net contribution from ancillary products which has ground to a halt. </blockquote> <p>He said the shares were \"materially overvalued given the likelihood of much reduced earnings growth in the coming years and the threat of a formal referral to the Competition Commission of the UK motor insurance market with the accompanying risk of wholesale change to the business model of players in that market\". He reiterated his sell recommendation on the shares.</p> <p>Numis also cut Admiral to reduce saying:</p> <blockquote> We expect UK customer growth to flat-line and margin pressure is also likely if the more competitive rate environment continues. We therefore think the UK business is at an inflection point and with the drag from the international businesses yet to reverse we see diminishing earnings growth. </blockquote> <p>Joy Ferneyhough of Esp\u00edrito Santo was similarly unimpressed and asked whether Admiral was running out of steam. She said the consensus forecast for full-year pre-tax profits to rise by 12% \u2013 compared with 7% growth in the first half \u2013 looks \"a little stretched\", if you dig into trends on pricing, margins and volumes.</p> <blockquote> With UK motor pricing and volumes under pressure and the international business getting further from, not closer to break-even, we struggle to see how investors can push the stocks much further. </blockquote> <p>She kept a neutral rating on the stock but suggested there was significant risk that things could get worse from here.</p> <p>Stuart Duncan of Peel Hunt, however, maintained a buy recommendation on the stock:</p> <blockquote> Interim results have marginally exceeded our expectations, driven by international price comparison, while the remedial actions taken last year in UK motor are paying dividends despite increasing competition. </blockquote> <p>He said Admiral remained attractive due to what he called an \"asymmetric balance of risk and reward\", whereby the company retains just 25% of the underwriting risk but 89% of the profits. He said the chance of big increases in the share price are now far more limited but noted that shareholders can still look forward to an annualised return of around 10%, due to the healthy dividend return.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Rhodes Boyson, the bewhiskered and boisterous former headmaster who became the most colourful champion of traditional educational values in the Thatcher era, but failed to make much mark as a minister, has died aged 87.</p> <p>Unlike many educational theorists Boyson, the son of a Rossendale cotton spinner, had practised what he preached.

Boyson lost his seat in 1997 but his talent for popular and populist themes kept him in the public eye and still writing and appearing on TV.</p> <p>In an era when anodyne professional politicians were first becoming the norm at Westminster, Boyson was a throwback to more idiosyncratic times, a working-class child of Lancashire Methodism, pacifism and civic socialism who made the journey to free markets, privatisation, low taxes and pro-hanging Toryism a decade before Margaret Thatcher led a party disillusioned with the postwar consensus in the same direction.</p> <p>As such his championing of the classroom \"three Rs\", school uniforms and ready recourse to the cane, and his visceral hostility to comprehensive schools \u2013 he felt they damaged the prospects of clever working-class children \u2013 made him a hero of Tory activists, their hopes and prejudices. His disdain for welfare \"scroungers\", single mothers and sexual \"deviants\" did him no harm either.</p> <p>Nor did his anti-Europeanism or his Lancashire accent, complete with mutton-chop whiskers. More moderate and fastidious colleagues despaired of what they saw as his simplistic remedies and his ministerial boss Norman St John Stevas archly referred to him as \"the Colossus of Rhodes\". Snobbery may have impeded his ministerial rise \u2013 and he was a better propagandist. But the cultural faultline which he represented within his party persists.</p> <p>In later life Boyson \u2013 whose PhD from Manchester University was on the Victorian cotton industry whose free trade ethos he came to espouse \u2013 appeared on Have I Got News for You without realising it was a humorous show. Though a cheerfully combative figure, that weakness made him an early target for Ali G's spoof interviews.</p>",
  "<p>Two of the world's smallest countries are to place nearly 2.5 million square kilometres of south Pacific Ocean in newly created marine protected areas.</p> <p>The Cook Islands, nation of 20,000 people on 15 islands, formally announced on Tuesday the creation of the world's largest marine park covering nearly 1.1m sq km, an area bigger than France and Germany.</p> <p>\"This is our contribution not only to our own wellbeing but also to humanity's wellbeing,\" said the prime minister, Henry Puna.</p> <p>\"The Pacific Ocean is source of life for us. We are not small Pacific island states. We are large ocean island states,\" Puna said at the opening of the Pacific Islands forum, where leaders of 16 Pacific countries including New Zealand and Australia are meeting in Rarotonga.</p> <p>The new Cook Island marine park will be zoned for multiple uses including tourism, fishing, and potentially <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/06/papua-new-guinea-deep-sea-mining\" title=\"\">deep-sea mineral extraction</a> but only if these activities can be carried out sustainably, he said. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle\" title=\"\">precautionary principle</a> will determine what activities can take place, he said.</p> <p>New Caledonia, the Cook Island's Pacific island neighbour and former French territory, also announced it will create a new marine protected area roughly half the size of India, covering 1.4m sq km.</p> <p>\"New Caledonia wishes to play its part in the sustainable management of our oceans,\" Francois Bockel, the head of regional development told the Guardian.</p> <p>Pacific island nations have committed to a new approach to sustainable ocean management called the Pacific Oceanscape for the 40m sq km inside their collective exclusive economic zones. The region contains the largest pristine marine ecosystems and is home to 60% of the world's tuna stocks, scientists say.</p> <p>The tiny Pacific island nation of Kiribati launched the Pacific Oceanscape concept and created the 400,000 sq km <a href=\"http://www.phoenixislands.org/index.php\" title=\"\">Phoenix Islands protected area</a> in 2008.

  "<p>An early morning train carrying about 100 passengers has derailed in west Cumbria after a landslide near St Bees.</p> <p>Emergency services were continuing to deal with the two-carriage train, which was travelling towards Sellafield nuclear plant.</p> <p>Passengers included employees on their way to work at Sellafield and officers from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary were at the scene.</p> <p>No injuries were reported and, although the train left the tracks, it remained upright.</p> <p>A second train sent to the scene to transport the stranded passengers to Sellafield left at 10.25am, but it too encountered a landslide and had to return to Nethertown. Passengers will now be escorted to the nearest road for their onward journey.</p> <p>Network Rail said the derailment, about a mile south of St Bees station, happened in a remote area with no easy road access. Emergency services plan to remove rubble, put the train back on the rails, examine the track for damage and carry out repairs. It is likely the line will be closed for the rest of the day.</p> <p>Network Rail said: \"Following a landslip on to the railway near St Bees, buses are replacing trains between Whitehaven and Sellafield. Approximately 100 passengers have been removed from a train which ran into the landslip at 6.45am, derailing the front set of wheels.\"</p> <p>Cumbria police said earlier: \"At this time, no injuries have been reported, and police, along with officers from the British Transport Police, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and other emergency services are in attendance. Traffic is asked to avoid the area whilst emergency vehicles are travelling to the scene.\"</p> <p>A night of heavy rain severely affected the west of the UK. Police and fire crews reported cars partially submerged in the Egremont area of Cumbria.</p> <p>About 20 elderly residents were moved to an emergency shelter at Egremont market hall after a power cut.</p> <p>Cumbria fire service said it received more than 100 calls for help, mainly involving requests for sandbags. Forecasters said the rain was easing.</p> <p>However, Cumbria police were concerned about an unstable bridge at Beckermet, near Egremont. The bridge, next to the White Mare pub, was closed while its safety was assessed. The pub was flooded and staff were trying to pump the water out on Thursday morning. One worker said: \"We are literally swamped. It's all hands on deck here at the moment.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Cumbria fire service said that up to 150 houses in the Egremont area had been affected.</p> <p>He said: \"I don't have exact numbers but some people have had to be evacuated and many have made their own way out of their flooded houses.</p> <p>\"Cumbria county council's emergency planning team have been setting up some emergency accommodation for people. I know that roads around St Bees have been affected by the landslide there.</p> <p>\"We had in excess of 100 calls related to the flooding in a period of just two hours overnight. I know that this morning things are now calming down as far as the flooding goes. We have a number of fire engines at the scene of the train derailment but there are no rescues to be made.\"</p> <p>Cumbria police said drains were unable to cope after the river Ehen and several becks in the Egremont area burst their banks.</p> <p>Emma Jane Taylor said floodwater began entering her St Bees home shortly before midnight. She said: \"We've had heavy rain here before, but it's never been this bad before.</p> <p>\"I alerted some neighbours, but within 30 minutes it was through my front door and coming up through my floorboards.</p> <p>\"It's lifted the block paving from my grandmother's house nearby and was also coming through her french windows. At the moment you can paddle across my floor. We just hope the rain doesn't come back because the drains are full to the top and wouldn't be able to take any more.\"</p> <p>Wasdale mountain rescue volunteers helped the fire service to pump out several properties in the Egremont area.</p> <p>Earlier this week the rear of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/28/flood-house-collapse-cumbria-ehen?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">four-storey house</a> in Egremont collapsed into the river Ehen after heavy rain.</p>",

  "<p>In the late 1990s, easy cash and irresponsibility became an art form. It was the time of the dotcom boom when a small number of clever, usually irreverent and often dysfunctional people invented great things and became billionaires overnight. Some became mainstream corporate bosses; others would disappear off the map. One of those who made silly amounts of money and then blew it all was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Harris_%28internet%29\" title=\"\">Josh&#xa0;Harris</a>.</p> <p>Harris was one of the early pioneers (bathos intended) of <em>Big Brother</em>-style reality television. His career culminated and collapsed in 2000 with the filming of his life, and that of his girlfriend, in a real-life internet show called <em>We Live in Public</em>. Everything they did, from sex to cooking dinner, was filmed and made available for anyone to see. He wanted to conceive a child online. \"Think about it, wouldn't you enjoy sex more if you knew you were being televised?\" Eventually his girlfriend, Tanya Corrin, became fed up with him, walked out and tried to get the rights to the hours of digital \"performance art\". This was the merging of counterculture and cyber-culture. This was New York's Silicon Alley at its peak of bling and hedonism.</p> <p>Harris's parties were chronicled in magazines around the world. An earlier project involved inviting around 100 people to his warehouse apartment, so big you could line up several double decker buses in it, for a collective social experiment in wired living. It was busted on millennium night by anti-terrorist cops fearing it might be a suicide cult.</p> <p>You might wonder why Harris's life story requires a book. But when I finished reading <em>Totally Wired</em>, I understood why the cultural journalist Andrew Smith had written it. This was a slice of life never to be repeated. Smith followed Harris for years, eventually catching up with him in Awasa, an Ethiopian town where he had gone to hide from the cacophony he had engendered in New York. \"The thing about life in deep Africa is that every day is a life-and-death experience and your senses get sharp,\" Harris tells Smith. \"New Yorkers think the world's ending if they can't get dinner reservations at the right restaurant.\"</p> <p>Smith traces the start of the internet generation, providing fascinating passages about some of the forgotten individuals (such as the 1960s military programmer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider\" title=\"\">JCR Licklider</a> \u2013 \"Lick to his friends\"), and the startups that quickly went flat. \"The first people to recognise the social power of the online idyll were the former flower children,\" he writes. The book is peppered with enjoyable anecdotes. \"The first online business transaction,\" he notes, \"is said to have involved a quantity of dope shipped between students at MIT and Stanford circa&#xa0;1971.\"</p> <p>By the mid-1990s, irrational exuberance had taken over, from the party-goer, to the nerd, to the investor, to bankers such as Alan Greenspan. The first initial public offering of shares was Netscape. And it went completely wild. From that point there was no going back. In 1997 <em>Wired</em>, the bible of the emerging online community, declared: \"We're facing 25 years of prosperity, freedom and a better environment for the whole world.\" Nasdaq, the US technology stock index known affectionally as \"Nazz\", couldn't stop rising. Some firms were valued in multiples far greater than their worth. As they partied and saw their fortunes soar, one chief executive warned his colleagues: \"This won't last for ever, enjoy it and remember it!\"</p> <p>Then came 2000 and the dotcom crash. Some retrenched, survived and went on to thrive. Others, like Harris, did not. He insisted his corporation, pseudo.com, was actually fake. He could not, would not, allow his mind to enter the \"grown-up\" business world. He preferred to host endless parties, interviewing characters about foot fetishism for his online show, and persuading the French champagne industry to sponsor a happening entitled \"The End Is Near\".</p> <p>Smith describes him as a modern-day Gatsby. Harris likens himself to a Warhol of the web. His friend and fellow indulger, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis\" title=\"\">Jason Calacanis</a>, said of him: \"He's one of the 10 most important people in the history of the internet and nobody knows who he is.\" Unlike Mark Zuckerberg and his ilk, with the world at his feet, Harris threw it all away, and seemed happy to.</p> <p>I wasn't sure in the end if I admired him for his refusal to be boring or if I scoffed at his self-indulgence. I suppose the answer is a bit of both. This was an age of excess and innocence unleashed by the breaking of financial and communications barriers. Even the Clinton administration, which bought into the optimism of the moment, was worried by the loss of state control. It was the first government to try to establish surveillance over all electronic traffic, via a so-called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip\" title=\"\">clipper chip</a>\", which was seen off technically by the cyber&#xa0;geeks.</p> <p>Now, more than a decade on, the authoritarians are far more successful in watching, listening and following us online. The internet is much more sober now.</p> <p><em>John Kampfner is author of Blair's Wars and Freedom For Sale</em></p>",
  "<p>The consequences of Europe's debt crisis are all too present throughout much of the European Union, as distressed economies attempt to stabilise and grow at the same time. Notwithstanding the important decisions taken over the last couple of years, the reality is that we need to do more to tackle the challenges facing the eurozone.</p> <p>Reform and consolidation measures are being implemented across the EU. Joint financial backstops have been put in place. And the European Central Bank has consistently shown that it will stand by the euro. Yet experts and partners often underestimate our determination.</p> <p>All of the steps taken so far have resulted in more European integration, not less. It is true that sometimes decision-making in our democratic system takes time. But do not misjudge us: the negotiations are about the arrangements, not about the final outcome. There is sufficient political will in the EU to do whatever is necessary to protect the euro, because the future of the single currency will determine that of European integration.</p> <p>The additional measures that Europe needs must be firmly rooted in a commitment to deeper integration. High levels of sovereign debt, together with the behavior of parts of the financial sector, have amplified the crisis in the eurozone and raised important issues of confidence that now require a systemic answer.</p> <p>That is why we must complete the unfinished business of economic and monetary union \u2013 and why the European commission has long argued for the creation of a banking union as an indispensable step toward that goal. The commission's upcoming proposals are part of a broader package leading to economic, fiscal, and political union that will redefine the boundaries of European integration.</p> <p>The crisis has starkly revealed the insufficiencies of existing banking supervision. We must go beyond co-operation and establish an EU-wide supervisory authority, particularly in the eurozone. The link between sovereign debt and bank debt has to be broken once and for all. We must end the vicious circle whereby the use of taxpayers' funds \u2013 more than \u20ac4.5tn (\u00a33.5bn) so far \u2013 to rescue banks weakens governments' budgets, while increasingly risk-averse banks stop lending to businesses that need funds, undermining the economy further.</p> <p>Europe can stop this negative dynamic now with bold action. A single rulebook for financial services is being put in place for the single market. Building on this, a single European banking-supervision authority would open the way to direct recapitalization of banks through the European Stability Mechanism, as well as to common deposit insurance and a single resolution framework.</p> <p>On 12 September, the commission will present its proposals for a Single Banking Supervisory Mechanism based on three key principles:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Single supervision</strong>: Within the eurozone, coordination between national supervisory bodies is no longer enough. Risks that emerge in one country can affect the entire currency area. Common banking supervision is needed for strengthening confidence among countries using common financial backstops.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Credibility</strong>: The eurozone's new banking-supervision mechanism will have the ECB at its heart. The choice of tasks to be entrusted to the ECB will ensure rigorous, high-quality, and equal prudential supervision of eurozone banks, thereby contributing decisively to maintaining confidence between the banks \u2013 and thus increasing financial stability throughout the eurozone. Close cooperation with national supervisors will be built into the framework.</p> <p>The ECB's supervisory role will be fully separated from its monetary policy responsibilities. In parallel, the European Banking Authority will continue to perform its existing tasks, namely developing the single rulebook for the entire single market and ensuring convergent supervisory practice throughout the EU.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Broad coverage</strong>: All banks in the eurozone will be covered by the new European supervisory system. And we will need to bridge the gap between eurozone members and EU members that remain outside the monetary union, some of which may want to participate in the new supervisory mechanisms.</p> <p>The road that we have decided to follow will allow for swift action. The Single Banking Supervisory Mechanism does not require a treaty change and should be in place by January 2013.</p> <p>Common and more integrated supervision is the first step towards a banking union. Next, the commission will build on our current proposals for deposit-guarantee schemes and bank resolution mechanisms to move toward a single resolution fund and a single resolution authority. Once these proposals are implemented, the banking union will be complete.</p> <p>Establishing a banking union by 2013 will not give Europe a magic wand with which to wave away the economic crisis overnight; but it is a major and crucial step to restoring the confidence of Europe's citizens, international partners, and investors. It will ensure financial stability, increase transparency, make the banking sector accountable, and protect taxpayers' money.</p> <p>Moreover, it is the start of something much bigger. Once again, I would like to stress that the eurozone is drawing lessons from the past and defining a way forward, not backwards, in terms of integration. That is good news not only for the euro, but also for the global economy.</p>",

  "<p>The Mill has never been one for those awkward bars where over-sozzled men in contrast collar and cuffs shove notes into the impossibly skimpy underwear of girls the same age as their daughters at home. But as an all-singing, all-dancing, rarely truthful transfer turbine that is forced to perform its sordid dance to the transfer gods each and every morning, the Mill can consign its two left feet into the Christian Louboutin's of those girls and find them a reasonably snug fit.</p> <p>The same must go for footballers up and down the land right about now. There is less time to the close of the transfer window than that afforded to Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte and if players want their move, poles will have to be climbed, smouldering looks will have to be shot and seductive rugs will have to be cut, pronto. And with that bromidic, banal analogy out of the way, let's get down to the business of the day.</p> <p>The greatest trick <strong>Theo Walcott</strong> ever pulled was convincing the world that he is a footballer. Week in, week out, year in, year out, Theeee-O! Theeee-O! would dash, scamper and scuttle up and down various sidelines throughout the land \u2013 often even touching the ball \u2013 fooling fans, managers, casual observers, not-so casual observers and the Swiss Guard into thinking that he knows what he is doing, when in actual fact Theeee-O! Theeee-O! appears to know about as much about football as the Mill knows about post-structuralism, paradigmatic analysis and the work of Algirdas Julien Greimas. Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped <strong>Liverpool</strong> \u2013 who, in fairness to them, know a thing or two about buying duff midfielders \u2013 from slapping some dead presidents on Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's almost broken table in return for Theeee-O! Theeee-O! But fear not Arsenal fans, that deal will only be getting the green light if Liverpool can get rid of <strong>Andy Carroll</strong> and we all know that ain't going to be happening no way, no how.</p> <p>There is more <strong>Arsenal</strong> news. After last week's antidote for insomnia performance against Stoke that was more blunt than a cigar stuffed with something the 42nd president of the United States would never inhale, the normally miserly Wenger has gone all wanton on the world. Not content with some chap who scored a few goals against teams like European superpower Evian and another who could not even hit the largest barn door built by the finest Amish craftsmen in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, despite standing two feet away, Wenger is about to get out his wallet and write a cheque for \u00a318m of the biggest ones. In return for that cheque he will be getting <strong>Edin Dzeko</strong>, whose time at Manchester City has been such an unqualified success that the Mill is not sure why Roberto Mancini has not stopped giggling since Wenger sent his offer via telephonic transmission of some scanned printed materials.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Mill favourite <strong>Dimitar Berbatov </strong>is caught in something of a bizarre love triangle. Having being given the sharp end of Sir Alex Ferguson's rather pointed elbows, it seems the Bulgarian is now being beckoned into the comforting embrace not only of <strong>Fiorentina</strong> but of <strong>Juventus</strong> and <strong>Fulham</strong> too. However, Berbatov is not the type of striker who will just throw himself into the expanded arms of the first club that offers him \u00a380,000 a week and a truck load of sweet Carolina tasting Laramies. Oh no. He will need more than that and while the Mill does not know what that is, his former boss, <strong>Martin Jol</strong>, does. Thus, you will find Berbs sitting outside west London's finest cafes reading Camus soon enough.</p> <p>If you are not interested in that final paragraph where the Mill crowbars in all the other transfer news it could not be bothered to have fun with in the previous ones, look away now. <strong>Queens Park Rangers </strong>are set to make signing No901 and No902 of the transfer window as Mark Hughes does his best to shake off the tag that he is not the type of manager that needs to spend big in order to bring any semblance of success to a club; No903 is <strong>Esteban Granero</strong> while No904 is <strong>St\u00e9phane M'Bia</strong>. Paul Lambert will solve all of <strong>Aston Villa</strong>'s problems by splashing out on \u00a32m on <strong>Ryan Babel</strong>, who is also wanted by Swansea for reasons the Mill will never, ever understand. <strong>Nicklas Bendtner</strong> has still not moved to <strong>Milan</strong> and the same goes for <strong>Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my</strong> and <strong>Tottenham</strong>. And finally, <strong>Charlie Adam</strong> will be making his slow, slow way out of <strong>Liverpool</strong> with nobody really interested in where he is going except Tony Pulis.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/30/barclays-new-chief-executive-antony-jenkins\" title=\"\">Barclays has appointed its head of retail and business banking Antony Jenkins</a> as its new chief executive, replacing Bob Diamond who was forced out by the Libor rate fixing scandal in July. Here is what analysts made of the appointment.</p> <h2>Jason Napier, banking analyst at Deutsche Bank</h2> <p>We view Jenkins as the natural internal choice for the position. He is well known to the market, businesses under his care have performed well (Barclaycard and UK retail and business banking are the only two divisions currently meeting the return on equity targets set under Barclays' 13% ROE plan), he possesses experience within and without the group, and his reputation and retail heritage provide a base for rebuilding the bank's reputation over time.</p> <p>We expect this appointment to trigger sell-side speculation that this will herald a material shift in business from investment banking towards retail and business operations, mathematically leading to greater stability and quality of earnings, a stronger balance sheet, larger shareholder distributions and higher ROEs and P/E multiples.</p> <p>We expect strategy to remain largely intact, with mix change already in train. We think Basel 3 and industry revenue conditions make a shift of capital allocation away from investment banking inevitable for all players, but see this as incremental rather than revolutionary in Barclays' case. We expect the bank to stick to its strategy of seeking to operate world leading retail and investment banking operations. We do think, however, that his appointment reduces the chances of a balance sheet kitchen-sinking exercise.</p> <h2>Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners</h2> <p>Antony Jenkins is a very different man to Bob Diamond, a retail banker and not an ex trader/investment banker. If you believe (as I do) that the culture of a firm is set from those at the very top, then Barclays under Mr Jenkins will be a very different place to Barclays run by Bob Diamond.</p> <p>He is both a retail banker through and through and a Barclays man. He is a very different person to Bob Diamond who earlier in his career was head of bond trading at Morgan Stanley, head of Investment Banking, Equity, Fixed Income and Foreign Exchange in the Pacific region at CSFB and at Barclays he engineered the acquisition of Lehman in September 2008.</p> <p>So who else could Barclays have hired? An external candidate may have been more desirable - a hoped for \"new broom\" to sweep out the old dirt. However the main external candidate was the ex JP Morgan investment banker, Bill Winters, a breed that is not terribly popular with politicians or the media at the moment. As part of the process of appointing a CEO, there would have been informal discussions with major shareholders to get their opinions and tacit approval. Therefore this decision gives us an insight into the thoughts of both the current executive board at the bank and its main investors \u2013 it provides guidance as to the future direction of the business. It may even suggest that boring retail banking has become sexy again in the difficult investment and trading environment. For the time being Barclays is a global Universal bank, but the appointment of Mr Jenkins must raise the possibility that the bank is getting ready for the Vickers report recommendation \u2013 to create some split between retail and investment banking.</p> <p>The first job on Mr Jenkins' to-do list must be to get a grip on the investment banking business that is still one of the biggest in the world and a significant profit generator for the bank. The loss of Bob Diamond was a big blow to this division so the key profit generating staff need to feel confident in the new CEO. Shareholders will want to see some vision of the future especially given the dire stock price performance since the crisis began (the shares are still below half the previous peak price). Personally, Mr Jenkins needs to be able to handle media scrutiny and parliamentary questioning. He will need to get a grip on the current investigations and massive regulatory changes facing the banking industry.</p> <p>He must also get used to having a much greater profile - he is relatively unknown - anonymity has now gone. So good luck to the new CEO - from big-hitter-Bob to safe-pair-of-hands-Jenkins \u2013 what a difference a financial crisis makes. However please remember that Bob Diamond was only CEO for just over a year, taking the post at the beginning of 2011 and then leaving in the midst of the breaking Libor scandal in July 2012. Let's hope Mr Jenkins lasts longer than Mr Diamond and does not get forced out by another scandal.</p> <h2>Mike Trippitt, banking analyst at Oriel Securities</h2> <p>We see Mr Jenkins as a highly capable executive who will take a fresh look at the allocation of capital across the group, particularly in a post ring-fenced world and the group's remuneration policy, particularly within investment banking.</p> <p>Mr Jenkins' appointment may refuel the Barclays demerger story. We estimate the investment bank would require an additional \u00a311bn of equity to make it Basel 3 compliant today, requiring a rights issue. We therefore see reallocation of capital and gradual deleveraging as the more likely strategy for the investment bank.</p> <p>Whilst the shares do appear cheap, they reflect further regulatory risk and the longer term impact of ring-fencing. The prospect of an improved investment banking quarter could lead to some outperformance - more likely a first quarter 2013 event.</p> <h2>Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers</h2> <p>The bank's fight to restore its reputation continues. The chairman-elect has clearly given his stamp of approval, with the group appearing to signal a move back to its retail banking roots. The former head of Barclaycard appears untarnished by the Libor scandal, and given his group experience, provides something of a running start.</p> <p>On the downside, and allowing for both the challenges ahead and the combined political and media scrutiny, questions as to whether Barclays has appointed the best candidate are likely to remain. The new appointee also comes with a lack of investment banking experience \u2013 an important current group profit generator \u2013 whilst time at the bank during its mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) also needs to be remembered.</p> <p>In all, news that the Serious Fraud Office has joined the Financial Services Authority in its fund raising investigation may be more important in taking the share price lower in early trading. Developments in the eurozone also remain highly significant, while the fiscal cliff in the US continues to loom ever larger. For now, despite a wealth of uncertainties, with the valuation seen as attractive and the group's exposure to investment banking providing greater exposure to any economic recovery than rivals, analyst opinion continues to denote a buy.</p> <h2>David Buik at Cantor Index</h2> <p>He had been many people's idea of CEO to keep continuity going. He ticked all the conservative boxes; he was not flash \u2013 a marathon runner and a family man.</p> <p>I am still amazed that Sir David Walker, [the chairman-elect] arrived at that decision with his colleagues. Though I am personally a great fan of Barclays, to restore the optics, credibility and trust of shareholders and its customers, I thought it was essential that an external candidate was appointed. I am sure that Barclays' staff will be delighted and they will feel that they can all get behind him. This will be essential as the cumulo-nimbus clouds of concern gather over the entire banking sector. What will be important is the next tranche of management to be appointed. That may help to narrow the optics and credibility gap.</p> <h2>Analysts at Investec</h2> <p>The bank has also been in the news for possible irregularities regarding fee payments in association with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/29/sfo-investigation-barclays-qatar\" title=\"\">Middle Eastern capital raising efforts in 2008</a>. Given these investigations an external candidate may have been better for Barclays, though with a change of both chairman and CEO the continuity of an internal candidate has some benefits too.</p>",
  "<p>Six weeks before sex reassignment surgery (SRS), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/12/transgender-health-and-wellbeing\">I am obliged to stop taking my hormones</a>. I suddenly feel very differently about my forthcoming operation. I'd previously seen transition as a marathon: surgery was like breaking the tape, but the race was won far earlier. Now I reconsider: perhaps this is more like a difficult cup final after some hard previous rounds.</p> <p>The surgery completely dominates my planning and thinking. My temporary job ended in March, and the knowledge that I'd be incapacitated for at least two months from mid-July made it difficult to find another. Ineligible for <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/Illorinjured/DG_171894\">Employment and Support Allowance</a> until after surgery, I sign on, the whole scenario feeling farcical as both my case worker and I know that I am unlikely to get a job, but still have to fulfil the <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_200090.html\">jobseekers' criteria</a> to get my weekly allowance, haemorrhaging money all the while.</p> <p>It consumes my conversations as it inches closer. I am constantly asked how I feel: everyone expects a mixture of excited and nervous, and they are right. Above all, I'll be glad when it is over. I take a little holiday in late June, staying with friends in Scotland, and travel back on the first day of July. Then, for the next fortnight, my concerns over the practical, physical and psychological effects of SRS intensify by the day.</p> <p>My psychotherapist, whom I've been seeing all year, tells me that I've barely touched on the surgery, so I devote my final pre-surgical appointment to it. After an hour of airing my anxieties, I feel calm and able to continue.</p> <h2>Final preparations</h2> <p>Five days before checking into hospital, I sign off. Returning from the Jobcentre, a man with a taste for \"shemales\" (his word) follows me home, making me feel far less secure in my house \u2013 my sanctuary in a life that has felt in constant chaos. I break down in tears, crying for 30 years of feeling like an outsider, 20 years of knowing this to be related to my gender, 10 years of exploring it, three years of transition and two years of writing about it, with all their stresses and traumas simultaneously hurtling to the fore.</p> <p>For four days, everything makes me weep. At first it's painful, then cathartic, and finally just annoying \u2013 having not cried when I expected to for years, the sight of every ornament, every poster in my house sets me off, and I don't know when it'll stop. Eventually, I realise I need to get out: I visit old friends in Brighton, who indulge me as I discourse about the run-up to surgery and my feelings about it.</p> <p>I return a day before admission: having to address the practicalities pulls me together, as I ensure I have everything I'll want or need during the seven-day stay. I've never been seriously ill or injured, so I've sought advice on what to take: I buy slippers and a crossword book. Once I've got everything on my list, and packed, I feel completely relaxed. I go to bed content, close my eyes, and then see a car crash outside my bedroom window. It's so vivid, it takes several moments to realise that the flaming wreckage is no more than the invention of my hyperactive subconscious, but once I do, I get a solid night's sleep \u2013 my last for some time.</p> <p>Obsessed with being brave and independent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/may/15/transgender-journey-reality-surgery\">I'd travelled alone to my previous surgical appointments</a>. This time, on advice, I've arranged for my friend Tania to take me to hospital. She arrives around midday: we eat in my favourite cafe and then get the tube to Hammersmith, well before I have to report to Charing Cross hospital reception at 4pm. We say little, putting our arms round each other, but once I've checked in, she gives me some earplugs and a cuddly tiger (\"You'll need a soft toy, trust me\"). Then she goes, telling me to surrender myself to the nurses, and I find my bed in F bay on the Marjorie Warren ward.</p> <h2>In the ward</h2> <p>There are six beds, with most but not all occupants also undergoing SRS. Reassuringly, there are two people who had surgery a day before, who can hold conversations and move unaided. We chat before the nurses take my weight and blood pressure, measuring me for stockings to fight deep vein thrombosis as I'll be spending so long in bed. I order dinner and then sleep, struggling more with the sweltering temperature than anything else.</p> <p>At 5.30am, I'm woken for an enema: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/18/transgender-journey-teeth-gritted-fists-clenched-toes-curled\">they have to thoroughly clear my bowels before the procedure</a>. It's not pretty but I take it, shower and return to bed. At 7am, <a href=\"http://www.genderxchange.co.uk/\">James Bellringer, the surgeon</a>, enters with two consent forms \u2013 one for the hospital, the other for me. He asks if I will allow \"the tissue removed\" to be used for medical science. In the hazy half-light, I agree (to the disappointment, I imagine, of friends who've asked if they can have it). \"I'll see you soon,\" he says. The anaesthetist comes soon after and asks several questions before I lie back down.</p> <p>At 8.20am, I'm escorted upstairs. I take the lift to the 15th floor in my slippers, white hospital gown and navy stockings. The chattering voices in my head silence themselves, with just the closing bars of a favourite song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VIqA3i2zQw\">Laurie Anderson's O Superman</a>, soaring through my mind, and I am ready.</p> <p>Yuri, who assists the anaesthetist, lays me on a trolley and takes my blood pressure and temperature. The anaesthetist enters, attaching a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula\">cannula</a> to my right wrist. She asks if I have any questions. \"This'll definitely work, right?\" Yes, she says, irked. \"It's just that I studied <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/h/health-and-medicine-in-the-19th-century/\">19th-century medicine</a>,\" I say. \"It didn't fill me with confidence.\"</p> <p>\"It'll be fine\", she says, raising a needle. \"You may feel a shooting sensation in your arm \u2026\"</p> <p>I wake in the recovery room, dehydrated, my lips bone-dry. I demand water, but it's nil by mouth until I return to the ward. I'm slow to come round, though, and they won't move me until I'm fully awake, however much I ask. After what seems an age \u2013 I've no idea how long \u2013 they wheel my bed into the lift, and then back to F bay.</p> <p>The women there are glad to see me back: I tell them that it went well, before finding a wave of \"good luck\" messages on my phone. I go on Twitter to say that I'm conscious again; throughout my stay, social media keeps me sane, providing contact with friends, family and well-wishers at any time, saving dozens of energy-sapping conversations.</p> <h2>The first night</h2> <p>The nurses set up intravenous morphine, which goes towards compensating for the hated catheter bag strapped to my thigh. The machine bleeps whenever morphine is administered, which is not every time I press it, and it does bizarre things to my sleep: I close my eyes for what feels like several hours, only to find it's been five minutes, but I get through the night. Dizzy and nauseous, I try not to be tetchy with the nurses, who do their best, but I struggle with the shared ward, wanting my own space and getting annoyed when they open the curtains without asking, feeling guilty about occupying myself with my headphones although everyone else is perfectly understanding.</p> <p>One day after the operation, the morphine is removed. The nurses say it's to stop me getting addicted: I argue, unsuccessfully, that we can cross that bridge when we come to it. It's replaced by paracetamol and ibuprofen, which doesn't always shift a headache, and proves woefully inadequate. With vaginal packing to keep me open, I'm in severe discomfort: the lights go out at 10pm, and, laid flat on the hard mattress, with resting on my side impossible for the foreseeable future, I cannot sleep, the excess light, sound and heat driving me crazy.</p> <p>At 3.30am, I ring for the nurse. She comes, and I beg for sleeping pills, or stronger painkillers. I needed to ask earlier for pills as they have to be prescribed, and I've had my allotted pain relief, so there's nothing she can do. I ask when the packing comes out. \"Monday\", she says, which I repeat in disbelief: it sounds an eternity. Then she leaves. Trying not to scream, convinced that no operation could ever be worth this level of pain and cursing myself for signing up, my outlet is Twitter. I post that this is the worst night of my life, and that I feel like I may never sleep again, and a handful of kind responses from insomniac friends and transatlantic contacts give me a little cheer.</p> <p>At 6.30am, I fall asleep. I wake an hour later, to find nothing has changed, and it feels like this night will last forever. A nurse enters to take my blood pressure and I start crying, having promised myself I wouldn't, for the loss of independence, privacy and dignity, symbolised by the hospital staff changing me like a baby. \"You surrender those when you walk in, I'm afraid,\" she says: harsh as it sounds, the reminder that these feelings are to be expected provides comfort, and night eventually rolls into day, clearly demarcated by the nurses turning on the lights, opening the curtains and offering breakfast.</p> <p>Manjit, the nurse specialist, comes to check the wound, removing the pad over it. I look down and start hyperventilating: it's encircled by heavy bruising, the pad splattered in blood and pus. She insists I tell her what's wrong: I say it's discombobulating and looks disgusting. Worse, there's a \"phantom limb\" sensation, as I think I can feel the old organ moving in the itchy cloth underwear like it used to, even though I know it's gone. Psychologically it's unbearable. This will pass, she says; there are no complications, so all will heal.</p> <h2>The day room</h2> <p>My old university friend <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/talent-issue--the-novelist-joe-stretch-766036.html\">Joe Stretch</a> is coming down from Manchester to visit. With time passing so slowly, the prospect of his company keeps me going: I text to say that as he's coming before dedicated visiting hours, he must meet me in the day room, and that as I've not slept and am in absolute agony, I won't be at my best. Even though it hurts to laugh, his reply is perfect:</p> <p>'Stop moaning! It's probably just a cold!'</p> <p>At 10am he arrives and I shuffle to the day room, moving like a toddler who's learned to walk by watching John Wayne films. Gently, he hugs me, and we sit. I take the sofa as I need to stretch my legs out, and talk him through everything from leaving my house to the present. I keep stopping, holding my forehead as the physical and psychological pains engulf me, but after an hour, I'm done. I pause, then ask: \"Anyway, how are things with you?\"</p> <p>We laugh, but I insist he tells me: other people's lives reintroduce normality, and discussing our usual subjects becomes really important. To make myself feel more human, I've put on makeup. We joke about the contrast between that and my \"sexy\" catheter.</p> <p>Feeling less tired and looking better than I'd expected, I change my pads and empty the catheter myself, passing time by watching <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/The_Impossible_Voyage\">Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s films</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIkxLneBs2I\">Paul Merton's programme on Buster Keaton</a> on my laptop. Billie, who's had her operation days earlier, introduces herself. We click, sharing a love of sport, political theatre and literature; she looks at my books, and I tell her that the only one I can handle is a favourite volume of poetry, <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/43651031/Paroles-by-Prevert\">Jacques Pr\u00e9vert's Paroles</a>. She's intrigued, and suddenly, in this rarefied environment, there's an unanticipated moment of beauty. She sits, takes my hand and reads:</p> <p><strong>To Paint the Portrait of a Bird</strong></p> <p>First paint a cage<br>with an open door<br>then paint<br>something pretty<br>something simple<br>something beautiful<br>something useful<br>for the bird \u2026</p> <p>Before she even finishes this <a href=\"http://thebluelantern.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/to-paint-portrait-of-bird.html\">beautiful little poem</a> we're firm friends, swiftly united in subverting our routine as much as possible. Just as the nurses are putting everyone to bed, she sneaks in and disconnects my catheter from the night bag so we can go and watch GB's Olympic football team play Brazil. The match is uncompetitive, sterile and meaningless but here, all the aspects of the BBC's football coverage that usually induce apoplexy, particularly <a href=\"http://www.chrisrand.com/hmhb/look-dad-no-tunes-ep/lock-up-your-mountain-bikes/\">Garth Crooks's endless banalities</a>, are strangely soothing, and I go to bed far happier than when I rose, having requested sleeping pills well in advance.</p> <p>I sleep deeply for four hours, then wake, fixated upon the question of inequality. Gradually realising that I'm in no fit state to resolve this longstanding problem, it takes time to settle back down. I take them again the following night, and something similar happens: I rise with this singular sensation of disconnect from my body. At 3.30am I go to the day room to read. Billie joins me and we watch more football together.</p> <p>Soon, I weep again, through tiredness and pain. I venture out into the garden for the first time. Just seeing London life \u2013 a tower block, a single car and pedestrian \u2013 makes me realise that soon I'll be out, with the pain subsiding, and this and the fresh air makes me feel infinitely better. That night I meet Katya, who'll be having her operation tomorrow, and I tell her that although she'll be sore, she'll be fine if she asks for sleeping pills and gets friends to sneak in food, and that the joy at resolving her <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Gender-dysphoria/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">gender dysphoria</a> will make it all worthwhile, as it has for me.</p> <h2>Departure</h2> <p>As soon as I wake on Monday, I ask the nurse when the packing and the catheter will be removed. \"After breakfast,\" she replies. Suddenly, I've never wanted tea, toast and cereal so much. When it comes, I eat voraciously, impatient for her to return. Eventually, she does: the removal is traumatic, taking longer than anticipated, and seeing the blood-soaked gauze makes me hyperventilate again. She cools me by saying I can shower and wash my hair, and that if I relieve myself efficiently, I'll be discharged tomorrow. Later, I manage to pee: it goes everywhere, but that'll fix itself, and the discomfort is outweighed by knowing that I'm a massive step closer to leaving. My morale is boosted further as I put on my own clothes.</p> <p>I start dilating, using lubricating jelly and two five-inch dilators, one two inches wide, the other three. I have to use the smaller one for five minutes, then the larger for 20, to keep the neovagina open, three times daily for now. (In Scotland I met someone who was down to once a month, three years post-SRS.) This is very dull, and I make it tolerable by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZHOjfIxqk\">listening to music</a>. It goes fine, so there's just one final barrier to my exit: I need to open my bowels. On Monday night, after I've ducked across the road get takeaway pizza, the first time I've left the hospital grounds, the nurse gives me laxatives, and I prepare for the most important dump of my life.</p> <p>You don't need me to describe this \u2013 I couldn't top the <a href=\"http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/jod/ulysses/ulys4.txt\">toilet scene in Ulysses</a> and even if you've not read it, you know what it's like \u2013 but later I triumphantly tell the nurses that I've done the business, and they say I can go now if I wish. I call my parents, my housemate Helen and others, deciding not to leave in a rush.</p> <p>This proves wise as Manjit, who's not back until morning, must see me dilate. She's satisfied that I do it properly, and now the only thing keeping me is the wait for the pharmacy to send my medication. Helen comes to help me home: I'm overjoyed to see her, and we chat for an hour before my painkillers and taxi arrive. </p> <p>When the car pulls up at my house I drag my suitcases inside before collapsing on to my bed, overwhelmed by the simple pleasure of seeing my own home.</p>",
  "<p>The amazing euro crisis continues \u2013 another meeting, another non-decision. You might have imagined that, like a brick being tugged with a piece of elastic, something would have happened by now.</p> <p>But no, the euro, it seems, is stuck in a political no man's land \u2013 trapped between two opposing world views. And the battleground is not economics, but ethics.</p> <p>Thus, the ongoing debate about pooling of debt founders less on practicalities than the categorical imperative that those who have been careful with their budgets should not have to help those who have been careless.</p> <p>And while the Spanish and Greeks insist that there is a moral obligation on the part of the wealthy countries to help them over bad times, the Germans and Dutch fume at the idea that work-shy, tax-evading grasshoppers with unregistered swimming pools should be bailed out by their dutiful ants.</p> <p>In the background there is the spectre of <a href=\"http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/bankers-ramp.htm\" title=\"\">banks busily gouging savings (via the central banks) out of the taxpayers for easy profits</a>. It is the 'unfairness' rather than the technicalities that are the sticking point in dealing with the euro imbroglio.</p> <p>The former ECB chief economist, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-26/greece-cheated-to-join-euro-sanctions-since-were-too-soft-issing-says.html\" title=\"\">Otmar Issing, illustrates the blockage by declaring bluntly</a>: \"Greece cheated to get in, and it's difficult to know how we should deal with cheats.\" Certainly, nowadays Greece freely admits it fiddled the figures to enter the currency bloc, claiming its deficit was less than 1% of GDP, whereas even in the boom years, its budget disregarded the 3% limit. This is a country rated by Transparency International as the most corrupt in Europe and top of the table for tax evasion.</p> <p>The media have merrily fanned the flames. A satirical picture for a German magazine caused outrage in Athens. The Venus de Milo (considered by the Greeks to be part of their looted heritage) \u2013 was depicted making a rude gesture, with the caption: \"Cheats in the euro family\". In response, a Greek daily mashed up a photo depicting the statue atop Berlin's Column of Victory holding up a swastika.</p> <p>In similar nasty vein, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/throw-out-cheating-greece-before-the-rot-cripples-rest-of-the-world-20110914-1k9lp.html#ixzz24BvuSr60\" title=\"\">Paul Sheehan, a columnist for the Sydney Morning Herald</a>, has called Greece \"a cancer in the eurozone\", one where cheating is the national sport. There are a lot of Greeks in Australia and Melbourne is the third largest \"Greek city\" the world. But that's Melbourne, not Sydney, and Melbourne has its own paper.</p> <p>On the other side of the euro divide, foolish talk grows of Greece and its fellow peripheral nations being \"systematically raped by Germany and France\". The mayor of Athens demands that Germany should now pay \u20ac70bn (\u00a355bn) for two civilian massacres by its soldiers during the war, while the country's deputy prime minister told the BBC that Germany also owed Greece for stealing its gold, a point reinforced by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNWI9_PlM7s\" title=\"\">Daniel Cohn-Bendit in a special appearance on YouTube</a>.</p> <p>Of course this is empty, if increasingly popular, rhetoric. To enable Europe to emerge from the ashes of the second world war, the Marshall Plan wisely put a block on competing national claims, including almost all wartime clearing debt. Yet now that Germany is rich, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/06/economic-history\" title=\"\">the call goes up for a re-opening of old debt issues</a>.</p> <p>And even as Greece's supporters hurl angry accusations at the 'Nazis', the reality is some \u20ac100bn of Greek wealth has recently flowed out of the country (depleting its cash-strapped banking system), while the ECB is keeping it afloat by buying zombie bonds. Actually, Greek external debt remains a rather modest \u20ac38,000 or so per person, rather less than either Germany or France's, let alone the UK's whacking \u20ac117,000. It's just the puny Greek GDP that makes it stand out.</p> <p>The eurozone debt problem remains comparable with that of the US, and potentially manageable. Alas, since its inception in the 1950s, the European project has been hostage to the competing views of governments all resolutely set on advancing national interests at the expense of their partners. If the commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, now tries to speak for 'the common interest', such talk is barely audible in the Hobbesian jungle of EU politicking.</p> <p>The bottom line is that governments and citizens in the relatively prosperous northern nations can borrow easily and cheaply, too easily and too cheaply, while fellow Europeans in the troubled nations are paying much higher interest rates that are strangling their economies. That's not only unfair, it's economic madness.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Martin Cohen is a writer on philosophy, social science and green economics.

  "<p>Whether or not <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/jul/25/bradley-wiggins-boost-uk-cycling-sales\" title=\"\">you've invested in cycling equipment recently</a>, it's possible Britain's recent cycling successes have inspired you to try distance rides.</p> <p>In this wave of enthusiasm, I recently found myself <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/national-cycle-network/long-distance-rides/england/coast-and-castles-south#401648,614418\" title=\"\">slowly cycling from Newcastle to Edinburgh</a>.</p> <p>Riding big miles comes with a great sense of achievement, freedom and adventure. Having leapt from commuter to touring cyclist with little-to-no preparation, however, I discovered they can also produce pretty sore knees.</p> <p>Each person has different strengths and weaknesses, but there are general tips that can help you on your way. I asked Martin Emery, instructor at <a href=\"http://www.boommybody.com/\" title=\"\">Boom! Cycle</a> in east London, and regular sportive rider, how much training is needed for a long (100-mile plus) ride.</p> <p>Both Emery and Nichola Roberts, clinical lead physiotherapist at Six Physio, agree building up slowly is the greatest form of preparation \u2013 and injury prevention \u2013 and the more time you give yourself to train, the better.</p> <p>\"As opposed to massive changes happening on a daily basis there will be small incremental changes week to week,\" says Emery. This is simply a matter of putting in the miles, ideally for three or four months, he adds.</p> <p>\"The intensity you are riding at is going to be low, what you are going to need to do is train your body to work at that intensity for several hours.\"</p> <p>Roberts says correct bike setup is vital for long rides. \"When people ride short distances they can get away with poor bike setup, but once they start doing longer rides then small niggles can become more of an injury.\"</p> <p>There is a useful <a href=\"http://physiobench.com/articles/19/Basic-Bike-Set-Up:-5-Tips-to-set-up-your-bike-so-as-to-avoid-injury\" title=\"\">page here on bike setup</a>.</p> <p>Improving core strength will increase your efficiency on the bike, as well as reducing injury risk. This can be improved <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2011/jun/23/bike-blog-avoid-injury\" title=\"\">through Pilates</a> as well as correct cycling technique. Roberts pointed out I was barely engaging my core (abdominal muscles) while cycling, and generally slouching a bit. She encouraged me to use my gluteal (bottom) muscles as my quadriceps were doing too much work, hence in part the knee pain. I could feel the extra power straight away, and riding actually felt more comfortable.</p> <p>Good nutrition and hydration are key during distance rides, and as with any aspect of training, it's important to listen to your body. Roberts suggests eating or drinking at the point when you start to feel hungry or thirsty, to prevent \"bonking\" \u2013 fatigue caused by low blood sugar and/or dehydration.</p> <p>With training, the body adapts to refuelling during exercise, as well as improving glycogen stores, used for energy. From energy bars to gels, with different flavours and sugar contents, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ethicallivingblog/2009/aug/19/bike-blog-food\" title=\"\">the choice of \"fuel\" is pretty vast</a>. Preferences differ enormously, so experiment and find out what works best for you. Just don't try anything new on the day of the big ride, as your body will get used to a certain type of fuel while training, and will learn to work with this.</p> <p>Once you start feeling improvements it's tempting to keep pushing yourself. However, rest periods allow the body to repair and adapt and are as important as the training itself. Again, your body will tell you when you need to rest.</p> <p>As I learned during my four-day 180-mile ramble, training for a long ride can make the difference between struggling and really enjoying the journey. Next time I will be better prepared.</p>",
  "<p>The figures are shocking. According to the UN Environment Programme (Unep), more than 400 million Africans now live in water-scarce countries; 300 million people still do not have reasonable access to safe drinking water and nearly 230 million people defecate in the open.</p> <p>But the reasons African governments cite for not implementing integrated water management policies or meeting commitments they have made to provide sanitation are many and varied. A survey of officials by Unep <a href=\"http://washafrica.wordpress.com/2012/05/15/africa-un-water-survey-shows-improved-government-performance-in-water-resource-management/\" title=\"\">in 40 African countries</a> suggests they are not mainly constrained by a lack of money.</p> <p>Congo-Brazzaville, Nigeria and Sierra Leone don't even have a formal water policy, they told the UN and African Union in the report, referred to this week at the <a href=\"http://www.worldwaterweek.org/about\" title=\"\">World Water Week in Stockholm</a>. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe said it did not have the necessary laws in place; Cameroon said it had no one to champion the cause of water provision, and 25 countries, including Namibia, Swaziland, Rwanda and Mozambique, said they did not have enough human capacity.</p> <p>Some governments were brutally honest about their failings. Congo-Brazzaville said it could not get the private sector or civil society interested, Burundi that it had experienced too many changes of ministries, and Ghana that it had problems collecting revenue from local sources. Liberia said it had difficulty accessing donor funds, and Libya and Zimbabwe said they did not have the infrastructure.</p> <p>Only 18 African countries cited money as a constraint to developing water resource management. Ghana and Liberia said they found it hard to access donor funds, and Burkina Faso and Congo-Brazzaville said a big problem was slowness in mobilising financing.</p> <p>But there is a growing belief that it makes little sense for governments to make more commitments on water and sanitation. Haba Arbu Diallo, former Burkina Faso water minister and chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.gwp.org/en/gwp-in-action/West-Africa/\" title=\"\">Global Water Partnership in west Africa</a>, argued for a moratorium on more commitments. \"Many African countries [at this rate] will need two or three millennia to meet their MDGs,\" he said. \"If urbanisation continues at this pace in 10 years' time, every African country will be faced with a massive challenge. The time has come to stop making commitments and to implement what we have already agreed to.\"</p> <p>On sanitation, says a report by the <a href=\"http://www.amcow-online.org/index.php?lang=en\" title=\"\">African Ministers' Council on Water</a> (AMCW), Africa is making little progress and is likely to miss its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-environmental-sustainability\" title=\"\">MDG target</a> by more than 300 million people. Only nine African countries are on track to meet their targets.</p> <p>A statement from the <a href=\"http://www.africasan3.com/\" title=\"\">third African Conference on Sanitation and Hygiene</a> added: \"The poorest 20% are 20 times more likely to defecate in the open than the richest 20%. The impact of this hidden scandal is devastating to health and quality of life.\"</p> <p>Rwanda has emerged as the poster child for hygiene and sanitation, largely because of high-level political support. More than 54% of the population has decent sanitation, from fewer than 1.5 million people in 1990 to more than 5.5 million today. \"In Rwanda, political prioritisation for sanitation and hygiene has come from the very top. This unprecedented level of support has been critical,\" said Therese Dooley, of Unicef.</p> <p>Some progress has been made elsewhere too. \"Before we were not even allowed to say toilets or defecation,\" she said, \"but now we see UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon using these words, which greatly increases exposure and awareness of the issue.\"</p> <p>But water and sanitation are still not top priorities for governments, despite overwhelming evidence that a country's development and people's wellbeing depends on efficient use of water.</p> <p>The secretary of the AMCW, Bai Mass Taal, from Nigeria, said the best way to push water and sanitation up the political agenda is to find new ways to measure the contribution of water to development. \"It is very important to provide a basis for highlighting the pivotal role of water resources as an essential ingredient in the advent of a green economy in Africa,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The Gaza strip faces a water crisis that will soon make it \"unliveable\" unless plans for a $500m desalination plant are approved by banks, delegates at a water conference in Stockholm were told this week.</p> <p>Water for the 1.6 million people \u2013 half of them children and two-thirds refugees \u2013 who live in just 365 sq km of land bordering the Mediterranean comes entirely from the shallow coastal aquifer shared between Gaza, Israel and Egypt, which is only partly replenished each year by rainfall. Decades of overpumping and heavy pollution from salts and waste water has left the aquifer highly degraded and in danger of irreparable damage.</p> <p>UN hydrologists say no more than 55 million cubic metres (mcm) of water should be abstracted a year, but present exploitation rates run at around 160mcm. If this continues, says the UN, it could result in the water table dropping to a point where massive sea water intrusion permanently destroys the source within a few years.</p> <p>In addition, the little water available is heavily polluted by nitrates from uncontrolled sewage, and fertilisers from farmlands, making 90% of the water unfit for human consumption. With the Gaza population expected to increase by 500,000 within eight years, and nearly 25% of all illnesses in Gaza water-related, the urgency for countries to put aside differences and address the issue is growing.</p> <p> \"The aquifer could become unusable as early as 2016, with the damage irreversible by 2020. UNEP [the UN Environment Programme] recommends ceasing abstraction immediately as it would otherwise take centuries for the aquifer to recover. Even with remedial action now to cease abstraction, the aquifer will take decades to recover,\" said <a href=\"http://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/file/publications/gaza/Gaza%20in%202020.pdf\" title=\"\">a UN Relief and Works Agency report</a> published this week.</p> <p>The Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) expects demand for fresh water to grow to 260mcm per year by 2020, a 60% increase on current levels of abstraction from the aquifer, the UN report says.</p> <p>\"We are facing a crisis. If we do not address it now, then Gaza will become unliveable,\" said Shaddad Attili, minister and head of the Palestinian water authority <a href=\"http://www.ufmsecretariat.org/en/ufm-presents-the-gaza-desalination-project-at-the-2012-world-water-week-in-stockholm/\" title=\"\">in Stockholm to lobby the Swedish and other Nordic governments</a> during World Water week.</p> <p>Plans for a desalination plant for Gaza have been discussed since 1996, but with water one of the underlying causes of the Israeli-Palestine conflict, political and security issues have always prevented work from starting. Last year the Palestinian water authority submitted new plans to the <a href=\"http://www.ufmsecretariat.org/en/\" title=\"\">Union for the Mediterranean</a>.</p> <p>However, what gives the scheme at least the possibility of success is that the principle of a desalination plant for Gaza is now backed by Israel, all Mediterranean governments, the UN, the EU and key development banks.</p> <p>Desalination may not be the most environmentally suitable solution, \"but it is the only feasible solution of providing a new water supply to meet growing demand,\" said Rafiq Husseini, a water expert at the Union for the Mediterranean, a grouping of 43 countries which this year approved the scheme.</p> <p>Palestinian authorities hope that the plant will be the cornerstone of a larger scheme to provide much needed electricity and clean water for everyone in Gaza. But with desalination being energy intensive, the whole scheme would need a 90MW power plant and cost in the region of $500m.</p> <p>Finance for the scheme is hoped to come from the Islamic Development Bank, which, says Husseini, has verbally pledged half the money, and Europe, via the European Investment Bank, the financial arm of the Eueopean Commission (EC) that invests around \u20ac70bn a year in soft, or cheap loans.</p> <p>\"This is not a risk-free project. There are many political and other issues. It cannot be financed through loans, but needs grant funding. It needs political commitment,\" said a spokesman for the bank, which is advising the Palestinian authority on how to finance the scheme.</p> <p>The next stage, he said, is for the EC to provide \u20ac4m for technical assistance. However, access to water across the region has become highly politicised and regional conflict has stymied all efforts to share it between countries. Water resources have paid a high price as the Middle East region has grown vastly in numbers in the past 50 years.</p> <p>The Dead Sea has dropped 33m and lost two-thirds of its surface area in a few decades, Jordan and Syria have siphoned most of the water off the Jordan river, and Israel maintains control of the water resources in the Golan heights and the West Bank.</p> <p>Jordan, one of the world's most water-scarce countries, has plans to transport water from the Disi aquifer in the south of the country to the capital Amman but this is thought to be hydrologically unsustainable with present population growth. The longer term regional solution is seen in an ambitious plan to link the Red and Dead seas with a pipeline.</p> <p>This, says its advocates, could pump around 2bn m\u00b3 a year of seawater from the Red sea over 200km to the Dead Sea where it would be desalinated and then pumped on to Amman in Jordan. Under present plans, around 800mcm of clean water would be produced, of which 150mcm would be pumped on to Israel.</p> <p>But all water schemes in the Middle East are complex, mostly requiring the elusive consent of several countries \u2013 virtually impossible until the Arab-Israeli conflict has been resolved.</p> <p>The stakes are high, with all major parties now agreed that it makes humanitarian and political sense to build the plant. \"We cannot wait until the conflict is resolved. We need to drink .The issue is not just water for food and drink but for the stability and security of the world,\" said Al Attili.</p>",
  "<p>Getting people to support less 'cuddly' causes such as domestic violence, disabled rights or prisoners' rights has always been a Sisyphean task. There is always the lurking temptation for charities working on tough causes to reach for shock advertising to generate awareness and donations. A recent example is <a href=\"http://www.kony2012.com/\" title=\"\">Kony 2012 </a>which takes using shock imagery to the next level with a video narrative gone viral on the wave of global online outrage resulting in an outpouring of donations.</p> <p><a href=\"@RobmDyson\" title=\"\">Rob Dyson</a> from <a href=\"http://www.whizz-kidz.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Whizz Kidz </a>commented in a discussion about whether charities have gone too far in using shock advertising: \"As long as these ads still appear to work, charities will keep using them. People give because of tragedy and sadness. It's our challenge to prevent our users and clients being turned into a circus of sadness.\" Yet a case can be made for the diminishing returns of shock imagery as illustrated by aid agencies campaigning for donations by bombarding the public with pictures of starving people in Africa. They wildly succeeded in the mid-1980s and the funds poured in. However, when the tactics were repeated in the early 1990s, their efforts fell flat in the face of compassion fatigue from previously enthusiastic donors.</p> <p>There are always powerful alternatives to negative campaigning. As charities, we have to get creative about reaching people and giving them the tools to get involved. Done right, positive campaigns build goodwill, generate conversation and galvanise the layperson to take action. The<a href=\"http://www.itgetsbetter.org/\" title=\"\"> It Gets Better Project</a> founded by American columnist Dan Savage to prevent suicides by LGBT teenagers went viral as LGBT adults from around the world sent YouTube messages of hope to LGBT teenagers. There was no advertising spend, no distressing imagery, no guilt-tripping \u2013 just word-of-mouth and a platform anybody can use to participate in the cause.</p> <p>The charity I founded, <a href=\"http://www.thepixelproject.net/\" title=\"\">The Pixel Project</a>, works to prevent and stop violence against women. Right from the start, we stuck to using positive images, ideas and strategies to power our campaigns and empower survivors and supporters to take action. From music to photography to cupcakes, our campaigns make people smile while mobilising musicians, photographers and independent businesses to spread awareness in their communities and raise funds for the cause. One of our volunteers, Gia Ibarra, described our approach best when she said: \"As a survivor of rape and domestic violence working to heal and help other survivors, I feel at home with The Pixel Project who showed me that activism can be fun and that you can help the cause without using or being exposed to the triggering images or videos that many anti-violence against women organisations use to raise awareness.\"</p> <p>As charities who frequently deal with sensitive, even controversial, issues, we owe it to those we serve to avoid sensationalising their pain. Bad enough that they had to face trauma and obstacles without us using them or their situation as case studies to leverage public guilt. We need to ask ourselves: Are we fighting for brand recognition or are we fighting for real change? If all shock advertising does is generate temporary public outrage, reinforce negative perceptions of our causes and create compassion fatigue, then we should abandon it.</p> <p>Here are a couple of best practices for building successful positive campaigns:</p> <h2>The Power of Positive Appeal</h2> <p>Instead of using shock advertising to provoke negative emotions such as outrage and anger in an attempt to motivate the public to donate and get involved, why not create campaigns that spark positive emotions in people such as hope, compassion and generosity? Even a subtle shift to affirming the positive can have a powerful effect on donors. The UK's <a href=\"http://prostatecanceruk.org/\" title=\"\">Prostrate Cancer Charity</a> discovered this when they held an initiative to gauge the reaction of donors to negative and positive appeal letters. Donors who received the positive appeal letters made donations worth 45 percent more on average.</p> <h2>Find the Bright Spots</h2> <p>Try what Jerry Sternin did when he was asked to open Save The Children's Vietnam office in 1990 with meagre resources and a charge to fight child malnutrition within 6 months. His strategy was to observe mothers with young children in a village to locate what Chip and Dan Heath, the authors of Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard call \"bright spots\" which are essentially effective efforts worth emulating. He noted what mothers with healthier children were doing right and got them to teach other mothers to do the same thing. 6 months later, 65 percent of the children in the area were visibly better nourished and remained so.3 So look for 'bright spots' already happening in your community \u2013 find out what is getting supporters actively engaged with the cause that you serve. Then, build your campaign around that.</p> <p>We have a responsibility to break the 'circus of sadness' and start focusing on how we and our supporters can move forward together to build a better future for those we help. After all, when we signed up to join the charity sector, we signed up to change the world.</p> <p><em>Regina Yau is Founder and President of The Pixel Project, a complete virtual, volunteer-led global nonprofit organisation whose mission is to raise awareness, funds and volunteer power for the cause to end violence against women.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Never mind the South Africans clogging up the batting order in the England cricket team \u2013 when Johanna Konta shocked everyone but herself by reaching the second round of the US Open and Laura Robson advanced to the third round on day three there must have been a lot of proud Australians smiling to themselves in the middle of the night.</p> <p>Konta was born in Sydney to Hungarian parents and moved to the UK seven years ago, when she was 14; Robson was born to Australian parents in Melbourne 18 years ago and moved to London when she was six.</p> <p>That's probably too long ago in both cases for Australia to claim them \u2013 and although Konta's accent has traces of her background, she says she is proud to have \"GBR next to my name\".</p> <p>Robson's next opponent is Li Na, one of the funniest and most interesting players on the tour. Asked what three things Americans might still not understand about China (where have you been guys?), she said: \"Why Chinese still use chopsticks; why Chinese have to put the family name first, right? &#xa0;I think lot American people couldn't understand, yeah. &#xa0;Two thing already. &#xa0;I couldn't find a third one.\"</p> <h2>The comeback kids</h2> <p>When Janko Tipsarevic and Lleyton Hewitt survived on day three they became the seventh and eighth players at this US Open to win from two sets down, an unusually high number. Unfortunately for Belgium, Xavier Malisse could not make it nine against American Marathon Man John Isner, murdering a regulation backhand volley in the tie-break.</p> <p>Isner, forever to be remembered as Nicolas Mahut's partner in longevity on Court 18 at Wimbledon, has played in 48 tie-breaks this year.</p> <p>When was the last time, incidentally, that three Belgians played on the main court on the same day at Flushing Meadows? Your humble reporter doesn't know but Malisse, Kirsten Flipkens and Kim Clijsters did it on day three. And all lost.</p> <h2>Say no cheese</h2> <p>Being fat in America is easy: have cheese on everything (including cheese), watch a lot of television and you will end up with a waist size bigger than your IQ.</p> <p>Too many kids, here and everywhere, are pretty good at being fat, which is why an initiative spawned by the first lady and encouraged by the United States Tennis Association is to be applauded.</p> <p>That's all well and good. But one way to get people skinny is not to stick a load of fat-making stuff in front of them. Out and about in the food halls at Flushing Meadows the calorie-rich fare still swamps the healthy stuff \u2013 and you do not want to know about the media canteen.</p> <h2>Kim's game over</h2> <p>The departure of Kim Clijsters from the tournament and the game at age 29, after losing to Laura Robson on Wednesday, will leave a big vacuum in the niceness department.</p> <p>She might be the nicest person in women's tennis and does not seem to have an enemy in the game. Robson said she could not allow herself to think about retiring one of the game's legends beforehand and felt guilty when reminded of it afterwards. Did she feel like the girl that shot Bambi? \"I wouldn't go that far,\" she said. \"I would say that was Becker beating Agassi here a few years ago.\"</p> <p>She said of Clijsters: \"I've always loved watching her play because she's such a dynamic player. Her movement is something that I wish I could have. Still, it's great to be through to the third round of a slam for the first time.\"</p> <p>Sentiment is fine. But sport is always about winners and losers.</p> <h2>More Mr Nice Guy</h2> <p>Another amenable character here is Brian Baker, the talented American returning after a long absence through injury. The first time he came here, with his father, he was eight years old. The last time was seven years ago, as a 20-year-old prospect, when he upset the ninth seed Gaston Gaudio.</p> <p>Then he suffered the cruellest run of &#xa0;injuries and had to have three operations on his hip, one on his hip and elbow, as well as a hernia, and did not play again until last summer.</p> <p>The place has changed a little, he says. The changing room is a lot better, and there's a good gym and better cafeteria. As for his own game, he feels stronger and his serve is better.</p> <p>\"Being older, knowing how easy the game was taken away from me, it's very easy to appreciate it a lot. I don't take anything for granted. I remember several years watching it on TV wishing I was here. So just to be here is an awesome feeling.\"</p> <p>But, says Baker, \"I'm not one that's gonna try to be the saviour of US tennis or anything like that. I don't feel like we're doing poorly at all. It's just we're coming off a generation that did so well. The game is so global these days. The top three or four guys in the world are probably one of the top three or four that's ever played.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency</a> (UKBA) has revoked London Metropolitan University's power to teach or recruit international students, leaving nearly 3,000 students facing deportation unless they can find another place to study within 60 days.</p> <p>The university's vice-chancellor, Malcolm Gillies, has warned that the decision to revoke its licence to take non-EU students would create a \u00a330m loss \u2013 equal to nearly a fifth of the university's budget \u2013 and threatens the institution's future. Of the 30,000 students expected at the university in the new academic year, about 2,700 from outside the EU.</p> <p>A statement posted on the university's website on Wednesday night said: \"The implications of the revocation are hugely significant and far-reaching, and the university has already started to deal with these. It will be working very closely with the UKBA, Higher Education Funding Council for England [HEFCE], the NUS and its own students' union. Our absolute priority is to our students, both current and prospective, and the university will meet all its obligations to them.\"</p> <p>The NUS has contacted David Cameron and the home secretary, Theresa May, to \"express anger at the way that decisions have been made in recent weeks and to reiterate the potentially catastrophic effects on higher education as a \u00a312.5bn a year export industry for the UK\".</p> <p>The university's \"highly trusted status\" for sponsoring international students was suspended last month over fears that \"a small minority\" of students did not have accurate documentation.</p> <p>The revocation of this status means that any students not involved in the failures around monitoring their status will be allowed to remain in the UK and given 60 days to find a new sponsor, \"regularise their stay\" or leave the UK. Any longer stay may lead to deportation and refusal for any application to enter the country for 10 years. The Home Office guidance to universities states: \"If a student has already been given a visa when we revoke your licence, we will cancel it if they have not travelled to the UK. If they then travel to the UK, we will refuse them entry.\"</p> <p>A border agency spokesman said the decision had been made after the university \"failed to address serious and systemic failings that were identified \u2026 six months ago.\" He added: \"We have been working with them since then, but the latest audit revealed problems with 61% of files randomly sampled. Allowing London Metropolitan University to continue to sponsor and teach international students was not an option.\"</p> <p>The universities minister, David Willetts, said a taskforce led by the HEFCE and Universities UK would help overseas students affected by the decision: \"It is important that genuine students who are affected through no fault of their own are offered prompt advice and help, including, if necessary, with finding other institutions at which to finish their studies.</p> <p>The taskforce, which will also include UKBA and the NUS, will work with London Metropolitan University \"to support affected students and enable them to continue their studies in the UK\".</p> <p>In an email before the licence was revoked, Gillies appealed for help to Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, saying university leaders \"absolutely accept\" some processes on international student recruitment \"will need further adapting\".</p> <p>In a letter to Home Office minister Damian Green, Vaz said: \"While the committee is fully supportive of the government's efforts to clamp down on the abuse of student visas, and the need to follow rigorous processes, I share the vice-chancellor's concerns about the procedure in the case.\"</p> <p>Liam Burns, NUS president, said: \"It is disgusting that international students continue to be used as a political football by politicians who seem either incapable of understanding, or are simply uncaring about the impact of their decisions on individuals, universities and the UK economy.</p> <p>\"This decision will create panic and potential heartbreak for students not just at London Met but also all around the country. The needs of students must be at the heart of any process to find new places of study and NUS will be working with UUK and HEFCE to support affected students and ensure as far as possible that they can continue studying in the UK.\"</p> <p>\"Politicians need to realise that a continued attitude of suspicion towards international students could endanger the continuation of higher education as a successful export industry. This heavy-handed decision makes no sense for students, no sense for institutions and no sense for the country. This situation and the botched process by which the decision was arrived at could be avoided if international students were not included in statistics of permanent migrants.\"</p> <p>Further official information to students is available <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/adult-students/changes/\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>"
