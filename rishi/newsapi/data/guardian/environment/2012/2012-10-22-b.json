  "<p>Health experts are warning that pro-smoking smartphone apps could tempt young people to start using cigarettes after new research found that dozens of them have been downloaded millions of times.</p> <p>Researchers who uncovered the existence of such apps, some of which use cartoons, fear it is a new way for tobacco companies to exploit loopholes in restrictions on their marketing activities in order to promote their products.</p> <p>Australian researchers, writing in the medical journal Tobacco Control, say they came across 107 apps that promoted smoking in some way when they checked the Apple and Android Market app stores in February. Sixty-five were in the Apple App Store and the other 42 in Android Market's equivalent. By that month a total of about 11 million people used the 42 apps held by Android Market.</p> <p>Their paper \"identifies a new trend of promoting tobacco products in a new medium with global reach, a huge consumer base of various age groups and less strict regulation policies\", they write. The apps included images of particular brands, told users where they could buy tobacco products, provided cigarette brands' packaging to use as wallpaper on their smartphone and let users simulate smoking behaviour.</p> <p>Others replace a phone's battery icon to an image of a burning cigarette, detail how to roll a cigarette or defend smokers' rights.</p> <p>The Department of Health condemned the apps as \"disgraceful\" but said that British law may not be able to do much to combat them, as many may be produced overseas.</p> <p>The researchers, led by Nasser Bin Dihm of Sydney Medical School's school of public health, said the apps appear to be breaching the World Health Organisation's landmark framework convention on tobacco control. And they voiced concerns that apps are being misportrayed by Apple and Android Market by being available in categories labelled \"health and fitness\", \"entertainment\", \"games\" and \"lifestyle\".</p> <p>\"These apps could also easily attract teens and children due to their high-quality graphics and availability under the 'game' and 'entertainment' categories in the app stores. Pro-smoking apps that show smoking is 'cool' in a cartoon game and provide a chance to explore the available cigarette brands and even simulate the smoking experience with high quality, free apps could potentially increase teens' risk of smoking initiation\", they say.</p> <p>Professor John Britton, chair of the Royal College of Physicians' tobacco advisory group and an NHS consultant, said introducing plain packaging of cigarettes, as many medical groups argue, would lessen the apps' appeal to young people as distinctive branding would be much less familiar.</p> <p>Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said Britain should follow the example of the United States and Canada and force tobacco firms to reveal what sort of promotional activities they are undertaking and how much they are spending on each. \"The measure we have in this country to control tobacco promotion apply to 20th century techniques, not 21st century ones such as the internet and smartphones. Apps are exactly the sort of thing that will attract young people to sample tobacco products because they glamorise them,\" Arnott added.</p>",

Romney outlined revolutionary activity in the past two years in the Middle East and concluded:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have seen this struggle before. It would be familiar to George Marshall. In his time, in the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Romney believes in American exceptionalism.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is what makes America exceptional: It is not just the character of our country\u2014it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership\u2014a history that has been written by patriots of both parties.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Romney thinks the United States must \"shape history\" in the Middle East:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But it is the responsibility of our President to use America\u2019s great power to shape history\u2014not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events. Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Romney believes in total coordination of US policy with Israeli policy:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The relationship between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The President explicitly stated that his goal was to put \u201cdaylight\u201d between the United States and Israel. And he has succeeded. This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Had he been president, Romney would have blared his support for Iran's Green Revolutionaries in the summer of 2009. The Obama administration has explained its concern \u2013 shared by the majority of knowledgeable observers \u2013 that doing so would have undermined the revolution by making the protesters look like puppets beholden to the Great Satan: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, \u201cAre you with us, or are you with them?\u201d\u2014the American President was silent.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Romney would have left troops in Iraq:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And yet, America\u2019s ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried\u2014and failed\u2014to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Romney would arm the rebels in Syria:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad\u2019s tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T19:46:01.321Z\">at 8.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508591cec0e343ef1abc7e4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T18:34:54.887Z\">7.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On this the <strong>polls agree:</strong> the president is killing it on the Latino vote.

Both call for sanctions on Iran; both believe in the drone program; Romney even seems to agree with the president's plan to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014, although that hasn't stopped him from criticizing the president for naming a date.</p> <p>One policy area where the two may differ is on the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" to question terror suspects. President Obama shut down Bush's CIA \"black sites\" and prohibited the torture tactics Dick Cheney argues for to this day.</p> <p>Romney appears to favor the use of torture in some cases. His team of advisers includes figures from the Bush administration who were among the most aggressive advocates of torture.</p> <p>\"A Romney administration would risk a return to the immoral, illegal, and counterproductive policies of President George W. Bush,\" writes David Cole in the <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/election-2/?page=2\">New York Review of Books</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were painfully reminded of this prospect on September 27, when <em>The New York Times</em>&#xa0;reported on a leaked memo, written by Romney\u2019s national security advisers, urging him to advocate restoration of the&#xa0;CIA\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d i.e., to return us to the \u201cdark side\u201d of professionally administered torture and physical cruelty.</p> <p>Romney did not write the memo himself, of course, and we do not know precisely how he reacted to it. But it is consistent with his public statements, in which he has criticized President Obama for ending the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d and has maintained, against precedent and common sense, that waterboarding is not torture.</p> <p>The Romney torture memo is unsigned, but was written by members of a committee of Romney national security advisers that included Steven Bradbury, Cully Stimson, David Rivkin, and Lee Casey. These may not be household names, but they should cause alarm among those who care about the United States\u2019 commitment to the rule of law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read Cole on Bradbury's work for Bush <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/election-2/?page=2\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508585ab58f96784ee2908d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T17:43:07.664Z\">6.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Giant glaring metaphor alert:</strong> A blimp-like aircraft with a huge Romney ad on the side got into trouble in high winds in South Florida last night and crash-landed.</p> <p>\"After all it isn't every day you see something this large looming below the treeline,\" the reporter says, helpfully.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWo7G22zcEw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wWo7G22zcEw?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50857ef358f96784ee2908d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T17:14:27.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's one for the <strong>conspiracy theorists</strong>: the CBS affiliate in Arizona broadcast a graphic Friday afternoon showing that Barack Obama had been reelected president of the United States.</p> <p>The twist: the election hasn't happened yet.</p> <p>The explanation: the station was just practicing.</p> <p>The suspicious detail: why not practice with a graphic showing that Mitt Romney won?</p> <p>If you have the stomach for this sort of thing you can visit <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11103719&amp;l=d0a2d0b7dd&amp;id=24718773587\">Sarah Palin's Facebook</a> page to sample the outrage, such as this witticism from commenter Jorge Lopez Jr: \"Goes right along with their name, 'see BS.'\"</p> <p>Michele Wallace of KPHO told <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/21/cbs-news-affiliate-calls-2012-presidential-race-for-barack-obama-weeks-ahead-of-election/#ixzz2A33rRQGU\">The Daily Caller</a> it was a mistake with a test graphic:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Friday October 19th during a test of KPHO- CBS 5\u2019s election returns software we inadvertently aired a test graphic for about 15 seconds in an episode of Peoples Court.

Can anyone argue that translating the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms into workable regulations is a minor undertaking?</p> </blockquote> <p>The essay <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ej-dionne-the-not-so-hidden-obama-agenda/2012/10/21/a4280792-1ba4-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html?hpid=z11Q\">is here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50855c3658f96784ee2908ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:46:15.089Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The running mates</strong> are running hard today.

Here are the final two paragraphs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The choice is clear. The Romney-Ryan ticket represents a constricted and backward-looking vision of America: the privatization of the public good. In contrast, the sort of public investment championed by Obama\u2014and exemplified by both the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Affordable Care Act\u2014takes to heart the old civil-rights motto \u201cLifting as we climb.\u201d That effort cannot, by itself, reverse the rise of inequality that has been under way for at least three decades. But we\u2019ve already seen the future that Romney represents, and it doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p>The re\u00eblection of Barack Obama is a matter of great urgency. Not only are we in broad agreement with his policy directions; we also see in him what is absent in Mitt Romney\u2014a first-rate political temperament and a deep sense of fairness and integrity. A two-term Obama Administration will leave an enduringly positive imprint on political life. It will bolster the ideal of good governance and a social vision that tempers individualism with a concern for community. Every Presidential election involves a contest over the idea of America. Obama\u2019s America\u2014one that progresses, however falteringly, toward social justice, tolerance, and equality\u2014represents the future that this country deserves.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:35:09.411Z\">at 3.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508550a658f96784ee2908c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:09:46.434Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning and welcome to our Monday live blog politics coverage.

  "<p>Amid admissions that cycling was facing its worst crisis \u2013 and even debate over whether it could survive \u2013 the UCI president, Pat McQuaid, in increasingly ragged attempts to draw a line under the blighted Lance Armstrong saga and move on, included one statement that spoke volumes. It was a defensive response to a query about whether the UCI could remain both policeman and promoter of the sport and it cut to the heart of the debate about what a sport's governing body should be and whether it is inherently conflicted when it comes to tackling doping.</p> <p>Asked whether the promotional and regulatory functions of cycling should be formally split, McQuaid said: \"I don't see why we should. We are responsible for the regulation, the development and the promotion of cycling worldwide. That includes anti-doping.\"</p> <p>From amid the alphabet soup of international federations, national governing bodies, national anti-doping organisations and law enforcement agencies, the World Anti-Doping Agency must somehow corral a coherent approach to the issue.</p> <p>While Wada, which has an annual budget of \u00a317.8m from national governments and the Olympic movement, can provide a framework for the rules it is largely down to federations and individual countries to enforce them.</p> <p>David Howman, the Wada director general, has conceded that the set-up is far from ideal. \"The model we've got is the one we've got and it's not going to be changed in a hurry. It's not perfect,\" he said. \"We acknowledge the imperfections and try and work with them.\"</p> <p>Other clashes between governing bodies and Wada down the years \u2013 most recently with Fifa, the world football governing body, and other team sports over its \"whereabouts\" out-of-competition testing programme \u2013 highlight the frustrations.</p> <p>The United States Anti-Doping Agency report made uncomfortable reading for McQuaid. It repeated allegations, strongly denied by the UCI, from Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton that, when Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel visited its headquarters in Aigle in May 2002 to offer $100,000 to help the development of cycling, they were doing so in order to buy its silence. McQuaid admitted accepting donations totalling $125,000 from Armstrong's camp in 2002 and 2007 but strongly denied there were any conditions attached.</p> <p>The UCI president attempted to draw a distinction between Armstrong's imperial phase between 1998 and 2005, before he was president, and afterwards \u2013 claiming there was no evidence to suggest that Armstrong had been doping when he came back to the sport in 2009 and 2010. And yet the Usada report says that there was a \"one in a million\" chance of Armstrong's blood profile occurring naturally. Moreover, it said, expert examination of his blood values \"build a compelling argument consistent with blood doping\".</p> <p>That dual role also makes McQuaid's insistence that there was nothing untoward in accepting a donation from Armstrong in 2002 hard to square while the current regime remain in place. Even taking its strong denials of any impropriety into account, he faced inevitable questions over the wisdom of accepting such large donations from the very athletes it is supposed to be policing.</p> <p>The Irishman said himself that the UCI's relatively impoverished state \u2013 \"we don't have billions in the bank like Fifa\" \u2013 made it reliant on donations such as that from Armstrong. He also said he was not about to stop associating with the sport's biggest names just in case it came back to bite him.</p> <p>Challenged as to whether it should have taken the money when there were already suspicions about drug use, McQuaid fell back on the explanation that Armstrong had never failed a test. Which, given that the organisation had just banned him for life and stripped him of his titles on the basis of a damning report that does not rely on tests for its proof, seemed a little inconsistent.</p> <p>In the fall-out from Ben Johnson's demise \u2013 perhaps the only individual fall from grace comparable in impact to Armstrong's \u2013 it was widely debated whether the sport had, consciously or not, turned a blind eye to the fact that one of its biggest names had exhibited a pattern of behaviour consistent with doping.</p> <p>The methods may be more subtle and harder to detect these days. McQuaid admitted in his press conference that it was only during the London Paralympics that an effective test of Human Growth Hormone had become available, while a test for blood transfusions of an athlete's own blood remains some way off.</p> <p>But McQuaid also pointed out, with some justification, that it was not the UCI or Usada that ultimately did for Armstrong but a federal investigation in the US.Once a gun and a badge were placed on the table, it finally broke the code of omerta.</p> <p>Other major drug conspiracies \u2013 notably the Balco scandal \u2013 have only unravelled once law enforcement agencies have become involved.</p> <p>That is why Wada has been talking for some time about increasing the focus on so-called \"non-analytic\" or evidence-based findings. But for that to happen it will need large resources and unashamed co-operation from the biggest sports governing bodies, not to mention the police and politicians. And, of course, money.</p> <p>\"The global sport industry is presently generating somewhere in the region of $500bn [\u00a3312bn] in annual revenues, against which the annual budget for the fight against doping in sport pales into insignificance,\" said Wada in its last annual report.</p> <p>\"I [the chairman, John Fahey] would suggest that it may be time for this sector to assume more of the responsibility for protecting athletes from doping and defending the integrity of all sports and, by extension, all leagues\" \u2013 the implicit point being that, if international federations are happy to take responsibility, they ought also to invest the necessary time, focus and cash in catching the cheats \u2013 whatever the consequences.</p>",
  "<p>It's the crucial final debate of the 2012 presidential campaign, and one man may have every right to be anxious about how his performance goes down on Monday night. Not the candidates, but Bob Schieffer, the moderator.</p> <p>A common theme of the three debates so far has been the criticism moderators have faced for their performance \u2013 being variously accused of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/05/jim-lehrer-on-debate-mode_n_1941335.html\">not interrupting enough</a>, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/17/Crowley-interrupts-28-times-Romney\">interrupting too much</a>, and having invited <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/10/abc-news-scrambles-to-cover-up-barack-obamas-attendance-at-vp-debate-moderators-wedding/\">the wrong people to their wedding</a>.</p> <p>When Schieffer becomes the latest high-profile journalist to enter the lion's den on Monday night, he will open himself up to similar vitriol from Republicans and Democrats scrutinizing every second of the debate for signs of bias.</p> <p>The good news is, Schieffer has been here before. The veteran host of CBS's Face the Nation has been in journalism for half a century, and moderated presidential debates in 2004 and 2008. But even he might be surprised by some of the venom directed at contemporaries Jim Lehrer and Candy Crowley.</p> <p>Crowley, the chief political correspondent at CNN, was variously accused of having <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/act-of-jouranlistic-terror-limbaugh-rips-candy-crowleys-moderator-performance/\">\"committed an act of journalistic terror\"</a> (Rush Limbaugh) to having committed an act similar to <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/video/2012/10/18/tucker-carlson-compares-cnns-candy-crowley-to-j/190724\">John Wilkes Booth assassinating Abraham Lincoln</a> (the Daily Caller's Tucker Carlson) when she fact-checked Romney in Tuesday's debate.</p> <p>ABC's Martha Raddatz, moderating the vice-presidential debate, faced inquiries into her <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/10/abc-news-scrambles-to-cover-up-barack-obamas-attendance-at-vp-debate-moderators-wedding/\">wedding in 1991</a>, where a certain Barack Obama was among the guests as a friend of her husband, Julius Genachowski. (Raddatz and Genachowski divorced in 1997).</p> <p>Lehrer, who arguably did not put in his best performance as he hosted his twelfth presidential debate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/jim-lehrer-debate-sucked\">faced widespread criticism</a>, descriptions of his performance ranging from \"practically useless\" to \"a bit overwhelmed\".</p> <p>But Schieffer's huge experience reporting on Washington means he should certainly be well placed to chair Tuesday's debate in Boca Raton, Florida, and his easygoing demeanour should mean he is able to handle any criticism that comes thereafter.</p> <p>Schieffer, 75, grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, and attending Texas Christian University before serving in the US air force. He joined the Fort Worth-Star Telegram upon leaving the military, <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/154064/schieffer-i-would-become-a-footnote-of-sorts-in-jfk-assassination-story/how\">with one of his first big scoops coming in 1963</a>, when John F Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.</p> <p>Schieffer was the night police reporter that evening, and d<a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/172893/how-2-twentysomething-journalists-brought-down-a-corrupt-kentucky-sheriff/\">escribed in an article for Poynter</a> how, amid the newsroom bedlam in the wake of Kennedy's shooting, he grabbed a ringing phone to find a woman ask: \"Is there anyone there who can give me a ride to Dallas?\"</p> <p>It was Lee Harvey Oswald's mother. Schieffer obliged, collecting Marguerite Oswald and driving her to the police station, where police took him to be a \"young detective\" and agreed to allow Schieffer to speak to the suspect. After waiting for six hours, an FBI agent finally asked Schieffer why he was there, only to be \"not amused to discover I was a reporter\".</p> <p>\"I never got that scoop but over the years there would be more stories to write about the Kennedys,\" Schieffer said. He moved from the Star-Telegram into local television and was later hired by CBS, first as a general reporter, then moving into national politics.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/10/21/4351062/for-debate-bob-schieffer-has-the.html\">In an interview with his former newspaper on Friday</a> Schieffer lamented the fact that \"people pay too much attention to moderators\" in the current environment.</p> <p>\"We're like the umpires. You only hear criticism from the losing team,\" Schieffer said.</p> <p>\"These debates are not about what the candidates say. People are watching to judge character.</p> <p>\"I don't think it matters what the questions are about \u2013 what matters is how candidates answer. Do they seem in control? \u2026 I'm just there to help the viewers get a better understanding of who these people are.\"</p> <p>Schieffer has stayed with the political beat for over 40 years, first serving as White House correspondent, then chief Washington correspondent before becoming the anchor of Face the Nation in 1991.</p> <p>While it is \"an honour to be asked\" to moderate the debate, Schieffer <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/entertainment/television/a-qa-with-cbs-bob-schieffer-on-the-lynn-debate/nShRR/\">lamented the partisanship</a> in American politics in an interview with Florida's Palm Beach Post over the weekend.</p> <p>\"Now we have people who want news from a conservative slant or a liberal slant, and they go to different places. It's a rare thing when we get our information from the same place,\" Schieffer said, adding that was why it was so important that both sides can use the debates to see the opposing candidates on the same stage.</p> <p>\"Because the partisan divide is deeper than I ever remember it,\" Schieffer said. \"A deep, deep divide, and I've been in Washington 43 years.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last week the Metropolitan police announced a criminal investigation into allegations that the white-haired, cigar-chomping BBC radio and television presenter Jimmy Savile had groomed and abused underage girls through much of his 40-year career. With 200 potential victims recorded so far and some 400 leads to follow up, the flood of allegations points to sexual abuse \"on an unprecedented scale\", Scotland Yard said.</p> <p>The corporation has now opened inquiries into the culture at the BBC that allowed Savile to commit his alleged crimes \u2013 some of them on BBC premises. It is also looking into whether an investigation by current affairs programme Newsnight into the rumours that had long circulated around the star was pulled in order to suppress the truth ahead of planned tributes to Savile elsewhere on the BBC. This could well prove to be the most damaging aspect of the whole affair.</p> <p>As the scandal threatens to spread to the very top of the corporation, some of its most senior staff have criticised the way the BBC has handled it. The veteran foreign affairs editor John Simpson in particular has warned that \"all we have as an organisation is the trust of the people that watch us and listen to us, and if we don't have that \u2026 that's very dangerous.\" The episode, he said, amounts to \"the worst crisis that I can remember in my nearly 50 years at the BBC\".</p> <p>But the BBC's history has been punctuated by scandals since its inception in 1922 \u2013 some storms-in-teacups brewed by its enemies, others genuine and seriously damaging.</p> <h2><strong>The Christmas tree affair: cold war vetting</strong></h2> <p>Security vetting of editorial appointees was introduced at the BBC as early as 1937, an understandable precaution in wartime and even, given widely felt anti-Soviet paranoia, during the early years of the cold war. But the practice, shockingly, continued until 1986, when it was finally halted following considerable public and union pressure, triggered by the Observer's revelation the previous year that a retired army officer called Brigadier Ronnie Stonham was employed to vet potential BBC appointees including graduate trainees, journalists, editors, directors and producers \u2013 a process informally known as \"colleging\" or \"the formalities\".</p> <p>The screening aimed to weed out potential political \"subversives\". Unsuccessful applicants' security files were stamped with a triangular green tag known as the \"Christmas tree\" on the grounds, for example, that they \"had a subscription to the Daily Worker\" or \"associated with communists and CND activists\". Among those who fell foul of the policy were folk singer Ewan MacColl, theatre director Joan Littlewood, children's writer Michael Rosen, journalist Isabel Hilton and Roland Joff\u00e9, who later directed The Killing Fields.</p> <h2><strong>The Milne-Thatcher feud</strong></h2> <p>Alasdair Milne was director general of the BBC from 1982 until 1987. A respected senior programme maker, he had worked on the irreverent and controversial satire That Was the Week That Was, founded the now-legendary current affairs programme Tonight, and was not a man to take any attempts to interfere with the BBC's editorial independence lightly.</p> <p>Unfortunately, his tenure coincided with the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. The BBC and the government clashed repeatedly, and at times heatedly, over the corporation's impartiality \u2013 or alleged lack of it \u2013 during the Milne years. Highlights involved Newsnight's reporting of the Falklands war, a 1983 Nationwide general-election special with Thatcher and the coverage of the 1984-85 miners' strike. Two particular incidents stand out. Soon after Thatcher's declaration that terrorists should be starved of the \"oxygen of publicity\", the BBC's Real Lives documentary series interviewed a senior Republican paramilitary for an episode titled At the Edge of the Union. The then home secretary, Leon Brittan, said transmission would be \"against the national interest\" and, to the fury of BBC staff, the corporation's governors ruled it should not go out.</p> <p>The fracas followed hard on the heels of a confrontation over the 1984 Panorama programme Maggie's Militant Tendency probing alleged extreme rightwing elements on the backbenches of the Tory party; two MPs, Neil Hamilton and Gerald Howarth, subsequently sued the BBC, which eventually capitulated, paying each \u00a320,000 plus legal cost and issuing an unreserved apology.</p> <p>Panorama's reporting of the US bombing of Libya and the controversy over Duncan Campbell's Secret Society series, which included an episode revealing that \u00a3500m of unauthorised military intelligence spending on a Zircon spy satellite had been concealed from parliament, only exacerbated matters. Thatcher eventually appointed Marmaduke Hussey, a former chief executive of the Times, to chair the BBC's board of governors in late 1986; Hussey demanded \u2013 and got \u2013 Milne's resignation in January 1987.</p> <h2><strong>Kelly and Hutton: the 'sexed-up' dossier</strong><br></h2> <p>In May 2003 the Today programme's defence correspondent, Andrew Gilligan, quoted an unnamed government official saying the government had \"sexed up\" a dossier about the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, Gilligan identified Tony Blair's communications director, Alastair Campbell, as the man responsible. The government denied the allegation and relations between it and the BBC soured dramatically; Dr David Kelly, a defence ministry scientist, killed himself after being named as the alleged source of Gilligan's original report.</p> <p>In January 2004, the Hutton inquiry into Kelly's death cleared the government of all wrongdoing but was savage in its criticism of the BBC, slamming Gilligan himself, the corporation's management procedures and its \"defective\" editorial processes. Amid an almost complete breakdown in relations between the government and the corporation, the BBC's chairman, Gavyn Davies, and its director-general, Greg Dyke, resigned. Many media voices, meanwhile, denounced the report as a whitewash, arguing that Hutton had consistently accepted the government's version of events and failed to recognise that journalism could not be expected always to be perfect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398183590\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/22/1350926064577/Blue-Peter-presenters-Zoe-010.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Peter presenters Zoe Salmon holding Socks (left) and Konnie Huq with new kitten Cookie.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue Peter presenters Zoe Salmon holding Socks (left) and Konnie Huq with new kitten Cookie.

Just under a year later, the industry regulator Ofcom fined the corporation \u00a350,000 \u2013 the first time it had imposed such a penalty on the BBC \u2013 for faking the phone-in's outcome: almost 40,000 children had called the show but none had stood a chance of winning because of a technical problem on the line. A girl visiting the studio was asked to pose as a winning caller. It was the tip of an iceberg: Comic Relief and Children in Need also turned out to have made up competition winners.</p> <p>The BBC was accused of misleading viewers and breaching audience trust, allegations levelled again at the corporation when, that same year, it emerged that an internet vote to choose the name of the new Blue Peter cat had chosen the name Cookie, but the show's producers had changed the result to Socks. A kitten, Cookie, was later acquired to appease viewers.</p> <h2><strong>Did the Queen really 'storm off'?</strong></h2> <p>In July 2007, a 60-second trailer for a behind-the-scenes documentary about the monarchy titled The Royal Family at Work was aired at the launch of the BBC's autumn schedule. It contained two clips of the Queen refusing to take her crown off during a photo shoot with Annie Leibowitz, and telling the celebrity photographer that she would \"not change anything. I've done enough dressing like this\". The effect was to make it look as if the Queen had stalked off the set of the shoot, an interpretation reinforced by the BBC1 controller, Peter Fincham, who said the Queen had \"lost it a bit and walked out in a huff\". In fact, the clips were edited out of order by the show's makers, an independent production company: the second clip was shot as the Queen was actually entering the room. Fincham resigned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398183591\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/22/1350926128982/Russell-Brand-and-Jonatha-010.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross. Photograph: ENTERPRISE NEWS AND PICTURES</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ENTERPRISE NEWS AND PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Brand/Ross phone prank: Sachsgate</strong></h2> <p>In October 2008, comedian and BBC Radio 2 host Russell Brand, along with TV presenter Jonathan Ross, made a number of calls to the home of the actor Andrew Sachs, leaving a series of messages on his answerphone to the effect that that Brand had slept with Sachs's granddaughter, Georgina Baillie. Several days later, the Mail on Sunday featured the story prominently, prompting a record number of complaints \u2013 many from people who had not in fact listened to the programme concerned \u2013 and fierce criticism of the two presenters and the BBC's editorial decision-making process from some commentators and politicians, including the then prime minister, Gordon Brown. Ross was suspended without pay and Brand resigned, as did the widely respected controller of Radio 2, Lesley Douglas. Ofcom again fined the BBC \u2013 \u00a3150,000 this time.</p> <h2><strong>Disaster appeals, age/ sexism, Top Gear and the jubilee: recent criticism</strong></h2> <p>In recent years, the BBC has also taken flak from politicians and religious leaders over its refusal, on the grounds of maintaining impartiality, to screen an appeal from the Disasters Emergency Committee to raise money for victims of conflict in the Gaza strip. The dismissal of a number of older women presenters, notably Moira Stewart, Miriam O'Reilly and Arlene Phillips, has led to loud calls of institutional sexism and ageism. The insult-fest that is Top Gear has got into trouble on many occasions, particularly for its description of Mexicans, while coverage of the diamond jubilee river pageant was variously slammed as dumbed-down, celebrity obsessed, \"mind-numbingly tedious\" and \"lamentable\".</p> <p>So in the context of all that, just how bad is the Savile scandal? Guardian columnist and presenter of the BBC's Media Show Steve Hewlett, who does not often shy away from criticising the corporation, believes it is probably not, thus far, quite as serious as, say, Maggie's Militant Tendency or the catastrophic fallout from the Gilligan item.</p> <p>\"First,\" he says, \"the environment is much more benign at the moment \u2013 [the government] may be Tories, but they are not Thatcherites. Fleet Street is full of cant, but that's Fleet Street.\" But also, Hewlett points out, \"in Maggie's Militant Tendency, they broadcast something they couldn't substantiate. With this, they haven't broadcast something they could perhaps substantiate.\"</p> <p>On the question of the pulled Newsnight investigation, Hewlett believes the truth may be \"really quite mundane. What I think probably happened is that the editor simply lost confidence in the story at some point. He thought: what have I really got here? And decided it wasn't enough.\"</p> <p>Of course, what would elevate Savilegate to a very serious and potentially very damaging crisis \"would be if it emerged that corporate interest had infected the journalism. That's pretty much the cardinal sin. We don't pay our licence fees for that to happen.\" But, Hewlett says, \"there's no evidence to show that's what happened. The two key charges \u2013 that corporate infected editorial, and the new director general George Entwhistle was somehow implicated \u2013 really seem unlikely to me.\"</p> <p>Kevin Marsh disagrees about the size of the scandal. A former editor of PM, the World at One and \u2013 during the Gilligan saga \u2013 the Today programme, he believes Savilegate is \"potentially bigger than both Maggie's Militant Tendency and Hutton. It's not about politics, it's about things people care about: celebrity, child abuse, trust. I don't know how it will play out yet. But in terms of public perception, this may yet prove to be bigger.\" Perhaps, even, in a long history of scandals, the BBC's biggest ever.</p>",
  "<p>With seismic changes planned for school exams and undergraduate fee increases still fresh, the government might have hoped to keep postgraduate issues tucked safely away in a study. But it would do so at the UK's peril, suggests a report to be published next week.</p> <p>In it, the Higher Education Commission, a cross-party group of MPs and representatives from business and academia, paints a dire picture of the country's economic future and global position unless postgraduate education is \"brought in from the cold\" and treated as part of a holistic vision for education.</p> <p>It describes postgraduates as \"the new frontier of widening participation\", arguing that while postgraduate qualifications are increasingly becoming the norm for many professions and careers, higher undergraduate fees and banks' unwillingness to offer loans make this level of study less and less accessible for poorer or debt-averse students.</p> <p>\"If we don't pay attention \u2026 this area of education will be closed to some people because of cost and accessibility,\" says Graham Spittle, chair of the commission. \"We will probably not be able to grow the indigenous talent we need to staff our universities, which, if you like, are the factories that groom the next generation. We are probably hindering ourselves from getting the strong technical leaders and entrepreneurs that society is going to need \u2013 that we're all going to need \u2013 in the future.\"</p> <p>The commission, he says, found clear evidence that students did not want to increase their level of debt by going on to postgraduate study and some had already decided against it for that reason.</p> <p>Referring to postgraduate education as a \"social-mobility timebomb\", the report echoes Alan Milburn, former Labour minister, now government adviser, who called last week for universities to make more efforts to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Milburn used the same phrase in an <a href=\"http://www.hecsu.ac.uk/current_projects_graduate_market_trends.htm\" title=\"\">interview with the Higher Education Careers Services Unit's magazine</a> earlier this year, adding: \"Everyone agrees that nobody should be barred from undergraduate education because they can't afford fees, and yet we completely accept this barrier when it comes to postgraduate education. The fact is, postgraduate education is not a luxury for the individual, it is a necessity for our economy and wider society.\" His fear was that the problem required money and there was not much of that around.</p> <p>The commission's report says to avoid spending on postgraduates would be a false economy, warning that \"education and skills is one of the key fronts on which the battle to maintain competitiveness will be fought\", with India, China and South Korea proving an increasing threat.</p> <p>Spittle says: \"Some of this will cost money, but the opportunity cost is unbelievable given that we want to become a skills-based economy. I think we have no choice but to pay attention to this area. It doesn't all have to be funded out of the public purse, but we need to strategically make choices as a country about what we are doing here and not just let market forces take their effect.\"</p> <p>The report agrees with Milburn's proposals last week that some kind of postgraduate loan scheme is needed, and goes further, calling for a taskforce to be set up immediately to look into how it might work, reporting by December next year with a view to having something in place by September 2015, when the first undergraduates to pay \u00a39,000 tuition fees will be graduating. This should please students, who have been looking for clear recognition that financial help for postgraduates is urgently needed.</p> <p>There are even suggestions of different loan schemes that could be considered, including one drafted by Tim Leunig, now an adviser to the education secretary, Michael Gove, which could help propel the idea through parliament.</p> <p>In the long term, the report suggests, undergraduate and postgraduate funding should be integrated. It also proposes that future postgraduate applications should be processed, like those of undergraduates, through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. This would make it easier to monitor admissions data, including information about the socio-economic backgrounds of students.</p> <p>This idea of a more seamless sector is perhaps not surprising from a commission specifically set up to take a broad, strategic view. This is its first report and it will decide at a meeting this week what to tackle next.</p> <p>Postgraduates were chosen as the first area to look at because they were seen as a neglected part of the sector, in spite of a review carried out just over two years ago by Adrian Smith, now vice-chancellor of the University of London. This identified a need for more information about postgraduates and called for Lord Browne to consider how they should be funded in his report on student finance, then in the pipeline.</p> <p>In the event, Lord Browne's report hardly touched on this part of the sector, and the Smith review was largely overtaken by a change of government and the impact of higher undergraduate fees, although there has been much more emphasis since on postgraduate data collection.</p> <p>Spittle says that nothing in the commission's report contradicts Smith's review but \"the world is a very different place\". \"We refer to a perfect storm facing students today. And that is something that is new and was not around three years ago.\"</p> <p>What has also changed is the government's stance on immigration, with tougher visa regulations making it harder for postgraduates to stay on after they finish their studies and the government's pledge to reduce immigration to \"tens of thousands a year\".</p> <p>The commission warns that the higher education sector would be \"significantly damaged, particularly at postgraduate level,\" were this pledge realised, with many courses in strategically important disciplines relying on international students to remain viable. It predicts course and even departmental closures and long-term damage to British research capacity and competitiveness, and calls for students to be removed from the immigration cap completely.</p> <p>Recent proposals by the universities minister, David Willetts, to produce disaggregated immigration figures for students are not enough, it says, warning of a \"climate of uncertainty for prospective and current international students which does not inspire confidence for those considering investing in a British university education\", not helped by 14 changes to student immigration regulations since 2009. It is also concerned that making it harder for postgraduates to stay on after their degrees means the UK is in effect training its competitors, becoming \"the education outsourcing capital of the world\".</p> <p>The commission has strong words for the government but there remain question marks over whether it will have any teeth. Spittle says he has spoken to Willetts about the report and, while he is non-committal about the minister's reaction, says he is \"optimistic\" that it will lead to action because of the broad spread of opinion it reflects \u2013 from politicians on all sides of both Houses of Parliament, students, universities and business \u2013 and the degree of consensus reached.</p> <p>He also believes the time is right. \"I&#xa0;think we have to look at the whole system end to end, starting with young children, all the way through their schooling, through university, to right at the high end of that process,\" he says.</p> <p>As chief technology officer of IBM and a former chair of the Technology Strategy Board, with an MA in geography from Edinburgh University, Spittle says systems thinking shows that actions taken early on in a cycle have a significant impact down the line. \"I don't think this is a minority game,\" he says. \"I think this is a very important part of the UK economy. I think it's also a very important part of social mobility.\"</p>",

  "<p>The demand to the board from many BP shareholders was loud and clear \u2013 when getting out of TNK-BP, make sure you maximise the cash proceeds and minimise the number of Rosneft shares you accept as part-payment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/22/bp-rosneft-deal-27-billion-dollars\" title=\"\">BP has done the opposite</a>. It will end up owning almost 20% of Rosneft and has even agreed to buy a 5.66% slug from the Russian government at 12% above the market price; the overpayment amounts to $500m extra for the Kremlin, hardly a trivial sum even the context of a $27bn transaction. Overall, some $12.3bn will return to London in cash \u2013 nice to have, but less than hoped for.</p> <p>Given the backdrop, you might have assumed that BP chief executive Bob Dudley would seek to reassure the doubters by talking up the exciting exploration adventures to be undertaken in the Arctic with Rosneft. But there were no new Arctic ambitions to report. Maybe they will follow once the oligarchs at AAR, the other half-owner of TNK-BP, are safely off the scene.</p> <p>Instead Dudley asked BP shareholders to consider Rosneft purely as a wonderful investment opportunity: \"Rosneft is a company working to become a global leader in the sector. It is developing its substantial asset base with new technologies and improving its management processes and corporate governance. As a major investor BP looks forward to being able to contribute to Rosneft's success and add value through our participation on the board.\"</p> <p>Okay, the arrangements may turn out to be mutually beneficial for many decades if the Kremlin, which will still own 69.5% of the stock, really has decided that it wants Rosneft to adopt western-style governance and practices. In that case, BP's timing in aligning itself with Russia's oil champion may be perfect and Rosneft's share price, asleep for the past half-decade, may awaken.</p> <p>On the other hand, nobody would pretend that life as a minority shareholder in a President Putin-controlled company will be a bed of roses. BP will appoint two directors to Rosneft's nine-strong board. That's better than having only a token representative but can hardly be viewed as a solid power base in the event of quarrels.</p> <p>Dudley's hands, to some degree, were tied since the option of a clean cash exit from Russia was never on the table. A foreign oil company that invested $8bn in 2003 and has taken out $19bn in dividends (BP's record at TNK-BP) would not then be allowed to wave goodbye to the country with a further $27bn lump sum. Some form of new partnership with the state was inevitable.</p> <p>This deal, then, may be the best that BP could achieve. But tying up $15bn of capital \u2013 more than 10% of BP's market value \u2013 in a single illiquid stock is a big punt. Come back in a decade to learn whether a Rosneft revolution happened.</p>",
  "<p>Last March banker Greg Smith delivered a broadside to his former bosses at Goldman Sachs. The morally outraged banker could take no more of the bank's \"toxic and destructive\" environment, he said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/14/goldman-sachs-director-quits-morally-bankrupt\" title=\"\">via the New York Times' editorial page</a>. But it was the muppets that caught everyone's attention.</p> <p>With the financial crisis still rocking the world and bankers held up as public enemy number one, Smith claimed Goldman bankers branded clients \"muppets\" \u2013 a derogatory term in British English \u2013 and secretly despised them as they ripped them off.</p> <p>It was explosive stuff. A reported $1.5m (\u00a3935,000) advance followed and on Monday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9781455527472/why-i-left-goldman-sachs-a-wall-street-story\" title=\"\">Why I Left Goldman Sachs</a> hit the shelves following <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50133578n\" title=\"\">a plug on 60 Minutes</a>, one of America's most popular news shows.</p> <p>But now the early reviews are in and it looks like Smith's turn to be called a muppet. William Cohan, author of the definitive Goldman Sachs history Money and Power, has blasted Smith as a \"hypocrite\", his facts are being questioned and the bank has cast Smith as a disgruntled one percenter who turned nasty after his bosses turned down his call for a $1m bonus.</p> <p>A lot of the book is a rehash of Goldman's recent troubled history that could have been done from newspaper reports. There's some stuff about Smith's once promising table tennis career (no joke) and his career struggles. There's a topless woman in a hot tub in Las Vegas (just the one?) but little else in the way of sex \u2013 unless you count the revelation that Goldman's boss Lloyd Blankfein likes to \"air-dry\" by walking around the bank's gym locker room naked. Gordon Gekko's Wall Street it ain't.</p> <p>Smith doesn't help his cause with a book that is remarkably short on details of wrongdoing \u2013 and the few it does contain have been challenged. Problems set in at the beginning with an anecdote about his apprenticeship in Goldman's tough 10-week internship programme. One intern \"starts to tear up and runs out of the room\" after a grilling about Microsoft stock. Another flounders badly as he is quizzed about \"risk arbitrage\". Smith then reveals that the intern, \"Josh\", is the son of a billionaire \"and one of the most powerful financiers in the world\".</p> <p>In the New York Times, James Stewart, best-selling author of Den of Thieves and other titles, challenges Smith's account. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/business/why-i-left-book-about-goldman-falls-short.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">In a damning review headlined: A Tell-All on Goldman Has Little Worth Telling</a>, Stewart says the only billionaire's son in Smith's intern programme was Teddy Schwarzman, son of Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the asset management firm Blackstone Group and certainly \"one of the most powerful financiers in the world\".</p> <p>\"I was never grilled on risk arbitrage, or asked to give a presentation on it,\" Schwarzman told Stewart. \"I realise it was a long time ago, but I would certainly have remembered it if I had floundered.\" Stewart said no one in the class that he spoke to could recall such an episode.</p> <p>Later Smith talks of a town hall meeting in London \u2013 a meeting that he says was instrumental in his decision to quit his $500,000-$750,000 a year job. \"What is the firm doing to address the fact that the culture is dying and our reputation is deteriorating?\" asks one woman. \"Absolute silence followed,\" he writes.</p> <p>In fact the questioner asks about the \"perception\" that the culture is deteriorating, according to audio heard by the Guardian. There is a short pause before the Goldman execs answer with some banalities but hardly \"absolute silence\".</p> <p>According to Goldman, Smith's town hall hero is the same woman that only a few pages earlier Smith describes as a \"vicious boss\" nicknamed the \"Black Widow\" for her \"penchant for trying to get colleagues fired\".</p> <p>Unsurprisingly Goldman has its own harsh critique of Smith's account. An internal review of Goldman's emails found 99.7% of references to \"muppets\" were related to 2011's outing for the puppet characters in which Miss Piggy, Kermit and Co reunite to save their old theatre from a greedy oil tycoon.</p> <p>The bank also said it undertook peer review polls and said Smith's average rating of his colleagues was nine \u2013 the highest mark on their nine-point scale.</p> <p>\"We thoroughly reviewed Greg's claims and found no evidence whatsoever to support them,\" said Jake Siewert, Goldman's corporate communications chief. \"We were hampered by the fact that there was little that was specific. We found no evidence that he raised concerns while at the bank but he did express concerns about his career.\"</p> <p>For Cohan the problem with Smith's book is that it is a morality tale that doesn't work: \"He spent 12 years taking their money and suddenly the scales fall from his eyes?\"</p> <p>According to Cohan Goldman has been rife with conflicts of interest throughout its 143-year history. \"This is not a charitable institution,\" he said. He said it was \"hypocritical\" of Smith to take Goldman's salary, complain about his bonus and then turn around and kick his former employer. \"Wall Street has huge problems and he is exhibit A,\" said Cohan.</p>",
  "<p>The Green party's presidential candidate has called Barack Obama a \"climate denier\" for failing to talk about climate change during the elections.</p> <p>On the eve of the third and final presidential debate, the Green party's <a href=\"http://www.jillstein.org/\" title=\"\">Jill Stein</a> said Obama's failure to speak out about environmental concerns made him virtually identical to Republicans who deny the human causes of global warming.</p> <p>The absence of climate change from the elections, after a year of record temperatures, wildfires and drought, has hugely frustrated environmental campaigners.</p> <p>Obama and Mitt Romney, who has expressed doubt about the human causes of climate change and the viability of renewable energy such as wind power, have failed to address the issue in their last two presidential debates.</p> <p>But no campaigner has gone as far as Stein, who said Obama was \"another climate denier who basically sold out with just a little bit of window dressing\".</p> <p>When challenged about the use of the word \"denier\", Stein said: \"We sure didn't hear him talking about climate in his debate. In either of these debates we don't hear him talking about climate and the devastation of it. Whether he is a denier or just a silencer, he has certainly silenced any discussion of the issue that would motivate real solutions.\"</p> <p>Stein, a Harvard-trained doctor, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/hofstra-debate-jill-stein-arrested-green-party_n_1971960.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\" title=\"\">was arrested trying to gain entry to last week's presidential debate</a>. Her arrest has focused attention on the exclusion of third-party candidates from such events.</p> <p>The Green party is on the ballot in 38 states, but is still polling at only about 2%. It is still viewed negatively by many on the left for its role in costing Al Gore the 2000 election.</p> <p>When the third and last presidential debate takes place on Monday night, Stein will be in San Francisco taking part in a virtual debate with other third-party candidates in a forum hosted by Amy Goodman's <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/\" title=\"\">Democracy Now</a>.</p> <p>Obama and Romney have yet to face a direct question on climate change in the debates, and they have given scant attention to environmental concerns, even during their long and heated exchange on oil drilling and gas prices during last week's debate.</p> <p>Obama, far from touting his biggest green achievement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/29/barack-obama-fuel-economy-standards\" title=\"\">raising car mileage standards</a>, used the debate to talk up his support for oil and coal.</p> <p>\"It is outrageous they will not even mention this devastating reality we are facing,\" said Stein, ticking off the growing evidence of climate change in the widespread US drought and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">unprecedented melting in the Arctic</a>. \"The climate catastrophe that used to be generations away is rapidly closing in on us.\"</p> <p>The larger environmental groups have hesitated to criticise Obama very openly for fear of costing him votes during an increasingly close election. Environmental groups are mainly supporting Obama and Democratic candidates for Congress in these elections.</p> <p>In Stein's view that too is a mistake. Obama has failed to live up to his 2008 campaign promise to save a \"planet in peril\", she said. \"I wasn't fooled by Obama then. I was not persuaded and a lot of other people were. The talk is very different from the walk,\" she said. \"These last four years have been drill baby drill and far worse. Obama's adopted the fossil fuel policies of George Bush and done far worse,\" she said.</p> <p>A second Obama term, Stein said, would amount to \"climate devastation with a friendly face and a warm endearing personality\".</p> <p>She went on to argue that a Romney victory in November would not be that great a loss for the environment - despite the Republican's promises to do away with environmental protections and Obama's moves to curb coal plant emissions.</p> <p>Stein, who is from Massachusetts, has direct experience of a Romney administration from his time as governor there. \"Flip-flopping is his downfall, but it is also his political instinct to go with the squeaky wheel,\" she said.

Click here to view</a></p> <p>On 29 April 1986, three days after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2011/apr/26/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Reactor Unit 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power station went into meltdown and exploded</a>, Vladimir Shevchenko gained access to the site and filmed the ongoing disaster. He shot some of his film from a helicopter, passing directly over the burning reactor. Viewing his footage later, Shevchenko discovered that portions of it were seriously degraded. At first he thought the film stock was faulty; it turned out that the aberrant flashes and blips, and the static on the soundtrack, were the invisible crackles of radiation itself, made visible on the photographic emulsion. Those who were at Chernobyl at the time said that they could feel the radiation, like pins and needles on their skin.</p> <p>Shevchenko, along with the film and the 35mm Konvas Avtomat camera he used, had all been irradiated. The Ukrainian film-maker died a year later, and his camera is now sealed in a lead-lined casket at a storage facility outside Kiev. Chernobyl's reactor is itself entombed in its own sarcophagus. Shevchenko's film, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbCcutzXzYg\" title=\"\">Chernobyl: A&#xa0;Chronicle of Difficult Weeks</a>, has since been described as the most dangerous roll of film in the world. It is now showing on a monitor <a href=\"http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whatson/exhibitions/jane-and-louise-wilson/\" title=\"\">at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester</a>, alongside Jane and Louise Wilson's most recent film installation, The Toxic Camera. This focuses on Shevchenko's story, and takes us to the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, as well as to the strange, brutal, abandoned military structures that stand on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jul/08/untrue-island-orford-ness-macfarlane\" title=\"\">Orford Ness in Suffolk</a>, where, during the 1950s and 60s, Britain's H-bombs, minus their atomic payloads, were tested to ensure they wouldn't go off or shake themselves to pieces before they reached their intended targets.</p> <p>The Toxic Camera features interviews with Shevchenko's surviving colleagues, as well as a great deal of atmospheric and sometimes moving incident. The camera glides, rises and falls. It is a witness and guide, leading you on and detaining you. It rises over a structure that once contained a cyclotron at Orford; it skates over dead mud and pebbles. It gets sidetracked, stopping at a snail's shell, at the torn end of a pipe, a boy's face, a curl of rusted razorwire, apples falling to the ground to rot in an orchard in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. A man buries his head in a tangle of bright foliage. He&#xa0;might be crying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-400863513\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/22/1350917686574/Jane-and-Louise-Wilson----010.jpg\" alt=\"Jane and Louise Wilson - Toxic Camera\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grim grandeur ... a still from Toxic Camera by Jane and Louise Wilson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Wilsons' work is more than just a film. Here is a black, bronze-cast replica of Shevchenko's camera, pointing blindly from its concrete plinth at a measuring stick which, reaching like an antenna towards the ceiling, disappears into the gallery's double-height gloom. More measuring sticks appear in and among the Wilsons' photographs, like divining rods calibrated with chequerboard markings and stripes. They measure nothing, just as the bronze camera sees&#xa0;nothing.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, I visited Orford Ness with the artists. It is one of the strangest, most haunting places I have ever been. Bunkers and concrete pagodas dot this island of shingle and wetland on the Suffolk coast. Radar was developed here during the second world war, and other secret, experimental work went on in the now decaying buildings. The Wilsons had installed their yardsticks in various places, in sub-basements and buildings without roofs, open to the weather, and amplified the ambient sounds of wind and metal that echo through the&#xa0;buildings.</p> <p>Orford feels like the end of the world, a place of grim grandeur and melancholy. The cranes of Felixstowe docks rise to the south. Sizewell nuclear power station dominates the horizon to the north. One place leads to another, Orford to Chernobyl. Journeys to forgotten spaces and liminal zones have been the subject of the Wilsons' work since the beginnings of their joint career, in the early 1990s. The sisters have taken us <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/issue/article/beside_themselves/\" title=\"\">from Kings Cross bedsits</a> to the abandoned Stasi headquarters in Berlin, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/feb/23/daoud-hamdani-star-city-another-view\" title=\"\">a Russian cosmonaut training centre</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2003/sep/16/1\" title=\"\">a graffitied modernist folly in Peterlee new town</a>. At the Whitworth, they also show us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/apr/26/inside-chernobyl-control-room\" title=\"\">the abandoned Soviet city of Pripyat</a>, near Chernobyl. Here is a ruined classroom and an abandoned, rotting library. Here is civilisation in ruins.</p> <p>In a second, 2011 film installation, with text by Eyal Weizman (and Shumon Basar), Face Scripting: What Did the Building See, the Wilsons' camera tours the sleek anonymity of a modern hotel in Dubai, where a Hamas operative was assassinated by Mossad agents. The camera sweeps the carpet, captures the light on louvred blinds, searches for room 230 where the deed was done. It is just another hotel room. It could be anywhere. Opposite the screen, a dangling TV monitor replays real CCTV footage of the incident. This, too, seems anonymous and generic, with its surveillance footage of corridors, parking zones and lobbies, and captured images of the blurry hit squad, looking like tourists or business guests, come to do their wet work.</p> <p>These two film installations are displayed in large, partially enclosed rooms-within-rooms with translucent walls, with mirrors at right angles to the screens. They feel as much like diagrams as real spaces. The light leaks in and the images thrown on the screen are reflected and multiplied by the mirrors. Get up close and you see yourself there, too, your repeated image bending away into infinity. The effect is like watching the bright windows of a train passing in the night. This sense of duplication and reflection is integral to the artists' work. It feels like metaphor \u2013 and it feels like a trap.</p> <p>The Wilsons' film installations haven't always been so effectively staged. Here, they have made great use of the difficult architecture of the Whitworth's complicated spaces.The exhibition design, as much as the things in it, feels like a kind of fiction. We could be in a story by JG Ballard or a novel by Don DeLillo, a movie by Tarkovsky or by Kubrick, a conspiracy thriller or a drama-documentary. What the Wilsons document, they also twist. There is no objective view. Nowadays, instead of featuring on-screen themselves, we are made aware of their overriding subjectivity, an implacable and sometimes merciless view. It is hard not to feel the sadness of the world here, the misery of the modern age, in these rooms of photographs and measuring rods, the dead bronze camera and the filmed trails of murder, nuclear disaster, cold wars and hidden wars. You get lost in it all: there is no end to its bleak and unremitting architecture.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article was amended on 24 October 2012 to credit Eyal Weizman and Shumon Basar, along with Jane and Louise Wilson, for the film installation Face Scripting: What Did the Building See.</p>",

The European Commission wants the size of the EU budget to be increased, a proposal which is anathema to the British government at a time of fiscal austerity at home. The UK is not the only country opposed to a large increase in the EU budget. But few are likely to fight as hard or as long against an increase as the UK.</p> <p>For his part, the British prime minister, David Cameron, is under enormous pressure from his own largely Eurosceptic Conservative Party to veto any budget deal that is inimical to British interests. Further struggles over banking union and efforts to repatriate key powers will follow, as pressures build on both sides of the Channel.

In 10 Downing St., his advisers are not only discussing whether to hold a referendum but also how to win one, says a senior minister involved in the plans. But the weakness of his political position means he cannot rule out leading a campaign to take the U.K. out of the EU if his renegotiation demands are not met.</p> <p>That puts him in a perilous situation. His hopes for a successful renegotiation rest largely on the belief that the euro zone's only hope of survival lies in full political union and the mutualization of debts. But this may be a miscalculation: Much of the fiscal and banking union needed to resolve the crisis are already in place and much of what remains to be done can probably be done within existing treaties, as it was with the fiscal pact. Even if Mr. Cameron had a radical agenda, the rest of the EU may see no need to indulge him\u2014particularly if, as last December, no U.K. interests are at stake.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron's misfortune/strategic blunder is to be trapped between two formidable obstacles. On one flank (<em>the right, presumably</em>) the Conservative Party's eurosceptics. On the other, a European establishment which is more concerned with saving the single currency than helping the Brits backpedal.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:59:20.263Z\">at 9.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085051dc0e343ef1abc7e01\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:34:37.092Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Talk of snap elections in Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Political developments in Greece this morning, where an MP has been slung out out the ruling coalition.</p> <p><strong>Nikos Stavrogiannis</strong> was expelled from New Democracy's parliamentary group after he declared on Sunday that he might not support the country's new austerity programme when it comes before parliament.</p> <p>Stavrogiannis said the measure being imposed by the Troika are \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d.

  "<p><strong>Aggreko</strong> lost its spark again as analysts downgraded after last week's warning from the temporary power supply company. It closed 64p lower at \u00a320.73, the biggest faller in the leading index. HSBC said:</p> <blockquote> Growth is slowing at Aggreko, but where and by how much and for how long remains unclear. We cut our 2012 and 2013 earnings per share estimates by 6.0% and 7.3%, respectively. Aggreko's rating is now out of kilter with projected capacity growth. We cut to underweight from neutral and our target price from \u00a323.50 to \u00a317.50. <br> </blockquote> <p>JP Morgan Cazenove also reduced its price target, down from \u00a323.60 to \u00a321.65. Analyst Nicholas de la Grense said:</p> <blockquote> The standout features of today's results were: a) fleet capex guidance for the first half of 2013, which was below market expectations; b) increased bad debt provisions, which should weigh considerably on the profitability of the international power projects (IPP) business; and c) weaker than expected order intake in IPP. We reduce our IPP growth and margin assumptions, leading to earnings per share cuts of 0.8% in 2012 and 7.0% for 2013. </blockquote> <p>Overall the markets edged lower for the second day running, with any impetus from the eurozone proving shortlived. A Spanish regional election appeared to strengthen the government's hand in its attempt to avoid a bailout for as long as possible, while Germany support for Ireland was also taken positively. But further disappointing US corporate news, including worse than expected figures from Caterpillar, proved a dominant factor, while a drop in Japanese exports also rekindled worries about a global economic slowdown. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 13.24 points lower at 5882.91.</p> <p>Later in the week come a number of key events which are likely to influence the market, including UK and US GDP figures and the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve.</p> <p><strong>Shire </strong>suffered some profit taking ahead of its latest figures due on Thursday. Its shares lost 33p to \u00a318.22 but in a buy note Deutsche Bank said:</p> <blockquote> Given the setbacks this year and the over-hang of patent litigation, sentiment has been fragile on the shares. However, we see several factors that may help to re-build confidence, including: (1) reaffirmation with the third quarter results of earnings per share guidance for 2012 (\"double digit\") and 2013 (\"sound\"); (2) evidence from IMS [sales] data and quarterly results that the new AXR [hyperactivity drug] competition is not as damaging as feared; (3) potential settlement of the Intuniv patent challenge. Fundamentals aside, as one of few European mid-cap pharma companies without a blocking or protective shareholder stake, Shire may be subject to intermittent bouts of market conjecture about its attractions as a potential M&amp;A target. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>BP</strong> dropped 6.95p to 443.45p despite unveiling its long awaited deal to sell its stake in a Russian joint venture to Rosneft.</p> <p><strong>Petrofac</strong> fell 37p to \u00a315.78 following its recent update. Analysts at Liberum moved from buy to hold, given the oil services company's share price had moved to within 5% of the broker's target price.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Morgan Crucible Company</strong> dipped 0.9p to 239.6p despite talk <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/oct/12/morgan-crucible-warning-engineering?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">its recent profit warning</a>, might leave it vulnerable to a predator. Andy Douglas at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> We believe that there may be scope for outside interest in the group to increase. We remind investors that, in late-2006, the group was subject to an approach from an unnamed bidder, although the talks were halted without a formal bid being announced. We also highlight that US-based peer Ceradyne was recently bid for by 3M, hence there would appear to be interest in the sector/space. </blockquote> <p><strong>Spectris</strong>, one industrial group not to issue a warning on trading, suffered a spate of profit taking following a near 12% rise following its positive update on Friday. The controls group closed 70p lower at \u00a317.09 with Panmure Gordon analyst Oliver Wynne-James moving from buy to hold:</p> <blockquote> The rise in the company's share price was too exuberant in our view, versus the deteriorating short term environment being witnessed by its industrial customers, which leads us to conclude that there is little point in chasing the shares. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Asos</strong>, the online fashion retailer, was in demand with investors ahead of its half year results on Thursday.</p> <p>Part of the interest came from weekend reports that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9623143/Amazon-weighs-bid-for-online-fashion-retailer-Asos.html\" title=\"\">Amazon had cast its eye over Asos</a>, not the first time this suggestion has been made. Analyst Nick Bubb commented:</p> <blockquote> With the market cap of Asos now up to \u00a32bn, mighty Amazon has left it a bit late to start looking at the business (unless money is simply no object), but whatever happens the 27% stake in Asos built up by the Danish fashion group Bestseller is looking cannier by the day, given the likelihood that Asos will soon start to crack the Chinese market. </blockquote> <p>At the same time Investec, in a note on clothing retailers, repeated its buy recommendation on the business. Analyst Bethany Hocking said:</p> <blockquote> In our view the share price is likely to benefit from positive sentiment over the next few months as the market continues to appreciate the significance to earnings of new in-country warehouses. We also think that it is positive that the company has already started to discuss (and thus clearly plan internally) the establishments of new warehouses, reducing the implementation risk, in our opinion. <br> We remain buyers, albeit caution that we see potential for the shares to consolidate between 2500p and 2700p near-term. </blockquote> <p>Asos added 73p to \u00a325.10 but <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>, tipped as a sell by Investec, dipped 2.9p to 390.2p.</p> <p>Sausage skin maker <strong>Devro</strong> slipped 11.9p to 324.1p after warning that profits will be lower than expected.</p> <p>It blamed rises in raw materials, a trend which is forecast to continue into next year, as well as delays in commissioning new production plants and adverse exchange rate movements. It said:</p> <blockquote> As a result of the combination of adverse currency movements, continuing increases in raw material costs and extended plant commissioning periods, overall full year operating profits are expected to be slightly below our original expectations but ahead of last year. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Essar Energy</strong> added 4.5p to 136.7p after Morgan Stanley issued a buy note:</p> <p>On Friday the Essar Energy chief executive officer Naresh Nayyar, held a meeting with analysts to update on the business ahead of the first half results on 26 November. The message was one of steady progress with the outlook looking more positive than at the start of the year.</p>",
  "<p>Sir George Young's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-live-reaction\" title=\"\">promotion to the chief whip's office</a> has put the 72-year-old's esoteric CV under the spotlight. Not only did the Conservative MP for North West Hampshire once captain the House of Commons squash team, maintaining an unbeaten record for five years from 1979 (when he lost twice in a day to Ron Davies MP and his wife Christine, a Welsh international squash player), but he founded the Parliamentary Bicycle Pool, a surprisingly socialist initiative that provided a fleet of communal bicycles for MPs who preferred two wheels to four.</p> <p>The Parliamentary Bicycle Pool eventually morphed into what is now the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/cycling.htm\" title=\"\">All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group (APPCG)</a>. Sir George, who gained the nickname the Bicycling Baronet after doggedly cycling the seven miles from his first constituency in Acton to Westminster each day, has been an active member of the group whenever he has not held a ministerial position. Ministers are not allowed to be members of APPGs, so Sir George is now officially a patron rather than a member.</p> <p>Disappointingly, the APPCG isn't like a normal cycling club. Members don't meet at 7am each Sunday for a punishing ride around Westminister's highways and byways, the back pockets of their jerseys stuffed with energy gels and drinks. It's more of a lobbying collective. Each year the group goes on a sedate pootle around Westminster \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/audio/2010/jul/02/tourdefrance\" title=\"\">in 2010</a> the newly elected transport minister Norman Baker turned up on the departmental Brompton folding bike and Labour's Ben Bradshaw wore rather <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/david-dansky/4712322640/in/set-72157624165513771\" title=\"\">daring shorts</a>. Tory MP Peter Bottomley also provoked mirth by arriving with his helmet on the wrong way around. Luckier members go on the annual field trip: they recently went to Paris to check out the Velib bike-rental scheme (not as good as London's, was the verdict) and another year they pedalled around Holland.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/cycling.htm\" title=\"\">A glance through the 135-strong membership list</a> reveals no particular party bias. Former Tory health minister turned peer Virginia Bottomley is on there, alongside Labour rebels Jeremy Corbyn and Kelvin Hopkins. So is the former law lord Leonard Hoffmann and Lords Butler and Scott, famous for heading inquiries into Iraq.</p> <p>The chair is currently shared between Labour MP Ian Austin, a speed freak who rides a racing bike, and Julian Huppert, the Lib Dem MP for Cambridge, who doesn't own a car and is something of a utilitarian cyclist, pedalling in his work clothes whatever the weather. Don't be surprised if you see either in a future cabinet: APPCG chairs have a track record for going on to become ministers. Charles Clarke and Ben Bradshaw were at the helm before taking charge of the home office and the department of culture, media and sport, respectively.</p>",

Hassan played a \u201chigh-stakes\u201d game both in investigating Hezbollah\u2019s role in the 2005 murder of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, and the arrest that he organised in August of Michel Samaha, a minister linked to the Syrian government, over terrorism allegations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki\">Speaking on a noisy Skype line</a> he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lebanon is very combustible. This current situation is especially dangerous because of the fractiousness of the Sunni community and the lack of control that [former prime minister] Saad Hariri and his Future Movement can exert over certain elements of the population, who are very angry and want to see more a proactive stance in support of the Syrian revolution, and are fed up with assassination after assassination and by what they see as Hezbollah\u2019s military dominance. This could easily become the straw that broke the camel's back. It could lead to the kind of civil violence that everybody has been trying to prevent.</p> </blockquote> <p>But for now the opposition Future Movement is making all the right noises, Muhanna said. He was encouraged by Hariri\u2019s attempt to rein in the radical demands of some Sunni groups. \u201cHariri doesn\u2019t want to assume power at this point - given all that\u2019s happening in Syria,\" he said. But there needs to be political consensus for cooler heads to prevail, he argued.</p> <p>\u201cIf they can find a way of containing the situation and keeping [prime minister Najib] Mikati in power then they may be able to return in some ways to the status quo,\" Muhanna said.</p> <p>There is as yet no evidence pointing to a link to Syria, Muhanna pointed out. But he said there is a long history of assassination of Lebanese figures who act against Syria\u2019s interests in Lebanon.</p> <p>It is impossible to tell whether Hezbollah was involved Hassan\u2019s killing, Muhanna noted. But he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is fair to say that Hezbollah does not gain by a situation in which Lebanon is pulled into sectarian violence. Hezbollah has really tried to insulate Lebanon from the Syrian crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leaked documents have suggested that Hassan had regular contact with one of Hezbollah\u2019s security chiefs. \u201cHe was really somebody who lived inbetween the spaces between Damascus and Beirut,\u201d Muhanna said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;Wissam al-Hassan&amp;#x27;s killing could spark Lebanon&amp;#x27;s combustible mix despite calls for calm from Future Movement says @QifaNabki&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T15:14:00.352Z\">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085484cc0e343ef1abc7e24\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:21:17.089Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turkish-Syrian tensions</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turkey has rejected Israeli calls for talks on the Syria crisis, as analysts express concern about Ankara's increasing aggression towards Syria.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=296024\">According to the Turkish daily Zaman</a> the calls for talks came from Pinhas Avivi, a former Israeli ambassador to Turkey and current political director of the Israeli foreign ministry.</p> <p>He suggested Syria and Turkey should both acknowledge mistakes over border violence, to avoid the tension escalating further.</p> <p>Most analysts believe Turkey wants to avoid war with Syria despite Ankara's belligerent rhetoric.</p> <p>But a new paper for the International Institute for Strategic Studies predicted that increased <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/past-issues/volume-18-2012/october/turkeys-frustrations-grow-with-syrian-civil-war\">military tension and even some form of intervention is still a possibility</a>.</p> <p>It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent events suggest that Turkey's policy towards Syria has entered a new and more aggressive phase. Ankara appears determined to increase the pressure on the Assad regime, raising the possibility of increased Turkish aid to the FSA and even artillery support, from inside Turkey, for Free Syrian Army operations in Syria.</p> <p>The likelihood of a war between Turkey and Syria remains remote. But the new impetuousness of the Turkish approach is a cause for concern. It would be a mistake to underestimate the AKP's frustration at Assad's continued hold on power, Nato allies' refusal to play a more active role in trying to overthrow him and the emergence of a Kurdish enclave inside Syria. Although it currently appears small, there is nevertheless a danger that sustained \u2013 or even increased \u2013 military tensions could generate a momentum that could drag Turkey deeper into a highly complex conflict from which it would be hard to extricate itself.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:42:59.320Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50853a37c0e343ef1abc7e1f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T12:21:11.766Z\">1.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lebanese army warning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lebanon's army has called for calm amid reports that the latest wave of violence has eased.</p> <p>Reuters reports: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lebanon's army said on Monday the nation faced a critical phase after the assassination of a senior intelligence officer prompted violent protests across the country.</p> <p>\"We call on all political leaders to be cautious when expressing their stances and opinions,\" said a statement by the army, adding that it would take \"decisive measures\" to prevent chaos in areas of high tension.</p> </blockquote> <p>Journalists in Beirut said overnight violence, which killed at least two people, appears to be over for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mitchprothero/status/260347904961687552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Streets in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Beirut\">#Beirut</a> reach uneasy calm but unclear if Army in control or if this is a just a break before nightfall. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Lebanon\">#Lebanon</a></p>&mdash; mitchell prothero (@mitchprothero) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchprothero/status/260347904961687552\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:52:32+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/javierespinosa2/status/260342863076921344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Clashes over in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23beirut\">#beirut</a>,lots of army vehicles around Tarik al Jedid <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Lebanon\">#Lebanon</a></p>&mdash; JAVIER ESPINOSA (@javierespinosa2) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/javierespinosa2/status/260342863076921344\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:32:30+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/lebanon\">Britain's foreign office has updated its travel advice to Lebanon</a> in the wake of Friday's bomb attack and ensuing violence.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As it stands right now, this aggressive posture doesn\u2019t appear to be stamping out some of the more militant activity. In many cases roads will be closed and then reopen later. It is just not clear right now whether there is enough security forces in Beirut to get a handle on things.</p> </blockquote> <p>There has been a heavy security presence in the areas of Qasqas, Tariq al-Jdideh, Cola Bridge, which Prothero described as \u201csectarian fault lines\u201d.</p> <p>The casualty count will be critical in the next couple of days, he said. If there is significant bloodshed there is a danger that the cycle of sectarian violence could spin out of control, he predicted. </p> <p><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack\">Speaking to the Guardian from Beirut</a>, Prothero said: \"I fear the security forces have until this evening to get this over with, with the minimum of casualties or we could see an ongoing situation.\"</p> <p>He said the scale of the violence and uncertainty feels different from previously Syria-related sectarian tension in Lebanon.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are used to a certain amount of sectarian tension that mimics the situation in Syria, popping off in the northern city of Tripoli where there has been a great deal of tension between pro-Syrian and anti-Syrian Sunni Muslim factions ... But what we are seeing since the killing of General Wissam al-Hassan is that this has really spread to Beirut.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Syrian government is widely believed to be behind the attack, he said. It is difficult to imagine any other suspects for the killing, given Hassan's record of investigating Syria\u2019s influence in violence in Lebanon, Prothero said.</p> <p>Sunni anger at the bombing appears to be spontaneous and leaderless, he pointed out. \"While it doesn\u2019t appear to be organised on the Sunni side it appears to be spreading all across the city, making it very difficult for the security forces,\" he said. </p> <p>The Sunni opposition lack strong leadership, he said. Exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri did not return to the country for yesterday\u2019s funeral, Prothero noted. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this point he\u2019s a voice on a television screen, or a Skype or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HaririSaad\">Twitter accoun</a>t. Thus not really connecting with the Sunni streets.</p> </blockquote> <p>For its part, the militant Shia group Hezbollah has stayed quiet since Friday\u2019s attack, focusing instead on protecting their Shia neighbourhoods, Prothero reported. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;@mitchprothero says Beirut security forces struggling to contain Syria-related sectarian violence after Friday&amp;#x27;s bomb attack &amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T10:08:52.218Z\">at 11.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50850f69c0e343ef1abc7e08\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T09:18:34.028Z\">10.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Security raids in Lebanon</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lebanese army raided <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Oct-22/192282-casualties-in-beirut-clashes-following-hasan-funeral.ashx#ixzz2A17DdH00\">suspected militant hideouts in several areas on Beirut\u2019s outskirts after last night's sectarian clashes</a>, the Daily Star reports.</p> <p>Its sources said fighting only stopped at about 2am when the army intervened.</p> <p>Friday's bomb attack is likely to be the <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Oct-22/192291-killing-of-security-chief-raises-fears-for-lebanon.ashx#ixzz2A18mxRml\">most destabilising event in Lebanon since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri</a>, according to the paper's Samia Nakhoul.</p> <p>But she adds: \"Although sectarian tensions are high, Lebanese factions have no desire to return to civil war.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7909659b-9e9e-43a8-8df1-5a43eef70886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350897495809/e2771e1a-9831-4d9b-a501-444156c3fab3-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Lebanese soldiers gather with their weapons in Kaskas, Beirut after a night of tension following the funeral of an intelligence official killed by a car bomb.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lebanese soldiers gather with their weapons in Kaskas, Beirut after a night of tension following the funeral of an intelligence official killed by a car bomb.

They consider Mikati\u2019s government to be in league with Syria over the attack.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20024519\">US secretary of state Hillary Clinton told Lebanon that the US was willing to help investigate Friday\u2019s bomb attack, the BBC reports. </a></strong>Clinton spoke to Mikati after the funeral. A spokeswoman for the state department said: \"She noted the importance of political leaders working together at this sensitive time to ensure that calm prevails and that those responsible for the attack are brought to justice.\u201d</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://sana.sy/eng/21/2012/10/22/448279.htm\">President Bashar al-Assad suggested he would only back a ceasefire if western and Arab countries stopped helping the armed struggle against his government.</a></strong> After talks with international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, the state news agency Sana said Assad insisted that \u201cany initiative or political process should be essentially based on the principle of halting terrorism and what is required in this regard from the countries involved in supporting, arming and harbouring the terrorists in Syria to halt such acts\".</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/uk-syria-crisis-idUKBRE89K07E20121022\"><strong>Thirteen people were killed when a car bomb was set off in Damascus during Brahimi\u2019s visit.</strong> </a>&#xa0;The bomb exploded outside a police station in the mainly Christian central Bab Touma district.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/21/west-policy-syria-failure-russia-iran\">By backing one side in a civil war that neither side can win, the west's policy on Syria is failing on a monumental scale, according to former Labour minister Peter Hain.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only way forward is to broker a political settlement, with Russia using its leverage to ensure that Assad negotiates seriously \u2026</p> <p>However unpalatable, Assad may have to be granted immunity in order to get him to sign up and stop his barbarity. All state employees, including those in the armed forces, must be allowed to keep their posts, to avoid a repeat of the chaos caused by America's de-Ba'athification in Iraq. A Yemen-type process may even figure. There, a hated president did not resign but did not stand for re-election. A coalition government of national unity could then prepare for Syrian elections, due in 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=15984\">The US should change the balance of power in Syria by supplying rebels with anti-aircraft weapons, according to Syria watcher Joshua Landis who until now has resisted US involvement in the conflict.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The supply of portable heat-seeking missiles seems to be increasingly justified. US politicians fear that elements of the Syrian opposition may misuse ground to air missiles, but surely they cannot be misused more than Assad\u2019s jets and helicopters. Assad\u2019s air superiority, combined with his inability to rule Syria, is causing endless misery. Air power is so destructive that if it could be denied to both sides, surely fewer people would be killed.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Jordan</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/jordan-claims-thwarted-terror-attacks\">The authorities claim to have foiled an al-Qaida-inspired plot using arms from Syria to target western diplomats, foreign nationals and shopping centres.</a></strong> A Jordanian government spokesman Sameeh Maaytah said all 11 suspects are in police custody. He said the men had brought in arms from Syria to use them in the alleged plot and had been assisted by al-Qaida operatives based in Iraq in manufacturing home-made explosives.</p> <h2>Libya</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/protesters-libya-parliament-bani-walid-conflict\">Demonstrators broke into the grounds of Libya's parliament, wounding two security guards, in a protest against the continuing fighting in Bani Walid, a former stronghold of Muammar Gaddafi.</a></strong><br>Fighting in Bani Walid, 90 miles south-east of Tripoli, continued for a fifth day, with the government yet to provide proof of its assertion that Gaddafi's youngest son, Khamis, was killed in the town on Saturday.</p> <h2>Egypt</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/sonia-dridi-attacked-tahrir-square\"><strong>A journalist for France 24 has described how his female colleague was attacked and groped by a group of men while filming live during protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night</strong>.</a> Sonia Dridi was surrounded while filming in the square, with the mob closing in on her as she was reporting.

  "<p>Students and their parents have always been concerned about safety while studying overseas. These concerns are shaped by information and experiences gained from many sources that accumulate across the international student journey. But being safe in an overseas study environment is not a one-dimensional issue, as new research by the British Council's education intelligence unit. Safety cannot be created by informing or changing one element of the international student experience \u2013 a holistic approach involving all participants is needed.</p> <p>What is striking about findings from our research is the rise of safety as an influencing factor on students' choice of where to study overseas. A country being a safe place to study is currently the fifth most important influencing factor, according to <a href=\"http://ihe.britishcouncil.org/ihe-exchange/products/115\" title=\"\">our Student Insight survey</a>, which has collected over 160,000 responses from students around the world since 2007. This compares with its ranking as the 17th most important factor out of a possible 19 in 2007.</p> <p>The UK was recently voted as the safest place to live while studying overseas, as part of an online opinion poll of over 800 students from more than 80 countries, conducted by Education Intelligence via <a href=\"http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Student Room online forum</a> . The most important factor in this verdict was the UK's rich cultural mix, followed by its lack of gun culture and good healthcare system. </p> <p>Much of this research investigated how opinions are formed and decisions are made. However, it was the final layer of our research \u2013 speaking to students, parents, teachers and agents in India about who they believe is responsible for international student safety \u2013 which formed an understanding of what action could be taken to equip and prepare students and mitigate their growing concerns.</p> <p>The young people we spoke to in Delhi and Mumbai held very strong views on how their future university overseas could make them feel safer. All students agreed that integration into both international student groups and the home student community was essential, not only to settling into university life but also improving safety. Feeling safe in their new home would give them a basis on which to build their academic ability and social networks.</p> <p>What are the implications for UK institutions? In 2010/2011, over 480,700 international students came to study in the UK, evidence of how successfully UK universities market themselves internationally. The average number of international students at the 160+ UK higher education institutions is around 2900. However, the number of international students at any one institution varies from 30 to more 10,000. The average ratio of UK students to international students is around 5:1, but at some institutions a quarter of all students are international. In classes where domestic students are in the minority, their international classmates may feel they are not fully integrated into the student community.</p> <p>International students that enter UK classrooms to study UK courses do not undertake this commitment lightly, having invested both financially and emotionally into a transaction they hope will boost their academic, professional and social aspirations. They do however embark on their journey as willing participants. Most UK students have not experienced the national and institutional marketing campaigns UK institutions conduct overseas targeted at (and witnessed by) international classmates in their home countries. Those UK students may also be unaware of their role in delivering on the promise of these campaigns.</p> <p>Like these classrooms, towns and cities across the UK feel the impact of up to 40,000 students into local communities at the beginning of each academic year, a large proportion of which are international. If a town or city is unprepared for this level of activity and not informed about the benefits of welcoming international students, there could be negative consequences.</p> <p>Fully internationalising an institution means making ready the curriculum, the administration, the careers department, and the accommodation facilities. But it also means taking steps to ensure full integration of international students into institutional and local communities. Our research shows this is an essential element of creating an environment in which international students feel safer.</p> <p>Bringing this about involves staff that work across facilities and departments, with students on campus, and with the wider community, making all fully aware of the expectations upon them to be welcoming, open and ready to learn. Is this an unrealistic, utopian aim? Let's hope not. After all, becoming a truly international and successful global institution that provides the safest and most productive learning and living environment for all students is crucial to the ongoing success of the UK as a world study destination.</p> <p><em>Elizabeth Shepherd is research director of education intelligence at the </em><a href=\"http://ihe.britishcouncil.org/\" title=\"\"><em>British Council</em></a><em> \u2013 follow it on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritishCouncil\" title=\"\"><em>@BritishCouncil</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>\"It was part of the grieving process,\" Andrew Strauss says in his considered but booming voice over tea and biscuits on an autumnal afternoon in Hertfordshire. He might still be cold after a rainy round of golf but it does not take the former England captain long to shake off the polite niceties of a few gentle warm-up questions as he cuts to the heart of loss and painful endings. Strauss is far too grounded to linger over any comparison between death and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/29/england-captain-andrew-strauss-retires?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">his retirement from cricket</a> but it is still striking how open he is about his turbulent emotions when he wrote to England's players in August to explain, in personal letters, why he could no longer continue as their captain.</p> <p>Strauss takes another sip of tea as he remembers that poignant day. \"One of the things I've found hardest about retiring was sitting down and writing to those players. It dawned upon me how much like a second family the England team has been to me in recent years. You spend so much time together \u2013 probably sharing more nights with them than your wife. It's hard to let go. And as soon as you do let go they move on for the next tour. They're still in that bubble and you're on the other side. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/sep/01/england-andrew-strauss-retiring\" title=\"\">Your relationship with those players will never be the same again</a>. I was prepared for that but it was still emotional writing and saying: 'This is it. Fine, I'm off. Goodbye.'\"</p> <p>Of course Strauss is too thoughtful to have scribbled such a cursory farewell. Every letter would have been packed with personal meaning from him to each specific player \u2013 summed up by the impressively old-fashioned fact that, rather than texting or emailing, he put pen to paper. \"Well,\" Strauss smiles, \"it just proved to me how successfully I'd managed to avoid getting a proper job because my hand was cramping after about 10 minutes. It took me a lot longer than I expected. I wrote the letters on the back of each other and it took at least half a day.\"</p> <p>How did he decide who he would write to first \u2013 or did he simply move down the batting order? \"It was a bit higgledy-piggledy. I had a list and some were easier to write than others and I went first with the ones that I figured would be easier. The ones that were harder to write were those with more emotion attached to them.\"</p> <p>Did Kevin Pietersen feature on his list? \"Um \u2026 I didn't write to KP, actually,\" he says of Pietersen, whose text messages to his South African friends in the opposition dressing room <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/15/kevin-pietersen-apologised-provocative-texts\" title=\"\">apparently undermined Strauss</a> during the second Test of an unhappy series for England. \"But the main reason was that I wrote all those letters so they could be taken down to the Rose Bowl where the guys were playing [in a one-day international \u2013 a form of cricket from which Pietersen had temporarily retired in order to pursue a more lucrative career in the Indian Premier League.] Obviously I texted KP.\"</p> <p>A text to Pietersen was probably more appropriate than a beautifully-written letter? \"Well yeah,\" Strauss shrugs. \"That was a strange time for the two of us. A lot had happened and during that period we were quite estranged from each other.\"</p> <p>Surely that estrangement, between Pietersen and the entire squad, cannot be healed \u2013 even though, after an awkward series of meetings, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/18/england-kevin-pietersen-squad-india\" title=\"\">he will play for England </a>against India next month? \"It's an interesting point. Maybe it actually makes it easier for the team that I'm not there because some of it was directed to me. It would have been harder if I'd stayed.\"</p> <p>Strauss has previously been resolute in stressing that he did not retire because of Pietersen's texts. Is he now saying something different? \"No, because of what happened with KP I felt guilty not sorting it before I left. I didn't want to leave it on [the team director] Andy Flower's plate and I felt uncomfortable with Cooky [Alastair Cook] having to deal with it as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/17/alastair-cook-kevin-pietersen-england-return\" title=\"\">one of his first tasks</a>. But that would have been the wrong reason for me to stay. I had to go.\"</p> <p>Was Strauss aware of Pietersen's soured mood towards him? \"Not really. That's the strange thing about it. We knew that Kevin was having issues about the IPL. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/14/kevin-pietersen-odi-cricket-retirement\" title=\"\">retired from one-day cricket</a> and didn't seem happy because it was clear that he was keen to commit to the IPL. But as players we were outside of that. So when it came to a head we were all quite surprised.\"</p> <p>It's easy to imagine that Pietersen, being such a willful maverick, has always been difficult to captain. \"Well, what makes people like KP special as cricketers is they are different. Nine-tenths of my time as England captain I found him a good guy to have in my team. He set the right example in practice and I felt he could have been far more resentful of me in the sense that he had been removed as captain before I took over. But he just got on with his job and our relationship was pretty good \u2013 which is why it was so surprising and baffling when I heard what had been going on. In the preceding months he had not given me any hint of what he thought about me.\"</p> <p>Strauss says that he and Pietersen have since met \u2013 and he acknowledges that some of England's players have not been blameless in the breakdown of relationships with their star batsman. \"I don't think anyone got to the bottom of the text messaging saga. But Kevin has since come up to me and apologised for it and I respect that. He seemed contrite and I think he was sincere. Looking back I think it was wrong some of our players were following <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/9473845/Kevin-Pietersen-parody-Twitter-KP-Genius-account-was-me-says-cricket-fan.html\" title=\"\">that [spoof KP Genius] Twitter account</a>. But I still don't think it's a justification for what Kevin did.\"</p> <p>Can Pietersen change perceptions of himself? \"It would be fantastic if Kevin does recommit himself to English cricket at a greater level. But if, deep down, he still feels more loyalty to his IPL franchise then obviously it's going to be difficult for him.\"</p> <p>Does Strauss believe Pietersen is badly advised \u2013 as he released his YouTube pitch at reconciliation in the midst of a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiaZnXayjTQ\" title=\"\">fevered night at the London Olympics</a>? \"I don't know. But I believe we all have to take responsibilities for our own actions. It was a fraught time for everyone and I now believe that KP is very contrite.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/24/andy-flower-zimbabwe-protest-henry-olonga\" title=\"\">difficulties for Flower</a>, who is just as straight and disciplined a man as Strauss, will be obvious in India as he tries to ease Pietersen's reintegration. \"It will be difficult,\" Strauss concedes. \"One of the problems is that there are two separate sections. One is going on in meeting rooms between KP and the players and on the other side is this media intrigue. From Andy's point of view, they need to get that first part right. If everyone is happy in the dressing room they will play well. But if it's not resolved then it is a problem. I honestly think it's a real problem.\"</p> <p>Is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/18/kevin-pietersen-england-india-tour\" title=\"\">reconciliation achievable</a>? \"Um \u2026 I think that it can be. But everyone has to desperately want it to happen and they all need to let bygones be bygones and not have any grudges and bitterness. Everyone has to want to move forward for the right reasons. That's the question mark and so it's hard for me to tell. But it saddens me that we've been through this \u2013 after all the hard work we put in as a group for three-and-a-half years. We all genuinely believed in this special bond and chemistry we had. Unfortunately we've slipped from there and the guys are going to need to recover that. It's going to be tough.</p> <p>\"If they can make it work then obviously England will be a better side with KP in it because he's an outstanding player. But if, behind the scenes, things are difficult and resentment is harboured, and if KP is not fully committed to England, there are going to be problems. But it's in everyone's interests to make it work.\"</p> <p>Strauss is not being disingenuous in deflecting any suspicion that he retired simply because of Pietersen. Instead, he offers some touching insights into his slow decline as a Test batsman. \"I had noticed signs that my batting was going backwards. I was starting to feel a bit old and that's not a good place to be as a professional athlete. I first felt it 12 months ago. I didn't have a great summer in 2011 and then over the winter I didn't play particularly well. I had a bit of a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/18241094\" title=\"\">resurgence against West Indies</a> but I felt like I was swimming against the tide.</p> <p>\"If I'm brutally honest, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/22/andrew-strauss-england\" title=\"\">by the time we reached world No1</a> I had ticked off everything I'd wanted to achieve. It's then hard to keep yourself hungry and motivated as captain. I also wasn't as mobile in the field. My agility was dropping. One of my favourite shots \u2013 the pull \u2013 was one I wasn't playing very often and I couldn't work out why. So maybe my reactions were slowing down. I loved captaining and trying to win games \u2013 but I wasn't enjoying batting any more.\"</p> <p>Strauss nods at the suggestion that, as a great sportsman, it must be immensely painful to lose your ability and desire. \"It is. There's this nagging feeling at the back of your mind and you redouble your efforts and work harder as a way of masking that feeling. But it's still there in the background. Every time you don't score runs or you dive for a ball and it just evades you, it creeps back. It's one of those things that when it catches hold of you it's just like a cancer \u2013 it spreads.\"</p> <p>Could he discuss his feelings with Flower? \"It's not something you can talk about. You spend most of your time fighting it. I only spoke to my wife and 12 months ago I marked out the South Africa series as a watershed. If we [England] were playing well and I was batting well that would give me the green light to go on for the [2013] Ashes. But if either of us was not playing well it would be a good time to think about going. In truth, England had taken a step back over the last nine months and I wasn't playing well. It became pretty clear in my mind.\"</p> <p>England dipped just as Strauss suffered his personal crisis of confidence. Were his players similarly drained of energy? \"We struggled with knowing our next goal. We never quite worked that out. If you say we want to stay No1 for the next 12 months then by definition you're just trying to hold on. I now think that as soon as we beat India to become No1 we should have made a conscious effort to refresh everything. But it's hard to do that when everything seems to be working so well.\"</p> <p>Flower once said that he wanted to create a dominant legacy that could rival great teams from the West Indies and Australia. \"We discussed it but it was just too big an aim at first. We needed something smaller than that and that's when it becomes trickier. Maybe we could have thought about getting to a certain number of ranking points. Human nature is that when you attain a goal you allow yourself to be happy and content and those emotions are not good in international sport. You have to be unhappy and keep pushing and straining because the opposition will do that.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/sep/18/joe-root-nick-compton-england\" title=\"\">Who does Strauss believe should replace him as Test opener</a>? \"I've heard a lot of good things about Joe Root but it would be hard to say he's the man when I haven't really seen him bat. I've known Nick Compton a long time. He's a fully-formed cricketer and he's scored lots of runs. He probably feels ready to open the batting for England. If KP is back then you have the option of <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/47623.html\" title=\"\">pushing Jonathan Trott</a> up the order. But he's done so well at No3 it seems wrong to swap him round. If it was up to me I would keep Trott at three.\"</p> <p>And that would leave Compton to open the batting with Cook? \"Nick has always been very good technically. I played with him at Middlesex years ago. He's quite an intense character and determined to make the most of his ability. I don't think he'd be overawed. Andy and Cooky will be looking very closely to see how Compton and Root play in the warm-up games and how they adapt to the squad. Sometimes it's how people hold themselves off the pitch that matters most.\"</p> <p>No one in the recent annals of English cricket has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/29/andrew-strauss-quits-england-captain\" title=\"\">conducted himself more admirably both on and off the field than Strauss</a>. England will miss him sorely, both for the batsman he once was and the tough and intelligent captain who steered them to back-to-back Ashes victories and led them to becoming the best Test team in world cricket. He now feels that he is \"on gardening leave\" as he works out what he might do next.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to make any decisions until after Christmas. It's going to be one of four things and quite possibly a combination of media work, cricket administration, corporate speaking and getting involved in a business unrelated to&#xa0;cricket.\"</p> <p>Strauss seems most passionate about safeguarding the Test arena \u2013 which is an&#xa0;aim that he can begin to develop as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/11/andrew-strauss-international-cricket-council\" title=\"\">member of the ICC's cricket committee</a>. \"It's a way of dipping my toe into the water and learning more about the ICC and the corporate governance of cricket. I really want to see cricket flourish and I have concerns that we're putting the game under a lot of pressure.</p> <p>\"My biggest concern is that Test cricket and Twenty20 cricket are competing too much. They should be complementing each other and the more they clash the more damaging it will be for cricket. We have to find a way to get the two forms of the game co-existing \u2013 and that involves administrators sitting down and banging their heads together and working out a framework. I understand the politics but&#xa0;I'm more interested in what's best for the game.\"</p> <p>Strauss seems eminently suited to pursuing a noble cause on behalf of Test cricket. It surely also means he won't be following Michael Vaughan on to Strictly Come Dancing? Strauss pulls a face, perhaps imagining a light entertainment show more geared to Pietersen, and then laughs. \"Definitely not! At the risk of sounding like Steve Redgrave when he said 'Shoot me if I get in a boat again', I'll be very disappointed if I end up doing that.\"</p> <p><em>Andrew Strauss is an ambassador for pensions and investment group MetLife (www.metlife.co.uk)</em></p>",
  "<p>As expected, the fourth entry in Hollywood's most high-profile genre franchise ruled the roost in the US after a relatively easy launch. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149941/paranormal-activity-4\" title=\"\">Paranormal Activity 4</a> was in dominant form outside North America too, as it edged out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149515/taken-2\" title=\"\">Taken 2</a> thanks to a $26.5m weekend debut in 22 countries, which contributed to a $56.7m (\u00a335.4m) worldwide opening weekend.</p> <p>That's a decent start for a movie with no name stars and an uninspiring response from reviewers (in territories where the film actually received a press showing). Heck, the musings of critics mean little to genre fans and indeed the franchise's supporters the world over were champing at the bit to see this in opening weekends from the UK to Russia. Paramount's top brass will be keen to focus on the global haul and play down the fact that this is, in real terms, the lowest release of the series so far \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144125/paranormal-activity-3\" title=\"\">PA3</a> opened exactly one year ago on $52.6m domestic and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/138452/paranormal-activity-2\" title=\"\">PA2</a> launched exactly one year before that on $40.7m. Neither figure is adjusted for inflation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/132450/paranormal-activity\" title=\"\">Paranormal Activity</a>, the big daddy that started it all, doesn't count as a comparable because Paramount wasn't too sure what to expect after buying distribution rights to the then unknown $15,000 horror movie. They released it in 12 theatres on 25 September 2009, word of mouth spread like wildfire and then came that extraordinary third weekend when the studio expanded the theatre count to 160 and it took a whopping $7.9m. The following weekend it was up to 760 and grossed $19.6m, and the weekend after that was the high point, when it reached No 1 on $21.1m from 1,945 venues. The first movie finished on $107.9m and remains the biggest result of the franchise, even though <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144125/paranormal-activity-3\" title=\"\">PA3</a>, which ended on $104m, is surely the best of the lot.</p> <p>Paranormal Activity came from outside the studio system, which is by no means unusual. Readers of this column will know I've been banging on about this a lot recently, but it bears repeating. The independent space is churning out some great stuff these days and it's been an engine at the US box office. The exit from the top 10 of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149647/seven-psychopaths\" title=\"\">Seven Psychopaths</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147832/perks-of-being-a-wallflower\" title=\"\">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a> has diluted independent cinema's representation in the upper echelons, although a newbie called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10488192\" title=\"\">Alex Cross</a> has just joined the mix.</p> <p>The last, a serial killer thriller, opened in fifth place and was put together by Los Angeles-based QED International, the people who made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131234/district-9\" title=\"\">District 9</a>. QED pre-sold distribution rights to international distributors. There was money from investors too, but this sales model, whereby a company like QED takes its sales estimates to a bank, which in turn cash-flows part of the production, remains the primary financing mechanism in independent film.</p> <p>Even the marketing and distribution savvy of US rights holder Summit Entertainment and the participation of competent mainstream director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/jul/18/alex-cross-trailer-tyler-perry\" title=\"\">Rob Cohen couldn't elevate</a> Alex Cross's opening weekend beyond mediocre.

  "<p>This statement covers all our significant findings regarding issues covered in the Community section of the Living our Values report to date. As we are using a rolling assurance process alongside the rolling publication of sections in the report, we may add additional findings that come to light as we investigate each section. All significant claims made in this section have been assured. We have not assured the data from this section.</p> <p>When Guardian News and Media (GNM) moved to Kings Place four years ago, it made a commitment to staff and the community to deliver positive benefits to the local community through an enhanced community programme, reaching more community partners. Since then the number of community partners has expanded from four to 11 with support also provided through the Guardian Education Centre. </p> <p>This year the community programme faced its biggest challenge with commercial pressures meaning financial investment fell by a third compared to last year and reduced availability of staff during the restructuring. The sustainability team is working even more creatively to continue to support partners and it is commendable that the number of regular volunteers and staff volunteering as part of team days was roughly the same as last year. However the total amount of time staff spent volunteering has fallen.</p> <p>Given the challenging environment, it is notable that GNM undertook independent monitoring and evaluation of the community programme. The review identified benefits created by the community programme, particularly from the employment of GNM's media expertise. </p> <p>Among the recommendations, one key finding was that GNM could manage internal resources better if there was a clearly articulated programme of support for partners agreed upon at the start of each financial year. GNM has started work on this by initiating planning meetings with each partner. A key challenge for the community programme will be to determine how to prioritise and support community partners going forward.<br> This year saw the conclusion of the Guardian's formal four-year integrated development project in the Ugandan rural community of Katine. It is a positive development that the Guardian has worked with Amref to agree a further \u00a3160,000 to support the existing community structures until the end of 2013, funded by continuing reader donations, In addition it has investigated the creation of a long-term development fund for the community that will help them to deal with shocks, such as extreme weather and climate change.</p>",
  "<p>We have now come to the end of the Guardian's formal four-year integrated development project in the Ugandan rural community of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine\">Katine</a>.</p> <p>Given the recognition that development is a long-term process and cannot fit neatly into any timeframe, a review of the project has led to a commitment to maintain support for the community until the end of 2013.</p> <p>It has also been agreed to investigate the possibility of setting up a long-term development fund in partnership with the community so that there are resources to call on in times of emergency.</p> <p>When the Guardian launched the project in October 2007, in partnership with NGO <a href=\"http://www.amref.org/\">Amref</a> and Barclays, we committed to demonstrate on a dedicated website the complexities that arise when trying to transform an impoverished African community.</p> <p>A combination of donations from Guardian readers, match-funded by Barclays, raised more than \u00a33m to pay for the project that has taken a holistic approach to development, focusing on education, health, water and sanitation, farming methods and new income-generating opportunities, together with community empowerment to increase engagement in local governance to achieve sustainability.</p> <p>Amref's work has been subjected to unprecedented scrutiny by journalists and the public. Every aspect of its work has been reported and its budgets and expenditure published and often debated online.</p> <p>While it is no longer feasible to commit the same resources to reporting on the project, the Guardian has a commitment to regularly visit Katine to update readers.</p> <p>An independent evaluator, who has been monitoring the project, completed a final report in November 2011, shortly after the completion of the four-year term. It focuses on technical achievements, the formation of sustainable community groups and the progress of activities against both objectives and outcomes. </p> <p>The consultant talked to a range of stakeholders and community members in Katine. Observational visits, one-to-one meetings, both informal and formal discussions at district, sub\u2013county and village level and focus group interviews were held. </p> <p>The key findings were that achievements against outcome indicators show that in every case but two (increasing family planning, and births attended by a skilled attendant), the project reached the target, and, in 18 of the 33 indicators for health, education, water and livelihoods, the target was exceeded. </p> <p>Further investigation of the outcomes against the relevant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/millennium-development-goals\">Millennium development goals</a> and Ugandan national targets shows a similar picture: 16 of the 23 targets were exceeded. </p> <p>The purpose of the community empowerment component was to strengthen local governance using a rights\u2013based approach, and it was found that all committees in local government had been trained and strengthened to operate effectively, and all have submitted plans to the district authorities. This component is the linchpin for sustainability.<br> The project provided training, technical support and supervision as well as monitoring and evaluation support to community health structures. More people are testing for HIV, and those who have the virus are able to access suitable drugs. </p> <p>Immunisation is offered against measles, polio, tuberculosis (TB), whooping cough, hepatitis B, tetanus and diphtheria. BCG vaccination levels are at 100 per cent, measles, polio and DPT3 are all at 80 per cent and above. </p> <p>The success of the vaccination programme can be attributed to the outreach work of community vaccinators who take immunisation services directly to people's homes. </p> <p>School management and governance committees are in place in all 15 schools in Katine. Parent/teacher associations (PTAs) and school management committees (SMCs) were inactive at project start-up. Each school in Katine now has a development plan, and PTAs and SMCs meet regularly to follow up their implementation and assess progress being made to improve performance and facilities in schools. </p> <p>Enrolment has increased by 29 per cent since the project started. More girls are now enrolling in school and, for the first time, in 2009-10 and 2011 the number of girls exceeded the number of boys.</p> <p>The five Katine primary schools \u2013 typically thatched\u2013roofed open rooms with earth floors and without furniture \u2013 were funded wholly by the local community. Teachers' salaries were paid by the community. But, thanks to the project, all are now under the control of the government.</p> <p>Achievements in water and sanitation are outstanding. There is a major increase in the availability of safe water sources (boreholes, shallow wells and rainwater harvesting), from 42% to 93% of the community. The number of latrines in homes and schools has increased from 350 to 4,077. Of extreme importance is the re\u2013establishment of water source committees (WSCs), which ensure the successful operation and management of the new water facilities. </p> <p>Each village within the Katine sub-county now has a farmers' group to improve practices, such as introducing new varieties and increasing crop yields. Groundnut seeds, upland rice, vegetable seeds, sunflower seed and cassava planting material were provided during each year of the programme. </p> <p>To strengthen the ability of rural institutions to access advisory services and markets for their produce, a co-operative was launched to co-ordinate farmers' groups, manage the produce store, support the groups in marketing activities, oversee the animal health service provision and assess the quality of farm produce. A farmers' produce store was fully established in August 2011, employing two staff.</p> <p>The voluntary savings and loans associations (VSLA) programme, funded with a separate grant by Barclays Bank, is a rapidly expanding, highly systematic approach to saving and financial planning. Most of the 152 known VSLA groups in Katine are now well established, and there is now a small cadre of village agents who, having completed two cycles of savings themselves, help groups set up both in Katine and in surrounding sub\u2013counties. The VSLAs have led to modest but significant improvement in household income. </p> <p>There were several recommendations arising from evaluation, including the need for an improved plan for monitoring and evaluation at the start of any project and a recommendation for a review of the VSLA groups.</p>",

  "<p>Peter Rippon was better known for his work in radio, rather than television, when he was appointed editor of Newsnight. As former editor of BBC Radio 4's PM and The World at One, he succeeded Peter Barron at the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/07/bbc-tvnews?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> helm of the flagship BBC2 daily current affairs programme in 2008</a>.</p> <p>Newsnight's ratings have dipped in recent years and a string of senior staff, both behind and in front of the camera, have left, including its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/19/channel-4-michael-crick?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">respected political editor</a> Michael Crick and deputy editor Shaminder Nahal, both of whom joined Channel 4 News.</p> <p>It is not known for being an easy job. Within the BBC, Newsnight has been regarded as a difficult ship to steer, with a group of long-serving, high-profile presenters, starting with Jeremy Paxman, and correspondents \u2013 most of whom long pre-date Rippon's appointment.</p> <p>A BBC lifer, Rippon joined the corporation as a news trainee in 1989; he has edited Broadcasting House and The World Tonight, also on Radio 4.</p> <p>He worked in the BBC World Service newsroom and gained TV experience, prior to Newsnight, at the corporation's global TV channel, BBC World Television.</p> <p>Rippon was in the running to head up the BBC News channel \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/01/bbc-appoints-head-news-sam-taylor?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the job went to the BBC's head of editorial development, Sam Taylor, earlier this month</a> \u2013 and was also said to have been a candidate for the controllership of Radio 4 two years ago.</p> <p>There have been other hiccups at the programme. Rippon was forced to apologise earlier this year for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/31/shanene-thorpe-judged-victimised-newsnight\" title=\"\">Newsnight report about housing benefit which featured an interview with single parent Shanene Thorpe</a>, but failed to make clear that she was a working mother.</p> <p>Newsnight's audience suffered a 15% year-on-year decline in the first half of 2011, from 800,000 to 680,000, dipping below 200,000 for one edition in May last year. Last week, Newsnight averaged 620,000 viewers across Monday to Friday, according to overnight viewing figures.</p> <p>Rippon, speaking to Media Guardian last year, blamed it on a decline in audiences on BBC2 overall and said viewers were watching in other ways, such as the BBC's iPlayer. The audience was \"evolving, not declining\", he said.</p> <p>Newsnight's audience bounced back in July 2011 with its coverage of the phone-hacking affair, and its memorable on-screen debate featuring Steve Coogan and former News of the World journalist Paul McMullan.</p> <p>But critics have said the programme, fronted by Jeremy Paxman, is no longer required viewing. Some also say it features fewer investigations and more studio discussion.</p> <p>Born in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and educated at Gillott's Comprehensive School, Rippon studied international politics at Southampton University and philosophy and politics at the University of East Anglia.</p> <p>Rippon won a Sony gold award in 2007 for his work on PM's interactive offshoot, iPM.</p> <p>His BBC blog has been infrequently updated since he took the Newsnight job \u2013 the most recent, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/peter_rippon/\" title=\"\">his explanation for dropping the Jimmy Savile sex abuse report late last year</a>, was the first for nearly 18 months.</p> <p>There has been some sympathy for Rippon from within the BBC. \"He's a great manager and a really good journalist who took over at a time when there were a lot of managerial issues to be dealt with,\" said one insider.</p> <p>\"He has had to make savings and put the programme on an even keel, both financially and managerially.

  "<p>Every strategy needs to be regularly re-assessed to ensure it is delivering on the original vision.</p> <p>It is for this reason that Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) has independently reviewed its community programme, nearly four years after the media company moved from its long-term home in Farringdon to King's Cross.</p> <p>The relocation of the business at the time created the opportunity to expand the company's existing partnerships from four to 11, but have they all been the success we hoped for?</p> <p>To find out, in January 2012, GNM commissioned sustainability consultancy Acona to conduct an independent evaluation. While the sustainability team had already developed a number of qualitative measures, there had not been much quantitative analysis or an effective system for tracking the programme year on year. </p> <p>By having an independent evaluation, it was hoped that partner organisations would feel free to speak about the value and problems of their relationship with GNM.</p> <p>To begin with, Acona looked at the original thinking behind the decision to expand the community programme, which was championed by Tim Brooks, the managing director at that time. He told an all-staff briefing: \"I am determined that we will not live in a bubble at Kings Place and ignore what is going on around us. We have a fantastic opportunity to think hard about how we integrate ourselves into this new community.\"</p> <p>At that time, the community team met local community leaders and charitable groups to gain an understanding of the issues local people faced and how GNM could support them.</p> <p>As a result, GNM came up with several criteria for our new community partners; for them to be local to our offices and to be engaged in work media education, social exclusion and environmental regeneration given the company's own ambition to become environmentally regenerative. We also wanted to develop long-term relationships with partners, with shared projects and joint goals, allowing relationships to grow and deepen. </p> <p>Before the move, GNM had four community partners \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.live-magazine.co.uk/\">Live magazine</a>, a youth run publication based in Brixton and three schools, Richard Cloudesley special needs school, <a href=\"http://www.wintonprimaryschool.com/index.asp\">Winton primary</a> and <a href=\"http://www.egaschool.co.uk/\">Elizabeth Garrett Anderson secondary school</a>. </p> <p>After moving to Kings Place, the number of partner organisations rose sharply. New projects included work with those at risk of social exclusion, such as <a href=\"http://www.nhyouthcentre.org.uk/\">New Horizons Youth Centre</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/camden/\">Age UK Camden</a>. We also teamed up with the management committee of the local housing estate, Bemerton, and <a href=\"http://www.teamcally.org.uk/\">Team Cally</a>, a community organisation that supports residents and businesses in the local Caledonian ward. </p> <p>We expanded our programme to include environmental projects, concentrating on the <a href=\"http://www.wildlondon.org.uk/\">London Wildlife Trust</a>, via its local <a href=\"http://www.wildlondon.org.uk/Pages/Category.aspx?IDCategory=4fd545f7-a11e-4b85-b143-724a886ffa16\">Camley Street natural park</a>, and <a href=\"http://globalgeneration.org.uk/\">Global Generation</a>, a local sustainability charity that works with young people.</p> <p>The community team also concentrated on media projects, such as working with Pentonville prison, supporting prisoners and teaching staff working on publishing the magazine Voice of the Ville. </p> <p>After talking to volunteers and partner organisations, Acona developed a set of 21 measurement indicators to capture both the value and shortcomings of the 11 partnerships.</p> <p>Charity expert Caroline Fiennes, who was on the Acona team, discussed in a blog post on the Guardian's Living our Values website how it was difficult to scientifically assess the impacts of the programme because GNM's support is often only one factor among many.</p> <p>However, Acona concluded that some of the projects would end without GNM's support, such as some of the school reading programmes, Winton primary school's chess club and the work at HMP Pentonville.</p> <p>Acona also found that \"the administrative burden on the community partners seems laudably low. Corporate donors often require charities to complete bespoke reporting forms, which diminishes the net value of the support. We did not hear of this with any of GNM's relationships.\"</p> <p>After speaking to staff volunteers, it also became clear that the programme had been important for some in attracting them to join the company. \"When I saw that the Guardian does this... that was definitely a good reason for me to join,\" said one staff member.</p> <p>One of Acona's key findings was that GNM could manage internal resources better if there was a clearly articulated programme of support for partners agreed on at the start of each financial year. </p> <p>With this in mind, the sustainability team will be meeting with partners during summer 2012 to draw up plans for 2012-13 and to discuss our ongoing relationship in the light of the financial cuts in the budgets. </p> <p>We aim to manage our resources better, but there will inevitably be some changes to the programme of support. We will work closely with our partners to help manage the impact of this.</p> <p>Acona also suggested refreshing the strategy for the programme as a whole, setting clear objectives, securing board-level ownership and increasing senior management involvement in the programme and visible support for it. We will be developing targets for 2012-13 to address these issues.</p> <p>The need for this is highlighted in GNM's recent volunteering survey, which showed only 15% of respondents feel their line manager or senior management were actively participating and promoting volunteering.</p> <p>With staff cuts across the board, it is not surprising that just over a quarter of respondents said that fitting volunteering into their work could be challenging. In fact, half of staff who left the programme said they were doing so because of work pressures.</p> <p>One respondent said: \"I think the Guardian's staff volunteering is laudable, but unworkable. We're working longer hours with fewer staff. I've had to reluctantly cancel three volunteer sessions because of covering for another staff member or work that has popped up unexpectedly.\"</p> <p>Another volunteer wrote: \"It's all very positive in general. Only real irritation really is that my line manager sometimes gets a bit cross when I vanish off to volunteer, even though I do it at the same time every week in my lunch break. It would be good, I think, if there was some sort of communication to managers clarifying: this is something you should be positively encouraging, rather than just tolerating.\"</p> <p>We hope this lack of active support from management will be addressed in part by linking volunteering week 2012 to business training needs, with a digital skills focus. </p> <p>Also during the recent strategy planning process, which took place across the commercial departments, heads of department and teams expressed the wish to work with community organisations both during their team away days and longer term. Setting up these connections with community partners and teams within GNM will help build understanding within the business of the value of volunteering. </p> <p>We have also developed a skills map of current volunteering and will publish this along with information about volunteering on our intranet. This will support staff to talk about volunteering in terms of skills development in their appraisals and help make the case to reluctant line managers who currently struggle to see the benefit. </p> <p>We recognised that, with 40% of staff who responded to a recent all-staff survey saying they were either not sure of how to get involved in the volunteering programme or had no knowledge of it, we need to develop our communications strategy. </p> <p>In response to this we are working closely with the internal communication department and sustainability advocates from across the business to help get information about the programme more widely disseminated.</p>",
  "<p>From the beginning, education has been at the heart of the Guardian News &amp; Media community programme, and in the last financial year GNM continued to support three long-term partners \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.egaschool.co.uk/\">Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (EGA) secondary</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wintonprimaryschool.com/\">Winton primary</a>, and Richard Cloudesley special needs school.</p> <p>GNM has also prioritised media-related projects and over the 12 months maintained its partnerships with Pentonville prison's Voice of the Ville magazine and organised the mentoring of young people at <a href=\"http://www.live-magazine.co.uk/\">Live magazine</a>.</p> <p>We also ran a summer project with Live magazine for young people to experience an intensive two weeks at the Guardian and Observer learning about reporting, editing and all the elements needed to put together a mini magazine. You can read more about the project <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/live-north\">here</a> and read what Diamond Abdulrahim thought about her experience as joint editor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/live-north-deadline-magazine\">here</a>.</p> <p>In December 2011, the young journalists from Live magazine took part in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/film-music-live-magazine\">Live magazine Film &amp; Music take-over</a>, developing feature ideas and articles with support from our journalists. </p> <p>Zindzi Rochque Drayton, who took part in the project, commented on how it had given her practical insight into how the world of journalism works. \"Writing for the Guardian had always been a dream of mine, but I never thought I'd be able to pitch an idea and get it commissioned. I didn't even know the process of getting an article in the newspaper, so working with Michael Hann for a film and music feature was extremely beneficial. It also gave me the confidence to develop more pitches and know that it is possible and I am capable of becoming a freelance journalist.\"</p> <p>Within the media sphere, the <a href=\"http://www.mediatrust.org/\">Media Trust</a>, of which <a href=\"http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/\">Guardian Media Group</a> is a partner, provided free places for all our community partners at their \"Communications for a digital world\" conference, as well as providing volunteer matching services for our partners.</p> <p>Beyond education and the media, GNM's community programme also has a focus on supporting marginalised communities, and as part of this volunteers have been running and supporting sessions at <a href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/camden/Local-directory/Great-Croft-resource-centre/\">Age UK Camden's Great Croft centre</a>. Janet Woodward, one of the older people using the centre, said the volunteers are a \"lifeline for us. We don't know what we would do without them.\" </p> <p>GNM also developed a number of new projects with our partners, including staff delivering sessions for the Level Two Business BTEC with <a href=\"http://globalgeneration.org.uk/\">Global Generation</a> and helping local job seekers in a club organised by Islington council and <a href=\"http://www.teamcally.org.uk/\">Team Cally</a>. </p> <p>The regular support from volunteers is greatly appreciated by the organisations we work with. For example, Marina Johnston, the head of literacy at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school, said: \"It has been a pleasure to work with the Guardian volunteers, and they have provided the students with more than just support with their reading. The volunteers have built up very positive relationships with the girls, enabling them to learn from an adult from a different walk of life, which has really expanded their horizons.\"</p> <p>Despite budget cuts, we have maintained relationships with all our community partners, although direct funding has been cut. For next financial year we will have a full review of all our relationships, and it might be necessary to augment part of what is an extensive programme of support in line with current funding and resources. </p> <p>Below is a summary of activities with all our partners.</p> <h2>School partnerships</h2> <p>47 volunteers (766.5 hrs)<br><strong>Partners</strong> Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school, Winton primary, Richard Cloudesley<br><strong>Activities</strong> Literacy support, teaching assistance, chess club, school speakers, employability skills day, hosting exhibition, funding for school trips</p> <h2>Youth organisations</h2> <p>18 volunteer (104 hrs)<br><strong>Partners</strong> New Horizons youth centre, Live Magazine<br><strong>Activities</strong> Fundraising, journalism and design support, mentoring, special projects - Live North, CV careers advice</p> <h2>Prisons</h2> <p>13 volunteers (54 hrs)<br><strong>Partner</strong> Pentonville<br><strong>Activities</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre\">Education Centre</a> session for staff, mentoring, work experience</p> <h2>Older people</h2> <p>12 volunteers (285 hrs)<br><strong>Partner</strong> Age UK Camden<br><strong>Activities</strong> Befriending, IT support, class support at Great Croft centre, skills sharing, fundraising stall at GNM, hosting <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_niQsz7Sq0\">In Their Own Words</a> film launch in Scott Room</p> <h2>Social inclusion</h2> <p>17 volunteers (62 hrs)<br><strong>Partners</strong> Bemerton, Team Cally<br><strong>Activities</strong> Job club, Education Centre visit, design support, funding for Cally festival, IT support</p> <h2>Environment</h2> <p>14 volunteers (41 hrs); 49 staff away days (232hrs)<br><strong>Partners</strong> Global Generation, London Wildlife Trust (Camley Street Wildlife Park)<br><strong>Activities</strong> Team awaydays, IT support, hosting <a href=\"http://www.wildlondon.org.uk/cockney-sparrow\">Cockney Sparrow</a> film event and LWT conference in Scott Room, delivering and hosting BTEC sessions for South Camden community school students, support for <a href=\"http://honeyclub.org/\">Honey Club</a>, organisational support, funding via membership and purchasing services</p> <h2>Other projects</h2> <p>14 volunteers (47 hrs); 10 mentors<br><strong>Partners</strong> <a href=\"http://pop-up.org.uk/\">Pop Up</a>, <a href=\"http://www.socialmobility.org.uk/\">Social Mobility Foundation</a><br><strong>Activities</strong> Mentoring, Education Centre sessions, hosting careers conference, festival support</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-community-education-centre \">Guardian Education Centre</a></h2> <p>53 volunteers (43.75 hrs)<br><strong>Activities</strong> The Education Centre works with schools, colleges, universities, community groups and teachers, with 7,500 visitors from April 2011-March 2012.

  "<p>In 2011, Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) announced that it would undergo a five-year transformation programme designed to ensure that it is sustainable in the long-term, despite the inexorable decline of print sales and advertising. In order to fund the creation of new digital platforms, it announced its intention to make cost savings of \u00a325 million. </p> <p>While the community programme remains a priority for GNM, the financial pressure the organisation is under led to a reduction in the community budget for 2011-12 and it will fall again in 2012/13. </p> <p>Spending on community projects, including salaries, fell from \u00a3140,000 in 2010-11 to \u00a385,000 for the last financial year. Of this, \u00a355,000 was spent directly on community projects and support in 2011-12, with this figure expected to fall to \u00a333,000 in the current financial year (excluding volunteering week costs).</p> <p>Given these constraints, the sustainability department has been looking for innovative ways of supporting our partners, leading to more creative collaborations such as matching volunteer skills to organisations and a better use of existing resources, for example allowing partners to use conference and meeting rooms for events.</p> <p>Project highlights during the last financial year included <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/live-north\">the Live Magazine summer project</a> and the co-delivery of a Level 2 Business BTEC with <a href=\"http://www.globalgeneration.org.uk/\">Global Generation</a>.</p> <p>There were also a number of smaller projects such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/sustainability-report-age-uk-camden\">Age UK Camden's Great Croft centre</a> teaching staff how to make Christmas decorations for the company Christmas tree and sessions run in our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/gnmeducationcentre\">Education centre</a> with <a href=\"http://www.socialmobility.org.uk/\">Social Mobility Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.openingdoorslondon.org.uk/\">Opening Doors</a>, Global Generation and the construction trainees from Bemerton Villages Management Organisations. To read more about this year's projects, see the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-community-partners-overview \">overview of year's activities section</a>.</p> <p>The sustainability team is not just focused on creating new ways to engage the organisation with its communities but also on ensuring that it demonstrates how these activities benefit our colleagues. We will be developing targets for 2012-15 that will help us achieve this deeper integration with business aims and objectives by helping to develop new skills within GNM. </p> <p>The last year saw the first independent monitoring and evaluation of the community programme, which was a key objective for 2011-12. You can read more about how Acona's methodology was developed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/blog/community-sustainability-shared-value\">here</a> and the findings from this year's report are discussed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-community-monitoring-evaluation \">here</a>. </p> <p>Overall, the number of staff volunteers fell during the last financial year to 210 people, who contributed 1,741 hours. This is equivalent to 13% of staff volunteering. This compared with 307 volunteers and 4,268 hours the previous year when 24% of staff volunteered. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398171387\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350663445955/Volunteering_numbers.png\" alt=\"Volunteer_numbers\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br>This was largely due to the postponement of volunteering week 2012 from March to September because of company-wide restructuring that took place in March 2011. As a result, the department was unable to meet two key objectives for 2011/12 \u2013 to grow volunteers and hold volunteering week.</p> <p>However, if the numbers from volunteering week for 2010-11 are excluded, the figures for 2011-12 show a similar number of staff volunteering for projects that form our community programme. The figure for 2011-12 of 210 staff compares with 207 staff volunteering in 2010-11.</p> <p>For 2011-12, this figure breaks down to 166 staff volunteering for projects that form part of our ongoing community programme and with 49 taking part in team away days.</p> <p>One highlight of the year was a major award for our payroll-giving scheme, which is one of the most popular in the country. GNM was awarded the platinum award quality mark in recognition of the fact that 26% of staff supported 195 charities, giving a total of \u00a383,320.08. GNM also supported individual staff fundraising through \u00a38,000 worth of match-funding donating.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/christmas-charity-appeal-2011\">Guardian and Observer Christmas appeal</a></h2> <p>Generous readers raised a total of \u00a3416,406 for eight youth charities featured in the Guardian and Observer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/10/guardian-observer-2011-christmas-appeal\">2011 Christmas appeal</a>.</p> <p>The annual appeal distributed the cash equally between the charities, all of which help marginalised young people to turn their lives around.</p> <p>The sum includes \u00a324,000 pledged in one day during the Guardian and Observer journalists' \"telethon\" in December.</p> <p>The charities are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/blog/2011/dec/14/christmas-charity-appeal-street-league\">Street League</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/dec/09/christmas-charity-appeal-boxing-academy-london\">The Boxing Academy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/dec/18/christmas-appeal-tomorrows-people\">Tomorrow's People</a>,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/dec/16/christmas-charity-appeal-just-for-kids-law\"> Just for Kids Law</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/dec/20/christmas-charity-appeal-magic-me\">Magic Me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/nov/25/community-links-christmas-charity-appeal\">Community Links</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/nov/27/christmas-charity-appeal-bannatyne-house-glasgow\">Fare</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/dec/02/guardian-christmas-charity-appeal-st-giles-trust\">St Giles Trust</a>.

  "<p>Last week, a friend of mine travelling in the Middle East came across a battered copy of <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Suspicion.html?id=2SB3QgAACAAJ\" title=\"\">Suspicion</a>, a novel I wrote some 20 years ago, in an Israeli bazaar. It is, of course, out of print now, and rightly forgotten.</p> <p>After some ironical back and forth about \"rare books\" and \"modern firsts\", it occurred to me that, in the age of the ebook, such serendipitous finds will become increasingly unusual. Eventually, there'll be no more browsing in secondhand bookshops, one of the world's great pleasures: everything will be out there, forever. At the click of a mouse the latest search engine will be able to locate any volume in the world's digital library, pages unyellowed and binding unfoxed.</p> <p>My friend's discovery of a lost book in a faraway country sent me back to my home shelves in curiosity. I no longer have any hardbacks of Suspicion, but I tracked down a dog-eared Picador edition. For a few solitary minutes, I scanned its forgotten pages with that mixture of nostalgia, affection and embarrassment (mainly the latter) that any author must experience when delving into old work. In many ways, I concluded, there was some justice in the book's oblivion.</p> <p>Such questions of permanence \u2013 the issues surrounding the afterlife of books and print \u2013 have been uppermost in my mind this week. Coincidentally, and for the first time in my career, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/series/guardian-shorts\" title=\"\">Guardian Shorts</a> has just published three ebooks, compilations of my Observer literary journalism: On Writing, On Reading and On Authors.</p> <p>The unfamiliar experience of launching virtual texts into the global marketplace has been a strange but enjoyable one. While there's no formal publication date, and none of the thrill of seeing hard copies on the shelf, there are some obvious compensations.</p> <p>The physical distribution of books has always been the author's bugbear. If publishers can somehow contrive <em>not</em> to have your book in the place where it is most likely to sell, you can be sure they will. That's the usual complaint, anyway.</p> <p>With ebooks, that anxiety has gone. I can sit at my screen here secure in the knowledge that my new titles, and millions of others, are currently available almost anywhere in the known world. And because they are written in English, not Serbo-Croat or Swahili, there's the incalculable privilege of knowing that there's a better than even chance they will be intelligible to readers from China to Peru.</p> <p>The astonishing advantages of the digital market, of course, are brand new. Even the frontiers of the English-speaking world continue to expand. What's unchanged, indeed immutable \u2013 alas \u2013 are the iron laws governing self-expression. There can be no reprieve from the age-old struggle with words and meanings.</p> <p>We can spin the words out there farther and faster, and perhaps more cheaply, than ever before. But if they fail to interest new readers, seem derivative and unoriginal, or tedious and poorly expressed, we will have no bigger audience than the monk in his cell, scratching on vellum with a quill pen.</p>",

Photograph: Dave Hill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hill/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the beginning of last month the chief executive of Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) council - an administration much admired by Boris Johnson and Conservative national high command - was firm in his refusal to commission an inquiry into claims that council officers had offered priority allocation of new, replacement homes in a planned housing development in Seagrave Road to an alleged \"VIP list\" of residents of <a href=\"http://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/\">two estates</a> threatened with demolition as part of the massive Earls Court redevelopment project in return for their supporting it. He has now changed his mind. H&amp;F has confirmed this, saying that it is \"perfectly willing to ensure any concerns are considered\" and that accountants Deloitte will undertake the work. Why the about turn?</p> <p>Perhaps the involvement of the police has had some rotational effect. A few days after the chief executive told Stephen Cowan, the leader of the opposition Labour group who has been demanding an inquiry, that he considered the matter closed, a document purporting to substantiate the \"VIP list\" claims and arguing that council officers might have broken the law was <a href=\"http://shepherds-bush.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/west-ken-report-on-misconduct-in-public.html\">handed to local police</a> and is now in the hands of Scotland Yard. The same document also found its way to the chief executive who, having absorbed its contents which include testimonies from mostly unnamed estate residents and parts of his own lengthy email correspondence with Cowan, asked Deloitte to look into the matter as an extension of an existing internal audit role for H&amp;F.</p> <p>In a statement the council repeats that it, \"has not allocated any homes and nobody has received preferential treatment,\" and that, \"if residents are moved it will happen in accordance with a local lettings plan,\" which, it adds, \"will be agreed by a public committee in the normal way and will take into account need and preference.\" The statement also says:</p> <blockquote> <p>During a lengthy two-year consultation process, <strong>the Council noted people interested in moving to Seagrave Road</strong> and will continue to note any further interest.</p> </blockquote> <p>My emphasis. The council's stating that it, \"noted people interested in moving to Seagrave Road,\" compares intriguingly with an assertion made by the chief executive on 1 August this year in his correspondence with Cowan that although he was \"satisfied\" that \"those who saw themselves as having something to gain from the regeneration of their estates did, of their own volition, gather together a set of names of those they believed to be so interested...any such gathering of names was <strong>not solicited by council staff</strong>...\" </p> <p>My emphasis again. So, two months ago, as part of a correspondence relating to alleged priority allocation of new homes in Seagrave Road, the chief executive said that a set of names of estate residents seeing some advantage in having the estates demolished was gathered together, but not by council officers. Now the council is saying that it has \"noted people interested in moving to Seagrave Road\" over a two years period. </p> <p>Why has it been doing this? The council says that, \"During that [two year] period people indicated various preferences regarding their own housing needs. People will continue to express their preferences. We are keen to talk to all our residents about their housing needs.\" </p> <p>I'm told that the chief executive expects Deloitte's work on this matter to set the council back between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000 for starters. Concerned Hammersmith and Fulham residents will hope that a thorough excavation results. That figure is, though, a drop in the ocean compared with the \u00a31 million H&amp;F has set aside to cover its failure to pay the full amount it owes in tax. The Standard <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/careless-tory-council-admits-1m-tax-blunder-8218332.html\">reported</a> on Friday that the council has admitted to a \"careless\" approach to its own finances having failed to ascertain whether 59 people who work for it were its own staff or hired consultants.</p> <p>As the Standard points out:</p> <blockquote> <p>The mistakes occurred on the watch of former council leader Stephen Greenhalgh, who quit this summer to become Boris Johnson's deputy mayor for policing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Greenhalgh, incidentally, is in charge of the Met's budgets. He was also - and doubtless remains - a passionate backer of the Earls Court project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">telling the Guardian earlier this year</a>, before joining the mayoral team, that it is \"the best deal in the history of redevelopment in London.\"</p> <p>This view is not shared by the great majority of the large percentage of residents who responded to the council's consultation earlier this year, saying they'd sooner not have their homes knocked down. There are also doubts about the legality of the scheme, with a judge <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/oct/12/earsl-court-project-legal-challenge-go-ahead\">clearing the way</a> for a \"substantive hearing\" at the High Court into the lawfulness of the masterplan for the area. So that's another pile of public money up in flames - posh lawyers, like posh accountants, don't come cheap.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the major planning development committee of H&amp;F's royal and fellow Tory neighbour Kensington and Chelsea (K&amp;C) has put back consideration of the part of the Earls Court project that falls within its boundaries to 20 November, having previously scheduled it for this Tuesday, 23 October. K&amp;C tells me that this is because part of its officers' report to the committee members needs to be revised so that a \"broader view of the transport impacts,\" of the scheme is included. </p> <p>Any other business? Yes. Caroline Pidgeon, leader of the Liberal Democrats on the London Assembly, has <a href=\"http://shepherds-bush.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/west-kenearls-court-libdems-enter-fray.html\">written to business secretary</a> and fellow Lib Dem Vince Cable expressing her concern that local small businesses will be damaged by the loss of the Earls Court exhibition centre buildings, which will also be bulldozed if the project goes ahead, and asking Cable to urge his cabinet colleague Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, to \"call in\" the project for review. </p> <p>During this year's mayoral election the Lib Dem, Labour and Green candidates all expressed concern about the project. The <a href=\"http://www.aeo.org.uk/page.cfm/Link=8/t=m/goSection=3\">Association of Event Organisers </a>think it's a bad idea. So do most residents of the threatened estates. Apart from local Tories, their friend \"Good old Boris\" and proposed developers Capco, almost nobody seems keen on it. It's getting messier too. Will Eric act?</p>",
  "<p>Brian Jones was a pivotal figure at three moments of Guardian history. He was one of the tiny band of Guardian subeditors who came to London from Manchester in 1961 and helped launch the London-printed editions of the paper: he literally brought the paper south. Five years later, as production editor, he oversaw a sweeping redesign of the old, staid Guardian as it struggled for survival in a hostile Fleet Street environment. And a decade after that, as northern editor and then deputy editor, he helped complete the move to London, ending separate publication in Manchester and helping secure the paper's future for a new era.</p> <p>Brian, who has died aged 78, was a Guardian man when the paper needed him: a board member of Guardian newspapers in the turbulent 70s and the first director of the Guardian Foundation in the 90s. But he was also an influential journalist in his own right, editor of two famous regional newspapers \u2013 the Bath Evening Chronicle and the Bristol Evening Post \u2013 and a renowned teacher of journalism at home and abroad.</p> <p>Brian was born in Liverpool and educated at <a href=\"http://www.kwc.im/\" title=\"\">King William's college, Isle of Man</a> (the school that still sets the Guardian's ferocious Christmas quiz). For five years, after national service, he learned his trade, reporting and subediting on the Isle of Man Examiner, the Ilford Recorder and the Lancashire Evening Post before, in 1959, getting a job on the Guardian as it dropped \"Manchester\" from the masthead and prepared to sink or swim in alien but advertising-rich London. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/04/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Alastair Hetherington</a>, then the editor, rated him highly. He was a fast worker with \"excellent news judgment\" who \"did not spare himself\" (high praise from the Stakhanovite Hetherington). But Brian was more than a hard-working professional.</p> <p>He was wonderfully calm in a crisis. He was companionable. Everyone who worked with him liked him. He was full of wry humour. Long, hard nights of producing the paper with Brian were simply enjoyable. His team often went home early in the morning as happy as if they had been to a good party. The controversial redesign after the days of near-merger and collapse in 1966 was a success because (while Hetherington havered for a time) he backed and delivered it. Brian then left to edit in Bath, but returned to the Guardian to take charge of its Manchester editions and, as it transpired, to end their separate identity when fate and continuing financial peril meant that I (as the very new editor) was required to close down most of the Manchester operation and make dozens of journalists redundant. I could not have done that without Brian. He was the man on the spot his journalists trusted. His word and his concern were manifest, and totally dependable.</p> <p>After that, he came down to London himself, as one of my two deputy editors, cementing the move of offices and production to Farringdon Road and taking a place on the paper's board. But Brian, with four children and a wife he loved, all living too far away in Wiltshire, felt pulled in two directions. It was a human dilemma he could not resolve until, suddenly, he abandoned London and journalism and headed west for the first job he could find, in public relations. But it didn't work out. Divorce left Brian free to return to journalism and its grinding hours again. He became editor of the Bristol Evening Post for much of the 80s. And then, because he had always relished the training of future journalists, he made an international reputation for himself through his work for the Guardian Foundation throughout eastern Europe once the cold war had ended.&#xa0;</p> <p>Brian eased himself away from newspapers in the late 90s to start a bookshop \u2013 Past Masters \u2013 in Wirksworth, Derbyshire, and to create a fresh life with his new partner, Fran. He wrote as well as sold books \u2013 on subjects as widely different as independent journalism in Romania and the history of Bath rugby club. It was a full life, cut short by a debilitating neurological disease, after which he used a wheelchair.</p> <p>Brian was the best kind of journalist, a man who never made headlines himself but \u2013 honest, shrewd and caring \u2013 seemed to combine all the virtues of a regional experience with a professional decisiveness that ranked with Fleet Street's best. The Guardian owes him a debt; but so do many hundreds of writers and subs on papers far and wide who will remember him and his tutelage with gratitude and affection.</p> <p>He is survived by Fran and his children.</p> <p>\u2022 Brian Jones, journalist, born 10 January 1934; died 14 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>As the shift towards brands becoming publishers gathers pace, so the role of content to drive social media conversations and SEO becomes even more important.</p> <p>Some of the successful brands today \u2013 just look at the rise and rise of Asos \u2013 recognise that the way to take centre ground in the lives of their customers is through great content, ie 'owned' media, and not advertising. We worked closely with Asos back in the early days; first by launching their own customer magazine (how counter-intuitive is that, a pure-play online fashion retailer launching its own glossy print magazine); later by launching the Asos Facebook page, now standing at over 1.9m 'likes'.</p> <p>What their super-smart CEO Nick Robertson realised even back as far as 2006, was that investing in and owning his own media channels was far more valuable that just taking some ads out in Grazia. The decision to produce and mail 400,000 odd magazines into the homes of their customers was one of the keys to making the brand an essential part of their lives. It also gave Asos the fashion credibility needed to bring onboard the fashion labels who were anxious about the impact that online might have on their own businesses.</p> <p>Today Asos has one of the most comprehensive and successful owned media operations around, which is helping them not only to stay relevant to their millions of customers, but also acting as a foundation for the global expansion that is powering their growth.</p> <p>The point is that this is just one example of how today's most successful businesses have cottoned on to the fact that great content is at the heart of a successful social media and SEO strategy. Content marketing works.</p> <p>Content agencies help their clients build and monetise their owned media channels. They also enable them to have a single view of content for their customers, baking efficiency and consistency into the mix. Since starting as print journalists, we have added in web, email, mobile, social, video and apps into our core offering, enabling clients to provide a coherent and integrated customer experience on whatever platform they choose.</p> <p>Of course, this isn't to deny that great advertising will always play a part in the building of brands. But it's not enough anymore. The world has shifted \u2013 often paid media is simply the trailer for a richer, longer term engagement through owned and earned channels, with recommendations driving search engine prominence.</p> <p>As Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever (one of the biggest spenders in the world) put it recently: \"Unilever is reallocating budgets to enable us to make content in an always-on world. Agencies need to organise themselves around the consumer, not the client.\"</p> <p>Taking this forward to the next logical stage, the smart people at McKinsey have acknowledged that: \"retailers, banks, airlines are rapidly recognising the importance of content to their brands\u2026It's a new publishing model, and one that brands may be heading towards even faster than traditional media companies. So, the time seems right to ask: 'What is your publishing strategy and who is your brand's editor-in-chief?'\"</p> <p>This just goes to show how content has shifted upstream from being a product of marketing to something that is very much a boardroom issue. From my many conversations with existing and prospective clients it is clear that we've moved on \u2013 from asking about the role of content, to asking how to make it happen.</p> <p>The challenge now is how to create, manage, measure and monetise content in an ever-more complex world. In fact, recent research from Econsultancy found that only 38% of brands have a content marketing strategy at all, even though 55% of clients surveyed are planning one, almost 90% said that content marketing would become more important over the next 12 months and 73% agree that \"brands are becoming publishers\".</p> <p>So clearly content marketing agencies like Seven must help brands get organised. Clients need to recognise the opportunity that an effective content strategy can deliver, whilst also ensuring that it takes genuine skill to create content that consumers (or businesses) are happy to engage with. The trap that most brands fall into is trying to do too much themselves. Creating genuinely engaging content that works across multiple platforms is a skill that few brands can manage internally.</p> <p>The secret of content marketing is to connect to the lives and passions of the target audience and not just to see the world through the eyes of the brand, which is natural and inevitable for most if not all in-house content teams.</p> <p>Of course I have a vested interest here, but as one senior marketer said at the Econsultancy research launch: \"most content produced by brands is rubbish\". Most brands today have a website, send out emails, have fans on Facebook, Twitter followers or even a Youtube Channel, but the real art (or is it a science) lies in building a editorially-driven content universe where the end user gets a consistent, on-brand experience regardless of platform. That's how brands deepen the affection people feel for them.</p> <p>The reality today is that for those brands who wish they were a little more loved, content can be the difference between winning and losing.</p> <p><em>Robin Bonn is business development director at </em><a href=\"http://www.seven.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Seven</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Britain has now posted three consecutive quarters of declining gross domestic product \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/24/uk-gdp-revised-economy-double-dip\" title=\"\">the most recent figures show the economy has shrunk by 0.5%</a>. With the latest set of GDP figures due to be released later this week, the nation remains sunk in the longest recession since the second world war.</p> <p>But GDP is also coming under a different sort of scrutiny in these days of economic woe. GDP measures all legal transactions in the financial economy \u2013 no more and no less. And yet, since its inception in the 1930s, it has become the single most important policy tool for governments, financial institutions and corporations. Governments and many people believe that only this one miraculous figure can really show whether things are getting better or getting worse.</p> <p>But GDP is a partial and misleading measure of national wealth and wellbeing. The problem is that it does not measure key goods in our economy, those unpriced but priceless services carried out by domestic workers and by nature \u2013 for example, the coastal defence of coral reefs, the pollution-filtering of wetlands, the nutrient recycling done by the soil and the unpaid work we do in our homes.</p> <p>And yet GDP does include bad elements such as pollution, crime, cigarettes and their related health costs and environmental disasters, which boost GDP and so generate economic growth.</p> <p>These omissions and inclusions generate alarming anomalies. Here are two: we are better economic agents if we eat out at expensive restaurants rather than cooking food we've grown at home; cleaning up the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico</a> was worth more economically \u2013 in GDP terms \u2013 than the carbon absorption provided by the Amazon rainforest.</p> <p>Under current GDP measures, countries that cut down forests for timber exports, dynamite their reefs for fish, pollute and degrade their soil for intensive agriculture and allow farms and factories to contaminate their waterways get rich.</p> <p>The services provided by nature and households are not included in GDP because we consider their work to be free. But these services are not free \u2013 and we are beginning to pay their hidden costs in environmental destruction and climate change.</p> <p>Conceived in Washington DC during the Depression, the GNP (as it was then) was flawed from the outset. Even its creator, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1971/kuznets-autobio.html\" title=\"\">Simon Kuznets</a>, argued that it was a partial measure of national wealth, as did economist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-maynard-keynes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes</a>, who oversaw the construction of the first British national accounts during the second world war.</p> <p>Both Keynes and Kuznets considered these figures to be temporary measures, for use only in emergencies such as wars and depressions. But they quickly became enshrined in public life, and after the second world war they were imposed on almost every nation on earth.</p> <p>The first politician to rail publicly against the GDP was Senator Robert Kennedy in March 1968: \"Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our Gross National Product \u2026 counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.\" For Kennedy, GDP measured \"everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile\".</p> <p>It took 40 years for Kennedy's words to reach Washington DC: in March 2008 a US Senate committee discussed GDP's failure to measure environmental damage, poverty, income inequality, health and the quality of life. Two years later, Obama's healthcare bill allowed $70m over eight years to develop a new system of US national indicators. Economists from the group the <a href=\"http://www.stateoftheusa.org/\" title=\"\">State of the USA</a> are now working to generate 10 to 15 key measures from a set of some 300 indicators, including health, education, crime and justice, art and culture, the environment, and the economy. These new, more comprehensive measures are designed to guide US policy in an era of environmental destruction and economic downturn.</p> <p>GDP has been similarly challenged and deconstructed in Europe. In 2009, the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy recruited a team of economists \"to tear the GDP apart as they saw fit\". They too found that GDP should be replaced and that other indicators should be introduced to monitor social and environmental, as well as economic, change.</p> <p>The UN is working to value ecosystem services \u2013 or natural capital \u2013 and this year adopted a new international standard to give natural capital equal status to GDP. Speaking at the UN's conference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rio-20-earth-summit-diary-20-june\" title=\"\">Rio+20, Nick Clegg</a> said the UK was committed to including natural capital in its national accounts by 2020.</p> <p>One notable exception to the reign of GDP across the globe is Bhutan, which for the last four decades has used \"gross national happiness\" as the important measure, instead of GDP. With its long experience of alternative measures, Bhutan is now instrumental in current debates about national wealth and wellbeing.</p> <p>These initiatives to tear GDP apart are still in progress, but they make it clear that GDP's 80-year reign as the unchallenged measure of national wealth is at an end.</p>",
  "<p>There has been concern for a number of years about the fate of socially responsible businesses that get swallowed up by larger mainstream corporations. Do they lose their independence and radical edge, or do they help drive innovative thinking within the parent company?</p> <p>The answers are difficult to fully assess in the case of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/mar/18/highstreetretailers.retail?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">L'Oreal's takeover of the Body Shop</a> or the purchase of Green &amp; Blacks by Cadbury, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jan/20/kraft-green-black-cadbury-ethical\" title=\"\">which in turn was bought by Kraft</a>.</p> <p>However, ice cream maker Ben &amp; Jerry's, owned by Unilever, says that it is now showing that a more transparent path is possible with the announcement that it has joined the rapidly expanding socially responsible <a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/\" title=\"\">B Corporation movement</a> in America.</p> <p>The company is the first wholly owned subsidiary to be certified by the non-profit B Lab to show that it meets rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.</p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's hopes its leadership will encourage other major corporations to give some measure of independence to their more progressive subsidiaries.</p> <p>The company becomes the 635th business to join the movement, which is gaining critical mass in securing legislation to support its socially responsible business model. Eleven US states have already enacted laws supporting entrepreneurs and investors to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy, and a 12th is on the way.&#xa0;</p> <p>The legislation is needed because US corporate law effectively obliges directors to prioritise shareholder interests above all else.</p> <p>Chief executive Jostein Solheim tells the Guardian: \"As a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever, the B Corp certification may even be a bit sweeter. When Ben &amp; Jerry's was acquired, many folks thought it would be a challenge for the company to keep its values.</p> <p>\"We're thrilled to join the movement. To undergo the process of certification, where every facet of our business is scrutinised to ensure that we're walking the talk, is rigorous but rewarding. It allows an experienced, holistic, values-led third party entity that B Lab is the chance to affirm that we remain true to our mission and look to accelerate our social impact.\"</p> <p>Solheim adds: \"We feel other businesses will learn and benefit from this.&#xa0;That position of being the first wholly owned subsidiary to become a certified B Corp is tremendous. The level of transparency and willingness to be open and honest is a testament to the relationship between Unilever and B&amp;J's, which we continually work for. It really helps put Ben &amp; Jerry's back into the pioneering realm, this time for other businesses who may find themselves in a similar setting.\"</p> <p>As part of its certification, Ben &amp; Jerry's has made its full B Impact Assessment and relevant excerpts from its governing<a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/benjerry\" title=\"\"> documents visible to the public</a>.</p> <p>Highlights show that 45% of the cost of goods sold go toward investing in and supporting small scale suppliers through the Caring Dairy program; its lowest paid hourly worker receives 46% above the living wage, and between half and three quarters of staff took part in an organised community programme in the last year.</p> <p>Between 65%-80% of its staff are \"satisfied\" or \"engaged\" at work, and the highest paid individual earns between 16 and 20 times more than the lowest paid full time worker.</p> <p>Only 4% of suppliers have third-party social or environmental company level certification, but this rises to 24% on the basis of materials or products purchased.</p> <p>Sensitive information that could advantage competitors or prejudice litigation, is blacked out, such as net income and the percentage of under-represented managers.</p> <p>In terms of overall performance, Ben &amp; Jerry's scored 93% of available points for its governance structure, 55% for environment and 45% for community.</p> <p>Does Solheim feel the knowledge the company gains will have an impact up the chain in Unilever?</p> <p>\"We operate in a manner of open communication and sharing,\" he says. \"As both organisations continue to pursue linked prosperity values be it in sourcing, social justice or sustainability we'll learn and succeed together.&#xa0;I've already spent considerable time with the Unilever CEO Paul Polman to discuss why we're proud of this announcement.\"</p> <p>Andrew Kassoy, who came up with the original B Corp idea five years ago with two course mates from Stanford University, said it was too early to predict what impact the certification may have on Unilever, but he is hopeful that \"the B impact assessment, as a tool to engage Unilever's supply chain on sustainability and to measure the increasingly positive impact Unilever has on the world by leveraging its enormous buying power, would be one compelling opportunity.\"</p> <p>With Ben &amp; Jerry's joining soon after outdoor clothing and equipment company Patagonia, Kassoy is hopeful that other large companies will join the fold. \"Anytime a company with a large following like Ben &amp; Jerry's joins the movement, it's a big deal,\" he says.&#xa0;\"We expect Ben &amp; Jerry's to embrace B Corp as they've embraced fair trade and that will help invite tens of millions of new consumers to be the change by supporting a better way to do business.\"</p> <p>Kassoy believes that soon others will follow. \"Larger and publicly-traded companies will begin to join the B Corp movement \u2013 some as certified B Corps, and many more will use the B impact assessment as a tool to engage their supply chains,\" he says.&#xa0;\"There are already more than 7,000 businesses using the assessment as a free and confidential management tool and we expect larger corporations to see this as a powerful way to leverage their purchasing power to engage their suppliers to measure what matters.\"</p> <p>While Ben &amp; Jerry's won the right to have an independent board of directors at the time of the Unilever acquisition more than a decade ago, the relationship has been through stormy times. In the past, the ice cream maker has accused its parent company of trampling on its values by trying to force it to follow Unilever's global policies at the expense of what it believes is right. Those tensions have dissipated since Polman took charge.</p> <p>Jerry Greenfield told the Guardian recently that there has always been \"a fascination with what the relationship is like between Unilever and Ben &amp; Jerry's. Do we have the freedom and how things have changed under their ownership? When we were over here the last time to announce our commitment to 100% fair trade, we thought we were doing this great thing, but the questions were about isn't Unilever trotting you out to make it look good and would you had done this a lot quicker if it was not for Unilever?\"</p> <p>Greenfield recalls company founder Ben Cohen admitting to the press they would have done it earlier and \"Unilever did not really like that. The difference now is that since Polman is so committed to this sustainability programme, he has managed to change the general feeling. Now there is not nearly the same level of distrust.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The maker of London's black cabs has fallen into administration, putting almost 300 British jobs at risk.</p> <p>Manganese Bronze, which has been making black cabs since 1948, said talks with various parties to secure last-minute rescue funds had ended in failure. The company \u2013 which manufactures the cabs in China \u2013 employs 288 people in Coventry. It is expected to call in administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p> <p>Manganese was locked in emergency talks with executives from Geely, the Chinese carmaker, over the weekend in an attempt to secure a bailout. Geely already owns 20% of the company but negotiations broke down and Manganese said the two could not agree on \"acceptable\" terms. Manganese's chief executive, John Russell, had said the group needed several million pounds a month to stay afloat.</p> <p>Manganese said on Monday it remained hopeful that \"its global reputation will provide the platform for a successful business in the future\".</p> <p>The black cab maker has had a disastrous 12 months. Earlier this month it was forced to recall 400 black cabs after discovering a steering fault. It also suspended its shares and warned its financial position would be \"unclear\" until it had found a way to fix the fault.</p> <p>This summer Manganese enjoyed a spectacular piece of marketing at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, when the Spice Girls danced on top of five black cabs, but the glow was shortlived as the company revealed a \u00a33.9m black hole in its accounts just days later, forcing a delay to its half-year results.</p> <p>They were eventually released a fortnight ago, to show the group generated a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.6m for the first half of 2012. Sales dropped 11% to \u00a334.3m.</p> <p>A former British success story, Manganese has failed to turn a profit since 2007. The company has faced growing competition after cab drivers were given permission to use the Mercedes Vito, breaking Manganese's monopoly. Japanese carmaker Nissan is also working on a version of the black cab.</p> <p>Manganese shares \u2013 which were suspended at 10p, valuing the company at just \u00a33m \u2013 have fallen 70% in the past year. Just five years ago, they were changing hands at more than 800p each.</p>",
  "<p>When Barack Obama and Mitt Romney take to the stage in Florida on Monday night, the eyes of the Kremlin will be watching.</p> <p>Obama has presented his \"reset\" in relations with Russia as a key foreign policy success. Romney has instead called the country \"our number one geopolitical foe\".</p> <p>In Russia, where politics is seen as a dark game conducted in sealed-off rooms far from the public eye, and where Washington is seen as constantly plotting Russia's demise, the differing positions are generally viewed some amusement.</p> <p>\"Some people say it's easier to have an open guy then have a guy who in fact follows the same anti-Russian line but is hypocritical,\" said Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor of Russia in global affairs. \"For them, Obama is the same as all of them.\"</p> <p>Obama's administration has pointed to a string of successes with Russia \u2013 negotiating a new Start arms reduction treaty, co-operating on Afghanistan, getting the country into the World Trade Organisation \u2013 as an example of the president's foreign policy savvy. Yet those successes came before Vladimir Putin made anti-Americanism a foundation of his third presidential term. Since then, the US has seen its ambassador to Russia harassed, its state department blamed for creating the opposition to Putin, its aid agency expelled and a key arms clean-up agreement, Nunn-Lugar, torn to shreds.</p> <p>That has allowed Romney's advisers to call the reset a \"complete disaster\" and use the issue as one of the starkest points of difference between him and his opponent.</p> <p>Putin gave a backhanded endorsement to a Romney win last month, when he praised the Republican challenger for issuing a \"straightforward\" assessment of his views on Russia.</p> <p>\"That Mr Romney considers us enemy number one and apparently has bad feelings about Russia is a minus, but, considering that he expresses himself bluntly, openly and clearly, means that he is an open and sincere man, which is a plus,\" Putin told journalists. \"I am actually very grateful to him for formulating his position in a straightforward manner.\"</p> <p>Lukyanov said many inside Russia took the formulation with pride, a sign that Russia managed to regain a status it lost with the fall of the Soviet Union. \"It's the highest assessment of Russia since Gorbachev,\" he said. \"No one has put Russia on the same level as the US since, probably, Reagan. In this regard, it was amusing and good to hear.\"</p> <p>Yet concerns exist that for all his bluster, Romney, as president, would relegate Russia to the backburner \u2013 if there is anything the Kremlin hates more than being disliked, it is being ignored.</p> <p>\"It's clear that Romney is not anti-Russian \u2013 he doesn't know Russia, he has no interest in it, and in his case it'll most likely be same attitude as we saw in the beginning of the Bush administration, when they didn't understand why they should pay attention to this country,\" Lukyanov said.</p> <p>Many Russians have seen Romney's attacks on their country as a pre-election ploy, even the usually flamboyantly anti-American Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the nationalist LDPR party. \"This is, of course, a pre-election approach,\" Zhirinovsky said earlier this year, in an uncharacteristically calm fashion. \"But of course, Mitt Romney isn't right. Forty years ago, our army was in Europe. If the tanks start up, eardrums in all European capitals will burst,\" he added.</p> <p>Average Russians appear to be taking heed as well. According to a new poll released on Wednesday, only 4% of Russians think a Romney win would be in Russia's national interest, versus 42% who would prefer an Obama win.</p> <p>Whether it's the anti-Americanism that has flooded Russia's televisions and political speeches since Putin announced his intention to return to the presidency late last year, or Romney's statements on his view of the country, something has changed.</p> <p>The percentage of Russians who say they have a \"positive attitude\" towards the US dropped from 56% to 46% over the past 12 months, according to the Levada Centre, an independent pollster. The number of those with a \"negative attitude\" grew from 27% to 38% in the same time, it found.</p> <p>And many appear at a loss to understand what form Romney's rhetorical anti-Russia stance would take. \"People here, at least specialists, know that what Romney is saying is coming not from some especially anti-Russian stance, but mostly because of his ignorance and disinterest,\" Lukyanov said.</p> <p>\"He's collecting stereotypes which are widespread, and that's enough for him now,\" he said. \"What kind of policy he will pursue is something we don't actually know.\"</p>",
  "<p>First it was Iraq, then Afghanistan. Who is next? Britain and other liberal democracies face the prospect of sleepwalking into endless conflicts as the traditional distinctions between war and peace get blurred.</p> <p>This is the stark warning of an important and thought-provoking study of recent military operations. War from the Ground Up, Twenty-First-Century Combat as Politics, by a Gurkha infantry officer with experience of three tours in Afghanistan, should be read by all aspiring military commanders and their Whitehall masters.</p> <p>War used to be clearly defined \u2013 brutal, decisive, and finite, said Carl von Clausewitz, the great Prussian military thinker still essential reading at British military academies.</p> <p>Now, we have the War on Terror, and the Long War as tribal and ethnic conflict is often described.</p> <p>Emile Simpson, author of War from the Ground Up (<a href=\"http://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/war-from-the-ground-up/\">Hurst Publishers</a>), warns of the \"fusion of war and routine international politics\" and of force being used for political rather than military, outcomes.</p> <p>That is not war in the sense Clausewitz described, but \"effectively a continuation of normal political activity, which is endless\".</p> <p>The result, says Simpson, \"has been a proliferation of violence in the world which has the potential to drag the West into endless conflicts that go beyond political utility, not least in terms of their human and financial cost\".</p> <p>Blurring war and peace has the most serious political and strategic implications and raises huge questions . Yet there has been little public debate about how Britain should respond - should it engage, with other liberal democracies, in one \"global counter insurgency\", only fight when they can defeat the enemy in conventional battle despite the risk to legitimate security concerns, or, as Simpson put its, \"beat the enemy at his own game through armed political activity\"?</p> <p>\"As the issue of how to define war rarely extends beyond specialist discussion\", writes Simpson, \"the public have not been much involved; yet the public's will and taxes must ultimately sustain strategic choices\".</p> <p>\"The question of whether to commit to a 'generational war', to accept an era of 'persistent conflict', without a clear end-state, or conversely, not to engage in countries in which there are genuine security concerns, should surely be an issue of public discussion, as the West seems to be sleepwalking into such a period of global generational conflict\".</p> <p>In Afghanistan, the success or failure of counter insurgency operations is measured by their political impact, often on very local communities. \"The outcome of an action is usually better gauged by the chat at the bazaar the next day, and its equivalent higher up the political food chain, than body counts\", Simpson writes. The control of political space can be more important than controlling physical space.</p> <p>The insurgents see the conflict through different lenses, while Kabul has different priorities. \"For some of the insurgents...their war is part of a wider war against the West. For others, it is a war limited to Afghanistan. For the majority, it is about local issues.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, while the powerful criminal patronage networks might be a target for Nato-led forces, but unless they pose an existential threat to the Afghan state, they may well not bother the government in Kabul, Simpson observes.</p> <p>And if a commander in Helmand tells the local population their opium poppies will not be burned, he may be going against Afghan government policy. But he may need to do this to avoid totally alienating the local population.</p> <p>The insurgency is a franchise movement of many factions and interests.</p> <p>Misconceptions and confusion surrounding the conflict in Afghanistan are also seized on by Julian Lewis, a former Conservative defence spokesman and member of the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.</p> <p>Back in 2010, he says, \"Western strategy seemed determined to restrict itself to the straightjacket of fighting irregular forces by conventional means - that, by trying too much, Nato would achieve too little\".</p> <p>Yet suddenly the scene shifted - an unrealistic commitment to a 40-year campaign was abruptly replaced by an unrealistic commitment to a four-year transition to hand over to Afghan security forces, he writes in a paper, International terrorism: the case for containment, published by the group, Conservative Way Forward.</p> <p>Some western forces, Lewis suggests, should now move to \"strategic bases\" and test the ability of Afghan troops to operate on their own.</p> <p>\"Withdrawal into the selected bases would remove the constant irritant of a uniformed infidel presence in the towns and countryside, thus reducing Western casualties on the one hand and the motivation of Afghans to join the insurgency on the other\".</p>",
  "<p>Here we go again. Yet more research has been published in the world's most prestigious, peer-reviewed journals showing that extremely widely-used pesticides have very damaging effects on bees, yet the only response from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/18/bees-pesticides-neonicitinoids\">government is inaction</a>.</p> <p>The new paper, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11585.html\">published in Nature</a>, shows that bumblebees foraging naturally and exposed to realistic doses of pesticides suffer in two key ways. First they are about twice as likely to die: two-thirds of the bees are lost when exposed to two pesticides compared to only a third when not exposed. Second, the exposed bees are half as successful in gathering food.</p> <p>The new results reveal, again, shameful failings in the regulatory regime. The ecotoxicology tests currently required only look at honey bees. Yet bumblebees, the subject of the new research, are just as important in providing the pollination that creates much of the food we eat. Tomatoes, for example, rely on bumblebees. Furthermore, bumblebees are very different, bigger in size individually, but living in colonies of just dozens, compared to the tens of thousands in honey bee colonies.</p> <p>Another failing is that current tests require just 96 hours of exposure, but the new research only saw the damaging effect after three weeks. \"If we had done our study for just 96 hours, our conclusions would have been very different,\" says Nigel Raine, at Royal Holloway, University of London, one of the research team.</p> <p>Yet another failing is that pesticides are only tested individually, not in the combination bees are exposed to in reality. The new work clearly shows a damaging cumulative effect from a combination of just two pesticides.</p> <p>The reaction from pesticide manufacturers is the same as ever: the experiments are \"unrealistic\". Raine rejects this: \"It is hard to see what you could do better.\" I think he has a point. The only truly \"realistic\" experiment would have no intervention at all, meaning you could collect no data. The manufacturers are making the perfect the enemy of the good. They also claim their own data shows there are no harmful effects, yet have not published it.</p> <p>The manufacturers do have some scientists supporting their view that there is too little evidence of harm to act. James Cresswell, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Exeter, said:\" It certainly wouldn't be fair to say that this research spells doom for wild bees.\"</p> <p>Creswell also <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6101/1453.2.full?sid=43aba4a3-f54f-40e8-aab4-a4730f270937\">criticised research published the journal Science</a> in March, which showed that honeybees consuming one pesticide suffered an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/29/crop-pesticides-honeybee-decline\">85% loss in the number of queens</a> their nests produced. Subsequently, Creswell was granted \u00a3136,000 by pesticide manufacturer Syngenta to fund a research post. Cresswell said there was no connection between the two. \"I consider myself an impartial scientist,\" he told me, adding he had not spoken to Syngenta until after his criticism was sent to Science. </p> <p>The UK government has already reviewed some of the evidence of the serious harm pesticides cause to bees but, unlike other countries, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/18/bees-pesticides-neonicitinoids\">chose to do nothing</a>. But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/21/bees-pesticides-harm-enquiry\">parliament is now investigating</a> the issue, with the call for <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news/new-inquiry-insects-and-insecticides/\">evidence open until 2 November</a>.</p> <p>\"Ministers may want to start doing their homework on pesticide policy and biodiversity, because we will be calling them before parliament to answer questions,\" said Joan Walley MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, when announcing the enquiry. \"In particular, we will be scrutinising the evidence behind the government's decision not to revise pesticide regulations or follow other European countries in temporarily suspending the use of insecticides linked to bee decline.\"</p> <p>The questions are mounting: this latest research shows the need for answers is becoming ever more urgent.</p>",
  "<p>Within days of the 9/11 attacks on the US, the CIA told British intelligence officers of its plans to abduct al-Qaida suspects and fly them to secret prisons where they would be systematically abused.</p> <p>The meeting, at the British embassy in Washington, is disclosed in <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846273339\" title=\"\">a forthcoming book by the Guardian journalist Ian Cobain</a>. It raises serious questions about repeated claims by senior MI5 and MI6 officers that they were slow to appreciate the US response to the attacks, and never connived in torture.</p> <p>The meeting signalled to British officials that the US was preparing to embark on a global kidnapping programme which became known as extraordinary rendition. Cobain reveals that at the end of a three-hour presentation by Cofer Black, President George Bush's top counter-terrorist adviser, Mark Allen \u2013 his opposite number in MI6 \u2013 commented that it all sounded \"rather bloodcurdling\".</p> <p>A few weeks later, in early October 2001, at a secret meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels, US officials drew up a list of \"necessary measures to increase security\", Cobain discloses. They included flights to and from secret prisons in Asia, Africa, and throughout Europe. \"Quietly, Britain pledged logistics support for the rendition programme, which resulted in the CIA's Gulfstream V and other jets becoming frequent visitors to British airports en route to the agency's secret prisons,\" writes Cobain.</p> <p>Over the next four years CIA rendition flights used British airports at least 210 times. The book reveals that Washington asked the UK for permission to build a large prison on Diego Garcia, the British territory in the Indian Ocean where the US has a large bomber base. The project was dropped, for logistical rather than legal reasons.</p> <p>However, Diego Garcia was used as a stopover for CIA flights taking detainees to secret prisons around the world. And in secret memos, Labour ministers said in early 2002 that their \"preferred option\" was to render British nationals to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cobain records. MI5 and MI6 officers carried out around 100 interrogations at the US prison on Cuba between 2002 and 2004.</p> <p>Yet for years ministers emphatically denied any British involvement in America's rendition programme. As late as December 2005, Jack Straw, then foreign secretary, was telling MPs there was \"simply no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition\". Just a year earlier, we now know, MI6 \u2013 under Straw's watch and with the blessing of ministers, officials say \u2013 helped to render two leading Libyan dissidents to Muammar Gaddafi's secret police.</p> <p>Despite the post-9/11 Washington embassy and Nato meetings, and other evidence of their early involvement in rendition, MI5 and MI6 witnesses told the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) that it was some time before they knew what the US was up to. As late as July 2007, the misinformed ISC stated in a report on rendition that MI5 and MI6 \"were \u2026 slow to detect the emerging pattern of renditions to detention\".</p> <p>Cobain's book, Cruel Britannia, says the British military operated a \"torture centre\" throughout the 1940s \"in complete secrecy, in a row of Victorian villas in one of the most exclusive neighbourhoods in London\". They also ran an \"interrogation centre\" near Hanover in Germany. Evidence from newly released records shows that British involvement in abuse was common earlier \u2013 in the colonies, later in Northern Ireland, and much more recently in Iraq.</p> <p>The book reveals that Allen (who was later to develop a cosy relationship with Gaddafi's intelligence chiefs) expressed concern after the post-9/11 meeting in the UK embassy in Washington about what would happen once the Americans had \"hammered the mercury in Afghanistan\". Al-Qaida would simply scatter elsewhere, destabilising entire regions, Allen suggested. A CIA officer who was present at the embassy meeting remarked later that while the British appeared laid back, \"it was clear they were worried, and not without reason\".</p>",
  "<p>It sounds like the green car dream \u2013 a mid-engined <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Evora\">Lotus Evora</a> with huge amounts of torque, a 0-60mph time of 4 seconds, and emissions lower than a Toyota Prius.</p> <p>However the <a href=\"http://www.lotuscars.com/engineering/evora-414e-hybrid\">414E</a> is not a dream - I've driven the car and can confirm that it is very much a reality.</p> <p>Lotus has developed the car as part of a <a href=\"http://www.innovateuk.org/\">Technology Strategy Board</a> demonstration project on so-called '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid\">range-extended electric vehicles</a>', with partners Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover, Xtrac and Evo Electric. The aim is to showcase what the UK car industry can do in the area of ultra-low carbon vehicles \u2013 and in this case with a sports car.</p> <p>The car's figures of 1000 Nm torque and 55g/km CO2 are achieved thanks to a powertrain that is primarily electric. Recharging the battery from the mains gives a driving range of around 30 miles, but the car also has an engine that cuts in either when extra performance is required, or to provide power when the battery becomes depleted. The engine then acts as a generator for the electric motors, giving a total range of 300 miles.</p> <p>Although similar in concept to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/19/general-motors-hybrid-chevrolet-volt\">Chevrolet Volt</a>, there's one significant difference. The Volt has an 'off the shelf' 1.4-litre engine from an Astra, together with a large battery and electric motor. Lotus believes this solution is too heavy, especially for a sports car. So it has developed its own 'range-extender' engine that is extremely light: a 3-cylinder, 1.2-litre petrol unit that's designed to work purely as a generator.</p> <p>In reality, the engine in the current 414E demonstrator isn't powerful enough to provide sufficient performance if it had to work by itself without any battery power. So Lotus is intending to develop a more powerful version with a supercharger, which would be a more practical solution in real-life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398161225\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/10/22/1350905513895/The-Lotus-Evora-414E-Hybr-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Lotus Evora 414E Hybri\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The engine and batteries that power the 'range extender' version of the Evora</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the lightweight range-extender, the Evora 414E gains a total of 377kg thanks to the battery and other electrical components. This has an impact on the handling of the normally extremely agile Evora, however you do get the benefit of 1000 Nm of torque to help offset the extra weight. There's no other car that combines such a huge torque figure with the relatively compact size of the Evora. The 414E still has good handling, along with spaceship-like levels of thrust out of the corners on the Lotus test track.</p> <p>The Evora 414E project is currently at the end of its second stage. During the next phase Lotus is looking at a number of further innovations, one of which is a simulated gearshift. Most electric cars are very similar to drive. Compared to the variations that you can achieve by combining different petrol and diesel engines with manual and automatic transmissions, it's difficult to inject such different personalities using just an electric motor with a single-speed transmission. A 'virtual' gearshift will provide keen drivers with the ability to interact with the car and hold it in a lower gear through corners.</p> <p>The 414E has been co-developed with the <a href=\"http://www.infiniti.com/gb/models/future_models/emerg_e.html\">Infiniti EMERG-E</a>, which is essentially the same platform with an Infiniti-styled body. Infiniti has said it won't be putting the EMERG-E into production. Lotus also has no plans to build the Evora 414E. However the company is serious about the Evora's technology, primarily the integration systems that it has developed, appearing in some non-Lotus vehicle through the company's engineering consultancy division.</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Clarke is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.green-car-guide.com/\">Green Car Guide</a></p>",
  "<p>Japan's trade deficit widened in September as exports plunged 10.3% from a year earlier, weighed down by the high yen, Europe's debt crisis and a row with China that has damaged close economic ties.</p> <p>The deficit for the month was \u00a5558.6bn (\u00a34.5bn), the finance ministry said on Monday, higher than the forecasts of many analysts and bigger than a deficit of about \u00a32.3bn a year earlier. The deficit in August was \u00a36bn.</p> <p>Without a swift reversal in fortunes, Japan is likely to register its second annual trade deficit in more than 30 years, embarrassing its leaders and illustrating the difficulties for major exporting economies in a period of low global growth.</p> <p>Some analysts said the row with China was the most important factor holding back exports after a boycott of cars and other Japanese goods in the escalating battle over the Senkaku islands.</p> <p>Beijing is accused of stoking xenophobic protests over the islands, which it has claimed since the 1970s despite a settlement following the second world war that handed them to Japan.</p> <p>Protests in September across the communist-run country spilled over into violence against Japanese-owned factories and shops after Tokyo purchased the islands from a private owner.</p> <p>It is understood that Japanese companies have reacted to boycotts of their goods by cancelling plans for investments in factories and equipment in their Chinese subsidiaries.</p> <p>The stand-off between the world's second and third largest economies has the potential to hit international trade and slow the world economy further, unless China's new leaders, who are due to be unveiled next month, take steps to open diplomatic channels.</p> <p>Tokyo has shrugged off the financial impact of the deficit, which is offset by decades of surpluses. Central bank governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, told a quarterly meeting of the bank's regional managers the economy was \"levelling off\".</p> <p>However, the figures indicate the difficulties faced by major exporters after a \"lost\" two decades of low growth following the property bubble shock that wrecked Japan's banking system in the late 1980s.</p> <p>Shirakawa warned that the risk of shocks to the financial system from the debt crisis in Europe remained high and slowing global growth was hitting manufacturing and exports.</p> <p>Matthew Circosta, an economist with Moody's Analytics in Sydney, said with the risk of recession rising, the Bank of Japan needs to convince markets that it will do anything necessary to pull the economy out of its two-decade-old malaise.</p> <p>The central banks has refrained so far from copying the huge injections of funds undertaken by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to stimulate demand.</p> <p>Instead of sporadic monetary easing, \"they need to make it sustained and powerful\", he said. \"They've just got to be more aggressive than they are now.\"</p> <p>Many expect the central bank to opt for further easing soon, perhaps as early as the next board meeting on 30 October.</p> <p>September's exports totalled \u00a55.4 trillion. Imports rose 4% from a year earlier to \u00a55.9tn, inflated by additional imports of oil and other fuels for power generation as most nuclear reactors remain offline after last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster.</p> <p>So far, Japan's trade deficit for 2012, according to the ministry's provisional figures, is about \u00a54.73tn.</p> <p>The ministry figures show exports to all regions falling, apart from a meagre 0.4% year-on-year gain in shipments to North America. Exports to crisis-stricken Europe plummeted 26%.</p> <p>The dispute with China took a heavy toll, with exports to China sinking 14% from a year earlier to \u00a5953.4bn. Imports from China climbed 3.8% to \u00a51.28tn. Car exports fell 15% in September from the year before.</p> <p>The strong Japanese yen has hurt the country's export competitiveness, while demand has evaporated as growth slowed in most regions. Exports of consumer electronics, a mainstay, fell by double-digit figures from a year earlier.</p> <p>Resource-scarce Japan is almost entirely dependent on imported fuel, and it has long relied on robust exports of high-value consumer goods and industrial products, such as machine tools, to help counter the cost of importing its energy needs.</p> <p>With most of the country's nuclear plants shut down, manufacturers and utilities have increased their reliance on traditional energy sources, such as oil and gas, while stepping up conservation and investments in renewable energy.</p> <p>Boosted partly by higher prices, imports of fuels jumped 18% in September from a year earlier to \u00a52.15tn, accounting for more than a third of Japan's total imports.</p>",
  "<p>The future of blind football is on \"a precipice\" according to its most famous player, Great Britain's former captain \u2013 now retired \u2013 and once called the Wayne Rooney of the game, David Clarke.</p> <p>The 41-year-old, now an ambassador for the sport, is awaiting the game's most significant funding decision in years, due on Tuesday to discover whether UK Sport will agree to boost the amount already spent by the Football Association and take blind football to the next level in this country. For Clarke the verdict is crucial to developing the talents of young stars such as the 17-year-old Lee Brunton, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/31/paralympics-football\" title=\"\">who impressed during the Paralympics</a>, and to win the nation a medal on its biggest global stage.</p> <p>Some may understandably question whether it is appropriate for a sport as wealthy as football to be asking for public money, but Clarke is unequivocal in his view. \"It's already improper in my view that the English FA are the only ones supporting Great Britain football. They've put their money behind something that, actually, strictly speaking isn't theirs to fund.\"</p> <p>UK Sport has so far refused to finance professional sports \u2013 but has already wavered in that stance by funding some individual wheelchair tennis players in the build up to the Paralympics this year. The sport is asking for an additional \u00a31m, over four years, to make a podium finish viable at Rio in 2016. Great Britain finished seventh overall in London, but Clarke points out that the six teams who finished above them all train full-time.</p> <p>\"Next time round we want to be in there fighting for a medal. If we get the investment we will be, if we don't we certainly won't \u2026 there's a precipice behind [the decision].\"</p> <p>As Clarke talks through Great Britain's current training set-up it is a wonder that the team were ever able to challenge the world's best \u2013 holding 2012 and 2008 Paralympic medal winners Spain, China and Argentina to a tie in London \u2013 for the squad meet up only six times a year to train together.</p> <p>In the absence of team-mates the likes of Clarke train on their own. In fact the St Albans-based bank manager says it was only this year that he introduced anything other than fitness training into his weekly schedule when he found a sighted coach willing to work free of charge with him \u2013 and even then he was only racking up one session a week. \"I don't want people to do it my way anymore. You shouldn't be able to. Football should be the only thing you're doing, or you're not doing it to the best of your ability.\"</p> <p>Additional funding would not mean a wage for any of the players, but would simply cover their costs \u2013 subsistence and travel \u2013 and enable the team to meet up and train at the newly opened FA facility, St George's Park. That would enable them to access elements especially set up for blind players on a weekly basis to match the opportunities available to their rivals France, Spain, Iran, China and Brazil.</p> <p>Clarke retired after the Paralympics with a remarkable tally of 128 international goals \u2013 much more than Bobby Charlton and Gary Lineker's totals combined in a game that, unlike sighted five-a-side, has a far lower ratio of goals per games. \"The most goals in a game I've ever been involved with was 5-1 against Greece, and I scored four of them\" he says.</p> <p>He laughs when recalling the time he went to visit a school that had won a visit from David Beckham: \"I remember Justin King [Sainsburys CEO] saying to the kids: 'We've got a really important guest coming today, his name's David and he's a footballer, can anyone guess who he is?' And this kid put his hand up and said, 'Is it David Clarke?'. Justin King had to go: \"No sorry it's not David Clarke, I wasn't thinking of that David,'\" he giggles.</p> <p>Clarke, who started out playing football with his dad on their driveway but did not receive any formal coaching until the age of 25 because the game had no infrastructure in those days, wonders what his career may have been like had he been given the opportunities available to young players today. \"I look back at it now and think: My god what could I have done if I'd have gone through the pathways available to kids now? The average five or six-year-old now coming into the sport will go through the normal pathways that any other child has open to them. They will join a local club, they can move to a centre of excellence, join a development squad if they're good enough, all the way to the elite team. I got coached aged 25 for the first time.\"</p> <p>\"That's what the FA has made happen. The frustration is we know what still needs to be done. We know what others are doing. Having reached this moment where the public are engaged, sponsors are engaged and potential blind athletes are engaged, if we didn't use this opportunity \u2026\" Clarke searches for the words to sum up his frustration. \"We've filled a stadium with 4,000 people for every single game, people have been watching it on big screens in pubs and been enthralled by it, kids are out in their back gardens practising it \u2013 even though they can see perfectly well they're blindfolded up and tapping pipes [the method used by coaches to guide the blindfolded players towards goal for a penalty].</p> <p>\"The amount of tweets and emails I get from people telling me that they found their kids out in the back garden doing this, it's wonderful isn't it? Having got that buzz about sport, it would be enormously frustrating if we didn't now take that opportunity to say we're going to give this a crack.\"</p> <p>Clarke worries that the magical memories of the Paralympics will only keep the buzz afloat for so long. After that, blind football could well struggle to make headlines again. He believes that only winning medals can change that.</p>",

This was \"the decision of the artist himself\", reps from SM Mall of Asia told the Associated Press. \"Understandably, the known environment-advocate artist was left with no choice in spite of the SM representatives' appeal.\"</p> <p>In their initial press release, SM Prime Holdings said that the Mall of Asia Arena \"has nothing to do with\" the 182 trees \"except for the fact that it is also under the same holding company as the Baguio [site]\".

  "<p>\"If you're not making money, that's a nice hobby you've got there!\" Blunt commercial advice from a blunt commercial adviser. But it was exactly the advice social entrepreneur Jude Ower, founder of online gaming company <a href=\"http://playmob.com/\" title=\"\">PlayMob</a>, wanted. For Jude, a 'highly commercial' approach is the best way to help the charities PlayMob supports.</p> <p>However, for many, fully embracing the dualism required of a social entrepreneur \u2014 do good and make money \u2014 is not easy. This is especially true of social enterprises that have been forced into existence as traditional funding has dried up. Making money is a subservient, if not uncomfortable objective.</p> <p>It's something every social entrepreneur knows they need to do, but it's not what gets them out of bed in the morning. And for many whose background is primarily social, the whole process of building a commercial operation can be bewildering.</p> <p>Our company, <a href=\"http://oneleap.to/\" title=\"\">OneLeap</a>, a global community that introduces entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs to business-leaders, investors and influencers, has just published <a href=\"http://oneleap.to/socent\" title=\"\">'How to build a social enterprise that makes money</a>.' The free book brings together personal tips and stories from 14 of our successful social entrepreneur members.</p> <p>The tips are as varied as the enterprises, but if there's one thread running through, it's the need to confront and embrace the dual nature of your objectives: making money and doing good \u2013 even if the former is a means to the latter.</p> <p>Here's what that dualism might mean.</p> <h2><strong>Horses for courses</strong></h2> <p>You're not going to ask your accountant for advice on how to get ex-offenders into employment. Similarly, don't rely on a board full of social work experts to tell you how to improve your marketing. Baillie Aaron of <a href=\"http://www.sparkinside.org/\" title=\"\">Spark Inside</a>, which provides life-coaching to ex-offenders, counsels developing a diverse network of advisers that includes for-profit professionals who will help you \"develop practical funding models and make you 'investable'.\" Particularly in an established organization that is transitioning to social enterprise, there can be resistance among the 'believers' to make space for the pragmatist 'suits.' The point is a social enterprise needs both.</p> <h2><strong>Stick to your mission, but don't get stuck in your business plan</strong></h2> <p>Having a clear mission is essential if you're to persuade people to back you. But as Jan Matern of <a href=\"http://www.theemergelab.org/\" title=\"\">Emerge Venture Labs</a> warns: \"don't be precious about your business model.\" Social entrepreneurs can be reluctant to pivot, as changing what you're doing to make money sounds an awful lot like 'selling out.' But changing the trading activity that supports that mission is not the same as changing the mission. Many startups need to perform some sort of pivot on the road to success. Social enterprise startups are not immune from this logic in achieving their missions.</p> <h2><strong>Share value, but know how to sell value</strong></h2> <p>There's a culture among people social enterprise and startups of helping each other out, and you should make the most of this. Selene Biffi, founder of <a href=\"http://www.plainink.org/en/\" title=\"\">Plain Ink</a>, which publishes books tackling social exclusion, created a value partnership under which her company gets free stationery in return for providing the stationer with illustrations from Plain Ink's workshops. Be aware though that some large organisations may cheekily suggest 'partnerships' when they can and should pay. Sometimes this means explaining politely, but firmly that you can't do something for free.</p> <p>It's also important you don't forget the commercial value you're creating along the way.

There's your social customer, who it's your mission to serve, and there's also your economic customer, who pays for your mission. Your economic customer may care about your mission \u2013 or they may not. If they do, that's a loyalty bonus, but don't expect them to let you off for sloppy service because you're a 'socent.' If they don't, embrace it. That's the beauty of a social enterprise: unlike asking for donations, you don't necessarily need to convince your economic customer of your cause in order to get their money. So sell the oversize 4WD-owner a great product, happy in the knowledge that even he is helping to fund a lower emissions world. And in meeting you, or in using your product, you might win him over to your cause as well.</p> <p><em>Hamish Forsyth is founder of </em><a href=\"http://oneleap.to/\" title=\"\"><em>OneLeap</em></a><em>, a global community that introduces entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs to business-leaders, investors and influencers.

  "<p>Like all Nairobians, Jessica Cola\u00e7o hates traffic jams, especially the out-of-nowhere monster tailbacks that make travelling in this sprawling city a gut-clenching gamble. Unlike most drivers, Cola\u00e7o is doing something about it.</p> <p>The 30-year-old is a research manager at Nairobi's <a href=\"http://ihub.co.ke/pages/home.php\" title=\"\">iHub</a>, a tech innovation centre where Kenyans brainstorm ideas. She is helping her team develop intelligent traffic lights to ease the chaos in the city considered to have the <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/35359.wss\" title=\"\">fourth worst commute in the world</a>.</p> <p>\"I hate driving in Nairobi. There is no management on the junctions \u2026 It becomes a deadlock,\" she said. City officials estimate traffic jams cost east Africa's largest economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (\u00a3365,000) a day. \"It's about measuring the traffic density and congestion \u2026 and instead of pre-programming the traffic lights, you make them intelligent,\" she added. \"The idea is to have them spread across the highway so they are talking to each other.\"</p> <p>What Cola\u00e7o is suggesting is not revolutionary: other cities around the world use smart traffic lights. But if her team is successful, and if drivers buy in, it could spur a mini-uprising in a city where most traffic lights are ignored by drivers, and overruled by poorly trained police.</p> <p>The project grew out of one of the regular robotics boot camps run by the iHub, set up in 2010 by the founders of <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>, a non-profit, open source platform for crowdsourcing information during disasters. The iHub, where wannabe developers huddle together at small tables in an airy fourth-floor room, is part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/03/kalonzo-musyoka-technology-city-kenya\" title=\"\">Kenya's booming tech industry</a>.</p> <p>Cola\u00e7o says the project is a \"bare bones\" assignment \u2013 and when a research assistant, Juliette Wanyiri, 22, brings out the prototype, it looks more like a child's game than the answer to the paralysis already spreading along Ngong Road four floors below.</p> <p>The model has three coloured pins representing the traffic lights, linked by pink, green and yellow wires to a motion sensor, a camera and a mini-computer. \"It's a simulation model, whereby we have a microcontroller with the traffic lights and we have the sensors that sense the congestion,\" Cola\u00e7o said. The system is due to be tested on Ngong Road soon. \"If the traffic reads higher than our benchmark then the red light should go off and the green light should go on,\" Wanyiri said.</p> <p>Along Ngong Road, one of Nairobi's busiest arteries, people wondered whether drivers could be persuaded to obey traffic lights, even smart ones, in a city where the rules of the road seem to be open to personal interpretation.</p> <p>\"Even if you bring in new [lights], if someone is used to breaking the law, he will continue with that habit,\" said Joseph, a financial services worker.</p> <p>Overtaking on the wrong side of the road, driving the wrong way, or dodging boulders placed to stop vehicles from using unfinished bypasses are common in Nairobi. A few drops of rain can bring the city to a standstill. At night, traffic lights are ignored, not least because in this rich-meets-poor city, stopping is seen as an invitation to be mugged.</p> <p>Cola\u00e7o believes people will change their driving habits if they see the system works.</p> <p>The undisputed kings of highway anarchy are the drivers of <em>matatus</em>, Nairobi's public minibuses, who are widely condemned for speeding, failing to indicate and stopping in the middle of junctions.</p> <p>Dante, who collects money and shouts out destinations, doubts smart traffic lights would hold much sway with <em>matatu</em> drivers, and had his own ideas about what should be done. \"At each and every junction, they should have a cop because then the jams will be easier,\" he said.</p> <p>The iHub project is just part of a broader effort to get Nairobi moving. New bypasses and an eight-lane superhighway have been built and in August, the World Bank said it would invest more than $300m to develop a <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/08/02/kenya-launch-rapid-road-rail-transport-ease-urban-traffic-congestion\" title=\"\">mass rapid transport system</a>.</p> <p>The iHub researchers can only dream of such funding. Laughing, Cola\u00e7o and Wanyiri show off their financial war chest: a glass jar with a couple of shillings rattling in the bottom.</p>",
  "<p>Every week brings dozens of new, individual book-apps for children, but an increasing number of startups are experimenting with storybook-store apps, through which parents can access dozens of digital stories paid for using in-app purchases.</p> <p>The latest to launch on Apple's App Store \u2013&#xa0;this is almost entirely an iOS phenomenon for now \u2013&#xa0;is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/me-books/id534499518?mt=8\">Me Books</a> from British startup <a href=\"http://www.madeinme.com/\">Made in Me</a>.</p> <p>The app is based on an engine that the company previously used for two apps with Penguin: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ladybird-classic-me-books/id453238220?mt=8\">Ladybird Classic Me Books</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/peppa-pig-me-books/id486850794?mt=8\">Peppa Pig Me Books</a>, which together have more than 100,000 active users according to Made in Me chief executive James Huggins.</p> <p>Like those, it offers a library of digital books from an in-app store, but this time they're drawn from a variety of publishers and brands.</p> <p>Penguin, Puffin, Ladybird, Bloomsbury and Andersen Press are all on board for the app's launch, with characters including Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit; Elmer, Topsy &amp; Tim; and titles from the previous Ladybird and Peppa Pig apps.</p> <p>They sell for between 69p and \u00a31.99 each, with voice narration provided by celebrities including Richard E. Grant, Sir David Jason, Tamsin Greig, Adam Buxton and Josie Lawrence.</p> <p>\"It's the very logical extension of the first two Me Books apps,\" says Huggins. \"The functionality in the app itself has been tweaked and polished, but the main feedback we got from Me Books was that people loved the apps, and they wanted more books.\"</p> <p>Huggins describes Me Books as \"the digital equivalent of an independent picture-book shop\" which is trying to help parents who are struggling to filter the sheer number of book-apps available on iOS.</p> <p>\"It should be exactly like going into a little picture-book shop where you trust the guy who runs it, and know the stuff he's selling is good,\" says Huggins.</p> <p>\"We've very much sold it to publishers on the basis that we are just another independent book shop that would like to sell their books. It just so happens that here, they send us the digital assets, we do the original audio in most cases, then publish it through what is essentially a retail platform for them.\"</p> <p>One key feature of Me Books is its \"draw and record\" feature, where children can draw an area on-screen \u2013&#xa0;a \"hotspot\" \u2013 and then record their own sounds or words for it.</p> <p>That may sound minor, but in the Peppa Pig and Ladybird Me Books apps, it was enormously popular with my own children, whether they were inventing their own zebra calls or insisting that visitors to the house record their own take on Daddy Pig.</p> <p>Huggins describes the feature as \"a way to bottle and keep a lot of the good conversation, silly voices and invented stories that happen around picture books\", and says that more than 95% of people with an existing Me Books app have created more than 10 hotspots.</p> <p>\"In the future, we'd really love the notion of people being able to save, swap and share versions of the stories, both with other people that have the app, but also the ability to, say, send your version of The Three Little Pigs to grandparents.\"</p> <p>Huggins says the company has also been thinking about the prospects for an all-you-can-read subscription, where people pay a single monthly fee for access to Me Books' entire library.</p> <p>\"I personally am a big fan of that model,\" he says, while admitting that it will only be feasible once publisher partners are convinced that such a model makes sense.</p> <p>Some other companies are already trying, such as fellow British firm Mindshapes with its cross-platform <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/magic-town-where-stories-live/id522680936?mt=8\">Magic Town</a> service. There, parents pay a monthly subscription to access a library of digital picture books.</p> <p>\"I know those guys and really like them,\" says Huggins, although he notes that Magic Town's challenge is convincing parents to pay \u00a37.99 a month after a relatively short free trial period, when they may not yet know how much they'll use the app in the long term.</p> <p>The positive thing is that both Me Books and Magic Town are available: a sign that publishers and startups are experimenting together, which is healthy for the industry. \"Publishers are becoming much more amenable to experimenting,\" says Huggins. \"What are they going to lose, as long as their brands are being represented in the right way?\"</p> <p>Me Books has launched for iOS first, but Made in Me has plans for an Android version, likely in the first quarter of 2013.</p> <p>\"It's still an absolute fact that in terms of revenue and providing an environment that's friendlier to small developers, iOS is still way out in front,\" says Huggins, although he sees Android as important to the future of Me Books. \"We're wanting to build a channel, a brand and a community, so Android is appealing enough based on the number of users alone.\" </p> <p>As an app, Me Books is very impressive, but only time will tell if that translates into a sustainable business for Made in Me and its publisher partners.</p> <p>Huggins says the company's deals with those partners vary between traditional licensing agreements and retail distribution-like deals mirroring real-world bookstores.</p> <p>\"If we're selling a book for \u00a31.99, Apple takes its 30%, and then in most cases we share the net receipts for what's left evenly with the publisher,\" he says. \"If we do audio \u2013&#xa0;sound effects and narration \u2013&#xa0;we do all of that for nothing.\"</p> <p>If parents flock to Me Books, that investment will prove worthwhile, although the elephant in the room is Apple and its own iBooks store and reader app. iBooks 3.0 is strongly rumoured to be one of the announcements at Apple's press launch this week, which could well include more features for picture books.</p> <p>If so, it would be unsurprising if Apple were to encourage picture-book publishers behind the scenes to focus their energies on iBooks rather than third-party apps like Me Books. Even so, getting out early with some big publishers on board gives Made in Me's app a fighting chance at winning an audience.</p>",

  "<p>The ideas of the modernisation theorists, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/08/us-economist-walt-rostow-development\" title=\"\">particularly those of Walt Rostow</a>, remained dominant throughout the 1960s, but it was not long before they came under sustained critique from the intellectual left, who developed a counter-tradition: the dependencia, or dependency, school of thought.</p> <p>The kernel of this thinking developed within the <a href=\"http://www.eclac.org/\" title=\"\">UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean</a>, (Eclac, or Cepal as it is often known, after its Spanish acronym). Founded in the 1950s to carry out research that would contribute to greater development across the continent, Eclac was a training ground for many dependency writers. Like a modern-day thinktank, it sought to overturn many of the rather western-centric assumptions of modernisation theory, replacing them with a critique of the unequal terms of economic exchange between core (rich) and periphery (poor) countries.</p> <p>This approach set the tone for the dependency school. But it was the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/may/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries1\" title=\"\">Andre Gunder Frank</a> who would go on to politicise \u2013 and indeed radicalise \u2013 the message, in publications such as his 1967 book <a href=\"http://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb0931/\" title=\"\">Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America</a>.</p> <p>Frank was, in many ways, a rather unlikely radical, having been trained at the notoriously free market Chicago School of Economics (the bad guys in Naomi Klein's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141024530\" title=\"\">The Shock Doctrine</a>) under the supervision of the school's head, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1976/friedman-autobio.html\" title=\"\">Milton Friedman</a>. But quite unlike his supervisor, in the early 1970s Frank worked under Chile's socialist president, Salvador Allende, not against him. And this experience of working outside the metropolitan centres was to be central to his radical perspective.</p> <p>Above all, it prompted him to notice what he saw as the unforgivable historical amnesia of mainstream development theories. Rather than taking poor countries' impoverished status as the starting point for analysis, he argued, their poverty ought to be thought of as the end point. This was the heart of the underdevelopment critique: the claim that what made rich nations rich and kept poor nations poor was not geographical bad luck or the wrong policies, much less an unproductive \"culture\", but the ongoing legacy of colonialism, slavery and resource extraction. Frank's colleague, the Stanford economist Paul Baran, neatly summarised this as \"plunder thinly veiled as trade\".</p> <p>In short, Frank was saying that while today's rich countries may once have been undeveloped, they were never underdeveloped in anything like the same way. Moreover, this was not a case of unintended consequences. It was central to the whole capitalist enterprise. If we stand back and look at the capitalist system as a whole, he said, it is impossible not to notice \"its simultaneous generation of underdevelopment in some of its parts and of economic development in others\". This primary observation led to a host of follow-on arguments, such as the idea that the exploitation of poor countries by rich ones is possible only because ruling elites in poor countries have something to gain from that exploitation, and are therefore complicit at every level \u2013 nationally, regionally and locally \u2013 resulting in a cycle of repeated exploitation and misery.</p> <p>The only possible solution to this rather hopeless situation, Frank believed, was socialism \u2013 although this was a conclusion that, like Rostow's unflinching adherence to capitalism (and damn the costs), he reached before carrying out his research. We don't have to agree with Frank on the solution, however, to recognise the many useful insights to come from the dependency critique more broadly: such as the idea that even if countries could successfully begin to develop \u2013 and not all dependency theorists thought that they could \u2013 they would never do so in a vacuum, as modernisation theorists believed. They would be increasingly propelled into a world system already clanking away at full speed.</p> <p>That may not sound so novel or insightful today. But it is interesting in retrospect because here, much more clearly than before, is a deliberate concern to consider the material forces of history \u2013 the actual lived reality of the world \u2013 when elaborating a model of economic development (rather than simply sketching it out according to the abstract reckonings of neoclassical economics). As a result, we can detect here a whiff of the idea that it is inequality as much as absolute poverty that most accounts for the problems of global poverty.</p> <p>But do the insights of dependency theorists still hold water? The somewhat pessimistic implication of the dependency approach is to assume that poor countries can only improve their condition by de-linking from the world economy. And as Frank himself was later to acknowledge, that makes it very hard to develop at all. Moreover, it has been largely disproved by the experience of the east Asian tiger economies: something other dependency scholars, such as the Brazilian intellectual and later president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/fernando-henrique-cardoso\" title=\"\">Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a>, recognised at the time. But, above all, dependency theory could never really account for the sheer variety of experiences that poor countries around the world exhibit.</p> <p>In its hardline form, then, dependency theory is of perhaps limited value today, which reiterates a lesson learned from modernisation: that when theories become all encompassing, they tend to become ever further removed from useful policy advice.</p> <p>It is nonetheless clear that the problems of uneven starting points and the structural unfairness of global capitalism that interested Frank and others have not gone away. And the underlying critique of western chauvinism (that western-style capitalist democracy is the best model for the rest) remains pertinent when people persist in talking of development \"ladders\", for example. Perhaps more important, Frank's belief that we too readily overlook the way that too many of the privileges of the rich nations are not only unearned but predicated upon the prior and active removal of that wealth from others is, if anything, making something of a comeback in these days of heightened discussion of inequality.</p>",

  "<p>The French government has announced a 10-point emergency plan to combat the wave of assassinations linked to organised crime on the Mediterranean island of Corsica.</p> <p>The plan follows the shooting last Tuesday of a prominent lawyer, Antoine Sollacaro, as he drove to work. The 63-year-old, who was shot five times in the head at the wheel of his Porsche as he was pulling up at a petrol station near the capital, Ajaccio, was the 15th person to be murdered this year on the Mediterranean island. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/corsica-intrigue-crime-politics?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Not one of the killings, believed to be linked to criminal gangs, has been solved</a>.</p> <p>After a meeting of prominent cabinet ministers in Paris on Monday morning, the office of the French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced a \"global strategy to fight Corsica's rampant criminality\".</p> <p>\"Economic and financial dealings are behind most of the murders \u2026 particular attention will be paid to the fight against money laundering, especially in the fields of property and including sport as well as the procedures for public contracts and urban authorisations,\" Aurault said.</p> <p>The 10 measures include appointing more investigating judges and setting up a special unit of the national gendarmerie to investigate and oversee criminal cases and \"co-ordinate internal security\". Ayrault also announced tighter controls on financial and fiscal dealings on the island.</p> <p>Ayrault called on Corsicans to show a \"spirit of responsibility\".</p> <p>\"The immense majority of Corsicans are suffering in this situation, each must ask themselves where are the roots of this violence,\" he said.</p> <p>After Sollacaro was murdered last week, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said the scale of violence on the so-called Ile de Beaut\u00e9 was \"intolerable\". Ayrault described the problem of organised crime on Corsica as a \"scourge that undermines [the island]\". <br>Corsica has been riddled with internal violence for decades. Previously it was linked to the nationalist movement but in recent years it has been blamed on criminal gangs who have made fortunes from bank robberies and large-scale drug trafficking.</p> <p>An historian, Antoine-Marie Graziani, has blamed the French state for the lawlessness, accusing Paris of washing its hands of Corsica. He also said it was wrong to describe the gangs as mafia.</p> <p>\"The attitude has been that the republic isn't bothered if it's Corsicans killing each other,\" said Graziani. \"They use the terms 'mafia' and 'vendetta' that are not just wrong but dangerous because they allow the state to say it cannot do anything about such things, which is scandalous.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Every time there's a murder they say it is 'intolerable'. I have lived here for 30 years and I must have heard this 50 times. We've had enough of hearing the same thing.\"</p> <p>Graziani said Paris had to take more active control of the island to stamp out ingrained corruption, money laundering, drug dealing and the black economy.</p> <p>\"It will be painful but it is the only way,\" he said.</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Paccou, head of the island's Human Rights League, accused successive French governments of \"utter incompetence\" in dealing with Corsica's problems. He said the fact that French detectives investigating organised gangs were based in Marseilles meant they were often \"completely out of touch with the realities of Corsican life\".</p> <p>Paccou told broadcaster France 24 the key to ending the gangs' \"reign of impunity\" was to stem the flow of their money.</p>",
  "<p>He's back \u2013 and he's not pulling any punches. Former Daily Telegraph owner <strong>Conrad Black</strong>, who was released from jail for fraud in May, has been warming up for his Have I Got News For You appearance later this week by firing some barbed one liners at his newspaper rival, Rupert Murdoch. Black told the Mail on Sunday: \"He's a psychopath ... like Stalin, except that he doesn't kill people\". And what about his star turn on Have I Got News For You this week? Surely Black is looking forward to that? \"I'm only going on because I'm trying to sell the book. I wouldn't cross the street to appear on it if I wasn't,\" he said.

  "<p>At the eastern tip of the Israeli settlement of Ariel, cranes and earth-movers are at work on the college campus, which stretches across a hill overlooking the villages and valleys of the West Bank. Eleven miles from the internationally recognised Green Line separating Israel from the Palestinian Territories, construction is under way of buildings to accommodate a projected growth from 13,000 to 20,000 students over the next 10 years.</p> <p>In September, the college passed a significant milestone when the Israeli cabinet voted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/israel-west-bank-ariel-university-upgrade-row\" title=\"\">upgrade the college to a university</a> as a matter of \"national importance\". Backing the move, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the cabinet that Ariel was \"an inseparable part of Israel\" and would remain so in the future.</p> <p>The decision, concerning a settlement which is illegal under international law and whose future is a key determinant of a viable Palestinian state and the peaceful resolution of a decades-old conflict, was not universally acclaimed. Urging Israel to reconsider, British foreign secretary William Hague said it would \"deepen the presence of the settlements in the Palestinian territories and will create another obstacle to peace\".</p> <p>Deeper inside the West Bank, a few miles east of Ariel, construction workers are also busy. Earlier this year, Israel approved <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/west-bank-settlement-of-shiloh-gets-initial-approval-for-600-new-homes-1.414215\" title=\"\">plans for 600 homes</a> in the settlement of Shiloh and its outpost, Shvut Rachel. \"This community has doubled in size in 20 years, and there is no question that there will be further growth. The demand for homes is much greater than supply,\" said Shiloh's former mayor, David Rubin.</p> <p>Further south, Israel a year ago announced plans for a settlement across the Green Line close to Jerusalem. The 2,600 homes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/israel-settlement-isolate-arab-jerusalem\" title=\"\">Givat Hamatos</a>, plus expansion of neighbouring Gilo and Har Homa, will increase the separation of Palestinian areas of the city from the West Bank, reducing the likelihood of East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p> <p>These three places illustrate a pattern of settlement growth that mocks Barack Obama's demand, issued early in his presidency, that Israel should halt expansion as an impediment to peace.</p> <p>Entrenchment of \"facts on the ground\" has led a growing number of people, on both sides of the conflict, to declare that creating a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state to resolve the conflict is now impossible. The \"two-state solution\", they say, is dead.</p> <p>In June 2009, less than six months into his presidency, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1902738,00.html\" title=\"\">Obama addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> in his keynote speech on the Middle East in Cairo. Restating US commitment to a two-state model, he said the Palestinians must abandon violence, and develop their capacity to govern. By most reckoning, the Ramallah leadership has ticked both boxes.</p> <p>On the Israeli side, Obama said the US did not accept the legitimacy of Jewish settlements. \"It is time for these settlements to stop,\" he said bluntly.</p> <p>There followed protracted negotiations between the US and Israeli governments which resulted, in November 2009, in Netanyahu reluctantly acceding to a temporary construction freeze in West Bank settlements. East Jerusalem was exempt, with the completion of any buildings whose foundations were already laid. In anticipation of the moratorium, the number of construction starts rose significantly in the run-up to November.</p> <p>Critics denounced the freeze as a farce, but the settlers were incensed and relations between Netanyahu and Obama nosedived. Relations between the two allies were \"in the state of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/27/israel-us-relations-tectonic-rift\" title=\"\">a tectonic rift </a>in which continents are drifting apart,\" Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the US, memorably said in mid-2010. The freeze ended in September 2010, despite US efforts to secure an extension. Direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians swiftly broke down as settlement construction resumed, since when the \"peace process\" has been in a catatonic state.</p> <p>Obama was heavily criticised for his early focus on settlements. But, according to one observer, \"the problem was not Obama's identification of the settlement issue as a critical obstacle to the resumption of talks and, beyond that, to the two-state model itself \u2013 it was his failure to stick with it in the face of Netanyahu's intransigence\".</p> <p>In the past two years, US officials have issued routine condemnation of settlement expansion plans but real pressure from Washington has eased. In June, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/jewish-population-west-bank-up\" title=\"\">the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank</a> had risen by 15,000 over the previous 12 months, to a record 350,000. Most of the growth was in small hardline settlements deep inside the West Bank. An additional 200,000 Jews live in settlements in East Jerusalem. In the New York Times, s ettlers' leader Dani Dayon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/opinion/israels-settlers-are-here-to-stay.html\" title=\"\"> pronounced the Jewish presence across the Green Line \"an irreversible fact\"</a>. Predicting the numbers in Jewish colonies in the West Bank would top 400,000 by 2014, he wrote: \"Trying to stop settlement expansion is futile.\" The international community should relinquish its \"vain attempts to attain the unattainable two-state solution\".</p> <p>He said: \"Our presence here has now passed a point of non-return. It's irrevocable, a fait accompli.\" The status quo, while not ideal, was \"immeasurably better than any feasible alternative\".</p> <p>In the face of the \"facts on the ground\", others are proposing alternative courses of action. Some on the Israeli right have called for annexation of the West Bank. The Palestinian population can either accept living under Israeli rule with limited rights or leave, they say. Critics say this would be akin to apartheid and make Israel a pariah state.</p> <p>Others have called for a more modest, but unilateral, annexation of the 9.4% of the West Bank which will lie between the Green Line and Israel's separation barrier when it is complete. Defence minister Ehud Barak recently proposed that settlers outside the three main blocs \u2013 Ma'ale Adumim, Gush Etzion and Ariel \u2013 should be evacuated or choose to live under Palestinian rule. The barrier would become what its critics have always charged \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5880\" title=\"\">Israel's new border</a>. \"It would be best to reach agreement with the Palestinians but, barring that, practical steps must be taken to begin the separation,\" he said in a newspaper interview.</p> <p><a href=\"http://bluewhitefuture.org/\" title=\"\">Blue White Future</a>, a relatively new organisation, also argues for \"constructive unilateralism\", by which it means Israel withdrawing to the security barrier, with voluntary evacuation and compensation for those in settlements beyond. \"Once Israel announces it has no sovereignty claims east of the fence, most [settlers] will move westwards,\" said Orni Petruschka, co-chairman.</p> <p>Some have even suggested the \"cantonisation\" of the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority would be given autonomy in five cantons around the main West Bank cities of Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron, with Israeli sovereignty over the rest of the territory.</p> <p>There are also growing Palestinian voices declaring the end of the two-state model. \"The two-state solution died long ago, with Israel's refusal to confront the settlement movement,\" said Palestinian analyst Diana Butto. \"Unless this colonial project is addressed completely, there cannot be two states, only apartheid.\" The battle now, she said, was for universal rights within the one state that is in de facto existence.</p> <p>Among those still fighting for a two-state model are European diplomats in Jerusalem who have identified a handful of West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements as \"game changers\". Significant growth in these places would signal crossing a red line, they say. \"There's a year, or 18 months maximum, before it's over,\" said one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.molad.org/\" title=\"\">Molad</a>, a young leftist Israeli thinktank, says it is fighting an \"irreversibility thesis\". According to director Avner Inbar, \"talk of the end of the two-state solution is irresponsible. The two-state solution is not only the best framework, it's the only one that will work. None of the advocates of one state talk of the likely consequences. It would result in dramatic and possibly catastrophic violence.\"</p> <p>Barring the unexpected, the most likely course is continuation of the status quo \u2013 Netanyahu's preferred option and so, it seems, Republican candidate Mitt Romney's, judging by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-israel-palestinian-solution\" title=\"\">recently leaked video</a>. But as many analysts and diplomats point out, the \"status quo\" in practice means the entrenchment and growth of settlements.</p> <p>A reinvigorated second-term Obama presidency could change that. In an interview with ABC in July, the president was asked if there was anything he believed he had failed at, that \"has you desperate to get that second term to atone for?\" There were \"a bunch of things that we didn't get done that I think were important,\" replied Obama. On foreign policy, he said, \"I have not been able to move the peace process forwards in the Middle East in the way I wanted\".</p> <p>Faith, as well as time, has been lost. \"Obama has learned this is not an issue that will win him any votes. I am not someone who believes a second-term president will act any differently that he did in his first term,\" said Butto.</p> <p>According to Dayon, \"Obama has learned the limitation of his powers to make change here. President Obama of 2012 will not be the same as President Obama of 2008 because he now realises he cannot deliver.\"</p> <p>Back in Ariel, students are hurrying between classes at the start of term. At the Moskowitz School of Communications, named after the US bingo magnate Irving Moskowitz, who has spent millions of dollars funding the settlement enterprise in the West Bank, 24-year-old Adi said she was thrilled at the institution's new university classification. \"It will give graduates better status and better job prospects. Yes, of course, we are situated in the middle of a conflict, but a city like Ariel is very valuable to Israel. We cannot give it up.\"</p> <p>Down the road in Shiloh, David Rubin dismissed the idea of evacuating any settlements. \"We're supposed to hand over our heartland? This is my country, where my roots are, where my history is, where my destiny is, where the Jewish people were born, exiled from and returned to. This community will never be destroyed. There will never be a deal with the Palestinians.\"</p>",
  "<p>Although he has to put up with the gnawing pain of thwarted ambition, it can't be too bad being David Miliband. Never mind that he still seemingly feels too awful to fight the good fight in the shadow cabinet, in the financial year 2011-12, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2192396/MPs-earning-13-TIMES-salary-taking-second-jobs.html\" title=\"\">in addition to his salary as an MP</a>, he turned \u00a3410,171 in fees for \"consultancy work and speeches\", supplied to such worthy causes as an agribusiness firm called Indus Basin Holding and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/uae-britain-best-friends\" title=\"\">United Arab Emirates' ministry of foreign affairs</a>. How he finds time to represent the struggling folk of South Shields as well as overseeing his Movement for Change (which, according to its blurb, works in \"specific areas to support campaigns for change in local communities, to identify and nurture talent and to develop new responses to the challenges that people face\") is anyone's guess, though his <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/david_miliband/south_shields\" title=\"\">45% Commons voting record</a> may say something. Or perhaps he's just given up sleep.</p> <p>Just to further suggest that's he's bionic, the elder Miliband has also become a prolific polemicist, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidmiliband?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">in the Guardian</a> and elsewhere \u2013 though then again, maybe \"polemicist\" is the wrong word. According to my dictionary, to meet that description, you're meant to be able to turn your hand to \"a controversial argument, especially one refuting or attacking a specific opinion or doctrine\". As far as I can tell, he might be in the habit of doing that, but only in a very strange way.</p> <p>His <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/the-treasury-doesnt-know-best\" title=\"\">latest Guardian piece</a> appeared last week and was a masterclass in an age-old political art that alumni of the New Labour regime have taken to surreal new heights. The political vernacular terms it \"speaking in code\": putting up kites and undermining your adversaries while ensuring that everything is put so nebulously that you can deny any such thing. To the untrained eye, it looks more like the borderline absurd art of saying close to nothing, at great length.</p> <p>Miliband's latest article was ostensibly about the old Blairite theme of so-called public service reform, which of itself may represent a pop at his younger brother: Ed Miliband does not talk about that stuff very much, and his brother's wing of the Labour party has always used this subject as a club with which to beat its supposedly unreconstructed adversaries. Anyway, the elder Miliband said things such as: \"Successful economies in the modern world are not sheepish about the power and responsibility of the state. But there is a catch. We need to be reformers of the state to reboot our economy and build a fairer society \u2026 the fiscal crunch requires a different kind of state. The failure of the government's economic policy makes how much less we spend, and how and where we spend it, a core issue. We cannot meet our goals on jobs, health, education, long-term care and tackling poverty without changing the way government goes about its business.\"</p> <p>At first sight, this stuff might be at least mildly interesting. Does he, perhaps, think the approach that has run from the last government into the current one, whereby bits of the public services are chopped up and handed to Serco and Richard Branson, is still a good idea? Has he begun to have doubts? Or is this some fiscally driven grope into entirely new territory? Who knows, least of all Miliband himself: after 728 words, nothing is clearer at the end than it was at the beginning. One <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/18/david-miliband-muddle?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Guardian letter writer moaned</a>: \"Having read his piece three times, I haven't a clue what he means by reform. He has one paragraph with two sketchy proposals, but nothing of substance.\" Quite so.</p> <p>To be fair to Miliband, the archives are bursting with this stuff, much of it written by other people. When I spent a joyous few hours researching this piece, it was available in the same volume as french fries at McDonalds, and was similarly taste-free and borderline pointless. In 2005, for example, that bold New Labour outrider <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/09/labour.observerpolitics\" title=\"\">Stephen Byers told us</a>: \"Achieving renewal in office can play a crucial part in uniting the party. The process itself needs to be inclusive but perhaps even more importantly, it provides Labour with the opportunity to state exactly what it is for, rather than just what it is against \u2026 The task now is to bring forward a policy programme firmly based on the values of the centre-left. The promotion of social justice, opportunity for all and security would maintain that coalition of support that led to landslide victories in '97 and 2001.\"</p> <p>Burningly controversial, that was. Among its other disciples, the same rhetorical tradition found another outlet in James Purnell, now of the IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research) but once hyped as a future Labour leader. Even when liberated from ministerial office, he still tended <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/19/new-labour-left-unite-sect\" title=\"\">to speak in the same slightly strangulated way</a>: \"The left believes in equality \u2013 we disagree about equality of what, but we agree that it should be a goal \u2026 I think we need to widen out from a narrow focus on income, to aiming for equality of capability \u2013 giving everyone the power to pursue their goals \u2026 Over time, New Labour became too much of a sect \u2013 we went from big-tent politics to small-gazebo politics.\"</p> <p>Pardon? But back, anyway, to David Miliband and what's arguably the founding document of his recent outpourings, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/david-miliband-politics-broken-we-must-seize-chance-remake-it\" title=\"\">the leader column he wrote when he guest-edited the New Statesman</a> in July: \"As the economy stagnates, politics needs to respond with vigour and imagination \u2026 The danger is to confuse being a better opposition with becoming a potential government \u2026 Labour's history is that it wins and governs when it aligns an economic narrative of modernisation with a social agenda of compassion and a political culture of dynamism and progress \u2026 Today, Labour has a disruptive economic narrative \u2013 that Britain needs fundamental change in its market structure and culture to compete in the modern world. This is bold. Given the crash, it is also necessary \u2026 The point is that defence of the status quo cannot deliver our goals \u2026 In developing new policies, Labour cannot afford the old politics of a conversation with itself.\"</p> <p>Brilliant! While we're here, it's also worth mentioning a recent jointly authored piece <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/08/us-democratic-convention-david-miliband-douglas-alexander\" title=\"\">in the Observer</a> by Miliband and the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, who went all the way to the Democratic National Convention and came back brimming with useful thoughts. From the top, then: \"We need to be state reformers as well as market reformers \u2026. we win by looking like the whole of the country not just part of it \u2026 we have to find new ways to connect our politics with the small businesswoman in Ipswich, the GP in Fleetwood, the personal trainer in Gloucester.\"</p> <p>Sorry, but only people who have spent far too long in the mind-bending environs of Westminster could write a sentence like that. Who knew that things are now so bad there's only small businesswoman in Ipswich, and a solitary fitness instructor in Gloucester? And why pick on Fleetwood?</p> <p>You can do this stuff, too, if you're bored: it's like a party game for people who are far too interested in the minutiae of politics. Essentially, you sling together one or two cliches, at least one word or phrase (such as \"reboot\") that suggests you own a computer, and a couple of propositions that it would be impossible to argue against (a la \"Feed the world\" or \"Make trade fair\"). You then chuck in some apparently oxymoronic ideas, to make yourself look a bit clever.</p> <p>Just watch: \"We need to represent the whole of Britain, not just some of it. In doing so, we will move into the radical centre, and prove that if you're hard, you can also be soft. In a time of change, we must be the change-makers. Opportunity must be our watchword. Watchwords must be our opportunity. It is time to switch Britain off and on again. We deserve nothing less. And nothing more. Neither does the mechanic in Morecambe, or the wrestler in Rhyl. We will win. Or we might lose.\" Etc, etc.</p> <p>What, aside from firing muted shots in some factional battle no one really cares about, is the point? Right when this most miserable of rhetorical traditions is refusing to die, people at the opposite end of the political spectrum are mastering the business of being altogether more blunt and plain-spoken. For proof, read the already-infamous Tory treatise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/27/britannia-unchained-global-lessons-review\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a> \u2013 which may advocate working until you drop dead and deregulated everything, but is at least coherent and straightforward. Meanwhile, David Miliband and his ilk talk \u2013 but say what, exactly? Time to leave the gazebo, disrupt the economic narrative and reboot?</p>",
  "<p>Tech giant Google recently announced it would purchase renewable wind energy to help power one of its data centres in Mayes County, Oklahoma. The agreement marks the latest milestone in Google's mission to maintain a zero carbon footprint, a goal it says it reached in 2007.</p> <p>To hit this mark each year, besides using clean energy where possible, the company supports projects that produce carbon offsets and works to improve the energy efficiency of its worldwide <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/\" title=\"\">mega data centres</a>, which handle 3bn search queries daily, support 425m Gmail users and account for about 85% of Google's total carbon footprint.</p> <p>A focus on efficiency has been part of Google's approach from the beginning, says Joe Kava, the company's senior director of data centre operations, during a recent interview on the Google campus in Mountain View, California.</p> <p>Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin understood early on that building a computer network to organise the world's information would consume a vast amount of energy, especially if they used off-the-shelf computer servers available at the time. Kava says commercial servers of the day were not designed for the work Google needed to do, nor optimised for energy efficiency.</p> <p>As a consequence, \"money you are spending in overhead and wasted energy is just thrown away; it's not doing us any good and it's not doing the planet any good,\" says Kava.</p> <p>Instead, Google designed their own computer servers and the large warehouse-like spaces to hold all them. Today, Google shares these technical details selectively. Still, its decision-making process , as described by Kava, provides some useful insights for any business looking to reduce waste and trim carbon impacts.</p> <h2>Challenge conventional wisdom</h2> <p>Current estimates suggest that the world's data centres are consuming about 2% of the electricity generated each year. But at many data centres, up to half of this energy is being used to cool the servers or on other overheads rather than actually processing data.</p> <p>When Google began designing their own centres, they discovered that much of this cooling was unnecessary. \"Lots of specifications for data centres go back to mainframe days when computers were still using punch cards,\" says Kava, \"so most companies over cool their centres.\"</p> <p>Google has a simple test to make sure the data server rooms don't get too cold and waste energy unnecessarily. Employees who maintain the systems wear shorts, rather than long trousers, at work. If the data centre becomes uncomfortably cool for shorts-wearing workers, the temperature is too low.</p> <p>By rethinking many long-accepted practices, like cooling requirements, Google says its data centres are able to use 50% less power than the industry average.</p> <h2>Rely on natural systems whenever possible</h2> <p>Another technique for saving energy is to locate the data centres near natural sources of cool air or water whenever possible, says Kava. For example, the company completed installation of a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/hamina\" title=\"\">data centre in Finland</a> last year by refitting an old paper mill. The building's air-cooling systems will rely completely on cold, and free, seawater from the nearby Bay of Finland.</p> <h2>Co-operate with local communities </h2> <p>In Douglas County, Georgia, Google built its own water treatment plant that allows them to recycle wastewater obtained from the county for cooling its facility rather than taking valuable drinking water from the community. In a second phase of the process, Google cleans the water again before returning it to the nearby Chattahoochee River.</p> <p>\"The payback for this system is longer than we normally see,\" says Kava, \"but management decided it was the right thing to do for the environment and the community.\"</p> <h2>Share what you know </h2> <p>Google has long considered its unique data centre designs as a key competitive advantage. For much of the last decade, the company was notoriously tight lipped about these advances, disappointing some in the industry who believe best practices should be shared when it comes to environmental issues.</p> <p>Starting in 2008, Google began to publicise the energy efficiency numbers for its data centres, which it felt were industry leading at the time, using the standard industry metric of Power Usage Effectiveness (or PUE). Along with these numbers, the company shared some of the details about the designs that allowed them to achieve these levels.</p> <p>The sharing continued in 2009 and 2011, when Google hosted <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/external/index.html#conferences\" title=\"\">data centre efficiency summits</a> bringing together others in the industry. Google has since created a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/external/index.html\" title=\"\">best practice website</a>, which is aimed primarily at smaller companies who don't have the resources to build their own data centres from the ground up and are likely using commercial off-the-shelf equipment.</p> <p>\"A lot of these smaller data centres may be in a room in an office building where they feel like they are constrained from making modifications,\" says Kava. But there are a lot of simple things that these companies can do with quick paybacks that will improve efficiency, he adds.</p> <p>Most recently, Google took another step forward on its transparency journey, launching a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/\" title=\"\">new website</a> that gives a first-time, behind-the-curtain look at its data centre operations.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>I've been at the <a href=\"http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/home/\" title=\"\">Institute of Fundraising </a>for just over a year now. It is a huge privilege to lead the community of fundraisers \u2013 they really are the lifeblood of every charity. And despite being a tough year, their endless enthusiasm for fundraising and their commitment to making the world a better place never ceases to impress me.</p> <p>In the wider world the economy continues to struggle. <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/publicopinion/archive/4721/\" title=\"\">Our YouGov polling</a> earlier in the year showed the biggest reason people say they don't give is because they can't afford to, but at the same time the vast majority who do give said they only do so when Charities specifically ask for support. Fundamentally they understand the need for charities to employ fundraisers.</p> <p>But still only 7% of the population give more than \u00a3100 a year. This means that giving as a whole is flat, although evidence from our members shows that those Charities that are investing in fundraising continue to grow. Similarly,<a href=\"http://www.lvsc.org.uk/campaigns/big-squeeze.aspx\" title=\"\"> research shows</a> that even those who have traditionally relied on statutory funding are now beginning to diversify their income streams in order to maintain their services. Many of these have benefited from our <a href=\"http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/events-and-training/help-for-small-charities/training-courses/\" title=\"\">Small Charities Training programme</a>, which has already reached over 10,000 organisations.</p> <p>So fundraising is more important than ever.</p> <p>Yet we would be complacent to ignore the fact that some forms of fundraising do annoy a small percentage of people. Face-to-face fundraising is currently the most prominent example. Despite the fact that 865,000 people last year decided to sign up to a support a charity long term as a result of a face-to-face ask for support, securing \u00a3130 million per annum, a significant minority of people find it inconvenient. Others have been unfortunate enough to come across bad practice, which although not prevalent in the sector, does exist.</p> <p>For the Institute this is serious stuff. And we reacted swiftly. Our face-to-face Summit set up three high level taskgroups to look at standards, training and space allocation. They will report later this Autumn.</p> <p>Linked to this, <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/charities-act-review\" title=\"\">the Review of the Charities Act</a> has enabled us to clarify roles and responsibilities with the <a href=\"http://www.frsb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fundraising Standards Board (FRSB)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.pfra.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Public Fundraising Regulatory Authority (PFRA)</a>, with the IoF's role as the single code-writer formally confirmed as the foundation of the self-regulation system. And I'm looking forward to informing MPs about the success of self-regulation at the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/pasc\" title=\"\">Public Administration Select Committee </a>later this month. And our new, single code will be published on 13 November, and will be a huge asset for charities up and down the country committed to best practice fundraising.</p> <p>On behalf of members we also played an important role in the successful <a href=\"http://giveitbackgeorge.org/\" title=\"\">give it back george campaign</a>, and are now lobbying hard to make the <a href=\"http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ConsultationDocuments&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_031993\" title=\"\">Gift Aid Small Donation Scheme</a> work better for everyone.</p> <p>The Institute's professional development programme has continued to prosper, with, over 2,300 people at <a href=\" http://www.nationalconvention.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the convention</a>, and each and every conference crammed. And fundraisers are embracing our new professional qualifications delivered through<a href=\"http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/events-and-training/training/ about-iof-academy/\" title=\"\"> IoF Academy</a>. 250 people graduated with our certificate or diploma in fundraising last year. 56 people are studying for our online certificate of fundraising at this very moment. Our international advanced diploma is in development.</p> <h2>What else lies ahead?</h2> <p>We need to ensure that self-regulation continues to inspire the long term trust and confidence that charities deserve, whilst at the same time not consuming disproportionate amounts of charities time or precious resources.</p> <p>For the wider fundraising community we will work to make sure we become the best knowledge and resource hub that the whole community of fundraisers can turn to for the latest skills development, information, advice and research into fundraising. It is our role to enable fundraisers become the best they can be.</p> <p>And we will continue to press the government to create a better environment for fundraisers to raise money: improving Gift Aid; transforming payroll giving and encouraging more legacy giving to charity.</p> <p>Fundamentally we share the government's desire to increase giving, but will continue to make the case that an increase in giving is unlikely without more and better fundraising.</p> <p><em>Peter Lewis is chief executive of the </em><a href=\"http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/home/\" title=\"\"><em>Institute of Fundraising</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Sausage skin maker <strong>Devro</strong> has slipped up after warning that profits will be lower than expected.</p> <p>It blamed rises in raw materials, a trend which is forecast to continue into next year, as well as delays in commissioning new production plants and adverse exchange rate movements. It said:</p> <blockquote> As a result of the combination of adverse currency movements, continuing increases in raw material costs and extended plant commissioning periods, overall full year operating profits are expected to be slightly below our original expectations but ahead of last year. </blockquote> <p>It said demand was still high, especially in Japan, Europe and the Americas. But pork prices, for example, have reached a three year high after farmers cut back on pig herds because of the rising cost of animal feed.</p> <p>As for capacity, the company is spending \u00a335m this year on new plant but this will not boost productivity to any great degree until 2013.</p> <p>Devro's warning has seen its shares shed more than 6%, down 21.6p to 314.4p. Analyst Damian McNeela at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> We continue to believe in the long term growth opportunities provided by rising meat consumption in emerging markets and the opportunity to switch manufacturers from natural gut to collagen casings in developed markets. However given the near term operating challenges and a valuation that looks fair we maintain our hold recommendation and 320p price target. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has slipped back once more, down 8.13 points at 5888.02 as worries about global growth continue in the wake of some disappointing US corporate results, especially from technology companies like Google and Microsoft.</p> <p>Some positive signs from the eurozone, with Spain's governing party winning a key regional election and German chancellor Angela Merkel backing Ireland following its bank bailouts, helped limit the falls. Simon Denham at Capital Spreads said:</p> <blockquote> This morning in Europe indices have got off to a negative start following the big falls in the US at the end of last week. Late on Friday and much earlier this morning we had been calling the FTSE down as far as 5850 which did seem a little excessive so a degree of normalization has brought us back up with a few people thinking this might be a good chance to buy again following the dip. </blockquote> <p><strong>Aggreko</strong>, the temporary power supply business, lost another 36p to \u00a321.01 as analysts downgraded following Friday's warning on trading.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> has dropped 3.35p to 447.05p as investors awaited confirmation of its plan to sell its stake in its Russian joint venture to Rosneft.</p>",

  "<p>How much does local government spend on procurement globally? In the US, I estimate that the public sector procurement spend by and within states <a href=\"http://www.cut-the-deficit.com/\" title=\"\">amounts to some $1.5tn a year</a>. This is around 70% of total US public sector spend. Yet in the UK, some of this expenditure \u2013 such as spending by universities and higher education institutions \u2013 would bot be recognised as a local government cost.</p> <p>Here in the UK, local government expenditure accounts for the equivalent of approximately US$80bn, just under 25% of total UK public sector spend. In other countries such as Indonesia, Poland, Australia and South Africa, much government procurement spend is delegated to local government.</p> <p>Globally, anything between 25% and 75% of total public sector procurement could account for spending by local governments; for large countries, \"local government\" can include states and provinces that have sufficient devolved responsibilities.</p> <p>So how much is the global public sector spending on procurement? No reliable figure exists. In the US, it is close to 12.5% of GDP. In the UK it is about 20%. In Indonesia the figure is just 5% of GDP. We might naturally presume that this pattern continues around the globe, with government procurement as a proportion of GDP much greater in the developed world.</p> <p>Globally, a figure of 10% of total GDP looks a pretty conservative estimate for public sector procurement. This would amount to US$7tn and, of this total, local government would account for around $3.5tn.</p> <p>Why does this matter? Because this immense resource is not well managed. In the UK, despite improvements, procurement management is fragmented, with individual local authorities coping with varying expertise. In the US, it is fragmented between and within states; there appears to be no state with an overall picture of both the state government's procurement spend and the public sector spend within its geographical boundaries (though Virginia has an excellent handle on the state government's own procurement spend).</p> <p>Data on procurement \u2013 who spends the budget, with whom, on what and where \u2013 is often woefully inadequate, which means that the fundamentals of good procurement management are immediately lost. In countries such as Indonesia or Poland \u2013 and even in some areas in the UK and the US \u2013 central government has ineffective oversight of local government procurement. This fragmentation means that nations cannot use public sector spending to manage markets, whether to obtain lowest cost or to support economic growth.</p> <p>Local government in both the UK and the US is struggling with limited resources. Much better management of this huge expenditure could help alleviate some of the problems both countries are facing.</p> <p>In the UK, there is plenty of evidence of the benefits of joint procurement, within central and local government, the NHS and education. And the UK does have a fair idea of how and with whom the money is spent. Yet progress towards mature joint procurement remains slow, despite common suppliers and common products and services.</p> <p>In US there is some collaboration between states, but this represents a small proportion of procurement spend.</p> <p>So why might councils and authorities be reluctant to work together on procurement? On both sides of the Atlantic there are fears about loss of independence; could joint procurement turn out to be the thin end of the wedge?</p> <p>Naturally, joint procurement could lead to fewer jobs and turkeys won't vote for Christmas. There is also a typical conservatism about moving away from known suppliers and specifications to work with new partners, while decision-makers sometimes have little understanding of procurement and how to secure the best deal from the process.</p> <p>The first large country to bring together its total procurement spend, have clear oversight of the budget and an ability to implement social policies through procurement, will have an economic advantage over its competitors. It will be able to ensure that procurement resources are directed towards those industries which generate economic growth. It is unlikely to happen in either the UK or the US in the coming years.</p> <p><em>Colin Cram is a consultant and the former chief executive of the North West Centre of Excellence </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>A Sri Lankan newspaper has apologised to a minister for reporting that he had threatened its editor with death - even though she recorded him doing so.</p> <p>Let's disentangle that bizarre turn of events. In July this year, the defence minister Gotabaya Rajapaksa threatened the editor of the Sunday Leader, Frederica Jansz, during a phone interview. </p> <p>At one point, Rajapaksa shouted at her: \"You pig that eats shit! You shit shit dirty fucking journalist... People will kill you. People hate you. They will kill you!\"</p> <p>But, in September, the ownership of the then independent Sunday Leader changed hands. It was acquired by Asanga Seneviratne, an ally of the president. </p> <p>One of his first decisions was to fire the editor after she refused to prevent her reporters from criticising the government.</p> <p>\"It is unbelievable that the Sunday Leader has apologised in front of the Sri Lanka Press Council to the defence minister,\" said Dr Agnes Callamard, executive director of Article 19, the global organisation that defends press freedom.</p> <p>Article 19 warned the United Nations last April that affiliates of the president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, appeared to be buying up private media, and thereby reducing diversity and narrowing debate.</p> <p>In January 2009, the Sunday Leader's then editor, Lasantha Wickrematunge, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/12/srilanka-censorship\">was murdered on his way to work.</a> Nobody has ever been prosecuted for the crime. </p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.ifex.org/sri_lanka/2012/10/19/apology_to_minister/\">IFEX</a></p>",

  "<p>Syria, more than anywhere else, is sorely testing Barack Obama's hands-off policy in the Middle East. So grave is the crisis in the Levant that it will go close to defining the success of the US president's second term \u2013 or Mitt Romney's first.</p> <p>If Obama was to be judged now on how he has dealt with the ever-worsening Syrian civil war, history would likely be harsh. The US has remained largely on the sidelines of the most violent episode of the Arab spring, shaping its response through the regional policy it laid down before the first stirrings of uprising in Tunisia.</p> <p>Soon after replacing George W Bush, Obama rubber-stamped the Republican president's policy shift, which pledged to recast the way the US dealt with the entrenched Arab world order. From 2006, Bush had said, the 50-year approach of favouring stability over democracy was to be turned on its head. Democracy was to be paramount. Stability, it was suggested, was to play second fiddle.</p> <p>Bush's resolve was barely put to the test, apart from some faltering steps towards nation-building in Iraq. Not so Obama. Almost everything about the first few heady months of the Arab spring spoke directly to the values Obama had first championed in his landmark 2009 address to the Arab world in Cairo: tyranny needed to defeated by self-determination, state repression trumped by accountability, violence checked by the rule of law.</p> <p>After rumbling through north Africa, the same themes soon took root in Syria, where they were confronted with a withering rearguard from the regime and its backers \u2013 primarily Iran and Hezbollah, as well as an old enemy, Russia. The US knew from the outset that this was to be no romp through the desert like Libya. After readily agreeing to send jets and missiles to bomb Gaddafi, Obama's administration has steadfastly refused to do the same to Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>A soaring death count, the growing threat of regional spillover, expectations from Sunni allies that Washington take the lead in stemming the chaos, and rising belligerence from Tel Aviv to Tehran have done nothing to shift Obama. And nor will they as he fights the last three weeks of a presidential campaign fought largely on domestic issues and his belief that the US should no longer take a stake in all the world's core problems.</p> <p>A president who won office partly on getting out of giant misadventures in the Middle East clearly doesn't want to campaign on the merits of getting the US involved in another one.</p> <p>The US military, its institutions \u2013 and the presidency \u2013 have learned some key lessons from Iraq, especially the perils of taking a power stake in a sectarian state. Almost 10 years on from the second Iraq war, there is nothing to suggest that intervening in Syria would be any easier. Far from it.</p> <p>The vacuum that would follow the fall of Damascus would become a high-stakes contest for myriad players. Two of them, Hezbollah and Iran, have an enormous amount to lose if Assad is ousted. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states have a lot to lose if he stays.</p> <p>Add to that the slowly growing presence of global jihadists, who for now remain a minority voice among an insurrection that started as a nationalistic push but is losing some ground to a sectarian agenda.</p> <p>Arming the rebel groups opposed to Assad remains fraught. Attempts by the US and Turkey to organise the many groups under a functional command haven't worked. Without that, a re-elected Obama is unlikely to change his first-term opposition to sending the heavy weapons that rebel fighters need to mount a serious threat to what remains of the regime's military.</p> <p>Obama spent much of his first term recalibrating what he deemed to be his national security interests. Filtered through the realpolitik of getting re-elected, Syria has remained in the too-hard tray with neither him or his inner court conceding that what is happening as the country crumbles directly affects the US.</p> <p>That position cannot last. Syria is perilously close to the abyss and its likely descent further will affect all corners of the region and far beyond. From the inauguration on, Syria will be central to the stage, along with its key backer, Iran. What to do about it will prove a defining chapter for US interests.</p>",
  "<p>The view from the top of the British fashion food chain has never looked more commanding. From the moment Kate Middleton stepped out of a vintage Rolls Royce Phantom last year in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/apr/29/kate-middleton-dress-sarah-burton\">an exquisite Sarah Burton ivory satin and lace wedding dress</a> to the closing ceremony celebration of our nation's top designers at this<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/12/london-2012-olympics-closing-ceremony-live\"> summer's London Olympics</a>, British fashion has been riding the crest of a giddy export wave.<br> But while the likes of Stella McCartney, Vivienne Westwood, Victoria Beckham and Christopher Kane are enjoying global acclaim as part of a sector that's worth \u00a320.9billion to the UK economy, further down the line the all-important ecosystem that feeds this success is under serious threat. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398143079\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349292919844/Stella-McCartney-004.jpg\" alt=\"Stella McCartney\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stella McCartney: doing well, but where's the next generation going to learn its trade?

In the first six months of this year alone almost 1,000 fashion independents <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/12/london-2012-olympics-closing-ceremony-live\">have closed their doors for the last time</a> according to the Local Data Company.<br> Long seen as space where star designers of the future are nurtured, as well as bringing diversity to counter homogenous high-street looks, high street fashion boutiques have been lashed by the harsh winds of recession. Mixed clothing indies have been the hardest hit, shrinking almost 4% in the last six months with the damage extending as far as some of the most fashionable streets of London. On Kings Road, for example, the elegantly dressed mannequins that posed in the window of Mimi <a href=\"http://www.kingsroadrocks.com/2012/03/whats-happening-to-the-kings-road/\">are no longer there. </a>Only empty fittings and bare walls are on show at the recently closed boutique that had been open since 1997.<br> In the street with the richest history of style in the UK you're more likely to see a frozen yoghurt shop open than a fashion boutique these days. For many in the industry the disconnect between a fragile high street ecosystem and the success of UK fashion powerhouses suggests big problems in the longer term. There are some in Government starting to recognise this, including the Business Secretary, Vince Cable. Earlier this year, he admitted to Drapers magazine that his department did not take fashion \"seriously enough\" as an economy boosting sector. The Government, he conceded, \"has an obligation to support it\". That was nearly six months ago and, as the situation on the high street continues to worsen, these warm words have yet to translate into meaningful action.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398143080\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348682370598/Rochdale-Pioneers-004.jpg\" alt=\"Rochdale Pioneers\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rochdale's Co-op Pioneers. Business rates and credit insurance would have challenged even them.  Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Some of this is down to the fact that Government has failed to grasp what the central problems are. Grant Shapps' obsession with competitions and golden tickets \u2013 the alarmingly titled<a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/economicgrowth/highstreetsportas/x-fund/\"> Future High Street X-Fund</a> being the latest manifestation of this craze \u2013 has blinded the public, media and politicians alike to the serious policy challenges that need to be tackled.<br> The decline of fashion indies isn't just down to tough trading conditions. Unfair business rates and a credit insurance crisis are the real ball and chain making recovery almost impossible. Putting aside for one moment the fact we've seen business rate increases of more than half a billion pounds in the last two years for retail, it's the massively unfair variations that are compounding the misery for high streets. Business rates for an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10285674\">ASOS distribution centre in Barnsley</a>, for example, are calculated at \u00a340 per square metre. Yet for a shop in Rochdale shopping centre they work out at \u00a31,080 per square metre. It's this flawed and out of date business rate model that's making it impossible for some independent shops to compete.<br> Both examples are of retail businesses competing for the same pound. But while one operates from an online platform the other competes on the high street \u2013 and yet there are huge differences in operating costs so far as business rates are concerned. As long as the dinosaurs at the <a href=\"http://www.voa.gov.uk/\">Valuation Office Agency</a> are creating rateable values on high streets in a way that's totally out of kilter with market prices and comparable sites in other areas, the operating costs will continue to punish fashion indies to the point where they're forced to call it a day.<br> But if business rates continue to be a slap in the face for traders on the high street then calamitous changes to credit insurance represent a near fatal blow to fashion indies. Brands rely on credit insurance to protect them in the case of their stock being caught in the supply chain when a small business goes under. In recent years we've seen a massive withdrawal of credit insurance to brands, which, in turn, has radically changed the relationship between brands and independent stockists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398143081\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/7/1349635166016/Grant-Shapps-002.jpg\" alt=\"Grant Shapps\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00adGrant Shapps. His high street gimmicks are not enough. Photograph: Ray Tang/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Tang/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Because a loss of credit insurance leaves brands exposed, the credit terms they offer to indies have been drastically altered, putting huge pressure on cashflows in small businesses already run on very tight margins and without access to finance from their banks.</p> <p> <br>Earlier this year I was involved in research on the changes in credit terms to almost 300 fashion indies across the country. We found that nearly 80 per cent of respondents had seen their credit terms change within the last 12 months and with nearly two thirds now having to finance stock purchases up front through personal savings and almost half using their own credit cards. At the time Roger Wade, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxfresh\">creator of Boxfresh brand</a> and <a href=\"http://www.boxpark.co.uk/brand/boxfresh/\">director of Boxpark</a>, was one of a number of industry voices to note that this was unsustainable. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If more and more independents have to fund their businesses through personal means they're going to fail. <br> Small business owners just don't have deep enough pockets to do this and without credit there will be more business failure. If credit insurers continue to remove levels of cover then things are going to get a lot worse. I hate the phrase 'government intervention' because I don't like government interfering in private business but I think it's the only option now.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> I subsequently went to meet policy advisors from Vince Cable's department to talk about this. Several months later I was informed they had met just a single credit insurer who told them retail was a difficult sector. Government, it would appear, shares this position and takes the view that standing back and observing a steady decline is the least difficult option. What's becoming more obvious where retail policy is concerned is that there's a crying need for some strategic heavy lifting from Government. From the radical reform of business rates to getting credit insurers around the table to ensure stock flows, these are the issues that will determine the future for fashion indies on the high street. There's been too much lightweight, headline-seeking activity around high streets for too long. It's time ministers put their hands in the chalk bucket and got a grip. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398143082\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350884315189/Paul.jpg\" alt=\"rochdale shops\" width=\"54\" height=\"79\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><a href=\"https://jp.twitter.com/Paul25Ten\"><br><strong>Paul Turner-Mitchell</strong> </a>owns <a href=\"http://www.25tenboutique.com/blog/new-flagship-store-for-rochdale-boutique\">Rochdale's 25 Ten boutique</a>, writes columns for Drapers and Retail Week and contributed to Mary Portas' high street review.

  "<p>A lost generation of 14 million out-of-work and disengaged young Europeans is costing member states a total of \u20ac153bn (\u00a3124bn) a year \u2013 1.2% of the EU's gross domestic product \u2013 the largest study of the young unemployed has concluded.</p> <p>The report, by the EU's own research agency, Eurofound, has discovered that Europeans aged 15 to 29 who are not in employment, education or training (known as Neets) have reached record levels and are costing the EU \u20ac3bn a week in state welfare and lost production.</p> <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said Europe was \"failing in its social contract\" with the young and rising political disenchantment could reach levels similar to those that sparked North African uprisings during the Arab spring.</p> <p>The research, which will be presented at a high-level EU presidency employment meeting in Cyprus on Monday, backs such fears: a survey of EU Neets included in the report found much lower levels of political engagement and trust compared with those in work.</p> <p>\"The consequences of a lost generation are not merely economic,\" the report warns, \"but are societal, with the risk of young people opting out of democratic participation in society.\"</p> <p>The number of young adults in work across 26 member states is the lowest on record, the report's authors found. Those in employment were working fewer hours and in less secure jobs. Last year 42% of young working Europeans were in temporary employment, up from just over a third a decade ago. A total of 30%, or 5.8 million young adults, were in part-time employment \u2013 an increase since 2001 of nearly nine percentage points.</p> <p>Since the global downturn in 2008, there has been a 28% increase in associated Neet costs across the EU, with Italy facing an annual bill of \u20ac32.6bn a year, France \u20ac22bn, and the UK \u20ac18bn. At the start of this month the International Labour Organisation reported that <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/youth-employment/lang--en/index.htm#a1\" title=\"\">worldwide, young people were three times more likely to be unemployed than adults</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_190716/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">urged the G20 to look for \"new approaches\"</a>.</p> <p>The new EU report calculates that as a proportion of annual national output, Ireland is estimated to have lost 2.8% of its GDP to inactive young adults in 2011, while Greece lost 3.28% and Poland 2.04%.</p> <p>The UK, the report concludes, lost 1% of GDP to an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/feb/24/neets-statistics\" title=\"\">inability to engage potential young workers</a> \u2013 a figure that contrasts with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/24/uk-gdp-growth-2011-revised-down\" title=\"\">2011 growth of 0.8%</a>.</p> <p>The report's authors warn that the total EU costs associated with rising numbers of Neets \u2013 \u20ac10.8bn in public finance and \u20ac142.1bn in estimated loss of output \u2013 are \"very conservative\", as they do not include extra spending on crime or health or the likely long-term scarring effect of unemployment.</p> <p>However, they add that it is unrealistic to expect all Neets \u2013 who make up 15% of the total young adult population in the EU \u2013 to be integrated into the workplace, as the figure also includes those who might be looking after children or suffering from ill health.</p> <p>\"[The] \u20ac153bn is a hypothetical situation if all young people could be integrated into the labour market,\" said the report's lead researcher, Massimiliano Mascherini. \"But another way to see it is that if just 10% of Neets could be reintegrated, 1.4 million people, it will represent a saving of \u20ac15bn [every year].\"</p> <p>Of those out of education, training and employment, 73% of 15- to 19-year-olds had no experience of work at all, dropping to 43% for those aged 20 to 24 and 28% for 25- to 29-year-olds. In southern European countries such as Italy, Bulgaria and Greece, the figure for Neets aged 25 to 29 with no experience of work rose to over 40%. <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/employment/ministerial/mrstefanoscarpettaheadofemploymentanalysisandpolicydivisionoecd.htm\" title=\"\">Stefano Scarpetta</a>, the OECD's head of employment analysis and policy, warned that disenchantment within Europe's young adult population was reaching dangerous levels.</p> <p>\"We are failing in our social contract,\" he told the Guardian. \"We are not giving option or opportunity to those who have invested in their human capital \u2026 [and] if we don't address these issues \u2026 soon social and political tensions will increase.\"</p> <p>Scarpetta added: \"The parallel in the Maghreb region is telling because there there was in some cases significant economic growth, with major investment in education. So the generation of young people who were in education were much better trained than the previous generation and yet there were no jobs waiting for them. The only jobs were low paid and service sector jobs.</p> <p>\"That was one of the major triggers, that of political social unrest, that then led to the revolutions in those countries.</p> <p>\"I don't think we are there in Europe but some dissatisfaction, and with our economic model, is building up and that's why I think it is very urgent to address the issue of \u2026 inactivity in young people.\"</p> <p>While tertiary education is still a shield against unemployment, Mascherini said his team discovered that 30% of Greek graduates were Neets. In Italy it was 20% \u2013 twice the EU average.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bath.ac.uk/sps/staff/paul-gregg/\" title=\"\">Paul Gregg, professor of economic and social policy at Bath University</a> and an expert in the scarring effects of long-term unemployment, said that according to his own <a href=\"http://dev.acevo.org.uk/commission-on-youth-unemployment-calls-for-emergency-action-as-research-finds-28bn-timebomb-on-uk-finances/\" title=\"\">study in the UK</a>, the EU report's stated annual costs could rise significantly. \"For young people, the time when you're gaining the experience and skills which lead to rapid advancements in your earning potential really focuses between 18 and 30.</p> <p>\"[So] if you're out of work for a year or so, what you're doing is forgoing that experience, so you are permanently delayed. When people are in their 30s they don't catch back up [with peers] who don't have that absence from the world of work.\"</p> <p>He said the 30% of unemployed young people across Europe who had been out of work for longer than a year would represent a drag on output for years to come.</p> <p>\"A young person as a Neet has 10% lower wages and spends about another month a year out of work even after they stop being a Neet,\" he said \u2013 something which needed to be factored into the long-term costs.</p> <p>Peter Matjasic, <a href=\"http://www.youthforum.org/index.php\" title=\"\">president of the European Youth Forum</a>, the representative body of more than 90 national youth councils and international youth NGOs, said: \"The Nobel committee talk of the success of the 'European dream' and European leaders this week spoke about strengthening it. But without investing in youth now, it is in danger of becoming a lost dream.\" He added that EU leaders needed to get to grips with the problem to make the European \"vision a reality for a generation\".</p> <p>The UK education department said: \"The number of young people who are not in education, employment or training is still too high. We are determined to tackle this. We are spending a record \u00a37.5bn on education and training for 16- to 19-year-olds this year.\"</p> <p>It added that coalition education reform would \"create a world-class education system that will equip young people properly for both higher education and skilled, sustainable employment\".</p>",

We followed a single track road off the A373 to El Colmenar, through ancient cork-oak groves. The barks are still harvested for cork. Griffon vultures crouched in the canopy while golden eagles circled above. As we climbed higher, the cork-oaks gave way to conifers and, most unexpectedly, cows foraging among giant pine cones.<br><a href=\"http://www.alcornocales.org\" title=\"\"><em>alcornocales.org</em></a><br><strong>Valerie1</strong></p> <h2>Americas</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398219296\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/17/1350492817535/White-Mountains-National--001.jpg\" alt=\"White Mountains National Forest, New Hampshire New Hampshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White Mountains National Forest, New Hampshire.

Once again, dreadful road form has taken its toll on their season and the Timbers have been limping through the second half of the season under temporary management after the sacking of John Spencer. Caretaker manager Gavin Wilkinson has had his moments, but will doubtless be deeply relieved to get back upstairs to his more general sporting managerial role, and leave the day to day to head coach elect Caleb Porter. Porter doesn\u2019t officially start his duties until the college season finishes, but you can be sure that for the last few weeks, every Portland player knows he may be playing for his contract next season, as the new coach arrives with a mandate to transform the club.</p> <p>A few of them may be hoping that their last game against Seattle was not part of the assessment process. Given the opportunity to seal the Cascadia Cup on their opponents turf, the Timbers were instead blown away by their biggest rivals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;369&quot; id=&quot;cf3e570oi&quot; name=&quot;cf3e570on&quot; classid=&quot;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1198778/1198778_2012-10-07-235318.640hq.mp4&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;embed width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;369&quot; src=&quot;https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1198778/1198778_2012-10-07-235318.640hq.mp4&quot; id=&quot;cf3e570ei&quot; name=&quot;cf3e570en&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; allowScriptAccess=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But as the first clip shows, this Portland side have beaten Vancouver already this year and would dearly love to not only take the Cascadia Cup, but finally get a road win and perhaps just as enjoyably, make the Whitecaps sweat on securing a play-off spot. One thing they won\u2019t want to experience is a second successive game of rivals gloating at their expense...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50847c0e58f96784ee290845\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-21T22:49:51.195Z\">11.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Vancouver Whitecaps</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Now that the MLS regular season is nearly over, we\u2019re getting closer to being able to make an objective judgement of the Martin Rennie revolution at Vancouver. After a pre-season of turnover that most outsiders looked at with nods of approval, Rennie ended up with more upheaval in the summer as the likes of Kenny Miller, Barry Robson and Dane Richards arrived for the run in. Initially the changes seemed to actually stall the team\u2019s progress, but gradually the Whitecaps have found their form, and also belatedly their goalscoring touch.</p> <p>Their progress to the playoffs was built on decent defense and good home form early in the season, but they were rarely a side who threatened to blow the opposition away with goals. And while their recent 4-0 breakout win against Chivas USA was against a side shockingly low in confidence in form, the same team they beat were able to rally enough to tie with FC Dallas a few days later and it was a timely confidence boost for the Whitecaps</p> <p>It\u2019s that result, stalling the charge of Dallas, perhaps as much as anything Vancouver have done in recent weeks that now means they can seal their play-off place tonight. A point will do it. They may be glad it\u2019s not a win that\u2019s required - since entering MLS last season they\u2019ve yet to beat either Seattle or Portland - their Cascadia Cup rivals.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50847a4e58f96784ee290844\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-21T22:42:23.392Z\">11.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One more playoff spot at stake then, and one team from the West to fill it. Later on this evening FC Dallas will travel to Seattle hoping that their dim play-off hopes are still alive, while right now we'll be watching the other two members of the Cascadia triumvirate* clash with something at stake for both of them.</p> <p>For Vancouver, it's the chance to take their first MLS play-off spot and indeed after now several years of Toronto failures, and a valiant but just-shy effort from Montreal, a Canadian team's first ever play-off spot in only the Whitecaps second season in MLS. After Dallas stumbled against Chivas last weekend, the Whitecaps, who may have been getting twitchy at the sight of David Ferreira et al closing in behind them, now need just a point from their final two games to guarantee qualification in the fifth and final spot, and what may be a trip to Los Angeles in the wild card game (more on that particular permutation in a bit).</p> <p>To get that point though, the Whitecaps have to go through a side who form suggests they should have the measure of, especially given the visitors' terrible road form, but must do so in a game where that form is perhaps less relevant than the fact that a Cascadia Cup is at stake. Win tonight and Portland may be the only one of the three Cascadia sides to miss out on the play-offs, but they will have some measure of bragging rights over their rivals in a season where there has been very little to brag about.</p> <p>More on these two teams in a moment.
