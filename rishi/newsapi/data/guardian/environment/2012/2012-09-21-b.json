  "<p>If you wanted a quick insight into the character and capacities of <a href=\"http://www.salmayaqoob.com/\" title=\"\">Salma Yaqoob</a>, you could do worse than bring up a clip, now on YouTube, of one of her appearances on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdq-3POhhfw\" title=\"\">Question Time, in&#xa0;December 2009</a>.</p> <p>The programme was broadcast that night from Wootton Bassett. It was broadcast not just to licence-fee payers in Britain, but also to serving British soldiers, including those in Afghanistan, and it had six panellists, rather than the usual five: Yaqoob, General Sir Richard Dannatt, then serving as defence adviser to David Cameron, Paddy Ashdown, Piers Morgan, Bill Rammell, then minister of state for the armed forces, and William Hague, then shadow foreign minister.</p> <p>The first, striking effect was visual \u2013 six men, including David Dimbleby, and a slight woman in a bright green cardigan and pale hijab. The next was the reasoned force of Yaqoob's argument, and how clearly and directly she spoke. Directly, first, to defuse any kneejerk doubts about her national loyalties: \"I&#xa0;am a mother,\" she said: \"I have three sons. I would be proud to have my sons defend this country\"; then to those abroad and in Wootton Bassett, concerned about the treatment of troops (the way the government is treating soldiers is \"an absolute disgrace\"), and then, having given the various constituencies unequivocal evidence that she had heard and thought about them, eviscerated the reasons for going to war, and the supposed reasons for staying. When she finished, four audience members spoke up, and all said the same thing. I agree with Salma.</p> <p>The Respect party, of which she was leader, was doing well enough that when the general election was called four months later, they hoped to take three seats. In the event, they took none, though Yaqoob came second to Labour in Birmingham Hall Green by only 3,799 votes, achieving an 11.7% swing from Labour to Respect and making it a marginal seat. After 2010, membership dropped below 1,000, but then the coalition cuts began to bite, and a party that had always campaigned both against inequality (or neoliberalism, as they would put it) as well as foreign wars (imperialism, they'd say), found that it was the former that people really wanted to talk about.</p> <p>Then in March of this year <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/30/george-galloway-bradford-west-byelection\" title=\"\">George Galloway was elected MP of Bradford West</a> in a result that left Labour reeling. In the local elections in May, Respect acquired five councillors in Bradford. There was even talk of another possible byelection if <a href=\"http://liambyrne.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Liam Byrne</a> ran for mayor of Birmingham (voters rejected the idea of a mayor altogether), and of Yaqoob then becoming Respect's second MP.</p> <p>But last week, she resigned. The immediate catalyst was Galloway, who had said in a podcast that some of the allegations against Julian Assange by two Swedish women did not constitute rape \"as most people understand it\"; that Assange was simply guilty of \"bad sexual etiquette\". When I ask how these comments led to her leaving the party she helped to&#xa0;found, there is a long pause.</p> <p>Yaqoob, 41, is, in person, even slighter than she seems on television \u2013 she has long, thin arms and a face miraculously unlined by a decade spent raising three boys, working as a councillor in Birmingham (she resigned for reasons of ill-health last year), running a part-time psychotherapy practice \u2013 oh, and leading a new political party. She has just had a new kitchen fitted, and the backyard of her home in the Moseley area of Birmingham is piled with cardboard boxes. The ceilings are high, and the rooms full of light. On the kitchen table sits a straw basket of chapatis she has been baking.</p> <p>\"I've always admired George's anti-imperialist stances and I don't regret, for a second, standing side by side on those issues. But for me, to have to make a choice between that and standing up for the rights of women was a false choice. I thought it was a blurring of something that didn't need to be blurred. It's not that complicated \u2013 you can hold two ideas at the same time.\" Of course, \"we're all human, we can't always make perfectly worded and crafted sentences \u2013 I really hoped a clarification would sort that out.\" She published a statement setting out her own position, but then, as she describes it, things escalated. Although she says Galloway never got directly in contact \u2013 and still hasn't \u2013 she felt she was being personally maligned; that \"under the guise of different names there were personal attacks\".</p> <p>The irony is, of course, that so much of Galloway's victory in Bradford West was ascribed to women, and particularly women from traditional backgrounds who had in the past been expected to vote the way their husbands or fathers or brothers voted \u2013 the baradari system that generally delivered block votes to Labour \u2013 \"that's why it's been deeply disappointing, because I do feel that those women have been let down. [Comments like that] open the door to women being treated in a certain way. You are just dismissed, your views are not taken seriously, and a certain reactionary attitude is encouraged rather than challenged.\"</p> <p>A week before, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/31/manchester-greater-manchester\" title=\"\">Kate Hudson, who had joined Respect from the Communist party</a> after the Bradford byelection, and had been selected as their candidate for Manchester Central, withdrew her candidacy; there have been reports that in the week since Yaqoob left, others have followed her. There were accounts of crisis meetings held in Bradford, predictions in the Pakistani press (which also noted that Yaqoob had been <a href=\"http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-131640-Galloways-Respect-Party-leader-Salma-Yaqoob-resigns\">\"highly upset when thuggish elements, including some with a highly radical religious agenda, took control of the party during the election campaign\"</a>, although this is not an issue she mentions in our conversation) of mass exit. Yet, according<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/sep/13/georgegalloway-bradford-west-byelection-2012-muslim-women-salma-yaqoob-rape\" title=\"\"> to a piece on this paper's website, when Galloway addressed the Bradford Muslim Women's Circle</a>, hours after Yaqoob's resignation, he was still standing by \"every word I said in my podcast\".</p> <p>It looks like Respect, only six months after a great electoral victory, is imploding. Is this the end of your party? \"Only time will tell. Councillors have just been elected, on a very clear mandate. They are hardworking and principled and there is an opportunity still for them to enact that vision.\" But it would not be too extreme to assume that a significant part of that famous women's vote in Bradford came about because she comes from the Pakistani community (when her parents arrived in Britain they settled first in Bradford, where she still has family, and then in Birmingham, where her father worked 18-hour days at the Post Office to support seven children), because she is trusted and (often reluctantly) admired for a public role that has at times been difficult to play; surely the combination of her leaving, and leaving over an issue so specific to the way women are treated, is a body blow ? \"I think ... George has to deal with that in the way that he sees fit. And reflect on that.\" There's a sudden sense of the tone her sons must hear when they have overstepped the mark.</p> <p>One of the issues that has been increasingly true of Respect is the way in which it has often seemed, from the outside at least, to be dominated by one man, Gorgeous George, with all his undeniable gifts, but also his unpredictability, his ego, his sometimes dubious decisions (his salute to Saddam Hussein's \"courage, strength and indefatigability\"; his stated \"respect and admiration\" of Syria's Assad in an email). Many people did not necessarily realise Yaqoob was party leader. Was that not galling? \"Not at all! It's not a popularity contest \u2013 at least not for me. It's about the ideas \u2013 and I'm proud \u2013 whoever champions those ideas and they get that support it's a victory for all of us. Which is why I'm very open about supporting, for example, members of the Green party, or members of the Labour party, who share that progressive vision.\"</p> <p>Ah yes, the Green party. And Labour. Immediately after she resigned, Caroline Lucas was tweeting, \"Really hope Salma Yaqoob's resignation from Respect doesn't mean she's leaving politics \u2013 we need her clarity and vision,\" and Birmingham Labour MP Richard Burden was suggesting a possible future in Labour. These overtures are not a new development \u2013 it has even, in the past, been reported that she's had approaches from the Lib Dems and the Conservatives (which says something about the worlds she straddles, and the nature of her appeal; it could also be a cynical calculation about visible diversification and the attendant votes).</p> <p>\"This is all in 2010 \u2013 it's no secret that people have made approaches. But then my political platform and principles are very, very clear \u2013 there was never that temptation. And right now, although I'm very flattered and honoured, I'm taking stock.\" (She says that Galloway has been keen to find a way back to Labour. \"This is the irony \u2013 he's always said to me, 'if you have an approach, just make sure that I can come back in'. Ironically, that has not been on the cards. I think it's a great sadness to him, understandably, that he was expelled [for his vocal opposition to the Iraq war].\")</p> <p>Not everyone, of course, would be happy to see her join the Labour party: \"Labour right already hyperventilating at thought of @SalmaYaqoob joining party. No problem with Tories though #doublestandards,\" tweeted Diane Abbott. Others pointed to an open letter Yaqoob signed that stated: \"The US government and its allies, and their friends in the media, have built up a campaign against Assange which now sees him in prison facing extradition on dubious charges \u2026 We demand his immediate release, the dropping of all charges, and an end to the censorship of WikiLeaks.\" \"If you don't want the seriousness of the charges to be diminished,\" blogged Dan Hodges, \"why denounce them as 'dubious', claim they are part of a US government conspiracy, and call for them to be dropped?\" The word \"charges\" relates to extradition, she points out \u2013 Assange has not yet been charged with rape.</p> <p>There is also a significant cohort worried about the nature of the membership of Respect, that it is an uneasy alliance of far left and Islamist far right.\"I will not accept that. I've been there from the beginning. I know that we have fought those very reactionary forces, we challenged them from within. I get the hate calls \u2013 I get people in the streets saying, 'She is trying to wreck our homes.' I've had the death threats, that anyone who beheads me will go straight to heaven. Because I promote democracy, because I have a very clear stance on pluralism. Pluralism is not about just supporting people you happen to agree with anyway. I would challenge anybody to say where I have pandered to, never mind encouraged, any reactionary stance.\"</p> <p>It has been exhausting, she says, arguing with \"people who misunderstand or deliberately project their stereotypes, so you're constantly saying, 'I'm not this' or 'I'm not that,' while trying to maintain a clarity of what you actually are.\" This is, in many ways, one of the most likable and impressive things about her \u2013 her robust refusal of easy, essentialising demographic assumptions, even those that might initially play, politically, in her favour \u2013 but also, having done this, her patient spelling out of a vision. Granted, that vision can sound incredibly idealistic, and in these careful days almost shockingly left-wing, but, unusually for a political leader, it doesn't feel rote.</p> <p>And this ability to stand for herself is, of course, what she'd be risking by joining a bigger party such as Labour \u2013 even though she makes a point of saying that they seem to be making baby steps in what (for her) is the right direction: \"We've seen Ed Miliband say that the Iraq war was wrong. We've seen him be bold before a lot of other people about Murdoch and the corporatisation of media, the fact that he's talking about inequality as an issue.\" But for her it is all still too timid. \"I think there is real potential for mobilising around what people are feeling right now at home. And yet [they are also] feeling, 'Who's championing us, who's speaking for us?' There is a vacuum there. Labour is the natural home for those people, but it needs to not take that for granted, needs to infuse [their message] not just with a negative narrative of, 'Oh, the Tories are scary and let people down,' but actually with hope.\"</p>",

  "<p>On the popular website Reddit, where users submit and share content, a member of&#xa0;a&#xa0;forum called \"creepshots\" was handing out advice last week. His subject? How to photograph women surreptitiously. \"Don't be nervous,\" he wrote. \"If you are, you'll stand out. Don't hover too much, get your shot and move on if you can ... You'll look less like a creep if you have photos of things other than just hot chicks' asses.\"</p> <p>He offered this advice in the comment stream attached to a gallery of photos of women snapped unawares at airports. Those images joined hundreds posted by group members of women waiting for trains, packing groceries, standing on escalators; the camera homing in on their bottom, crotch or breasts. And they joined thousands more on creep websites as a whole, a large, thriving online subculture. The point is to catch women unawares, lay claim to something off-limits, then share it around for&#xa0;bragging rights and comment.</p> <p>Erin Gloria Ryan, a writer for popular women's website <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/\" title=\"\">Jezebel.com</a>, was alerted to the forum by concerned Reddit users who are trying to get it closed, partly because some of the pictures appear to have been taken in schools. The content on the creepshot forum isn't pornography, says Ryan, \"but it is using people's images in ways&#xa0;they definitely wouldn't want authorised\". For group members, she says, it seems to be precisely women's lack of consent \u2013 the violation of their privacy and agency \u2013 that is appealing.</p> <p>The issue of women's pictures being taken and shared without their consent has been in the spotlight for more than a&#xa0;week now because of the furore around topless images of the Duchess of&#xa0;Cambridge. I suspect the most arresting photograph of the scandal will actually prove to be the one&#xa0;that shows where the photographer was apparently standing. An 'x' marks a&#xa0;spot on a public road, so far from the chateau where the couple were staying that you can barely make out the building itself. The perspective makes any argument against the right to privacy seem laughable, yet&#xa0;they continue. The editor-in-chief of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/19/kate-topless-photos-swedish-magazine?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Denmark's Se og H\u00f8r magazine, which published a 16-page supplement of the photos</a>, has implied Kate must&#xa0;accept some responsibility for \"willingly revealing her breasts towards a public road\".</p> <p>The story prompts questions about why there is such a market, and therefore audience, for these pictures. As others have pointed out, it is not as though there is any dearth of bare breasts, consensually exposed and shared, on the internet. The answer involves a familiar combination of desire and humiliation. There is an interest in seeing not just any breasts, but all breasts, a sense that female bodies are public property, fair game \u2013 to be claimed, admired and mocked.</p> <p>Paparazzi culture has been a problem for decades, but it has taken on an especially sinister, sexualised hue in recent years. In 2008, for instance, a photo agency announced that Britney Spears definitely wasn't pregnant \u2013 by posting pictures of her in period-stained knickers. Emma Watson has said that on&#xa0;her 18th birthday she realised that \"overnight I'd become fair game ... One photographer lay down on the floor to get a shot up my skirt. The night it was legal for them to do it, they did it. I woke up the next day and felt completely violated.\" At the Leveson inquiry, towards the end of 2011, Sienna Miller said that for years she was \"relentlessly pursued by 10 to 15 men, almost daily ... spat at, verbally abused ... I would often find myself, at the age of 21, at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with 10 men chasing me\".</p> <p>While we associate this experience specifically with celebrities, we arguably all live in a paparazzi culture now. Cameras are ubiquitous, as is the technology to share and publicise pictures instantly. The throb of surveillance plays out in different ways. On the more benign side are the mild nerves many people feel when an email pops up to tell them they have been tagged in a Facebook photo, an image that could be from any moment in their life \u2013 recent or historical \u2013 now public, and open for comments.</p> <p>But it also plays out in more insidious ways. This includes the creepshot websites, and others where people collect images of ordinary women they have culled from around the internet. Julia Gray, co-founder of anti-street harassment group <a href=\"http://ldn.ihollaback.org/\" title=\"\">Hollaback London</a>, says she was horrified when a picture of her ended up in one of these groups, an image of her at her best friend's birthday party. \"We were really drunk, I fell over, and my friend took a picture that happened to capture my boobs down my shirt.\" When she saw it in her friend's Flickr album online, she was completely relaxed about it; in that setting it was just an innocent, funny image. But then it was appropriated, \"and in the context of all the other pictures \u2013 upskirt shots and down-top shots \u2013 it became incredibly creepy. All of a sudden it was this weird, voyeuristic thing, and I felt really preyed upon.\"</p> <p>Then there is the evidence that young women are being coerced into taking suggestive pictures by their male peers, badgered in a way that is distinctly paparazzi-like. Teenagers today have grown up in an environment filled with both paparazzi pictures and images of ordinary women with their tops off. We live in the land built by gossip and lads' magazines over the past decade. Heat magazine ran its Circle of Shame feature for years, encouraging young women to look at their female peers, deride them for ugliness, and simultaneously police their own appearance. Nuts magazine went into nightclubs and asked women to flash for them. Zoo magazine asked readers, \"What kind of tits do you want&#xa0;for YOUR girlfriend?\" in a 2005 competition that offered \u00a34,000 worth of&#xa0;surgery in return for pictures of readers' girlfriend's breasts.</p> <p>This has been the formative environment for today's teenagers, and in <a href=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforprofessionals/sexualabuse/sexting-research-report_wdf89269.pdf\" title=\"\">a small-scale but fascinating NSPCC study published this year, researchers spoke to 35 students at two London schools</a>, and found \"peer surveillance and recording was normalised to the extent that many young people felt they had few friends they really 'trusted'\".</p> <p>A girl in her second year at secondary school whom the researchers spoke to reported that the demand \"Can I have a&#xa0;picture of your tits?\" occurred daily. If boys managed to get these photos, they immediately became a form of currency for them, and potential humiliation for the girls. Male interviewees spoke about posting these pictures to \"exposure sites\" on Facebook, profiles set up especially for this purpose.</p> <p>Allyson Pereira, an anti-bullying advocate from New Jersey, has had that experience first-hand. Now in her 20s, she was 16 when her ex-boyfriend \u2013 the first boy she had dated \u2013 said he would get back together with her if she sent him a topless picture. She did, and he immediately \"sent it to everybody in his contact list,\" she says, \"and it just went viral\". She found out when everyone started laughing at her, and calling her a&#xa0;whore. Her mother initially said they would have to move, former friends called her disgusting and teachers made jokes about it. Six months later, Pereira felt so lonely that she attempted suicide. Having planned to become a&#xa0;teacher herself, she abandoned the ambition, because: \"I would have had to explain to every single [employer] about my past, because you never know when a picture like that is going to resurface.\" She didn't go to university, because she felt too vulnerable. The photo is still out there, she's sure, and although her anti-bullying work gives her pride, feels her life will always be tainted. \"I don't like public places,\" she says, \"I'm still bullied sometimes now if I go out. I have people who call me a whore.\"</p> <p>In recent years a genre of websites dedicated to sharing humiliating pictures of women \u2013 and occasionally men \u2013 has cropped up, known as \"revenge porn\" sites. The idea&#xa0;is that vengeful people can post humiliating, sexual pictures of former partners, photos often clearly intended for personal use only, if they were taken with consent at all.</p> <p>Charlotte Laws first encountered these sites in January this year, after her daughter Kayla, who is in her mid-20s, had her computer hacked. In Kayla's email account was one topless photo she had taken of herself \u2013 it hadn't been shared with anyone \u2013 which was then posted on a notorious revenge porn site, Is Anyone Up. She was distraught, and Charlotte, an author and former private investigator, spent 11 days, non-stop, working to get the picture taken down. One of the nastiest aspects of the site, which has since closed, was that humiliating photographs would be posted alongside details of the person's social media accounts, so they were immediately identifiable.</p> <p>Laws wanted to find out more about the experiences of those whose images ended up on the site, so began an informal study. She called 40 people \u2013 a&#xa0;few men, but mainly women, reflecting the site's make-up \u2013 and says that 40% had had accounts hacked, while others were victims of vengeful exes. She spoke to three teachers, one of&#xa0;whom had lost her job due to the site, and another whose job hung in the balance. One woman was terrified the photos would be used against her in a&#xa0;custody battle. Another had seen her business ruined \u2013 even though the nude&#xa0;images the site ran alongside her social media profiles weren't actually of&#xa0;her. There was a woman who had taken pictures for her doctor, of her breasts bandaged after surgery, and those had been hacked from her computer and posted. All the pictures were open to biting discussion of looks and desirability.</p> <p>Laws has been researching possible legal routes for victims of such sites, which has brought her into contact with Mary Anne Franks, associate professor of law at the University of Miami. \"What&#xa0;unites creepshots, the Middleton photographs, the revenge porn websites,\" says Franks, \"is that they all&#xa0;feature the same fetishisation of non-consensual sexual activity with women who either you don't have any access to, or have been denied future access to. And it's really this product of rage and entitlement.\"</p> <p>Franks finds it interesting that the response to these situations is so often to blame the woman involved. Ali Sargent, a 19-year-old student and activist, says in her school years there were a few incidents of girls being filmed in sexual situations, without their knowledge or consent, and the attitude of other girls was dismissive at&#xa0;best \u2013 displaying that dearth of sympathy that distances people from the thought that it could ever happen to them. \"It was mostly just, 'well, she was pretty stupid,'\" says Sargent.</p> <p>Franks echoes this. She says the argument goes: \"'You shouldn't have given those pictures to that person', or 'You shouldn't have been sunbathing in a private residence', or 'You should never, as a woman, take off your clothes in any context where anybody could possibly ever have a camera'. That's been shocking to me, that people aren't just outraged and furious about this, but they're actually making excuses for this behaviour, and blaming women for ever being sexual any time, at all.</p> <p>\"Even in a completely private setting, within a marriage \u2013 it couldn't be any more innocuous than the Middleton situation \u2013 and yet people are still saying things like: what was she expecting, she's famous and she's got breasts, and therefore she's got to keep them covered up all the time. I do think it's a rage against women being sexual on their own terms. We're perfectly fine with women being sexual, as long as they are objects and they're passive, and we can turn them on, turn them off, download them, delete them, whatever it is. But as&#xa0;soon as it's women who want to have&#xa0;any kind of exclusionary rights about their intimacy, we hate that. We say, 'No, we're going to make a whore out of you'.\"</p>",
  "<p>JK Rowling's first novel for adults, The Casual Vacancy, draws on her own experience of living on the margins of society and satirises a political landscape in which the poor are regularly cast \"as this homogeneous mash, like porridge\", according to a rare interview in the Guardian's Weekend magazine.</p> <p>Rowling, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/20/labourconference.jkrowling\" title=\"\">donated \u00a31m to the Labour party in 2008</a> and has <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-billionaires-who-do-pay-their-bills-including-james-dyson-and-jk-rowling-7873607.html?afid=af\" title=\"\">previously spoken of her indebtedness to the welfare state</a>, began writing The Casual Vacancy five years ago under the last Labour government but believes the novel has \"become maybe more relevant as I've written\".</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian's Decca Aikenhead, she described what she saw as \"a horribly familiar change of atmosphere\" since the 2010 election. \"It feels to me a lot like it did in the early 90s, where there's been a bit of redistribution of benefits and suddenly lone-parent families are that little bit worse off,\" she said. \"But it's not a 'little bit' when you're in that situation. Even a tenner a week can make such a vast, vast difference.\"</p> <p>The idea for the novel, her first since the 2007 publication of the final volume in the Harry Potter series that made her a global household name and the world's first author to become a billionaire solely through her writing, came to her on an aeroplane. \"I thought: local election! And I just knew. I had that totally physical response you get to an idea that you know will work. It's a rush of adrenaline, it's chemical. I had it with Harry Potter and I had it with this.\"</p> <p>Set in the fictional West Country village of Pagford, which bears a passing resemblance to Rowling's own childhood home in the Forest of Dean, and telling the story of a parish election triggered by the death of councillor Barry Fairbrother, The Casual Vacancy investigates the agendas and infighting that fuel local politics, and the class divisions that rive even the most picturesque English communities.</p> <p>The election ultimately turns on the fate of Pagford's grotty council estate, the Fields, embodied in The Casual Vacancy by the wretched, wrung-out Weedon family: mother Terri, struggling to kick her drug addiction, three-year-old son Robbie, under threat of social care, and teenage daughter Krystal.</p> <p>\"So many people, certainly people who sit around the cabinet table, say: 'Well, it worked for me' or 'This is how my father managed it',\" Rowling said. \"The idea that other people might have had such a different life experience that their choices and beliefs and behaviours would be completely different \u2026 seems to escape a lot of otherwise intelligent people. The poor are discussed as this homogeneous mash, like porridge \u2026 They talk about feckless teenage mothers looking for a council flat. Well, how tragic is it that that's what someone regards as the height of security or safety?\"</p> <p>Rowling's own experience of poverty \u2013 writing the first Harry Potter novel in Edinburgh cafes while she and her daughter survived on state benefits \u2013 and her emergence from it are now the stuff of literary legend.</p> <p>The stratospheric success of the Harry Potter franchise has placed her in the enviable position of being able to do \"whatever the hell I like\", she said. \"I am the freest author in the world. My bills are paid \u2013 we all know I can pay my bills \u2013 I was under contract to no one, and the feeling of having all of these characters in my head and knowing that no one else knew a damned thing about them was amazing \u2026 Pagford was mine, just mine, for five years. I wrote this novel as exactly what I wanted to write.\"</p> <p>While the financial imperative may be absent, expectations of the novel, which will go on sale at 8am this Thursday, are nevertheless running extremely high.</p> <p>The Casual Vacancy has featured on the Amazon.co.uk bestseller list since the announcement of publication \"on the strength of pre-orders alone\", according to a spokesman.</p> <p>Jon Howells of Waterstones, meanwhile, said of the bookseller's staff, who will take delivery of the closely guarded books on Wednesday, that \"everyone's very excited and curious\".</p> <p>Nobody, he said, was treating the book \"as if it were another Harry Potter\" but, \"that said, there is a little bit of that inherent craziness still there. It's an 8am embargo, and all our shops near as dammit will be open at 8am \u2013 they're usually open at 9am. I don't think it will match the first-day sales of a million-plus for the last Harry Potter, but we all expect it will be the biggest hardback novel of the year. There is competition out there, but this is JK Rowling.\"</p>",
  "<p>Friday night at Milan fashion week was taken over by Versace, who staged their mainline catwalk show for spring/summer 2013 and a party where singer Beth Ditto performed to celebrate the label's secondary line, Versus, which is co-designed by British star Christopher Kane. It was an evening that very much cemented the brand's reputation as the high-octane house of va-va voom.</p> <p>In recent seasons the label has been catapulted back into pole position as one of the industry's power names. This January, the house staged a triumphant return to the Paris haute couture schedule for the first time since 2004. Sales figures have also been on the increase since 2011 and the recent hit collaboration with high-street brand H&amp;M not only brought the iconic brand to a new and younger audience but also sparked off a revival for the famous baroque prints.</p> <p>This latest collection was brimming with flesh. Short, wispy gowns skimmed thighs and featured trademark criss-cross leather lace-up details. Sparkling fringed belts and chokers bounced and glittered. Tough-looking, long, leather gladiator boots with high heels stalked down the flashing disco catwalk.</p> <p>Masculine jackets cut longer in length were worn as cover ups. Some featured pretty lace panels and another was made in black leather; these had the sulky nonchalance of Kristen Stewart. Leather and lace was also used on shorts and mini-dresses while crushed-silk slip dresses were belted and appeared in tie-dye patterns or warm orange.</p> <p>It was a complete gear change from last season when the Versace woman had been transformed into a brooding autumnal creature wearing crucifixes, gothic makeup, severe blunt fringes and a Girl with the Dragon Tattoo attitude.</p> <p>To take her catwalk bow, the designer Dontella Versace emerged in a sharply tailored black suit with a single sparkling Medusa motif, gold button on the jacket and kick-flare trousers. \"I love your bangs,\" said influential fashion editor Carine Roitfeld backstage as wellwishers lined up to pass on congratulations to the designer.</p> <p>\"It was a tougher woman with the jackets but also for the first time I really wanted to show a more fragile side as well,\" Versace explained after the show. This idea she said was reflected in more fluid shapes. On the style of print, she said: \"This is a house of prints and we could do anything but I felt this organic feeling with the tie-dye.\" Asked what woman would wear these latest looks and where they might wear them, the designer simply purred like a rock star: \"Everywhere. All over the world.\"</p> <p>This week also saw the initial stages of a global roll-out of a Versace e-commerce website, which will sell all the main ranges, including fragrance, interiors and handbags. Products are shot on typically glitzy gold mannequins and there is a section called \"Donatella's hot picks\". The Versus collection will be added to the site later in the year.</p> <p>The presentation for the Versus brand saw a parade of 31 girls modelling as Ditto sang live. Once the girls finished on the catwalk, the front row got up and formed a mosh pit in front of Ditto, who was wearing a black dress with plastic black, white and orange chains trimming the hem, waist and neckline. Ditto then piled in with Donatella and the audience on the catwalk.</p> <p>This collection featured cartoon prints, from large dots to love hearts, and next season's hottest fashion motif \u2013 the daisy. Fabrics included a sporty techno stretch mesh alongside patent shiny leather, silks and transparent printed plastic.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I wanted to hire a motor home for one week during the school holidays and, searching the web, eventually found that MotorHolme still had a few available. The motor home, I was told, was in Matlock, some 120 miles from our house in Banbury. </strong></p> <p><strong>Not wishing to let our children down, I agreed to the hire. I was told the cost for the week was going to be \u00a3897 plus \u00a312.50 per day for insurance cover. This would be a total of \u00a3992, so we provided our credit card details. We then received an email, which had a&#xa0;link its to terms and conditions. At the time of booking the company deducted the basic hire charges for the motor home, of \u00a3897. However, it has since taken another \u00a3331 for an insurance surcharge that was not covered in our original conversation.</strong></p> <p><strong>Trying to get in contact with the firm has been very difficult. At the time of writing, we still have yet to go on holiday with the hired motor home. I did contact its owner, who sounded genuine and was happy to tell me that everything will be OK.</strong></p> <p><strong>In the meantime, I have blocked MotorHolme from taking anything more from our credit card. What do you know about this firm? </strong><em>DR,</em> <em>Banbury</em></p> <p>Sadly, we know too much about MotorHolme, as we have received a&#xa0;number of complaints about this company from unhappy customers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/09/motorholme-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"\">since we featured the firm in the column in March</a>. At that time, we reported on the case of TH of Sheffield, who complained the company was hiding its major insurance costs in terms and conditions that were only sent after the booking was made.</p> <p>DR has reported that the same thing happened to him, as have others. Readers complain that this is a difficult (and rather aggressive) company to deal with. It quotes a price and omits to point out its insurers then set their price dependent on the driver's record just before the rental begins. Company owner Andrew Hughes says his insurers demand it is done this way because there can often be a long time between a booking and the actual rental, and this risk has to reflect any points on licences.</p> <p>He disputed suggestions that his staff were unpleasant to deal with, saying they operate in the tough holiday bookings environment. He says the vast majority of the 21,000 hires pass off without incident, and that we only hear about the tiny number of unhappy customers.</p> <p>Since DR contacted us, he has taken the hire and described it as unsatisfactory. He said the motor home had several faults and was older than he thought it would be. Also, a refund Hughes promised as a goodwill gesture didn't materialise, though he said that if DR contacted the firm it would be paid. Ultimately, if we were looking to hire a motor home we would not be using this firm. If you are considering using the company we suggest you spend time on the net looking for feedback, and read its T&amp;Cs carefully before you hand over your card details.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<p>Head gardener Bo Stills has a lot on his mind. Slugs have been a problem this year, there are prize vegetables to be chosen for show and he's wondering if there's space for the soft fruits he wants to plant. Nothing unusual there, until you realise that Bo is eight and the garden he tends is on a&#xa0;school roof in Tower Hamlets.</p> <p>Bo and his fellow gardeners attend <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/100896\" title=\"\">Chisenhale primary school</a>, one of nearly 16,000 that have registered for the <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/schoolgardening/default.aspa\" title=\"\">RHS Campaign for School Gardening</a> which is celebrating its fifth anniversary this month.</p> <p>The benefits of school gardening range from improved behaviour to healthier eating habits, but the RHS had a more specific aim. \"The charity was worried about the loss of gardening skills,\" says Claire Custance, RHS strategic development manager, \"and we wanted to ensure these were transferred to the younger generation. What's more, most young people don't see gardening as a career to be proud of.\"</p> <p>The campaign offers gardening resources and teaching plans, which are free to access and show schools how a garden can be used as a teaching tool across all subjects. There is also an emphasis on skills, from experienced regional advisers running staff training sessions, to schools getting parents up to speed with <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/schoolgardening/teachershome/getyourgrown-upsgrowing/default.aspa\" title=\"\">Get Your Grown-ups Growing</a> events.</p> <p>Do you know what an <a href=\"http://www.permanentculturenow.com/african-keyhole-garden/\" title=\"\">African keyhole garden</a> is?

But, using containers, Chisenhale grows a&#xa0;huge range of crops, from carrots and spinach to wheat which they have made into bread. Pumpkins have been tricky, encroaching on to the playground, but despite resembling orange footballs, not one was damaged, which James puts down to the children's pride in their environment. As Lili, aged five, says: \"I like standing back after I&#xa0;have done a job and seeing how pretty the garden looks.\"</p> <p>The skills learned stretch beyond the classroom, with an after-school family gardening club proving so popular that the original one-hour activity regularly runs for three.</p> <p>The children use their garden in literacy, maths, science and geography.

  "<p>In a hotel beside a Norwegian fjord, encircled by snow-streaked mountains, the novelist and playwright <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuruddin_Farah\" title=\"\">Nuruddin Farah</a> has his mind on warmer waters.\"Are they pirates?\" he says of the Somalis who hold ships hostage off the Horn of Africa, where he was born. \"What they do has the characteristics of piracy. But that wasn't how it started.\" He fixes his eye on the Arctic trawlers in the harbour. \"The majority were fishermen who lost their livelihoods to Korean and Japanese and European fishing vessels, fishing illegally in Somali waters. I'm not condoning the things they're doing. But there are unanswered questions. Someone is not telling us the truth.\"</p> <p>Over 45 years, Farah has pursued complex, elusive truths as one of Africa's greatest novelists, and a cosmopolitan voice in English-language fiction. He was driven into exile by the Somali dictator <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-mohamed-said-barre-1566452.html\" title=\"\">Mohamed Siad Barre</a>, who ruled from 1969 to 1991, and he now lives in Cape Town. But all 11 of his novels (translated into 20 languages) are set in Somali-speaking lands, one impulse being to \"keep my country alive by writing about it\". When I first met him in London in the 1980s, he was with Salman Rushdie at a Royal Court play, and his became a staunch Muslim voice against the fatwa. Rushdie writes in his new memoir of seeking his friend's advice on how to depict a country lost to him: \"'I keep it here,' Nuruddin said, pointing to his heart.\"</p> <p>For Nadine Gordimer, Farah is one of the continent's \"real interpreters\". Aged 66, he has lived in 10 African countries and is often cited by other African writers as overdue for the Nobel. His novels scourge received opinion \u2013 whether of female inferiority (he writes women characters who make their own destinies), religious dogma, nationalism (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Maps-Nuruddin-Farah/dp/0140296433\" title=\"\"><em>Maps</em></a>), foreign aid (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=gifts+nuruddin+farah&amp;tag=googhydr-21&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=9682614392&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=1145084661748327081&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;ref=pd_sl_18e0wod9c8_e\" title=\"\"><em>Gifts</em></a>) or clannism (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Secrets-Nuruddin-Farah/dp/0140280456/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347633498&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\"><em>Secrets</em></a>). They trace the history of a region long an arena for proxy wars and great power rivalries, in an oblique, metaphorical style that marries proverbial wisdom (\"a dead man's shoes are more useful than he is\") with daily life in a modern African state awash with sim cards and AK47s.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/crossbones-by-nuruddin-farah-book-review.html\" title=\"\"><em>Crossbones</em></a> is the final volume of a trilogy, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/82898-past-imperfect\" title=\"\">Past Imperfect</a>, set in the civil war that erupted when Siad Barre was ousted. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/16/featuresreviews.guardianreview9\" title=\"\"><em>Links</em></a> (2004) a Dante scholar returns to the seaside capital Mogadishu to find StrongmanNorth and StrongmanSouth battling with US Marines in the infernal, Italianate ruins. In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/deBellaigue.t.html\" title=\"\"><em>Knots</em></a> (2007) a Canadian-Somali actress arrives as the warlords have been vanquished by bearded men in white robes, foisting \"body tents\" on women. By <em>Crossbones</em>, the ascendant Islamists \u2013 whom Farah terms \"religionists\" \u2013 are spoiling for war with Ethiopia, while piracy proliferates off the breakaway coastal region of Puntland.</p> <p>I spoke to Farah as a peace process was under way in Somalia that culminated in the inauguration last Sunday of the country's first elected president in decades. The author was in Troms\u00f8, a tranquil town of clapboard houses and silver birch trees 360km north of the Arctic Circle,&#xa0;to address global Ibsen experts. He was already \"pregnant\" with his first published novel, <em>From a Crooked Rib</em> (1970), when he read Ibsen's plays as a student of philosophy&#xa0;and literature in India. The novel-in-progress was the tale of a fight&#xa0;for selfhood in a world where women are \"sold like cattle\", told through the eyes of a 19-year-old nomadic woman. \"I could&#xa0;not have written <em>From a Crooked&#xa0;Rib </em>if I had not read <em>A Doll's House</em>,\" he said at Troms\u00f8&#xa0;University. Growing up in Somalia and Ethiopia, and studying in India, he tells me, \"I saw, on a daily basis, women beaten, girls not sent to school, and the injustices meted out to women. But at 19 or 20&#xa0;I&#xa0;lacked&#xa0;the&#xa0;courage to articulate it.\" The gulf between Ibsen's Nora and his unlettered pastoralist clarified his task: \"For Ebla, even in a metaphorical&#xa0;sense, there was no door to slam.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/crooked-Rib-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141187174\" title=\"\"><em>From a Crooked Rib</em> became a Penguin Modern Classic in 2004</a>. At a time when fiction in Africa was more focused on colonial power and emerging nationhood, Farah scrutinised the intimate power play between men and women. The novel was subversive in other ways. Some women berated Farah for trespassing on their realm for exposing the horror of female genital mutilation practised among Somalis (a&#xa0;practice banned last month under Somalia's new constitution).</p> <p>His second trilogy was conceived when he returned to Somalia in 1996, for the first time in 22 years, and was taken hostage by a minor warlord. In Kismayo, \"I was kept incommunicado for a few days. The warlord sent a technical [vehicle] with 16 gunmen; he'd been told wrongly that I was a journalist, and wanted me to write an article praising him.\" The warlord's sister-in-law pleaded for Farah's release: he had been her school teacher in the early 70s. Reconsidering, his captors demanded that he deliver lectures. He complied, since there was nowhere to escape to. He shrugs at the absurdity: \"I was held hostage and gave lectures to the community.\"</p> <p>Later in Mogadishu, he was \"shocked by the destruction. It was a country I didn't recognise, and many of the people in it were newcomers.\" Since the 10th century, he argues, Mogadishu had been a cosmopolitan city-state, but with the civil war, \"it lost its old inhabitants \u2013 some of Persian, Arab and Indian origin who had intermarried. Its character changed.\" In an essay, \"Of Tamarinds and Cosmopolitans\", Farah wrote of a clash not of clans, but between pastoralist nomads and urbanites, in a once \"open city with no walls\". But he was moved by his welcome as one of Somalia's most famous sons (a celebrity matched only recently by the British Olympian Mo Farah): \"People touched me and said, Nuruddin is back, life is here. Others will come.\"</p> <p>Born in 1945 in Baidoa, in Italian Somaliland, Farah went to school in Ogaden (ceded by the British to Ethiopia) and Mogadishu. His father was an interpreter for the British governor, and his mother an oral poet. He used English textbooks, took Qur'anic lessons, and spoke Amharic, Arabic and Italian too. He claims an American typewriter had much to do with his choice of literary language. But his efforts to write in Somali, once it gained a written script in 1972, were curtailed by censorship. All his novels were later banned, and read only in smuggled copies.</p> <p>His first wife was a student from Bangalore whom he met while studying in Punjab (\"her father and I played chess\"), and their son is now an auditor in Detroit with two small daughters. Leaving Somalia in 1974 to do a master's degree in theatre at Essex University, Farah worked at London's Royal Court (\"making tea\"). When his second novel, <em>A Naked Needle</em> (1976), riled Somalia's despot, his brother advised him not to return. He was sentenced to death in absentia. \"The country died inside me, and I carried it, for a long time, like a woman with a dead baby,\" he says. \"It became the neurosis from which I write.\"</p> <p>After a trip that took in the Soviet Union, Greece under the colonels and Sadat's Egypt, he wrote his first trilogy, Variations on the Theme of an African Dictatorship (1979-83), consisting of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sweet-Variations-Theme-African-Dictatorship/dp/1555971598\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet and Sour Milk</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sardines-Variations-Theme-African-Dictatorship/dp/155597161X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347634030&amp;sr=8-2\" title=\"\"><em>Sardines</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Close-Sesame-Variations-African-Dictatorship/dp/1555971628\" title=\"\"><em>Close Sesame</em></a>. He once challenged fellow Somalis to \"study the structure of the Somali family and you will find mini-dictators imposing their will \u2026 We become replicas of the tyrant whom we hate. When you rid yourself of a monster, you become a monster.\" Somalia's implosion, which he predicted as early as 1988, fuelled a personal crisis. His mother died in 1990, when it was still unsafe to return. He got married for a second time, to a British-Nigerian academic, and moved to northern Nigeria, then South Africa.</p> <p>In his talk in Norway, he described being in a \"very difficult marriage, much worse and more debilitating than Nora's, even though I stayed in it ... maybe because I was in mourning\". As he sees it now, the collapse of Somalia \"necessitated the creation of a foundation. I was afloat, and needed an anchor. Marrying became an anchor \u2013 which was probably wrong.\" When the couple eventually split, and his children were taken to California, \"it reminded me of when I couldn't see my [elder] son.\" At that time, \"I couldn't go back; I was being hunted down. Two attempts at killing me were made, in Nigeria and Rome.\"</p> <p>As his second marriage foundered, \"writing became hard; living a lot harder.\" It took a dozen years to complete his second trilogy, <a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/blood_in_the_sun.html\" title=\"\"><em>Blood in the Sun</em></a> (1986-98), begun with <em>Maps</em>, set during the 1970s Ogaden war, and <em>Gifts</em>, at a time of famine. <em>Secrets</em> unfolds on the eve of civil war, and he deems it a pessimistic book. \"I was pretending to be happy, but wasn't. It's a novel that predicts terrible days.\" As a nation ruptures along bloodlines, the novel evoked incest and bestiality, \"to make everyone sit up and see the ugliness of what was happening. The entire country was a death camp\".</p> <p>Farah met his father for the first time in 17 years in a hospital in Mombasa, Kenya, and was told: \"We fled because we met the beasts in us, face to face.\" Farah's son and younger sister also fled by boat. In the non-fiction <em>Yesterday, Tomorrow</em> (2000), based on conversations with Somali refugees, Farah extrapolates from his own exile the anguish of people without means, education or a writer's creativity, when their country ceases to exist. The voices are \"raw, tearful, pained\". The book was spurred by \"two types of Somali: the poor in refugee camps in Kenya; and the rich, corrupt sons and daughters of the dictator and his cronies, staying at the Hilton in Nairobi&#xa0;and flying in private jets. I was interested in where the future of Somalia lay.\"</p> <p>He has been back often since 1996, and played peace- broker between armed groups in an effort curtailed by the Ethiopian invasion of 2006. Somalia, he says, is \"full of stories. We say, 'one sick person; a hundred doctors'. Somalia is a sick country and&#xa0;everyone has an opinion. Mine is&#xa0;one version; in a civil war, there are&#xa0;millions.\" In <em>Links</em> he wanted to offer an alternative angle on the US intervention of 1993 to the film <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. The trilogy was conceived, he says, in the context of \"misunderstandings, misconceptions and missing the point\", chief among those being that the conflict is clan warfare. Farah does not see himself as belonging to a clan. \"Anyone who claims to represent a clan is a dastardly liar. You can represent people who elected you. I can't represent my own brother.\"</p> <p><em>Crossbones</em> also casts doubt on reports of boom towns rich on piracy. Farah visited Puntland, and says: \"I did not see that wealth.\" The novel suggests those up the food chain, and abroad, take their cut. \"Nobody wants to talk about illegal fishing or the destruction of the environment \u2013 the marine life and coral reefs. What we talk about is the consequences of this destruction. There's enough UN information about nuclear and chemical waste dumped on the shores of Somalia \u2013 the tsunami unearthed it. Entire communities in Puntland have children born with deformities.\"</p> <p><em>Crossbones</em> takes place against the rise of al-Shabaab, the military wing of the Union of Islamic Courts, which has claimed allegiance to al-Qaida. Farah, who is a professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, says susceptible teenagers were \"told they were fighting an enemy: infidels, unbelievers, Ethiopians, the federal government.\" The militant leaders are hypocrites, he adds, who \"leave their own sons and daughters in school, and recruit other people's.\" Taxliil in the novel, a troubled teenager briefly inducted by the militants, has no exit but via Guant\u00e1namo. Farah is indignant that \"he is going to prison. He's been misled by people who don't go to prison, but their names are known.\"</p> <p>Al-Shabaab's withdrawal from Mogadishu in August last year heralded&#xa0;the city's rebirth, with the return of many expatriates. Rather than having been routed by peacekeepers, Farah says, \"Shabaab's beastly attitudes alienated people, with stories of women raped and pregnant, whipped, killed. People were afraid; now no longer. More understand that Shabaab has nothing to do with religion; it's interested in political power.\" He was once attacked online for insisting the \"Afghan-type body tent is not culturally Somali. I said: 'My mother never wore a veil, nor my sisters.' They said my mother was not a Muslim.\" In the diaspora, he argues, \"the majority could not articulate their Somali culture. The less you know about Islam, the more conservative people become.\"</p> <p>When the National Theatre in Mogadishu was devastated by a suicide bomb last April, only two weeks after reopening, Farah's response was to write a short play in Somali, though its staging may take time. Three more of his recent plays are being translated into Somali. As Jean Anouilh set Sophocles in Nazi-occupied Paris, Farah's <em>Antigone in Somalia</em> is set during the Ethiopian occupation of Mogadishu of 2006-09. Antigone's brother, whose corpse cannot be buried, is a suicide bomber. In areas al-Shabaab controls, says Farah, they have \"forbidden song and dance because they're closer to Wahhabism than most Somalis\". Theatre that is verse-based, and sung to music, \"challenges everything such groups represent. They say it's evil, Satan's work, and that a woman's place is not on the stage.\" Yet visiting Mogadishu in the spring, he found people \"playing&#xa0;music and singing in tea houses and at parties. Women have created their own space.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/somalia-president-power-assassination-attempt\" title=\"\">Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud</a>, elected by MPs, took power last week, four days after surviving a suicide bombing for which al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Though Farah has reservations about \"electing MPs and president on a clan-based formula\", he believes there is no present alternative, given years of war. The president, whom he has met, \"struck me as trustworthy, a man capable of uniting the country and taking it forward, away from attrition and in-fighting.\"</p> <p>Though his protagonists strive to leave their homeland better than they found it, good intentions go awry. Farah notes a pessimistic turn in his fiction, \"and the reason is, Somalia is no longer what it was. No matter how the characters struggle, how can you reconstruct a country that's self-destructing continuously?\" Then, under a blazing Arctic summer sun that refuses to set over the harbour, he rallies: \"I'd like the dust to settle first. It will take five more years of peace. Then good things will come.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"P<em>atagonia sin represas!</em>\" screamed the hoarding on the roadside \u2013 Patagonia without dams. If the sign spoiled the view, it was nothing to what might befall the beautiful landscape we were passing through if the Chilean government goes ahead with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/apr/05/chilean-court-patagonia-dam\" title=\"\">plans \u2013 on hold since June \u2013 to flood 6,000 hectares of pristine wilderness to provide electricity</a> to power the rapidly growing economy.</p> <p>For four days my girlfriend and I had been driving along the Carretera Austral, Chile's great 1,250km southern highway, penetrating deep into the remote province of Ais\u00e9n. We'd flown into drizzly Balmaceda airport and headed south-west. The road surface deteriorated but the weather improved and we found ourselves all alone in our hired pick-up in a wonderland of glaciated valleys, temperate rainforest and back-of-beyond hamlets. In the distance loomed the serrated wall of the Andes, topped with snow.</p> <p>Stays in a budget hostel and then a smart riverside lodge had taken us close to three of Ais\u00e9n's postcard sights. The first was Lago General Carrera, South America's second-biggest lake, whose unnatural-looking Persian green water, unbroken by flecks of white or even ripples, was both alluring and alienating.</p> <p>A side road took us past seven more lakes \u2013 we walked around one to shake off the creases you get on long car journeys \u2013 and, after a couple of hours' driving through antediluvian montane forests, to the Exploradores glacier. Hanging off the north-eastern face of Monte San Valent\u00edn, the highest mountain in Chilean Patagonia, the great blue-white tongue \u2013 and the wispy lenticular clouds \u2013 reminded me that the northern Patagonian ice field was just around the corner.</p> <p>The smart lodge was on fast-flowing Baker river, revered by anglers, feared by rafters, east of the ice field. I drove up to its source at nearby Puerto Bertrand and saw a deep lake basically being siphoned into a very narrow, shallow watercourse. Downriver from the lodge the Baker, also surreally green, tumbled over high cliffs and, in a maelstrom of grey glacier melt and freezing river, merged with the Nef to continue south to the Pacific.</p> <p>We were heading in the same direction, with superlative vistas piling up one after the other. Hacienda Tres Lagos sits beside its own deep green (and alarmingly cold) lake at the bottom of a mountain \u2013 but was equipped with a barbecue shack, where we feasted on grilled lamb, and a wine bar where we sampled the latest Patagonian varietals.</p> <p>But it was only when we turned left at Entrada Baker that the view was genuinely surprising \u2013 shocking even. The Patagonia we had seen so far had fitted all my notions of Chile: the Baker valley, like the country, was narrow, hemmed in by geology, packed with coig\u00fce, \u00f1irre and lenga beech trees, riven by cascades and streams.</p> <p>But the Chacabuco valley east of Entrada Baker was wide open to the sky, with bright golden steppe carpeting an immense plain. Guanacos (small Patagonian relatives of the llama) grazed and rolled in the dust, hawks circled overhead and strange wind-resistant plants exploded out of the arid earth. We were travelling into a region where the deserts of Argentinian Patagonia reach for the Pacific, adding another ecosystem to Ais\u00e9n's already varied landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396582129\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/20/1348133678582/Lago-G-Carrera-001.jpg\" alt=\"Lago G Carrera\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking across Lago General Carerra to the Andes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Moss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After driving for half an hour along a winding back road we came to the lodge built by philanthropist Kris Tompkins for her latest park project. Kris, former CEO of outdoor clothing firm Patagonia, and her husband, Doug (of the North Face and Esprit chain) are well-known in Argentina and Chile for purchasing swathes of virgin forest and wetland and donating them to the respective states as national parks.</p> <p>The Parque Nacional Patagonia (<a href=\"http://www.patagonialandtrust.org/\" title=\"\">patagonialandtrust.org</a>) is the latest and perhaps most exciting of all their projects. Once an estancia overgrazed by sheep and cattle, these 70,000 hectares will bridge the gap between two existing reserves to create a national park three times that size.</p> <p>We stayed just one night at the park's Yellowstone-style lodge, but I found time to chat to the staff and to head out into the hills. The park can be seen as a sort of symbolic counter-gesture to the plans to dam the Baker.</p> <p>\"The proposed dam is old technology,\" Doug told me. \"The only viable industry for Ais\u00e9n is tourism, and if we bring in 250,000 visitors eventually it can be another Torres del Paine. Fisheries won't work here, food won't, logging won't and farming didn't. We're putting backpackers first here. The lodge is here only to subsidise the campsites.\"</p> <p>For almost five centuries, Ais\u00e9n has remained the least visited, least settled corner of Patagonia and maybe of southern South America. Its preservation may now depend on attracting as many low-impact visitors as possible. The self-indulgent traveller in me would like to keep the road lonely and romantic; but if a few rented pick-ups and a campsite are the alternative to caravans of dumper trucks and cranes and a flooded valley, bring them on.

  "<p>Certain habits in Indian life once gave an illusion of permanence. On hot afternoons 30 years ago, for example, you could lie on your bed under a slow-turning fan and hear noises from the street that had been the same for at least a century. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057935/\" title=\"\">The lonely wife in Satyajit Ray's film Charulata</a> heard them in the film's celebrated opening sequence as she flitted about her Victorian mansion in 1870's Calcutta like a trapped butterfly, and in 1982 you could hear them still: some rhythmic chanting, the hollow patter of a little drum. And if, like Charulata, you went to the window and looked down, there in the dusty lane you would see a gang of coolies shouting something like a work-song as they pushed a wooden-wheeled cart with a heavy load, or a street entertainer drumming up business with his tabla. The most common sounds, however, were the singsong calls of peddlers selling fish or vegetables, or milky sweets and ancient biscuits from a&#xa0;portable glass case. Some salesmen rode bicycles; that transport apart, these were scenes that looked as if they had existed for centuries and would never be expunged by modernity.</p> <p>Their extinction is coming \u2013 not immediately and not everywhere, but probably inexorably in the middle-class districts of the big Indian cities, now India's governing coalition has said it will open up the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/india-supermarket-chains\" title=\"\">retail market to foreign supermarket</a> chains. The coalition put the plan on hold last year after some of its smaller parties, notably West Bengal's Trinamool Congress, branded it as against the interests of \"the common man\". The postponement suggested a weak and muddled government. Economic growth was faltering, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, looked particularly ineffectual, and the administration's reputation suffered the lash of critics at home and abroad (not least in the USA). Last week it decided to face down opponents and show its free-market muscles by reviving planned reforms that will allow familiar European and American names \u2013 Walmart, Tesco, Carrefour \u2014 to build stores in cities of more than a million people, providing the local state government agrees.</p> <p>Western supermarkets arrived in China several years ago and there is now hardly a country in the world without them. India's resistance came out of what Louise Tillen, an academic at the India Institute in King's College London, describes as a \"compound of opportunism and ideology\" in a democracy that tolerates dissent and political fixes, but that resistance looks to have collapsed. The government says the marketing, technical and managerial expertise of the big supermarkets will transform food production and consumption by cutting out middlemen and building the system known as \"the cold chain\" that delivers fresh food swiftly from the field to the shelves. The farmer gets higher prices, the consumer pays lower ones and less food is wasted: the supermarkets hire staff in their thousands, no food rots in the warehouses.</p> <p>Perfection! Unless you are a middleman, or one of India's 12 million small retailers, or a peasant farmer with a crop yield too insignificant to interest Walmart, or a street vegetable peddler. The process is known as \"retail Darwinism\". In Vietnam, to quote a recent survey, a&#xa0;supermarket needs 1.2 people to sell a tonne of tomatoes rather than 2.9 people for every tonne in more traditional distribution channels. In several large Indian cities, fruit and vegetable sellers have already seen their incomes cut by up to 30% since the advent of smaller Indian-owned supermarkets; the powerful giants from abroad could bring&#xa0;far larger changes.</p> <p>How does India's cultural elite \u2013 with apologies for that clumsy phrase \u2013 feel about this revolution? To judge from my friends there, some feel anxious, hopeless and sentimental: emotions familiar to the supermarket's enemies everywhere. One of them writes from Delhi that the vendors who come to her door selling vegetables, milk, flowers and fish are \"one of life's greatest pleasures\".</p> <p>They do their rounds on environmentally sound bikes, while supermarket shopping needs cars and car parks. \"We fear all this will go,\" she writes of the old pattern of vendors and neighbourhood shops and bazaars, adding that in India's hierarchical society to shop at a supermarket has an exclusive appeal, a generalised version of the Waitrose cachet, because until now they have specialised in prepared rather than fresh food and have prices (and security guards) to keep out the poor. \"In my view,\" she says, \"they are urban, classist, expensive, sell packaged stuff and restrict the right of entry. It could hardly be worse.\"</p> <p>Or, of course, better \u2013 if you are a time-poor but cash-rich consumer and want to feed easily from the global cornucopia that you feel India has kept at bay out of the state's fear of upsetting the small-farmer and small-trader vote, and its residual antagonism towards foreign corporations that goes back to its foundation.</p> <p>Shopping in India's pre-cornucopian times could be taxing. Say you lived in Kolkata with a generous family and wanted to treat them, to partly compensate for all the treats they had given you. This was my case. The family were my then in-laws, and sometimes for Sunday lunch, as a break from fish, rice and dal, I'd prepare a bastardised waldorf salad.</p> <p>The city's old covered market sold most, though not all, the ingredients. I would take a taxi to the market, where a porter carrying a straw basket on his head would attach himself to me as a guide and adviser. His basket would fill with apples from Himachal, limes from Bihar, walnuts from Kabul and cheese from Kalimpong. The really difficult item was the olive oil for the dressing, which could never be found in the market but sometimes at the Great Eastern Stores, a dark and usually empty shop whose trade had foundered when the last of Kolkata's once-large British population decamped in the 1960s, leaving its assistants with memories of tinned prunes, Worcester sauce and other delicacies whose supply lines had dried up.</p> <p>All this would take a morning. It made an interesting quest for someone like me with an outsider's curiosity and time on their hands. Few Kolkatans, unless they were rich in domestic servants, would have gone to such trouble to prepare something so foreign. The lunch felt like a triumph, and yet Kolkata was one of the world's largest cities, a metropolis by its own account, and had once been the capital of the Raj.</p> <p>Then, under the fan, we would nap. Sounds from the streets drifted indoors: snatches of Hindi film music, the slap of wet clothes on a laundry slab, a taxi honking, the calls of itinerant food vendors. A whole world waiting, though we didn't know it, for luxury and variety to arrive in the form of the shopping mall, Walmart and Tesco.</p>",
  "<p>By the work of fate and the fixtures software, Manchester United visit Liverpool on Sunday, the first Anfield match since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-police-coverup-revealed\" title=\"\">the Hillsborough Independent Panel conclusively vindicated</a> the bereaved families' 23-year struggle for the truth about the disaster to be accepted. There are some worries, claiming far too much attention, about whether everybody among the 45,000 people in attendance will find it in their moral souls to respect the memories of 96 fellow football supporters who died in the grotesque negligence of Hillsborough in 1989. But football, so great a spectacle, has always been good at its grand moments of reconciliation.</p> <p>On Sunday the two captains, Steven Gerrard and Nemanja Vidic, will walk together and release 96 balloons, to float into the Liverpool sky in remembrance of those supporters, all loved and mostly young, whose deaths make up that still unthinkably large number. Surely in this context Luis Su\u00e1rez will then shake Patrice Evra's hand as required and finally end the hostilities between them.</p> <p>The minute's silence, the black armband, the laying of a wreath: football has refined its ritual remembering of the disasters that pockmark its rise to local and global pre-eminence. For the most part, as with the minute's silence held by the modern-day, different Sheffield Wednesday this week before their Championship match with Huddersfield Town, all supporters in the crowd do observe the moment. But then the whistle blows, and the game hurtles on.</p> <p>Too often the deeper challenges posed by the tragic event being remembered are forgotten, or discarded. Hillsborough itself was a watershed, for the end of English football's bad old ways, but much of the spirit in Lord Justice Taylor's landmark reports \u2013 there were two \u2013 were ignored. His analysis was about much more than all-seat stadiums, and concluded with this: \"After the horror of Hillsborough&#xa0;\u2026 the lesson is surely that now is the moment for the fullest reassessment of policy for the game.\"</p> <p>In the 10 days since Taylor's first report, on the causes of the 1989 disaster, has finally been acknowledged as the truth, there have been some signs that football's response may just be shaping into a lasting&#xa0;legacy.</p> <p>There was real feeling in <a href=\"http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2012/09/17/everton-s-hillsborough-tribute\" title=\"\">the beautifully staged tribute to the 96 by Everton</a> before their game against Newcastle United, an understatement in the \"He ain't heavy, he's my brother\" lesson, that sport should unite us all, not curdle into vitriol. Yet if this moment is to be a watershed too, football will need to think about it all for longer than this week, for more than just a minute.</p> <p>In his second report, the one people in football do recall, on safety in sports grounds generally, Taylor insisted on laws to change the dismal culture, in which supporters huddled in sordid, unsafe conditions while the directors feasted in their lounges. He insisted stringent safety standards be made compulsory \u2013 along with his all-seat stadium recommendation many fans still believe was unnecessary \u2013 because after serial disasters the men who ran football could no longer be trusted. Taylor noted the \"massive public support and interest\" the national game commanded, despite the dreadful problems then disfiguring it; the crowds, which mostly braved it then only at the big games, were waiting to flock back.</p> <p>In his observation of football's boardrooms, as astute as his slicing through the lies of South Yorkshire police, Taylor famously noted: \"As for the clubs, it is legitimate to wonder whether the directors are genuinely interested in the welfare of their grass roots supporters. Boardroom struggles for power, wheeler-dealing in the buying and selling of shares, and indeed of whole clubs, sometimes suggest that those involved are more interested in the personal financial benefits or social status of being a director.\"</p> <p>It is one of the great contradictions in football's modern history that partly due to the rehabilitation Taylor himself ushered in, the directors then indulged in more \"wheeler dealing in the buying and selling of shares, and indeed of whole clubs\" than ever before. It is not difficult to imagine what Taylor would have thought of the \u00a390m pocketed by David Moores for his shares in Liverpool, and \u00a393m by Martin Edwards at Manchester United, for \"wheeler dealing\" in their shares. That has led to the bizarre position of two great clubs, entrusted with so huge a responsibility for setting the tone tomorrow, being owned by faraway Americans who knew nothing of the sacrifice that built English football, but were attracted by the dollars in the TV rights.</p> <p>As many supporters know, Taylor decided to back the government's, the FA's and top clubs' desires for all-seat stadiums, but recommended they should not raise prices for the supporters who had stuck with the game through the 1980s. The Football Supporters Association argued that the clubs would do so but Taylor, despite having identified the venality in directors, said they need not, pointing to the then \u00a36 price of a seat at Rangers' Ibrox. What has happened since, the \u00a345 charged now for a seat on what was once Liverpool's fabled standing area, the Kop, has proved that the fans knew their clubs rather better than did the judge.</p> <p>Conditions for supporters have, of course, been hugely improved and the game has been greatly refurbished. There have been many changes, but that \"fullest reassessment of policy\" never really happened. As football was rehabilitated, the clubs were allowed to raise prices beyond the reach of the next generation.</p> <p>It is a grim truth that so many of the Hillsborough victims were teenagers because then, at \u00a36 a ticket for the Leppings Lane end, they could afford to be part of the game which then failed them so abysmally. The clubs have developed community work vastly more sophisticated than anything envisaged in 1989, but they work with \"socially excluded\" young people whose exclusion extends to the stadium, too, priced out of what was once validly called \"the people's game\".</p> <p>The truth about Hillsborough has broken through, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/in-the-mix/2012/09/14/poet-laureate-carol-ann-duffy-writes-exclusive-poem-for-the-liverpool-echo-inspired-by-the-hillsborough-report-100252-31831715/\" title=\"\">as the poet laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, wrote for the Liverpool Echo</a>, like the sweet silver song of the lark. So perhaps now is the time for that full reassessment, not just for a minute.</p> <p>And if the fans, who watch these modern, overseas-owned corporations we still call clubs, in much better conditions, might have their own reassessment, it goes beyond ending pathetic chants burped up by ignoramuses who do not deserve the airtime. It should be to reclaim, somehow, the way football was supported for decades, when fans of rival clubs might like a drink and be tough enough, but would walk together and watch together without needing segregation. When the Munich air crash happened in 1958, there was great solidarity around football. The sad little song mocking it only wormed in with other rubbish behaviour, years later.</p> <p>Twenty-three years after the first Taylor report, its truth is finally accepted. It has felt as if Liverpool, the country, and football as a whole have breathed a mighty sigh of relief with the bereaved Hillsborough families. So football may now remember the spirit of the second Taylor report, not just the bits the clubs wanted, and, as the balloons lift to the heavens before this grandest of fixtures, think of an all-round better way for the game.</p>",
  "<p>With due apologies to the Greens, Plaid Cymru and even to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/21/ukip-conference-farage-speech-live-blog2\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage's buoyant Ukip</a>, all of which have already met and made their pitches, the gathering of the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/autumn_conference.aspx\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrats</a> this week is the moment at which the 2012 party conference season gets properly under way.</p> <p>These are the first party conferences since politics crossed the watershed between the first half of the 2010 parliament and the second half. Politics will now increasingly be dominated by what may happen in the 2015 election rather than by the upshot of the 2010 contest. The opinion polls increasingly frame the agendas of the parties as they seek to engage support from their voters. The battle for positional advantage is more focused, exemplified by the Conservatives' focus on <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f0413ea2-0261-11e2-8cf8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz277bmSl4C\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband</a>. But the tone at all of the three main conferences is likely to be more strategic than before.</p> <p>Nowhere is that likely to be more true than with the Lib Dems in Brighton. Nick Clegg's party has haemorrhaged electoral support for two years. <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Its poll ratings</a> remain obstinately low. It has been humiliated on AV and the House of Lords, while fighting its corner on bank reform, lower-rate tax bands, exam reform, and pupil premiums in school funding. The Lib Dems remain committed to the coalition with the Conservatives which they entered in 2010. But that commitment increasingly coexists with the desire and need to differentiate themselves more sharply from the Tories, especially since the latter's move to the right in the reshuffle. Many on the social liberal wing of the party have been urging this sharper course for many months, over issues like NHS reform and welfare. But there are other big issues on the table at Brighton, where a loud liberal clarion call is also required next week \u2013 on <a href=\"http://politicshome.com/uk/story/28597/\" title=\"\">secret courts</a> among others.</p> <p>However, the high command is already making its own differentiation moves, as Saturday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/danny-alexander-find-resources-elderly-welfare\" title=\"\">Guardian interview with the ultimate coalition loyalist, Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander</a>, bears out. Through the first half of the parliament, to the consternation of the Lib Dem left, Mr Alexander could never be manoeuvred into saying anything that strayed an iota from Treasury and coalition orthodoxy on economic policy. In Saturday's interview, by contrast, he makes three sharply drawn partisan points: that he will not agree to this week's Tory and Treasury hints about a two-year freeze on out-of-work benefits; that the next spending review will inevitably cover 2015-16 but will not push further, thus keeping future spending options open for post-election negotiation; and that it is time to stop the Tory war of attrition against green growth. High time. Welcome stuff.</p> <p>The other big issue at Brighton is Mr Clegg. The Lib Dem leader's position is not yet directly at risk. But the question of who would give the party its best chance in 2015 cannot be wished away. It is there every time a poll shows Lib Dem support in or just above single figures and Mr Clegg's ratings in eclipse. Mr Clegg would not have apologised over tuition fees this week if he did not grasp this, nor have told an interviewer about the \"hits\" he is taking \"for the team\"; nor would both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/liberal-democrats-must-back-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Paddy Ashdown</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/tammy-wynette-lib-dems-man\" title=\"\">Menzies Campbell</a> have had to speak up for their leader. Mr Clegg knows what is going on; he is going on. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/02/andrew-rawnsley-nick-clegg-safe-for-now\" title=\"\">the issue is out there</a> and it remains to be seen if the apology has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/21/nick-clegg-apology-song-alex-ross?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">helped or hindered</a> his attempt to deal with it.</p> <p>This is not make-or-break week for the Liberal Democrats or Mr Clegg. But the party has to recover its credibility, its voters and its sense of purpose in the 12 months that are now beginning. It desperately needs to be able to prove it has made a progressive difference within the coalition. There are signs that the party gets this. But they have to be translated into genuine achievements and a persuasive case. This won't be easy, to put it mildly, in current economic circumstances and with the commitment to austerity. But the clock is ticking.</p>",
  "<p>Next week Professor David Nutt will test the effects of MDMA \u2013 otherwise known as ecstasy \u2013 on a number of volunteers live on TV in a research project funded by&#xa0;Channel&#xa0;4. Julia Manning, chief executive of thinktank 2020Health believes the experiment is reckless. Oliver Laughland chairs.</p> <p><strong>David Nutt:</strong> The project has two purposes. The first is to show the whole process \u2013 from design to analysis \u2013 of a scientific experiment being performed. The second is to do the first UK imaging study of the human brain with [the effects of] MDMA, using the latest technology. The drug has been around for 50 years, and been used massively by young people. It also has important therapeutic potential and it's necessary, from the perspective of a neuroscientist, to understand what it does in the brain.</p> <p><strong>Julia Manning:</strong> It's reckless and pointless. We have a high regard for British scientific research. But I was alarmed when I heard about this. I don't believe it is a serious scientific study. It's been funded by Channel 4 because the Medical Research Council (MRC) and other authoritative bodies wouldn't fund it.</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> The research quality in this study is world-leading, using cutting-edge neuro-imaging technology and analysis. It will be published in the highest-quality journals. It's being funded by a television company not because other funders don't value the qualities of the research. When we put this study as part of a larger project to the MRC, it was scored very highly, but didn't fit in with the MRC's portfolio of addiction. As we know, MDMA is not addictive. I should be commended for finding a way of doing quality science, which otherwise wouldn't happen.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> Simply because you're using high technology doesn't make it quality. I also dispute that MDMA isn't addictive, because it's an amphetamine and it's well-known that amphetamines are addictive. Ecstasy and other drugs are illegal for good reasons. Not just for scientific reasons \u2013 it's because of the social, economic and moral messages that it&#xa0;sends out as well.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Laughland:</strong> Do you think the programme will send out the wrong moral message?</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> I don't think a scientific programme has any relationship to moral messages. What we're trying to do is understand the effects on the brain of a drug which, as everyone who uses it \u2013 by and large \u2013 tells us, produces an interesting and profound change in people's feelings in a positive direction. This science will give us an insight into a brain mechanism underpinning trust, empathy and love, and may lead us to new therapies. I am president of the British Neuroscience Association; I know what good neuroscience is, and this is cutting-edge.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> It's publicity-seeking neuroscience. It's publicity-seeking neuroscience. The issue is that you're using an illegal drug to get publicity for your research and position, which is wanting to legalise access to [some] drugs. If&#xa0;you're really looking to do serious neuroscience, why aren't you looking for a cure for Alzheimer's or Parkinson's?</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> Sorry, Julia, but depression is still \u2013 as you may know from the recent report from the European Brain Council, of which I'm vice president \u2013 the largest cause of disability in Europe. We have many treatments that are not particularly effective. I'm looking to innovate. You should be endorsing this approach and encouraging the British pharmaceutical industry to support me. The reason it is not is because it is too terrified of the illegal status of these drugs \u2013 it believes, incorrectly, that working in this field would give it bad publicity. Your argument with me is essentially fuelling that prejudice.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> That's absolutely not the case. The University of Birmingham is using a derivative of MDMA [in a modified form to examine its effects on fighting blood cancer cells]. It has got a licence from the Home Office. Have you got one?</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> Of course we have. Are you saying that fighting cancer is more important than depression? That it's all right to use illegal drugs for cancer but you can't use them for depression or trauma illness? The illegality is a separate dimension. There are drugs that are very useful but also illegal; drugs such as opiates, ketamine, amphetamines \u2013 all of which are prescribable for medical conditions. My view is clear. If this drug has therapeutic utility, doctors should be able to use it.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> This sends the wrong message to the public and to young people because it implies that taking MDMA as it is currently constituted, could be valid for therapeutic use. The other examples that you cited have medically approved, trialled and tested forms in which the risks have been considered to be less than the benefits. That is the basis of all our medicine. There is no restriction on doing proper trials on drugs that are available as illegal forms. If you come up with a valid scientific study, the MRC and the Home Office will often give approval to looking into possible therapeutic uses for those drugs \u2013 often in different forms, not in their street form. The law is in place to protect and that is important. What this programme will do is glamorise the taking of MDMA.</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> This is something we thought about very carefully. I'm not in favour of taking any [illegal] drugs, which is why I'm concerned about the glamorising of the taking of alcohol in many aspects of our society. I am anti-drugs, and my entire research career has been directed towards understanding the harms of drugs so we can minimise them. I'm not in the business of glamorising anything. You will see when you watch the show that it's extremely rigorous. It will tell us where MDMA works in the brain, whether there is a biological relationship between taking MDMA and the three-day blues [come down] \u2013 which I can tell you now there isn't. It will make the data even stronger on how this drug might be useful in post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p><strong>OL:</strong> Won't showing you taking this drug in a controlled environment go some way to demystifying its use? It's a fact of life for thousands of young people.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> I don't think drugs are a fact of life. Only three million adults have tried drugs. Use of drugs is symptomatic of profound malaise; we are letting down young people and children if we imply taking drugs is something that could have value. It's not the drugs that are in question, it's the human, psychological and existential issues complicit in drug-taker behaviour that we should be raising.</p> <p><strong>DN:</strong> These people [taking part in the experiment] are taking a chemical that's 99.9% pure ecstasy. This is not street drugs, this is the pure form that could be used therapeutically. I was working with the Home Office when people began to get concerned about the harms of ecstasy in the 1990s. Now I realise this was due to a misunderstanding of how to use the drug, and gross exaggeration by the media. I realise now that the drug is far less harmful then I believed at the time. Putting it into class A was wrong, it was politically motivated. It's been vilified.</p> <p><strong>JM:</strong> We don't agree that you can look at a drug by itself. You have to consider the social, moral and economic implications of doing anything that suggests taking a banned substance is OK.</p> <p><em>Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial is on Channel 4 at 10pm on Wednesday and Thursday next week</em></p>",
  "<p>Lord Fink, the Tory donor (ennobled 2011) and party treasurer, who succeeded to the post after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/25/tory-cash-access-party-funding\" title=\"\">Peter Cruddas was caught out offering meetings with David Cameron for donations of up to \u00a3250,000</a>, has revealed that he asked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/20/tory-treasurer-make-uk-tax-haven?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">George Osborne to make Britain more like a tax haven</a>, so we, er, don't lose jobs to other tax havens, because everyone knows that Guernsey is an economy that dwarfs all others.</p> <p>What Fink means, I suspect, is that Britain should be more like a tax haven so he doesn't lose money to anything as morally perverse as a tax system. This is the neoliberal cure for the problem of tax havens, and it makes sense if you love money and hate people. Make everywhere a tax haven. This, in the government's exhausted social equality jargon, could even be called \"fair\".</p> <p>Not that Osborne agreed with Fink. We know what the chancellor thinks of tax avoidance, because he was moved to comment on it even before the comic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/21/jimmy-carr-apologises-error-tax\" title=\"\">Jimmy Carr was exposed as a tax avoider</a> in June and instantly stopped being funny. In his budget speech Osborne denounced \"tax evasion and indeed aggressive tax avoidance as morally repugnant\". Morally repugnant? Are you sure? I thought it was welfare recipients, with their pesky need for food and healthcare and jobs (see the whispered philosophising of Mitt Romney) who are morally repugnant; you would certainly think so, from the number of briefings from civil servants hitting the tabloids, moaning about immigrants living in mansions and laughing at the \"squeezed middle\".</p> <p>Other ministers sing the anti-tax avoidance song \u2013 Danny Alexander, Vince Cable, even the prime minister, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/20/cameron-family-tax-havens\" title=\"\">private fortune was enhanced by careful investment in tax havens</a>, courtesy of his late father. But while welfare scrounging is morally repugnant enough to act on, tax avoidance, it seems, is not \u2013 you can endorse it, and still be Lord Fink (ennobled 2011) and party treasurer. Nothing changes, which makes me wonder if the only person in government telling the truth is Francis Maude who, when accused of trying to turn Britain into a tax haven by a Labour MP 20 years ago, said: \"Thank you very much, I appreciate the compliment.\" This is an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9189492/Its-a-compliment-to-be-a-tax-haven-says-Francis-Maude.html\" title=\"\">anecdote he tells journalists</a>, so he must think it makes him sound wonderful.</p> <p>No one is sure quite how much revenue is lost to tax havens and complex avoidance schemes because invisible money is hard to count. You are more likely to see the tax gap wandering down Bond Street than find a note of it in a drawer at HM Revenue and Customs. The Treasury says that almost 14% of the UK tax gap is due to legal tax avoidance. The Times put it at \u00a35bn a year in an investigation this week, with at least \u00a31bn being lost to British citizens living in Monaco, if you can call it living.</p> <p>Of six Monaco-based donors to \u2013 surprise! \u2013 the Tory party, one, David Instance, lent Cameron a helicopter in his leadership campaign, so he could fly to meetings and harm the world, like James Bond in reverse. I have seen Monaco; it is all street signs pointing at Prada, billionaires cruising, as if on spring break, and defibrillators at bus stops for when they actually do break. Only a person who thinks paying capital gains tax is the same thing as being beaten up by a gang of social democrats would actually live there, but they do.</p> <p>In the report <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/21/global-elite-tax-offshore-economy\" title=\"\">The Price of Offshore Revisited</a>, James Henry, formerly the chief economist at McKinsey, puts the amount invested through tax havens between \u00a313 trillion and \u00a320tn, which is more than US and Japanese GDP combined. It enough to write off third world debt, reinstitute Sure Start, even in a property market as inflated as Monaco, and buy the prime minister enough helicopters to fill the skies. He could spell out his name in them.</p> <p>Action is promised, but always snuffed out. The G20 said it would \"close the door on tax havens\" in 2009, after taxpayers bailed out banks and bankers \u2013 the state does have uses, you see, despite its baffling hunger for tax revenue. The G20 showed the robustness of its determination by flexing its giant fists and, er, requesting more transparency from tax havens, which they were, amazingly, reluctant to provide. And why would they when the people asking for transparency are so often the same people languishing offshore? This week the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/20/peers-mps-directors-companies-linked-tax-havens\" title=\"\">Guardian reported that 68 peers and MPs</a> work for firms that operate in tax havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the amount held in bank accounts in tax havens was \u00a31.7tn in 2011 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/07/tax-evasion-global-action\" title=\"\">the same as in 2007</a>. With insane hubris, the crackdown, a few treaties and a lot of money moving from tax haven to tax haven, was called a success. What would they consider a failure?</p> <p>In November, Angel Gurr\u00eda, general secretary of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or, as I am calling it, the Organisation for Talk, Wait and Do Nothing, told the G20: \"The era of bank secrecy is over.\" The most amusing result was that Jersey was seriously rattled: in June, Sir Philip Bailhache (knighted 1996) the island's assistant chief minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/26/jersey-threatens-independence-tax-backlash\" title=\"\">threatened to declare independence</a> from the UK.

That is what my daddy always told me \u2013 don't make the same mistake twice.\"</p> <p>Alexander's remarks show that the Lib Dems, who faced criticism for caving in too easily to the Tories on tuition fees, have learnt another lesson which is now being drilled into them by their new director of strategy director, the South African Ryan Coetzee. This is that they must identify and highlight their priorities and then fight hard to deliver them in government.</p> <p>The chief secretary will be doing that at the Lib Dem conference this week when he tables a motion calling for the implementation of what was meant to be the main headline pledge of their last election manifesto: raising the personal tax allowance to \u00a310,000 to relieve the burden on the less well off.</p> <p>The Lib Dems are likely to be able to deliver the new personal tax rate by the next general election in 2015 after reaching a deal with the Tories in the budget this year in which they supported the abolition of the 50p upper rate of tax. But on areas such as the Dilnot proposals and on renewable energy, the Lib Dems are hunkering down for a prolonged battle with their coalition partners.</p> <p>The harmony of the joint Clegg-Cameron Rose Garden press conference of May 2010 is now but a distant memory, and Alexander warns of a \"constant war of attrition\" on green issues from his coalition partners. \"I just don't think the British economy can anymore afford to have a blue roadblock to green growth,\" he says in words that would have been unthinkable a few months ago.</p> <p>The marriage first ran into trouble in the summer of last year when the prime minister instructed Tory donors to direct their resources against his coalition partners in the AV referendum campaign, which the Lib Dems lost heavily. But the final spark was extinguished when Cameron failed to deliver his party to support House of Lords reform, prompting the Lib Dems to retaliate by withdrawing their support for Tory plans to shrink the size of the House of Commons.</p> <p>In the new businesslike coalition there may be little warmth but the two partners are working to ensure the government stays together until the next general election in May 2015. Clegg and Alexander recently thrashed out a series of ideas with Cameron and George Osborne at a meeting at Chequers for a mid-term review of the coalition which will be published this autumn.</p> <p>\"Of course it will be looking forward,\" Alexander says. \"In the area of the economy we set out a plan when we came in and we have been constantly building upon that and improving that \u2013 adding more pluses to Plan A if you like.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of further ideas in that space as well as, crucially, delivering the things we have already set out to do. Also there are issues we address in the coalition agreement that we have talked but we haven't necessarily completely got there yet as a coalition government. Social care is one of those.\"</p> <p>The immediate challenge for Alexander will be when the chancellor delivers his autumn statement. Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, raised the prospect this week that Osborne may fail one of his tests \u2013 that debt should be falling as a share of GDP by 2015-16 \u2013 if the Office for Budget Responsibility rules the fall in economic growth is more permanent than expected.</p> <p>Alexander indicates that the treasury will not dig in its heels and impose even more draconian spending cuts to ensure the debt target is met. \"I am not going to get into hypothetical discussions about it. But if you look at what we did last autumn we took a very pragmatic response to the structural deterioration in the forecast. Rather than say we are going to make more cuts in this parliament we said we need to extend the period over two years by which we are going to eliminate the structural deficit.\"</p> <p>But the chief secretary is clearer in spelling out the impact of last year's decision \u2013 the Lib Dems will only sign up to the first of those two extra years of spending cuts. \"Here is something we have to do and something I won't do,\" he says on Lib Dem plans as he breaks new ground on Lib Dem plans. \"The thing we have to do is set out detailed plans for 2015-16. That financial year begins in April 2015, we will still be in government and departments will need to know what they are doing and what they have budgets for and we have a responsibility to make those decisions. Based on the numbers we set out in the Red Book that means billions of pounds of reductions set out for that year.\"</p> <p>But Alexander says that at that point the Lib Dems will differentiate themselves by pulling stumps and refusing to sign up to joint cuts for the second year with the Tories. They will instead feature in the Lib Dem manifesto.</p> <p>\"The thing I will not do is sacrifice our party's independence by binding us to specifics on spending deep into the next parliament. But we definitely have to find those savings for that year. Not to do so would be completely irresponsible.\"</p> <p>Alexander's words mean the Lib Dems are making plans to place clear yellow water between themselves and the Tories in before the general election. But by signing up to spending cuts for 2015-16, which will be underway by the time of the next election, he is indicating that the Lib Dems intend to remain in the coalition until polling day.</p> <p>The chief secretary has clearly learnt that lesson from his parents. \"Focus on the job in hand,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Treasury chief secretary, has accused his Conservative coalition partners of waging a \"constant war of attrition\" on green issues, warning that it is endangering billions in green investment, as well as the whole government growth strategy.</p> <p>Alexander describes how the government is having to deal with Tory backbenchers \u2013 including those he calls \"luddite\" climate change deniers \u2013 opposing green technologies such as windfarms. \"I just don't think the British economy can any more afford to have a blue roadblock to green growth,\" he says.</p> <p>In a Guardian interview on the eve of the Lib Dem party conference, he also reveals a new fault line with his coalition partners, promising to oppose any Tory plan to freeze out-of-work benefits.</p> <p>\"A two-year freeze in benefits, which would freeze the incomes of the poorest people in this country, is not a place we should be looking at,\" he says.</p> <p>He also insists that he does not accept George Osborne's suggestion that the next round of welfare cuts needs to be as high as \u00a310bn. \"I am not wedded to any number,\" he says.</p> <p>Alexander's remarks represent a twin broadside against the chancellor, who has been urging further big welfare cuts as well as claiming that green policies will hinder growth if they make British industry less competitive</p> <p>But Alexander does admit for the first time that the two parties will have to agree joint plans in a spending review next year for billions of so far unidentified Whitehall spending cuts to be implemented in 2015/16, the period straddling a June 2015 general election.</p> <p>\"The thing I will not do is sacrifice our party's independence by binding us to specifics on spending deep into the next parliament, but we definitely have to find those savings for the year 2015/16. Not to do so would be completely irresponsible\", he says.</p> <p>As chief secretary to the Treasury Alexander is at the heart of all budget negotiations across the government. He is a member of the \"quad\" at the apex of the coalition alongside David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Osborne.</p> <p>He indicates that a new wealth tax could be agreed by the coalition before the election. He also gives a strong hint that the government may shelve its fiscal mandate \u2013 debt falling as a proportion of GDP in 2015/16 \u2013 if public finances deteriorate.</p> <p>Alexander, normally the Liberal Democrat cabinet minister most loyal to the coalition, was speaking before a conference in which Nick Clegg will seek to re-energise the Lib Dems. Clegg is hoping his party's contribution to the coalition will get a more positive hearing now that he has apologised for pledging at the last election to oppose tuition fees.</p> <p>Alexander marks out his clearest differences with the Conservatives on green issues. \"The thing that in this job and in this government I find most frustrating is what often feels like a constant war of attrition on green issues, on renewable energy and renewable investment which is so important to our economy. I think that just has to come to an end.</p> <p>\"It seems to me that green investment is one of the fastest routes to getting investment, growth and jobs going in this country, and we just need to have a very, very clear position and a very, very clear plan. I don't think as a government we can afford to send mixed messages on that point.\"</p> <p>The government, after a lengthy internal battle earlier this year, reduced subsidies for onshore wind power by 10% from April next year rather than the 25% reportedly sought by Osborne.</p> <p>Alexander says he wants to establish a target range of 50g\u2013100g of CO2 per kilowatt hour for the decarbonisation of the power sector by 2030.</p> <p>But Cameron has appointed John Hayes, an opponent of windfarms, as the new energy minister, and the Treasury has been hinting that green subsidies should be dropped. Alexander says he will not comment on individuals but adds: \"There are all sorts of noises off, particularly from Tory backbenchers about 'let's stop onshore windfarms, and massively cut back their subsidies' and it creates a lot of uncertainty for investors.</p> <p>\"They worry about the pressure going on amongst the backbenchers in one of the governing parties and what does it mean for the future.</p> <p>\"It means we have to deal with some of the luddites that continue to deny climate change and who think this is all a myth. I am not saying these views are held in government, but you do hear those noises in the wider debate, and the only way to deal with them is not for the government to pander to those ideas, but to get on and deliver our agenda.\"</p> <p>Alexander rebuffs suggestions that the Treasury has become an institutional block to reform of social care by failing to implement proposals set out by the Dilnot commission.</p> <p>He says: \"I certainly want to see reform of social care. In the end these spending decisions are about choices. It is about what do you want to prioritise and where are you willing to make savings?\"</p>",
  "<p>\"The day the music died \u2026 \" observed Don McLean in American Pie, still available from EMI. It is a competitive field as to when this event happened but the pointless, unnecessary dismemberment of the 115-year-old British record company has to be in the dismal top 10. The world's most concentrated media market, with four players, is reduced to three.</p> <p>The approval by the European commission means EMI will broken up into at least three. The Motown and other song catalogues had already been sold to a consortium led by Sony. Now Universal Music, the market leader in recordings, is being allowed to buy most of EMI's record labels \u2013 with Brussels insisting on the offsetting divestment of the Parlophone label and EMI's half of Now That's What I Call Music.</p> <p>How needless. Over-ambition got to Guy Hands, who showed that music and private equity don't go together, injecting the business with too much debt against a backdrop of endemic piracy. Citigroup snatched the keys, and insisted on an unnecessary sale process, when it could have been demerged instead. European regulators failed by allowing Citigroup's breakup plan to go through, thinking it reasonable to let Universal increase its global market share from 29% to about 36%. Sony is next on 22%.</p> <p>Had EMI been a chocolate-maker there might at least have been some concern about a breakup and takeover. But because it operates in the music industry \u2013 one of the few areas where Britain leads the world \u2013 nobody in Westminster cares. Neither Conservatives nor Labour raised any concern.</p> <p>The result? Most probably, less choice for aspiring artists. Digital music startups acting in thrall to a handful of companies. Fewer records likely to be released. EMI falls, a victim of capitalism unconstrained. There can be no coda to that.</p>",

In the highest echelons of power, we've seen Bill Clinton grudgingly throw his weight behind Barack Obama, George Bush formally endorse John McCain, and Sarah Palin praise the Romney/Ryan ticket. While these stamps of approval must inevitably sometimes be seen as proverbial albatrosses, every so often they can be just the boost you need.</p> <p>Now imagine the coup if an entire presidential staff were persuaded to record a video in support of a candidate for Michigan's supreme court. Lucky Bridget Mary McCormack then, for she has managed just that. President Josiah Bartlet (leader of the free world: 1999-2007), and his staff have recorded a message to persuade the great people of Michigan to be aware of the non-partisan candidates on the ballot, and in particular, for McCormack. The video has gone viral, and caught the eye of many a media outlet not previously inclined to cover the local election with such enthusiasm. This shouldn't surprise anyone, given that Jed Bartlet has regularly been voted America's most popular president, with approval ratings that would make even Mitt Romney finally embrace those pesky 47%.</p> <p>Of course, you know that there was no \"real\" President Bartlet. But for those of us who watched the West Wing with an almost religious zeal during the Bush years, it was hard not to wish that there was. The fictional president was a studious and thoughtful man, with a degree of honesty and belief that voters don't usually find in real politicians. His staff were passionate, hard working and often too attractive for Washington (hello, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young et al). </p> <p>Throughout each of the seven seasons, we followed the frustrations of governance and came to understand just how seriously the characters took it. This was often in stark contrast to the famous gaffes of George Bush, which only made the fictitious White House seem that much more competent.</p> <p>Since the West Wing has secured its place in TV history with its enduring popularity, Bridget Mary McCormack may very well have played her trump card. The video is bereft of the opulent White House set, and it's hard to explain non-partisan candidacy in a particularly gripping manner, but despite this, the short film manages to capture the basic essence of the series. The famous \"walk and talk\" is there, as is the Aaron Sorkin-like lofty dialogue that can veer dangerously towards pretension. </p> <p>As the nostalgia for these particularly loved in-jokes builds, fans will be sure to check out McCormack's credentials, and no doubt enjoy her close link to one of the cast (she is Mary McCormack's sister). By any stretch, she will be more recognised today than she ever could have been previously. You cannot buy this kind of spotlight unless you are actually the president.</p> <p>Without wanting to criticize my beloved political dream team, I might offer two criticisms of the short reunion. The first is whether a globally watched video actually can make the desired impact in one specific state. As one YouTube viewer said: \"Good luck on your campaign..wish I lived there to vote for you!\" </p> <p>And therein lies the problem. Whilst I'm prepared to pack up my bags and ship off to Michigan to vote in a West Wing-endorsed race, will it convince the locals? Hollywood has a record of turning off voters when they engage in the electoral process. Will the Michigan electorate really listen to the points made on the video, or will the problem of low voter engagement for non-partisan candidates remain just that?</p> <p>The more obvious problem with this kind of campaign is the realization that we live in a world where a fictional president is more effective at capturing the electorate's attention than the wars, recession and global warming that some of us will actually face in our lives. </p> <p>Does the affection reserved for a TV show that ended six years ago still have the power to make people get out and vote? And what does it say if our real politicians can never muster this kind of loyal turnout? </p> <p>It's unlikely that I'll be watching the state supreme court results, however. I've remembered I still have West Wing box sets I could be re-watching.</p>",
  "<p>Grant Shapps, the Conservative party chairman, posed as a \"multimillion-dollar web marketer\" named Michael Green who spoke to reveal the secrets of his trade at a $3,000-a-head internet conference in Las Vegas while he was the Tory party candidate for Welwyn Hatfield.</p> <p>The pictorial evidence of his double life, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosalindgardner/2088336964/\" title=\"\">revealed online</a> by a fellow conference speaker, will pile pressure on Shapps to explain his links to a network of websites which have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/07/google-blacklists-websites-grant-shapps-family\" title=\"\">blocked by Google for breaching its rules on copyright infringement</a> and encouraging customers to plagiarise content.</p> <p>But at the age of 35, Shapps claimed already to have established \"the world's largest internet marketing forum\". A few years later while a member of the shadow cabinet, he also had time to run phone lines where for $297 an hour Green would give tips to aspiring entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Casting himself as an internet marketing guru with products and coaching services guaranteed to generate income, Shapps owned and ran until 2008 a series of websites making claims that still dog him despite attempts to downplay his personal role. Using the website MichaelGreenConsulting.com, which operated from 2004 until it was removed from the internet in 2009, Shapps claimed to run the \"world's largest internet marketing forum\" with his company How To Corp.</p> <p>While serving the constituents of Welwyn Hatfield, shadowing the housing brief and taking charge of Tory byelection campaigns, Shapps also ran phone lines offering expert advice on internet marketing. \"The fee for my one-hour phone consultation is $297 (US). I make the call to you, no matter where you are in the world,\" the website read. In 2004 Shapps, then the Tory candidate for the Hertfordshire seat, was passing himself off as Green and began to appear at web marketing conferences \u2013 <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040327025047/http://www.jvsummit.com/\" title=\"\">speaking at a $2,797-a-ticket convention in Las Vegas's New York New York Hotel and Casino</a>, whose facade is a lifesize replica of 12 Manhattan skyscrapers including a 529-foot-tall copy of the Empire State building. It was here that Shapps was pictured as Green.</p> <p>After winning the seat in 2005 Shapps registered his shareholding in How To Corp on the parliamentary register of interests. He has never revealed the amount paid out to him from the company in dividends. Shapps founded How To Corp in 2000, focusing on internet marketing, but rarely touched upon it in interviews \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/grant-shapps-wikipedia-edited-gaffe?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">a mention of Green was removed from his Wikipedia entry.</a></p> <p>In 2008 Shapps transferred his share in How To Corp to his wife, Belinda, a Conservative activist who had failed to win a council seat for the Tories in Camden, north London, a decade earlier. The Tory chairman says he \"no longer has any involvement\" in the company. The site is now fronted by a Sebastian Fox.</p> <p>In 2010 the family firm launched Traffic Paymaster \u2013 software that inflates a website's advertising revenue by copying and retouching other people's content, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/15/labour-probe-grant-shapps-company\" title=\"\">which Labour has called on police to investigate for possible fraud and copyright violations.</a> Last week, after the Guardian reported Labour's call, Traffic Paymaster disappeared from the web.</p> <p>The Guardian has now established that Traffic Paymaster \"scrapes and spins\" content from at least four websites: <a href=\"http://www.ezinearticles.com\" title=\"\">ezinearticles.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.goarticles.com\" title=\"\">goarticles.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com\" title=\"\">ehow.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ezinemark.com\" title=\"\">ezinemark.com</a>. These sites appear to prohibit the \"plagiarising of information\".</p> <p>\"Use of site scrapers, article crawlers, or other automated methods/scripts to mine the article content of GoArticles are expressly forbidden unless permission has been specifically granted by GoArticles.com,\" reads one warning.</p> <p>Although registered to an office in Pinner, north-west London, How To Corp products and services are priced in US dollars, and in its marketing materials How To Corp claims to have an office in the United States and lists US phone and fax numbers. Shapps had claimed this was necessary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/08/1\" title=\"\">since 90% of the site's revenue came from the US</a>. The company lists offices in Pennsylvania. However the Pennsylvanian department of state said it had no record of the company. The addresses given were traced to residential properties. \"If a company had been trading from Pennsylvania then it would have to be registered here. Otherwise there are fines of $500,\" said the state authorities.</p> <p>A Conservative spokesman said that Shapps's \"involvement in business has always been entirely properly declared with the parliamentary authorities and subsequently ministerial authorities\", including being cleared by Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service.</p> <p>The spokesman continued: \"Grant had a career in business before entering politics. He is completely open about this and believes that parliament benefits from the experience of members from a wide variety of backgrounds. His involvement in business has always been entirely and properly declared with the relevant authorities, confirmation of which includes a letter from the head of the home civil service, Bob Kerslake. It is completely incorrect to suggest otherwise.\"</p> <p>Labour said it would be pressing Shapps to explain his past. Steve McCabe, the Labour MP who has called on the Crown Prosecution Service to investigate How To Corp, said: \"Grant Shapps's multiple personalities and questionable business practices are becoming a major embarrassment to the Conservative Party.</p> <p>\"It is little wonder the Tory-led government can't start to deal with the myriad problems, from a recession made in Downing Street to the debacle of the GCSE results, with Grant Shapps overseeing proceedings. He must make a full statement on his past and why he found it necessary to use an alias to conduct business.\"</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this month, we <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2012/sep/14/gaming-in-education-tips-for-teachers-ollie-bray\">interviewed teacher Ollie Bray about how he uses games in his classroom</a>, and he shared a lovely story about a collaborative project he worked on with a Canadian school. </p> <p>He told Hannah Gould: \"We did a wonderful project in 2010, when the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Winter Olympics game was released and we had a video project with a school in Canada. The Canadian teacher we spoke with kept her kids in school all night for a kind of sleepover and when they connected to us at 6am their time, it was 3.30pm and we had kept our kids back after close. The fascinating thing about this was that our kids thought it was a project about the Olympics, but really it was about connecting rural communities across the world, with all kind of lessons about citizenship. The teachers then applied the experience to lessons on time zones, which is something children really struggle with. All of this came from the contextual hub of the computer game. The learning had little to do with the Winter Olympics game but it provided a stimulus to get children excited about learning.\"</p> <p>You can almost feel the excitement anticipation from this snippet. Students up all night, eagerly waiting to play - and hopefully thrash - their peers at a school in Canada.</p> <p>It's a great story to illustrate the potential of international collaboration - and it's just one small piece of the global puzzle.</p> <p>Over the next week, we'll be hearing lots more about the opportunities, challenges and benefits working with schools overseas can bring.

  "<p>How is Frankfurt different from London as a financial centre? Over the past week I have tried to ask as many insiders across Frankfurt as possible. A picture emerges of a city where finance is simply a job, not an all-encompassing identity or a way of life.</p> <p>Meanwhile, life in Frankfurt does appear almost offensively good. \"When I first got here, I just couldn't believe how small it was,\" said a British recent arrival who worked in the City for years. \"You think, this is Germany's or even Europe's financial centre. You assume it's very big. It really isn't.\"</p> <p>As a city, Frankfurt is a tenth the size of London, and in spite of the skyscrapers, its financial sector is vastly smaller too.</p> <p>A trader in his late 20s described dealing with a London trading floor: \"I call and speak to Tom. Next time, someone else answers the phone, and next time, someone else again. These places are just huge.\"</p> <p>Add to this the enormous turnover. \"In Frankfurt you've got people who have been trading particular Pfandbriefe [bonds] for 25 years. That's what they do. In London, people are fired easily and hired easily. Frankfurt doesn't have that recruitment and headhunting culture.\" You have traders and dealmakers working in Frankfurt, obviously. But all the truly huge deals and trades are happening in London.</p> <p>Another trader said: \"In Frankfurt there simply aren't any 24-year-olds with a $10m bonus. You only need a few of those, and public opinion is affected by their excesses.\"</p> <p>A pivotal event for the city came a few years ago when Deutsche Bank moved the headquarters for its investment bank \u2013 with its bonus-heavy activities around financial markets and dealmaking \u2013 to London. Several people in both London and Frankfurt claimed that if Deutsche Bank Frankfurt was \"a family\", London headquarters was like \"a boxing ring\".</p> <p>Frankfurt gets filtered for testosterone, said one banker. \"Genuinely ambitious Germans go to London. Meanwhile any expats who decide to settle down here do so for the quality of life.\" Indeed, walking around town and seeing German pedestrians wait before a red traffic light without a car in sight, it's hard to imagine a Master of the Universe setting up camp here. Insiders use terms such as sedate, steady and stable for Frankfurt.</p> <p>Bankers in Frankfurt get paid significantly less, all the way up to the CEO, and they pay considerably more taxes. Meanwhile finance is far less controversial, it appears, and I did not find the sense of victimhood and siege mentality you see among quite a few bankers in London. \"Finance in Frankfurt is more knitted into the wider fabric of the economy,\" said one financial analyst. \"You have the fair, it's a transport nexus and they have some real industry here. Finance is less of an end in itself.\" And the sector holds less clout. \"It's not like German bankers sit together and say: 'let's be modest',\" the analyst said. \"You have the same tendencies as in London. But German bankers operate in a different environment and the financial lobby gets less of what it wants.\"</p> <p>And then there is the quality of life. A newcomer to London myself, I began to get slightly annoyed over the course of the week by the raving over Frankfurt's superb cultural offerings, its forests nearby, the massive yet peaceful beer and wine festivals along the river. Drinking is not about release here, several Brits said, so you don't get the English excesses. Frankfurt airport is the size of Heathrow but only 15 minutes by car from the city centre. The Hauptbahnhof is a hub for the superfast Ice trains.</p> <p>The recently arrived Brit said: \"Here I can ride my bike to work, or walk there in 20 relaxing minutes. Nobody in my office has lunch at their desks. The ones with kids live out of town in the <em>Speckgurtel </em>(\"bacon belt\"), and they need to drive maybe half an hour or so. Because the commute isn't such an epic struggle, people arrive at work in a different mindset. I imagine they must also come back to their families in a different mood.\"</p> <p>The trader in his late 20s agrees. \"London salaries and bonuses are much higher. But in Frankfurt your money goes further, even after the higher taxes. Housing is far cheaper, there are no crazy school fees, and we have subsidised daycare.\"</p> <p>Sounding almost smug, he added: \"I like to tell my boss, if you want to send me to London, you are going have to pay me four times as much.\"</p>",
  "<p>Chayya Gaikwad grew up in a women's refuge in Mumbai. She now works for an international bank. It wasn't a miracle that got her there. It was netball.</p> <p>Chhaya, 23, joined the <a href=\"http://goalprogramme.org\" title=\"\">Goal programme</a> as a teenager. Financed by Standard Chartered Bank, Goal gives girls from deprived backgrounds the opportunity to learn a range of different sports with a qualified coach. Running alongside the sessions are lessons in life skills, such as healthy eating, leadership and financial literacy.</p> <p>\"Netball builds health and confidence and team spirit, and teaches us to work with all sorts of different people,\" says Chhaya, who proceeded through the programme's ranks to become an assistant coach and finally an intern at Standard Chartered.</p> <p>Sport is now <a href=\"http://www.sportanddev.org\" title=\"\">widely accepted</a> as a powerful vehicle in the delivery of development goals, be they public health, education or social inclusion. Lecture kids in a classroom and a fraction of the information sticks. Introduce a ball into the equation and you suddenly have yourself a large and attentive audience.</p> <p>That's <a href=\"http://www.righttoplay.com\" title=\"\">Right to Play's</a> experience, at least. The Toronto-based development charity provides a network of 12,000 local coaches in 20 countries. Their sports-based activities are all geared to address specific local issues, ranging from gender equality in the Middle East to basic literacy in Peru.</p> <p>Will Morgan, senior fundraising manager at the charity, explains: \"At the end of every activity, there's a discussion facilitated by the coach in which the children are taught to reflect on what they've just done, connect it to their everyday life and apply it in the future. That's how you get long-term behaviour change.\"</p> <p>The facts bear that out. A study of Right to Play's sport interventions among refugee communities in Uganda found that 84% of participants now sleep under a mosquito net. The national average is closer to 10%. Attitudes can shift too. More than 90% of Right to Play's young participants in Uganda believe children with HIV or AIDS should be allowed to attend school. Only 54% of non-participants agree.</p> <h2>Mutual benefit </h2> <p>So how does business fit into the mix? First, there's the issue of incentive to consider. Corporate reputation, employee engagement and health, and license to operate are just some of the notable wins for companies.</p> <p>\"On top of that, sport can add to the efficiency, reach or impact of any kind of corporate community initiative\", says Joe Phelan, a spokesperson for the International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF), which has published <a href=\"http://www.sportanddev.org/en/toolkit/partnerships/benefits_of_partnering_with_ngos/shared_goals/\" title=\"\">two reports</a> on the business case for sport for development.</p> <p>Recruitment represents another big pull. \"From the bank's perspective, the benefit [of Goal] is in creating a talent pool,\" says Chris James, head of talent acquisition at Standard Chartered, South Asia. He's not wrong. Chhaya is just one of 18,865 girls involved in the Goal programme throughout India, Nigeria, China, Jordan and Zambia. The bank aims to reach 80,000 more.</p> <p>Having empowered and informed women in the markets where it operates is not lost on Standard Chartered. The programme's financial literacy component \"makes perfect sense\" to a bank, says the firm's head of sustainability, Mark Devadason. No surprise then that the Goal webpage offers a click-through tab to the bank's advisory services for women in business.</p> <p>David Wheldon is equally frank about the potential business upside. Managing director for brand, marketing and citizenship at UK bank Barclays, he points to young people's appropriation of \"highly employable skills\" through sport, such as teamwork, leadership, problem solving and communication. \"[These are] precisely the skills that an employer such as Barclays looks for in potential employees,\" he states.</p> <p>It's not a one-way street, however. Development charities can gain from business input too. Corporate cash is one welcome asset. But development NGOs can benefit from companies' professionalism and technical expertise as well, says Pippa Satchwell Smith, a Zimbabwe-based sport-for-development expert.</p> <p>Tapping into businesses' global networks can be invaluable too, she adds. Take sporting superstars. As sponsor of the Premier League, for example, Barclays has access to some of the best-known sporting faces on the planet. The same is true for the likes of Nike, Adidas and the world's other major sports sponsors.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.laureus.com/foundation\" title=\"\">Laureus Sport for Good Foundation</a> foundation is putting such celebrity to good effect. The charity has an academy that comprises 46 of the world's greatest sporting legends.</p> <p>Think Viv Richards, Michael Johnson, Martina Navratilova. Laureus arranges visits for them to its 104 projects around the world. So last year, for example, tennis star Boris Becker popped into a football school in Haiti. Next week, athlete Edwin Moses is in Brazil to visit a youth boxing project in the favelas of Rio.</p> <p>These are sporting icons that children immediately know, says Ned Wills, the foundation's director. \"They [sports stars] can not only inspire the kids on the ground, but they can also highlight the huge impact that sport is having \u2026 and promote the value of these programmes to new audiences.\"</p> <h2>Lasting legacy </h2> <p>Nick Keller is a passionate advocate for involving companies in development through sport. Yet as founder of <a href=\"http://www.beyondsport.org/\" title=\"\">Beyond Sport</a>, a global charity that promotes sport as a vehicle for social change, he's sceptical of corporate philanthropy. \"A very positive approach is when the actual expertise of the business is actually helpful to the NGO \u2026 and also something that fits into a business's objective, because then it's not so whimsical\", he states.</p> <p>Don't go it alone. That's Keller's top-line message to companies. So he praises Standard Chartered, which won this year's Corporate Award at the Beyond Sport Awards, for its tie-up with <a href=\"http://www.netball.org/Netball.aspx?id=98\" title=\"\">global netball association IFNA</a>. Barclays' network of well-managed, grassroots partnerships in its <a href=\"http://group.barclays.com/about-barclays/citizenship/our-programmes/community-programmes/barclays-spaces-for-sports\" title=\"\">Spaces for Sport programme</a> is likewise commended.</p> <p>\"Good partnerships come in different shapes and sizes,\" Keller states. \"But what you don't want is a corporation trying to deliver on the ground. You want it to be working with a community partner that really understands its stuff.\"</p> <p>These kind of deeply rooted partnerships are particularly important when it comes to securing long-term developmental benefits from large-scale sporting events. This so-called <a href=\"http://www.sportanddev.org/en/newsnviews/highlighted_initiative/social_legacy_of_london_2012_olympics/index.cfm?uPage=3\" title=\"\">\"social legacy\"</a> is top-of-mind now the Olympics have passed. Tasked with taking forward the London 2012 vision to connect young people \"to the inspirational power of the Games\" is the government agency <a href=\"http://www.uksport.gov.uk\" title=\"\">UK Sport</a>. Its vehicle for doing so is the aptly named <a href=\"http://www.uksport.gov.uk/pages/international-inspiration/\" title=\"\">International Inspiration</a> programme.</p> <p>Rolled out in association with children's charity UNICEF and the British Council, the seven-year International Inspiration is running structured sports training programmes in 20 developing countries.</p> <p>Transforming \"a moment of inspiration\" such as the 2012 Games into \"real opportunity and lifelong participation\" won't just happen, insists Debbie Lye, director of international development at UK Sport. Keeping up the momentum requires \"meaningful investment\" in local sports facilities, community coaches and targeted taster courses, coupled with inclusive sport in every school.</p> <p>Businesses are well set up to help, says Lye, although persuading corporations to factor sport into their corporate responsibility and marketing budgets remains a struggle. \"Many will understandably put millions into elite sport and to commercial sport \u2026 but don't see the value in committing a fraction of that to mass participation sport development for young people.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <h2>Guardian Sustainable Business will be running a live discussion on the opportunities for partnerships between sporting and development organisations <strong>on Thursday 27 September, 2 - 4pm (BST)</strong>.<p>For more details please click <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/partnerships-sporting-development-organisations-live-discussion\">here</a>.</p><p>To register your interest in the discussion and to submit a question in advance, fill in your details below:</p></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dFhRTUMwZ29HaHZtLUxpakQyaE45S0E6MQ\"> <iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dFhRTUMwZ29HaHZtLUxpakQyaE45S0E6MQ\" width=\"460\" height=\"650\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading...</iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Government officials have been in Beijing this week with their Chinese counterparts for <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_103/pn12_103.aspx\" title=\"\">an \"unprecedented\" collaboration on energy</a>. On the table was new nuclear power, and its role in moving the UK to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>So far, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) has been relentlessly optimistic about new nuclear, and hopes that its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/22/government-announces-energy-reforms\" title=\"\">electricity market reform plans for a draft energy bill</a> will do the trick, despite strong and sustained criticism <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/concerns-uk-electricity-market-reforms\" title=\"\">from a parliamentary select committee on energy</a>, and more recently <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/policy-legislation/Energy%20Bill%202012/6149-lords-working-group-paper-on-the-draft-energy-bill.pdf\" title=\"\">a House of Lords working group who conclude</a> that the reforms are \"unworkable\". But Decc is still loyal to the nuclear project and hopes the financial support implied in these market reforms will attract foreign investment.</p> <p>France's state nuclear corporation EDF and their UK junior partner, Centrica, have been centre stage in this nuclear fiscal drama. Centrica appears increasingly lukewarm, and City insiders doubt whether it will maintain a 20% stake in the nuclear consortium. Centrica's potential departure could have something to do with the economics of nuclear power, with construction costs more than doubling from \u20ac3bn to over \u20ac6bn \u2013 and rising for each of the French-designed European pressurised reactors being built in Finland at Olkiluoto, and Flamanville in France.</p> <p>Separately, since Germany's RWE and E.ON in March <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy\" title=\"\">pulled out of the UK's second nuclear consortium, Horizon Nuclear Power</a>, two Chinese nuclear state corporations, China Guangdong Nuclear Power and State Nuclear Power Technology, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/20/china-uk-nuclear-power-plants\" title=\"\">are considering taking on the consortium</a>. Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear energy corporation, has also expressed an interest in the UK nuclear market.</p> <p>At this point, it's worth looking at the underlying business ethics of the Russian and Chinese nuclear industries, and questioning the wisdom of their strategic involvement in key UK energy infrastructure.</p> <p>Russia's Rosatom has recently built the hugely controversial nuclear power plant in Iran at Bushehr, and is ready to help Iran build another power generating unit there, despite reports that Iran has installed an underground uranium enrichment facility, potentially paving the way for nuclear weapons development.</p> <p>In Tibet, the Chinese nuclear industry is engaged in a determined effort to secure uranium deposits located in Amdo, where leaching and open pit extraction are reported to have resulted in significant environmental contamination. Regulation of safety oversight mechanisms is relatively weak in the Chinese nuclear industry, and according to a recent <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Nuclear Materials Security Index report</a>, China ranks 29th among the group of 32 nuclear nations in terms of nuclear security and materials transparency. Although it's to be hoped that greater corporate social responsibility and sensitivity to vulnerable industrial communities is evolving in both Russia and China, it's still troubling to reflect on their respective human rights situations, documented by Amnesty International.</p> <p>A more responsible way forward to this ethically questionable strategy can be found closer to home.</p> <p>Germany uses 20% of all European electricity, and its decision to go nuclear-free by 2020, meeting power and CO2 targets by investing in renewables and energy efficiency, grid network infrastructure, and planning for trans-boundary pumped storage hydroelectricity, with combined heat and power gas and some coal as interim measures, will prove significant for all European energy policy.</p> <p>Germany also views its non-nuclear energy policy as a driver of economic expansion. As Chancellor Angela Merkel says: \"We can achieve a transformation to efficient and renewable energy, with all the opportunities that brings for exports, developing new technologies and jobs.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Dorfman is the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.nuclearconsult.com/index.php\" title=\"\">Nuclear Consulting Group</a> and a nuclear policy researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.jrct.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust</a></p>",
  "<p>Mick Davis, the boss of mining group <strong>Xstrata</strong>, will have to wait at least another week to learn his fate.</p> <p>Xstrata's non-executive directors were due to decide whether to accept a \u00a356bn merger proposal from commodities trader <strong>Glencore</strong> by Monday. But shortly before the market closed yesterday the two sides said they had been granted an extension until 1 October \"to take full account of feedback from consultation with key Xstrata shareholders.\"</p> <p>Glencore was forced to raise the terms of its initial offer after investors, including the Qatari investment fund that owns more than 12% of Xstrata , argued the price being paid was too low. The terms of any new retention packages for key Xstrata staff - who stood to receive share awards of more than \u00a3240m - also need to be resolved. Xstrata chief executive Davis is due to leave after six months if the deal goes ahead, and the composition of any joint board is believed to be one of the issues under discussion.</p> <p>Xstrata lost 44p to \u00a310.05, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, as the uncertainty over its future continued. Glencore was down 6.15p at 362p.</p> <p>Other mining shares did better as metal prices moved higher, on hopes that recent measures from the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank would help boost global demand. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> rose 32p to \u00a310.86 while Russian steelmaker <strong>Evraz</strong> added 11.1p to 271.9p.</p> <p>Banks were also wanted on expectations of an economic recovery, with <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> up 7.3p at 275.8p and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> climbing 0.85p to 40.17p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> slipped 2.02 points to 5852.62, down more than 60 points on the week. The eurozone crisis continued to unsettle investors, with Spain widely expected to seek a bailout and Greece's fate still far from resolved.</p> <p>The market's decline came despite a renewed burst of takeover speculation across a number of sectors.</p> <p><strong>United Utilities</strong> was among the wave of rumoured bid targets, with traders suggesting possible interest from predators including Abu Dhabi funds, China Investment Corporation, Ontario Teachers' Pension Fund and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The company also issued a trading statement on Thursday which highlighted its attractions to any bidder, including steady earnings growth, but made no comment on the takeover rumours. Analysts said an approach for the water group could not be ruled out. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch said:</p> <blockquote> We believe a bid from a consortium seems more feasible than a bid from a single fund due to United Utilities' large size, and the names mentioned look plausible to us given infrastructure appetite. </blockquote> <p>Tina Cook at Charles Stanley said:</p> <blockquote> Overseas investors and infrastructure funds have been attracted to regulated utilities due to their stable and relatively low risk revenue streams, but there can be no guarantee that a formal bid will materialise. </blockquote> <p>United Utilities slipped 8p to 722p, having risen 39p over the week.</p> <p>There was also reheated bid talk around British Gas-owner <strong>Centrica</strong>, with Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and Russia's Gazprom both mentioned. In the event Centrica merely signed a three year gas supply deal with the UK arm of the Russian business. Centrica added 1.2p to 337.2p.</p> <p><strong>National Grid</strong> - itself the subject of vague bid rumours earlier in the month - fell 7.5p to 686.5p after JP Morgan Cazenove moved from neutral to underweight. The bank pointed to a tricky time ahead for the company:</p> <blockquote> Grid faces a potentially challenging six months with final regulatory decisions due for its UK regulated businesses (December), Rhode Island businesses (January) and upstate New York businesses (March). The early indications have not been positive with challenging preliminary announcements in all three jurisdictions. <br> </blockquote> <p>The company also faces seeing a reduction in profits due to revisions to an accounting rule, IAS 19:</p> <blockquote> These guidelines state that for profit and loss purposes the return assumed on pension assets must be the same as the discount rate on the liabilities. We estimate that the change in IAS 19 treatment will reduce Grid's pretax profit by around \u00a3220m. Although it does not change the economic value of the company, it may be unhelpful for sentiment. <br> [The accounting change] is the main driver of our 3.4% reduction in 2013/14 earnings per share. On our updated estimates, 2012/13 will represent the peak in Grid's earnings per share for the rest of the decade. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market mobile gaming group <strong>Probability</strong> added 0.5p to 76p on talk that <strong>William Hill</strong>, up 0.6p to 312p, could turn its attention back to the business, if it succeeds in its bid for <strong>Sportingbet</strong>, down 0.75p at 50.5p., William Hill made a move for Probability last year, but a deal fell through after opposition from its online joint venture partner Playtech. Analysts believe a revised deal, similar to the Sportingbet offer, could see it snap up Probability successfully if it takes a second tilt at the business.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Pearson</strong> put on 35p to \u00a312.17 after the publisher was upgraded by Exane BNP Paribas, which raised its target price by 21% to \u00a314.50 and its rating from neutral to outperform. It said:</p> <blockquote> We have turned more bullish on the growth opportunities at Pearson International Education, US School and on digital learning. We have raised our earnings per share by 5% 2013 estimates and 9% on 2014 estimates and now stand above consensus by 4% and 6%, respectively. Apart from increased earnings forecasts, our target price upgrade reflects more optimistic long-term assumptions on margins in digital and a revaluation of Pearson's emerging market education assets, which we now value separately. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> dropped 34p to \u00a323.65 on profit taking after Thursday's better than expected trading update.</p> <p><strong>Lonmin</strong> lost 16.5p to 594p ahead of an expected cash call of up to $1bn. The platinum producer's balance sheet will come under increasing strain after it agreed a wage deal after a bitter dispute in South Africa. The agreement at the Marikana mine followed six weeks of industrial action which has led to production stoppages and protest in which 45 people have died. It will add 14% to the company's wage bill from October, and Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> Following the Marikana agreement we downgrade our earnings [forecast] from $218mm to $95m in 2012 and from $195m to $29m in 2013. We believe Lonmin will struggle to ramp up to 750,000 ounces (its optimal capacity) in 2013, and we moderate our volume forecast to 660,000 ounces of platinum in 2013 (from 750,000 ounces). <br> On our new numbers Lonmin will likely breach covenants until 2014 under our base case price forecasts. While in 2009 the group managed to arrange a covenant waiver we think this time there is a genuine funding gap and as such a recapitalization (including equity) of Lonmin continues to be needed. On our base case (and spot) forecasts net debt will climb close to $700m by the end of 2013 (or in 12 months time).  A full recapitalization (replacement of debt) would need $1bn equity and this would arguably reset the company. A smaller $500m rights issue in our view would be enough to pay down some covenanted debt, but not enough to restart growth plans and would need to be complimented with a bond if growth was to be restarted. </blockquote> <p>Others continued to be hit by industrial action, including the platinum subsidiary of <strong>Anglo American</strong>, down 6p at 19.38.</p> <p><strong>Burberry</strong>, whose shares dropped sharply after a shock profit warning earlier this month, edged another 1p lower to \u00a310.36 despite Credit Suisse issuing a positive note on the luxury goods group. The bank said the longer term outlook was good, and put an outperform rating on the shares, although it cut its target price from \u00a316 to \u00a314.</p> <p>Drinks group <strong>Diageo</strong> added 2.5p to 1722.5p on reports it was in talks to buy a stake in Indian distiller United Spirits, three years after the failure of a similar move.</p> <p>Finally industrial group <strong>Tanfield</strong> dropped 44% to 28.75p after its US electric car associate Smith Electric Vehicles cancelled a proposed flotation on Nasdaq because it could not achieve an acceptable valuation.</p>",
  "<p>It is high time Britain left the ailing EU and its burdensome regulations and embraced trade with fast-growing emerging economies. That was the argument put forward by Nigel Farage at his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/21/ukip-conference-farage-speech-live-blog2?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">keynote speech</a> this morning at the Ukip conference. It's an argument that also chimes with a growing body of opinion about the EU's diminishing importance for British trade, with <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2201876/UKs-non-EU-exports-surges-time-high-firms-sell-13-2billion-goods-nations-Europe-month.html\" title=\"\">recent trading statistics</a> showing that Britain's non-EU exports have risen to their highest levels since records began in 1998 while exports to the beleaguered eurozone continue to fall. However, the idea that Britain's economic prospects would actually improve were it to leave the EU is deeply misguided.</p> <p>Significantly, the EU remains the favoured export destination for the small and medium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of the British economy, and which are essential for an export-led recovery and a move away from Britain's over-reliance on the financial sector. A <a href=\"http://www.fsb.org.uk/policy/assets/fsb_exporting_web.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> by the Federation of Small Businesses found that 87% of its members export to the European Economic Area, compared to less than 13% exporting to each of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC\" title=\"\">Bric</a> economies. Meanwhile the British Chambers of Commerce's <a href=\"http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/press-office/press-releases/smaller-firms-need-more-support-to-trade-with-high-growth-markets,-says-bcc.html\" title=\"\">annual survey</a> found that it is overwhelmingly large firms who are expanding trade with major emerging markets, while smaller businesses see the EU as providing the best opportunities for export growth.</p> <p>This is because most small firms lack the financial and human resources required to overcome the many challenges presented by emerging markets: language barriers, foreign legal systems, high tariffs and intellectual property theft. More fundamentally, low transport costs and rapid, visa-free travel make exporting to Europe far more manageable. A business employing fewer than 10 people can't afford to send an employee out to China for a week to meet potential partners, let alone come to grips with the Chinese bureaucracy and legal system. Exporting to the Brics therefore remains largely an elite affair, available only to those truly global firms who can afford the necessary armies of lawyers, accountants and translators.</p> <p>While small firms have made some inroads into emerging markets, notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/aug/28/india-exporting-small-business\" title=\"\">in India</a>, they have tended to remain reliant on government assistance or costly intermediaries. The EU thus remains vital as an affordable and hassle-free export destination.</p> <p>Undeniably, we are seeing a profound restructuring of the global economy, and as the relative importance of Europe diminishes it is natural that British firms will increasingly seek to exploit new opportunities in emerging markets such as the Brics.</p> <p>Importantly though, the EU can often act as a stepping stone for smaller firms, allowing them to expand the scale of their business in a secure and open environment before attempting to enter more difficult markets. The single market also allows firms to easily forge links with businesses on the continent, which can then be used as a springboard to open up new prospects elsewhere. For example, <a href=\"http://www.aidanstradling.co.uk/workareas.htm\" title=\"\">one small consultancy firm I spoke to</a> has helped micro businesses from the north-east of England pair up with their counterparts in Poland and Lithuania to then penetrate the Russian market. Similar opportunities abound, for example through the close trading relations between Spain and Mexico or Portugal and Brazil, and the <a href=\"http://www.kooperation-international.de/fileadmin/public/cluster/Xuzhou/GermanBusinessStudy.pdf\" title=\"\">significant expansion</a> of small German firms into China. By forging partnerships with European businesses and learning from their successes, British firms will be better placed to overcome existing barriers and expand into emerging markets. Instead of perceiving there to be a stark choice between trading with the EU or with the rest of the world, we should be seeing Europe as complementary to our <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/9502325/Britain-can-still-profit-from-global-trade-while-remaining-in-the-EU.html\" title=\"\">global trading strategy</a>.</p> <p>Tariff barriers remain one of the biggest concerns for small businesses, meaning the negotiation of free trade agreements is one of the most important opportunities for future growth. The EU already has free trade agreements in place with 45 countries, including a new deal signed with South Korea in March which will bring an estimated <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17508360\" title=\"\">\u00a3500m a year</a> to the British economy. Further trade agreements are currently being negotiated with India and Canada, with potential trade deals with the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/uk-eu-us-trade-idUKBRE85J1FY20120620\" title=\"\">US</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/18/us-eu-trade-japan-idUSBRE86H0HD20120718\" title=\"\">Japan</a> in the pipeline. If the UK left the EU, we would have to start negotiating these trade deals from scratch. Moreover, without the weight of the world's largest common market of 500 million wealthy consumers behind us, we would end up with far less favourable terms when negotiating with the world's economic superpowers.</p> <p>There are many other benefits accrued to small businesses from EU membership, including access to credit from the European Investment Bank, as well as <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/foi_eumembership_fdi.pdf\" title=\"\">foreign investments</a> which are often motivated by the UK's proximity and access to the single market. Indeed, some studies estimate foreign direct investment into the UK could <a href=\"http://www.moneyweek.com/news-and-charts/economics/uk/should-britain-pull-out-of-the-eu-55616\" title=\"\">fall by over a third</a> if it leaves the EU.</p> <p>On the one major aspect of EU membership which is a significant burden on small businesses, cumbersome EU regulations and red tape, there has been some <a href=\"http://www.enforbusiness.com/news/eu-red-tape-reprieve-small-business-20115961\" title=\"\">much-needed progress</a>, and there are <a href=\"http://www.neurope.eu/article/meps-want-less-red-tape-small-businesses\" title=\"\">further plans</a> to exempt small businesses from all EU regulations unless they can be proven beneficial. There are also significant benefits to be gained for small firms from plans boost e-commerce in services by expanding the single market to <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/innovation-enterprise/european-smes-need-digital-singl-analysis-512320\" title=\"\">digital sector</a>.</p> <p>So despite the ongoing problems in the eurozone, Britain's future prosperity continues to be inextricably linked to our trading relationship with Europe. Tellingly, a recent <a href=\"http://www.enterpriseeuropeeast.org.uk/eox/news/index.asp?newsid=510\" title=\"\">poll</a> found that while largely opposing further political integration, almost 90% of UK businesses continue to support EU membership. As conference season begins and an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/ukip-tory-deal-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">eventual referendum</a> on EU membership draws ever closer, it is these pragmatic businesses we should be listening to, not the irrational voice of Ukip.</p>",
  "<p>This week we've set ourselves the challenge (along with most of the developers here at the Guardian) of undertaking <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun\">Functional Programming Principles in Scala</a>. <a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/\">Scala</a> is the main programming language that we use at the Guardian, and through studying this course we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the language, learn new features and improve our programming style. The course is devised and delivered by Scala's creator, <a href=\"http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/\">Martin Odersky</a> and we're excited by the insights he's sure to reveal.</p> <p>One of the first things that jumped out at us is how well-organised the course is. A common complaint of Scala is that it can be quite complicated to get the tools up and running before you are ready to begin writing code. Upon entering the portal for the course, however, we found ourselves presented with well laid-out instructions for getting started on each of the major operating systems. Concise written instructions as well as detailed screencasts are available to take you through setting up a working development environment that includes the language, the build tool and an IDE. On top of that, pre-configured downloads of these tools are available if you don't want to get your hands dirty configuring the required plugins manually. For a programmer setting out to learn Scala for the first time, these details mean the course has perhaps already been a worthwhile endeavour, even before the lectures and assignments have started.</p> <p>We're into the first week now so we've seen the format for the course. Every week, Odersky releases a set of video lectures and perhaps some accompanying reading material that you can consume at your own pace. When you feel ready, there's a homework assignment comprised of a few programming exercises that put into practice the theories and techniques learnt during the week. So far the assignments have been fun and we're already looking forward to having some more problems to tackle next week. </p> <p>The bulk of the course is the video lectures, which are given clearly and concisely and interspersed very neatly with small optional questions and exercises. Given his rich background in computing, Odersky has a lot of knowledge to share and one of the wonderful things about this course is to be given the opportunity to benefit from his teaching. It's only the first week and we've already learnt some new concepts. Once the course progresses and the content gets more advanced, we'll certainly have broadened our programming skills.</p> <p>One of the most interesting features of the course design is the assignment submission process, using <a href=\"http://www.scala-sbt.org/\">SBT</a>. The tools come with an SBT plugin which will, with a single command, send your code to their servers where a few minutes later your work gets automatically graded, according to your code's style and functionality. Your assignments page shows a log of all your submissions with a score and feedback, including a useful stack trace of any errors. While such a tool is obviously required for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odersky/status/248768435599863808\">such a popular course</a>, the flawless implementation delights in its simplicity and makes submitting the assignments a real pleasure.</p> <p>While it's great that everything is so well set-up to make it easy for beginners to get started, this does mean the downloadable projects come in a slightly non-standard layout. Because we already use Scala here in our day-to-day work we found integrating the projects with our own toolchain (in particular, <a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">IntelliJ</a>) a bit tricky. After a bit of tinkering we've made it work, so if like us, you'd rather use IntelliJ to work on the project, then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2012/sep/21/funtional-programming-principles-scala-setting-up-intellij\">check out our blog post that takes you through the configuration</a>.</p> <p>Now that we're up and running with IntelliJ, we're looking forward to getting stuck into Scala. Looking ahead at the syllabus, the next few weeks will involve reasoning about functions and immutable objects, core data structures in Scala and utilising functional techniques such as pattern matching. We might not be leaving our computers for a while...</p>",

It is a competitive field as to when this event happened but the pointless, unnecessary dismemberment of the 115-year-old UK record company has to be in the dismal top 10. The world's most concentrated media market, with four players, is reduced to three.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/21/universal-emi-takeover-approved\">Friday's approval by the European Commission</a> means EMI will broken up into at least three. The Motown and other song catalogues had already been sold to a consortium led by Sony. Now Universal Music, the global market leader in recordings, is being allowed to buy most of EMI's record labels \u2013 with Brussels insisting on the sale of the Parlophone label and EMI's half of Now! That's What I Call Music.</p> <p>How needless. Overambition got to Guy Hands, who showed that music and private equity don't go together, injecting the business with too much debt against a backdrop of endemic piracy. Citigroup snatched the keys, and insisted on a unnecessary sale process, when the bank could have demerged instead. European regulators failed by allowing Citigroup's break-up plan to go through \u2013 thinking it reasonable to allow Universal to increase its global market share from 29% to about 36%. Sony is next at 22%.</p> <p>Had EMI been a chocolate-maker there might at least have been some concern about a break-up and takeover. But because it operates in the music industry \u2013 one of the few areas where Britain leads the world \u2013 nobody in Westminster cares. Neither the Conservatives nor Labour raised any concern. </p> <p>The result? Most likely, less choice for aspiring artists. Digital music startups acting in thrall to a handful of companies. Fewer records likely to be released. EMI falls, a victim of capitalism unconstrained. There can be no coda to that.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cityoffilm.co.uk/\">vigorous campaign</a> to save Bradford's historic Odeon cinema is gaining extra muscle, after winning a reprieve from the threat of imminent demolition. </p> <p>The 1930s Art Deco building with its iconic towers is located in the centre of Bradford. To its detractors, it might be an eyesore just aching to be pulled down, but it means much more than that to thousands of Bradfordians who have, over the last decade, backed the campaign to save the former cinema. In fact, the future of the Bradford Odeon is one of the most emotive issues in the city today. Not only does it symbolise local <a href=\"http://www.cityoffilm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Odeon-Exhibition-Poster.pdf\">heritage and pride</a>, it has also come to represent the value of local democracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396498195\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348241709186/Odeon.jpg\" alt=\"Bradford Odeon\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stately pleasure domes: the Odeon with the Alhambra beyond. Photograph: Wikipedia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The historic building was known as the New Victoria when it first opened in the 1930s as one of the largest cinemas in the country, with an auditorium boasting some 3,000 seats (the Bradford <a href=\"http://www.bradford-theatres.co.uk/alhambra/\">Alhambra Theatre</a> next door, another fine Bradford monument, seats just under 1,500). There was also a ballroom as well as a fancy restaurant. Known as the Gaumont during the 1950s, the building attracted the biggest names of its day to perform there - The Beatles, The Rolling Stores and Buddy Holly. A refit during the 1960s sadly obscured many of the original features and divided the large auditorium into several smaller screens, to maximise returns. </p> <p>The Bradford Odeon finally closed in the 1990s, at the same time as the Leeds Odeon on The Headrow, when a suburban multiplex was launched at Thornbury on the site of the old English Electric works, halfway between Leeds and Bradford. While the Leeds Odeon now houses large retail outlets, the Bradford one has remained vacant, with the original fa\u00e7ade virtually untouched ever since. </p> <p>It was the threat of demolition which sparked a fierce battle, now a decade long, to save the building for possible renovation, attracting high profile support from such luminaries as Bradford born artist, David Hockney, who describes the Odeon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>a splendid building that could be used for many imaginative things. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396498196\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/17/1326814910334/David-Hockney-002.jpg\" alt=\"David Hockney\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Famous Bradfordian and Odeon fan.

The Bradford Odeon is one of the UK's last remaining super-cinemas of the 1930s.</p> <p>The building is currently owned by the Government's <a href=\"http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/\">Homes and Communities Agency (HCA)</a>, a non-departmental body tasked with funding new affordable housing in England. The agency inherited the building from Yorkshire Forward after the latter was abolished last year. Along with the building, the HCA also inherited the <a href=\"http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/bradford-odeon\">legally binding agreement </a>which the former regional development agency Yorkshire Forward had already made with <a href=\"http://www.langtreegroupplc.co.uk/\">Langtree</a>, who planned to develop the site.</p> <p>They intended to dispose of the Odeon to make room for a development called New Victoria Place, made up of offices and flats as well as a hotel. But campaigners yesterday breathed a sigh of relief after the HCA terminated its agreement with Langtree, citing a breach in the terms after the developer requested more time than the binding paperwork allowed, in order to verify its plans, finance and tenants. </p> <p>So why do Bradfordians want to save a disused building that even the local authority appears to have written off? As a quick drive through the city centre confirms, there are at least four hotels just a stone's throw from the Odeon site, with a fifth recently built directly opposite. There are also ample offices and city centre apartments lying vacant to conclude that building any more would be foolhardy. </p> <p>More importantly, campaigners believe that the building has great architectural merit and huge capacity for regeneration. Moreover, they allege that the council has purposefully concealed the Odeon's development potential because it has a vested financial interest in the building's demolition. So much so that campaigners even gained access to the sealed site to post photographic evidence on YouTube, in order to confirm that the original features of the lavishly decorated interior are intact. Furthermore, there are doubts about the timing of the building being earmarked for demolition and an unconvincing consultation exercise. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IChubdFQqIc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IChubdFQqIc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Here is the YouTube clip made by <a href=\"http://www.bradfordodeonrescuegroup.co.uk/\">Bradford Odeon Rescue Group </a>showing features intact inside the neglected building.</p> <p>The state of other parts of Bradford city centre have also earned the council a reputation for being uncertain in its handling of regeneration. Bradford has suffered a clutch of failed projects, the most prominent of which has been the proposed Westfield Shopping Centre. With planning permission granted and the old buildings flattened, developers backed out of the agreement because of the effects on investment of the recession. Ten years on, with few efforts made to make the site useable, Bradfordians continue to live with a \"hole at the heart\", known mockingly as 'Wastefield'.</p> <p>It is this level of mistrust which has helped to maintain the thriving ten year campaign to save the abandoned cinema, and in the process take a stand against a leadership which is deemed to be needlessly obstructive and unsympathetic. Perhaps that's the underlying reason that Bradford cares so much about a derelict cinema \u2013 because it has also become a matter of principle. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396498197\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/27/1346098055395/George-Galloway-004.jpg\" alt=\"George Galloway\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He was on to it like a shot.

One idea recently mooted was to renovate the former cinema into a <a href=\"http://www.johnpeelnorth.org/\">flagship music venue</a> and arts space dedicated to the former Radio 1 DJ, John Peel. The proposed scheme is inspired by the successful John Peel Centre for Creative Arts in Stowmarket which not only acts as a hub for the community but also attracts quality performers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396498198\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/5/18/1274202740770/John-Peel-001.jpg\" alt=\"John Peel\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Peel; a great man to honour.

He also had strong links with Bradford, and was an honorary graduate of the city's university.

It has begun to attract people back into the centre and to become a focal point. When the Alhambra Theatre had a photocall for this year's panto, Cinderella, they brought Cinders in her glass carriage along with her ugly sisters down to City Park.

  "<p>Record queues outside Apple stores in nine countries on Friday suggest the iPhone 5 will be a blockbuster. The new model will be available in 100 countries by the end of the year, in what the company is calling \"the fastest phone rollout ever\". But the tills are ringing not only in Apple's sleek glass and steel retail spaces but at the many smaller businesses in its long supply chain.</p> <p>A successful iPhone 5 will send ripples around the world, from the vast production lines of Foxconn's Chinese assembly plants to the Texan chip foundries owned by Samsung, an arch rival but also a major supplier. Apple's 2011 list names some 150 companies with which it spends money on materials, manufacturing and assembly, but there are many more who profit, such as those that licence their intellectual property.</p> <p>The fortunes of five UK companies are known to be closely tied to Apple's. Of these only Volex and Laird Technologies feature on the supplier list, but chip designers ARM Holdings and Imagination Technologies, and semiconductor wafer maker IQE have profited indirectly, and handsomely.</p> <p>\"If you have exposure to Apple you are doing really well, if you don't it's more challenging,\" says Numis technology analyst Nick James. \"ARM and Imagination have been standout stocks and that is at least partly driven by their exposure to Apple globally.\"</p> <h2>ARM Holdings</h2> <p>ARM designs but does not make computer chips. Originally created as a division of Acorn Computers in Cambridge, it owes its very existence as a standalone business to Apple. In the late 1980s, Steve Jobs started working with Acorn on chip designs for the Newton, a tablet computer resembling today's more basic e-readers that was a little ahead of its time.</p> <p>The work was so important that ARM was spun out of Acorn, with Apple taking a stake \u2013 although it sold its shares in the 1990s when the Cupertino firm was facing bankruptcy. Today its designs, popular because of their power efficiency, are in use in 90% of smartphones and 28% of all electronic devices, from car-part sensors to digital cameras.</p> <p>Companies using ARM's chip architecture pay a licence fee, and a small royalty on each chip or wafer. The iPhone 5 is likely to contain several, including the A6 processor which speeds up functions such as loading apps and web pages.</p> <p>Analysts estimate around 10% of ARM's \u00a3490m-a-year revenues come from Apple products.</p> <h2>Imagination Technologies</h2> <p>This Hertfordshire-based company was founded in 1985 and designs 2D and 3D graphics, video and audio technologies. Like ARM, its blueprints are licensed to semiconductor manufacturers. As a sideline, it also manufactures the Pure range of digital radios.</p> <p>Apple owns a near 9% stake, while chipmaker Intel holds nearly 15%.</p> <p>Headed by Iranian-born Hossein Yassaie since 1998, Imagination's designs are to be found in games consoles, cameras, radios and set-top boxes, as well as the latest iPads and the iPhone 5. Analyst Eoin Lambe at broker Liberum Capital estimates 30% of Imagination's \u00a3128m annual revenues are attributable to Apple products.</p> <p>The business shipped designs on 325m chips during the last financial year, and has set itself a target of 1bn a year by 2016. But its share price has fallen in recent days.</p> <p>\"While Apple is a fantastic customer to have, Imagination need to diversify,\" says Lambe.</p> <h2>Laird Technologies</h2> <p>Established as a Liverpool ironworks in 1824, Laird built the first iron ship for the British government. Today it makes the metal casings that protect the internal workings of mobile phones from heat and from electromagnetic interference from other phones.</p> <p>Laird built ships and trains until it moved into computer components in the 1980s. Today it employs 9,000 people, has revenues of \u00a3590m a year and has headquarters in London. Its two main business lines are mobile phone antennas \u2013 Nokia was a major customer \u2013 and electromagnetic shields.</p> <p>Its customers include Cisco, Dell and Chrysler, but the largest is Apple. According to Espirito Santo bank, Apple accounted for 16% of first-half revenues, with half of that coming from the iPhone.</p> <h2>IQE</h2> <p>With its headquarters in Cardiff, IQE uses nanotechnology to create chip wafers \u2013 some of which can consist of up to 300 individual layers, each as little as two atoms thick. These layers contain semiconductor materials such as aluminium, arsenic and gallium, arranged in perfect crystal lattices. Their precise construction is used for chips that need to operate at high speed on low power. These chips are found in 3G and 4G internet phones, helping to run the radios that communicate with the base stations, at speeds that can switch on and off several thousands of million times a second.</p> <p>IQE, which listed in London in 1999, reported revenues of \u00a375m in 2011. Espirito Santo bank says 75% of its revenues are from its phones division, but because it also supplies chip makers like TriQuint Semiconductor and Skyworks Solutions \u2013 who in turn supply Apple and other companies \u2013 its dependence on iPhone sales is difficult to estimate.</p> <h2>Volex</h2> <p>Designing power cables and USB leads for Apple's laptops, iPhones and iPads has cost Volex dearly this year. The 120-year-old London-based company, in which billionaire financier Nathaniel Rothschild owns a 24% stake, racked up \u00a33m in costs redesigning its products after Apple decided to do its bit for the environment with a move towards halogen-free power cables, which are less toxic when disposed of.</p> <p>Then Apple announced the iPhone 5 would have a smaller connector, and days later Volex issued a profit warning which sent its shares to their lowest point for four years.</p> <p>Broker Charles Stanley estimates around 30% of Volex's \u00a3320m annual revenues come from Apple, its largest customer.</p>",
  "<p>The battle is on for France's opposition party to find a successor to Nicolas Sarkozy to unite the divided right and return it to power.</p> <p>The centre-right UMP party is looking for a charismatic leader who can rally support after losing its 17-year hold on the presidency to Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in May.</p> <p>Several former ministers had suggested they would stand as party general secretary, but after weeks of speculation the field was reduced to just two when the deadline for nominations closed last week.</p> <p>Now the former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, 58, and his younger rival Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, 48, the current party chief, will go head to head for the job.</p> <p>The two men claim to be natural successors to Sarkozy, with whom both had an uneasy, at times hostile, relationship in recent years.</p> <p>Fillon, a discreet and serious character whose wife is Welsh, is seen as an experienced, safe pair of hands. He was appointed PM in 2007 after helping Sarkozy win his presidential election bid.</p> <p>Defying frequent reports that he was to be replaced in a reshuffle, Fillon remained at Matignon (the prime minister's official residence) throughout Sarkozy's five-year term in office.</p> <p>Cop\u00e9, once sidelined by Sarkozy as a potential rival, was brought back to his inner circle as head of the UMP in 2010. Unashamedly ambitious and seen as more charismatic and hyperactive than his rival, he is presenting himself as Sarkozy Mark II, telling supporters he will \"walk in the footsteps\" of the former president.</p> <p>\"France needs someone who is going to jump in and get their hands dirty,\" he said recently. He added he would step down if Sarkozy decided to return to mainline politics.</p> <p>Fillon said he too would remain close to Sarkozy: \"I cannot imagine leading the party he helped to develop without his support,\" Fillon told the daily Le Parisien.</p> <p>In a swipe at Cop\u00e9 he added: \"The truth is that Sarkozyism is a bit like love; there are those who speak a lot about it because they have reason to do so. Their love is fairly recent, while there are others who over the years can prove their love.\"</p> <p>Both are keen to play up links to Sarkozy after an opinion poll by LH2 published on Tuesday found that 43% of rightwing voters think Sarkozy would have the best chance of regaining the presidency for the UMP party in 2017, ahead of Fillon, with 32%, and Cope, with 21%.</p> <p>However, polls give Fillon a considerable lead over Cop\u00e9, which the younger candidate will hope to close in the coming weeks.</p> <p>In policy terms, less divides Fillon and Cop\u00e9, who have similar views on economics and Europe. Both support tighter budget discipline and reforms to lower employment charges.</p> <p>Last week, there was a brief spat between both camps over the number of supporters each had among card-carrying UMP members.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Cop\u00e9 announced with great fanfare that he had amassed 30,000 signatures. Within hours the Fillon camp responded by announcing its candidate had at least 45,000. A member of Cop\u00e9's team said the news had fallen on the candidate like \"a thump on the head\".</p> <p>The only woman who had been seriously in the running, former environment minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, who was Sarkozy's spokesperson during his election campaign,was in third position but stood down at the last minute.</p> <p>\"Many of our supporters were hoping for a third way so the election didn't end up being a duel between Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9 and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon,\" she told French journalists. \"It's not necessarily such a good image for our party,\" she added.</p> <p>NKM, as she is known, refused to say who she would support.</p> <p>The candidates will officially begin their campaigns on 5 October and party members will vote on a new leader on 18 November.</p> <p>Cop\u00e9 will publish his campaign programme on 3 October, entitled Manifesto for an Uninhibited Right. \"Those who read it will see what I have in my heart,\" he said, adding that it contained some \"suggestions to shock\".</p> <p>The highlight of the campaign will be a televised debate. Cop\u00e9 has welcomed the chance to go face-to-face live with his rival, but Fillon's camp has been more cautious.</p> <p>\"A debate in the same political family is always a little complicated,\" said Fillon's campaign director Eric Ciotti.</p>",
  "<p>Is it possible to fall in love with a brand? \"Not when you're 60-odd,\" Gerard told me. \"Maybe when you're young.\" He needed an iPhone 5 because he'd just bought an Audi A6 and they're only compatible with a phone that has a milled aluminium finish. It seemed so laden with cultural significance, that sentence, that I thought it might be a joke, but apparently it's true. He is not your typical iPhone 5 early-adopter.</p> <p>Outside Apple's flagship store on Regent Street in London, a snake of young men (plus two or three young women) stretched right back to the poky patch of grass on Hanover Square. I met nobody who'd been there longer than 14 hours, but nobody who'd had any sleep, either. Knackered, pink-eyed, and mildly hysterical, they were brandishing their little cards \u2013 strictly two per customer \u2013 each of which, plus a fistful of cash, entitled the bearer to one iPhone&#xa0;5 once they got inside the building.</p> <p>Kaiser, 34, was going to get a 64GB model in black. It would cost him \u00a3699. \"I'm a real Apple fanboy,\" he said. \"Last time they brought out a new phone, I had a man from my office queue for me. But queuing overnight for a new phone is on my bucket list. I don't want to offend anyone here, but Apple would be my church. This is my Sunday worship.\"</p> <p>Everybody in the queue was buying a phone for themselves, and nobody was buying one for anybody else. When you asked them who the other ticket was for (they all had two), they unfailingly said \"my dad\". But there was something under the surface, some anxiety that if your bid was found to be inauthentic, you'd be shoved out of the queue with nothing. Mohsin, 22, half-shouted, \"Yes it's for me! Why wouldn't it be for me?\" Who's the other one for? \"One's for me, one for my dad. It is my dream to buy it, I must buy it.\" It's true that everybody was very tired.</p> <p>Nasir, Imran and Feraz had arrived together; their friend Shahid, through some accident that I never comprehended, had managed to get ousted from the queue and was left standing beside it, his tickets confiscated, his face childlike with sorrow. He kept shuffling along, next to his in-queue friends: it was better to exist in a limbo, where you were at least parallel to an iPhone purchasing opportunity, than to go home. Feraz was quite lively, and saying philosophical things such as \"what's the point of having a new thing, if you don't have it on the first day?\"</p> <p>Nasir had a more analytical bent, and explained: \"The big thing is that they didn't launch them in [south] Asia; they just launched in the UK and Hong Kong. So in Asia they'll be around \u00a3600.\"</p> <p>\"But they're \u00a3529 here.\"</p> <p>\"That's still \u00a370, if you have seven or eight phones\u2026\" He tailed off, with an expression that said, \"Of course, this is entirely hypothetical.\"</p> <p>If they're not all buying for themselves, it's possible that they are young entrepreneurs with good global contacts, trying to make \u00a3500 between them. What I find a bit depressing is the other rumour \u2013 everybody is just being paid to queue for somebody else. Nobody owned up to this, though plenty of people denied it, affronted. It sounds like fun, this queueing experience (more fun in New York, apparently, where they were giving out Starbucks coffee, in some kind of corporate megalith mash-up).</p> <p>But it's a bit Victorian, when some people have so much more money than others that they get grown men to stand all night in line for some piece of tat that is basically the same as the thing they've already got and could buy for themselves, online, if only they were prepared to defer this modest gratification for a short amount of time.</p> <p>Blethering on about equality, of course, ends up with having to move to France (where, to coincide with the launch, the Apple store workers went on strike. You have to hand it to the French).</p> <p>Waseem, 36, had arrived at 9pm the night before, and like many people, was annoyed at the poor queue management (there appears to have been some situation in the middle of the night where, unsupervised, the queue etiquette broke down and a load of people pushed in). With the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdIWKytq_q4\" title=\"\">Jimmy Kimmel video</a> fresh in my head (he shows people a \"new iPhone 5\", which is actually an old iPhone 4, and they all go, \"ooh, it's so much lighter! And faster! And I think the screen is larger\"), I ask Waseem what he thinks will be so good about this phone. \"It' a new phone, that's what's so good about it.\" (Thinks for a second.) \"Hopefully it will have some new features.\"</p> <p>If they're all on the level, and they're all buying for themselves, then they're all mad, is what I concluded, crossing the road. And I ended up in Banana Republic, buying a pair of jeans that were almost identical to the ones I was wearing, as if in a trance.</p>",

The group then split into units of de-nailers, sanders, frame builders, and painters and got to work.</p> <p>The young people visit the skip garden every Thursday morning as part of their Business and Sustainability BTEC which provides them with training in how to run a business \u2013 from marketing skills to interacting with companies and partners. Guardian News and Media (GNM) helps fund the course and staff volunteer to deliver some of the lessons at the Guardian.</p> <p>The employees getting their hands dirty on Thursday were from departments across GNM from marketing and commercial personnel, to front-of-house receptionists, developers, and journalists from the newsroom.</p> <p>Lisa, 14, a student at Regent High School, said it was a great experience: \"We were able to stand at the entrance and welcome in the Guardian employees. It gives you more confidence and people are really nice. I like the practical side of things.\" she said.</p> <p>Jess Morton, who works in marketing, and was busy sanding wood, said: \"It's much more physically active than my daily job which is mainly siting at a computer - I feel way more awake. I think the young people interact more outside of the classroom \u2013 you're more up and about and moving.\"</p> <p>Many of the workers were enjoying the fresh air and outdoorsy feel of being on site \u2013 topped off by a delicious curry lunch provided by the kitchen staff. But this wasn't just about sharing skills and gaining a refreshing new perspective on life from the young people. The project is also part of a wider aim to make sure local families are part of the regeneration of King's Cross and surrounding companies contribute to the sustainability of projects in the area around the station \u2013 a development which has another 10 years before completion.</p> <p>\"The main aim of Global Generation is to connect young people and adults to the natural world,\" said Global Generation's youth worker Nicole Van den Eijnde.</p> <p>\"But it's also about opening people's world view up \u2013 especially young people \u2013 they get experiences they wouldn't normally get \u2013 and relationships start where opportunities arise. The garden, and nature and carpentry are really just excuses for bringing people together.</p> <p>\"We want to build a community alongside the building work at King's Cross. A lot of the young people here live locally and would be at risk of not benefiting fully from the changes on site.\"</p> <p>The urban skip garden, around which the group was working, came from the countryside in Wiltshire and is a fully moveable feast of French Breakfast radishes, mint and basil, lettuces, tomatoes and chive plants \u2013 it moved from a previous base nearer to St Pancras Station one year ago and will be situated in its current location for the next three years. Food and produce from the skip garden is sold on by the BTEC students to restaurants such as the Rotunda in Kings Place and food waste goes to the wormeries.</p> <p>Global Generation is also setting up longer term projects in permanent venues such as a harvest of bees on the roof tops of nearby Central Saint Martins (a development from the <a href=\"http://globalgeneration.org.uk/honey-club\">Honey Club</a> which exists already) alongside the continual reworking of disused parts from the construction site, kitchen produce and garden which are keeping a building site in the centre of King's Cross alive.</p> <p>By the end of the day the group made 12 blackboard frames and four shelves, so a good day's work.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.15am: Today it's the Ukip annual conference and I was up early to get on a train to Birmingham. I've never been to a Ukip conference before. In fact, only a few years ago, any half-decent political correspondent volunteering to attend would have been dismissed by colleagues as an eccentric. That was in the era (2006) <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4875026.stm\">when David Cameron dismissed them as \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly\". </a>Now they are still a minor party and they don't have any MPs. But they came second in the European elections in 2009, they are level-pegging with the Lib Dems in the polls and they exercise a potent influence on Conservative party politics. Anyone interested in the British political scene would be foolish to ignore them.</p> <p>My colleague Martin Kettle explored this in detail <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/ukip-force-shape-2015-election\">in his Guardian column yesterday.</a> He argued that, as the 2015 election approaches, there are two key reasons why Ukip matters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first is the Ukip factor itself. From 2009's 16.5% in the Europeans, Ukip slumped to 3.1% in the 2010 general election. A disastrous fall? Undoubtedly. The party crumpled.<br>But that 3.1% \u2013 still nearly a million votes \u2013 may have made some of the difference between a hung parliament and an outright Tory win. Small though it was, the Ukip vote exceeded the majority in 21 marginals the Tories failed to win in 2010, including Ed Balls's seat in West Yorkshire. If Ukip does as so many expect, and fares even better in the 2014 Europeans than in 2009, the Tory fear of a palpable Ukip effect in the 2015 general election will be even greater than before, even if Ukip's vote tanks again as it did in 2010. Any Conservative with a majority of 1,500 votes or fewer may be at risk.</p> <p>The second reason why Ukip success matters is because of Britain's place in post-eurozone crisis Europe. The competition between the parties on whether to promise an EU referendum \u2013 and, crucially, what question it would ask \u2013 is already intense behind the scenes. Every Ukip success is likely to push that competition further towards an in-out referendum pledge. Even if that does not come about \u2013 and a referendum on a less cut-and-dried choice of the sort that is apparently preferred by David Cameron would certainly cause problems for Ukip \u2013 the momentum of the whole process is towards increased UK marginalisation within whatever remains of the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the Ukip conference in the Birmingham town hall today, the highlight will be the speech by Nigel Farage, Ukip's leader. Farage was on the Today programme at 8.10 this morning talking the possibility of a doing some kind of deal with the Conservatives before the next general election. I'll write a full post about his comments soon. He will be speaking at 11.45am.</p> <p>But I will also be writing about the rest of the conference too. It opens at 9.45am and the full agenda is <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/page/conference-schedule\">here.</a> Ukip has in the past been vulnerable to charge that it's a one-man band, the Farage party, an outfit whose success is largely dependent on the efforts of one accomplished campaigner in a pin-striped suit. Today I want to see what the rest of them look like close up too.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@Andrew Sparrow.</a> I won't be updating this blog quite as regularly as I normally do when I'm writing my daily Politics Live, but there should be updates at least every hour.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>9.28am: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> has been talking this morning about the possibility of Ukip doing some kind of deal with the Conservatives before the general election. His message has not been entirely clear.</p> <p>At Euston this morning I picked up a copy of the Daily Express. It's not normally the first paper I turn to in the morning, but it has become the Ukip house journal and, sure enough, there on page two was <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/347306/Ukip-leader-offers-a-poll-pact-with-Tories\">a story about the speech Farage will give today.</a> Here's how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UKIP leader Nigel Farage will today make a dramatic offer to David Cameron to form a pact with the Tories at the next General Election.</p> <p>He will use his keynote speech at Ukip's annual conference to raise the prospect of an alliance at the polls.</p> <p>But he will demand in return the promise of an in-or-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>But then, when Farage was asked about this in his interview on the Today programme, this is how he started his reply.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>I haven't offered a deal at all. What has happened here is in Tory circles they fear that the Lib Dems will move to the Left and will head towards Labour, leaving the Conservative party very exposed. They look at Ukip at 10% in the polls and they say 'we've got to do a deal with Ukip'.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage then went on the clarify his position, in a way that stands up the Express story. I've taken the quote from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm responding to many voices within the Conservative party, and what I've said is we're a different party with a different manifesto, but if we were offered a deal that made it easier to push open a door marked 'independence for the United Kingdom' of course we'd consider it.</p> <p>But I wouldn't even contemplate doing a deal, even if it gave the party an advantage, unless we first had, written in blood I think, an absolute promise that we would have a proper referendum on our relationship with the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Macer Hall says in his Express story, there are some Tories who want their party to form some kind of non-aggression pact with Ukip at the general election.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tory Euro MP Daniel Hannan said yesterday: \"I'd like to move to a position where people who vote Ukip and people who vote Conservative at the moment can support the same candidates.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week, senior Tory MP Brian Binley wrote on his internet blog: \"Support for Ukip is growing. Conservatives and Ukip share a lot of common ground on Europe and a re-alignment with supporters of Ukip on the issue might also help win back some of the voters who abandoned us for them after the last election.</p> <p>\"We can't keep patronising Ukip as extremists. They represent the strength of feeling on an issue that is so important to the British people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresecoffey/status/248959181774807040\">on Twitter</a> the Tory MP <strong>Therese Coffey</strong> said that Farage seemed to rule out a pact with the Conservatives only five days ago, when he was interviewed<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01mnqqz/Westminster_Hour_16_09_2012/\"> on the Westminster Hour. </a>She's got a point. I've been listening to the programme and this is what Farage said when he was asked if Ukip would stand down at the next election in seats where Tory candidates were calling for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No. Our intention is to fight every seat in the country at the next election. We are not just about Europe. We are about how we re-invigorate Britain once we've left.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.20am: I've arrived. The press room at Birmingham town hall obviously doubles up as a broom cupboard, and so I'm inside the main hall itself, perched near the top of the balcony. According to Ukip, around 900 members are coming to the conference and there must be several hundred in the hall already. I couldn't get a seat downstairs. As I type, <strong>Mike Read</strong>, the former Radio 1 DJ, is speaking. He's already mentioned Churchill, and I've only been here five minutes. And he's winding up now.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will soon be time to say once more: \"The long night of European darkness is over. Good morning, Great Britain.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>You get the gist ...</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.52am: Nigel Farage will be speaking in about an hour's time. Before he starts, here's a Farage reading list.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/20/nigel-farage-ukip-leader-interview\">\u2022 Nigel Farage told the Observer in a long interview earlier this year that Ukip could trigger a realignment of British politics.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can he imagine 20 more years of [campaign for a referendum on EU membership]?</p> <p>\"No. But I would think in the next four to five years we will either win the big question as far as we are concerned, or we will succeed in realigning a segment of the British political scene.\"</p> <p>An alliance with sceptical Conservatives?</p> <p>\"It's not completely impossible there will be some SDP-type moment, a coming together of different people over this one issue. Eventually, this question will have to be resolved.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9543841/UKIP-axes-pounds-sign-logo-saying-it-has-won-the-battle-to-save-sterling.html\">\u2022 Nigel Farage told the Daily Telegraph in an interview last week that he wanted to ditch the pound sign as the party's logo.<br></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our pound sign has been a fantastically simple image. But now it is in my opinion represents a battle honour and not a forward looking aspiration for a party that wants to represent an independent UK.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100181226/nigel-farage-has-to-save-ukip-from-its-golf-club-eccentricity/\">\u2022 Tim Stanley at the Telegraph says Nigel Farage is the only person holding Ukip together.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The appearance of coherence is the genius of Nigel Farage. Farage is one of Britain's great everyman conservatives, with an innocent, unblinking expression that suggests a pug being gently squeezed from its middle. Like Boris or Nadine, \"Nige\" is an anti-politician. He visits lap dancing clubs, smokes, drinks and is alleged to have had an affair with a Latvian woman he met in a pub in Biggin Hill. The ordinariness defuses the potential extremism of UKIP's manifesto and injects some real world outrage into politics. There are too few conservatives like him left \u2013 men in camel hair coats who would abolish the income tax and swap the Channel Tunnel for a brick wall. But such is the power of Farage's joyful libertarianism that I wonder if UKIP would survive without him. It could either split into philosophical factions or, as it did under Lord Pearson, simply fail to generate attention.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nigel-farage-tory-donors-ukip?newsfeed=\" true\"\">\u2022 Farage tells Michael White in a Guardian interview that disillusioned Tory voters are turning to Ukip.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9553120/Pinstripes-plain-views-and-areal-problem-for-Cameron.html\">\u2022 Paul Goodman in the Telegraph says Farage's long-term goal is to split the Conservative party.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Ukip leader has had testicular cancer, led his party before, stopped leading it, nearly died in a plane clash (while campaigning during the last election to win the Buckingham seat held by the Speaker), and come back to lead Ukip again. In other words, he is a tough old thing who gives his turbulent party momentum by sheer force of character. His contempt for Messrs Cameron and Osborne would curdle low-fat milk but, significantly, doesn't extend to the older generation of senior Conservative politicians, of whom he speaks with guarded respect. His plan is evident: to gain the In/Out EU referendum that would split the Conservatives in half, and to realign British politics, much as the Common Market referendum of 1975 did.</p> <p>After all, a new force eventually emerged from the cross-party alliances formed during that referendum \u2013 the SDP. The Ukip leader evidently hopes that similar co-operation during another referendum would bring a similar outcome \u2013 that a No vote and Tory splits would divide the Cameroon leadership of the party from its base. The latter, joined with Ukip, would then morph to become the full-blooded Thatcherite party that even Lady Thatcher herself never quite led. Hence his recent decision to drop the party's long title and replace its pound-sign symbol. Hence, too, Ukip's support for grammar schools and opposition to gay marriage. Mr Farage is trying to wean his party off the EU issue alone, woo traditional Tory voters and park his guerrilla army on Mr Cameron's lawn.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>11.16am: And here are some more lines from the various interviews that Nigel Farage has been giving this morning, in addition to the points he was making about the (very, very remote, it sounded to me) possibility of a pact with the Conservatives at the election. (See 9.28am.) I've taken the quotes from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a><br><strong><br>\u2022 Farage said he had more respect for Boris Johnson than for any other leading Conservative politician.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have to say I have a great regard for Boris, he is the only leading Conservative figure who stands up and says things that many UKIP members agree with ... When I hear him talking about the City of London and the fact that it is a rather valuable asset, he is closer to us, but he's not quite UKIP yet.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 Farage said Ukip were rightwing on some issues and liberal on others.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think on economics, you can put us on the centre-right. But on issues of liberty - we're the party that believe in habeas corpus, we're the party that wants a smaller state. In that sense we're classical liberals.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that most people joining Europe were coming over to the party from the Conservatives.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we have, since the last general election, got the Conservative party worried. A lot of people have come to us; some from the Lib-Dems, some from Labour, but the bulk that have come to us in the last two years from the Tories. They look at David Cameron and what they see is another brand of social democracy.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 He said Ukip's politicians had more real-life experience than the government's.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>I think people think we're being run by a bunch of college kids. They look at UKIP and think, well they may not be perfect, but at least it's led and full of people who've run businesses and got experience of life.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 He said Nick Clegg would probably be gone as Lib Dem leader within two years.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that schools do not teach pupils about British history or Christianity.</strong><br><strong><br>\u2022 He claimed that 75% of British laws originate from Brussels.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that Ukip wanted to spend more money on defence because the cuts to the armed forces were \"absolutely shameful\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said too many 18-year-olds were going to university.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Ukip wanted a 31% flat tax on all incomes over \u00a311,500. National insurance would be abolished under Ukip, he said.</strong></p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>11.33am: Farage claims that 75% of British laws come from Brussels. (See 11.16am.) But <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP10-62\">the House of Commons library has had a look at this issue and published a paper on it.</a> Its conclusion is different.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>All measurements have their problems. To exclude EU regulations from the calculation is likely to be an under-estimation of the proportion of EU-based national laws, while to include all EU regulations in the calculation is probably an over-estimation. The answer in numerical terms lies somewhere in between the two approaches, and it is possible to justify any measure between 15% and 50% or thereabouts. Other EU 'soft law' measures under the Open Method of Coordination are difficult to quantify as they often take the form of objectives and common targets. Analyses rarely look into EU soft law, the role of EU standard setting or self-regulatory measures.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>11.38am: Back in the hall, <strong>Lord Hesketh</strong> is giving the warm up speech for Farage. Hesketh is one of Ukip's prize defectors; he was a minister in the Thatcher government and chief whip in the Lords under John Major, but left the Conservatives for Ukip last year. He mentions Neville Chamberlain (his grandfather was Chamberlain's PPS, he says) and he says Chamberlain deserves credit for keeping Britain out a slump in the 1930s because he spent money on rearmament. He says the whole of Europe is becoming disenchanted with a political class that cannot be trusted to tell the truth, and he suggests that Europe needs an 1848-style revolution.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>11.53am: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> is on the stage now. He starts by welcoming to the stage three councillors who have defected to Ukip from the Conservatives. And he welcomes to the stage <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19627027\">Lord Stevens of Ludgate, the former chair of United Newspapers, who joined the party this week.</a></p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.00pm: <strong>Lord Stevens</strong> is speaking now. He cites David Cameron's quote about Ukip being full of \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\". (See 9.15am.) It's a pleasure to join you, he says.</p> <p>He says he finally decided to join Ukip<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9411876/David-Cameron-says-Britain-should-not-leave-EU.html\"> when Cameron told the Telegraph in an interview earlier this summer that he would never campaign for Britain to leave the EU.</a></p> <p>He says Britain could have a perfectly good free-trade agreement with the European Union. There should be an in/out referendum, he says.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.07pm: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> is speaking now.</p> <p>Something has changed, he says. At the general election Ukip got 3% of the vote. But now they are up to 12% in some polls, he says.</p> <p>What has changed? They have been lucky with their enemies, he says.</p> <p>But it is not about individuals. People look at the three parties. \"They look the same, they sound the same.\" And they look like college kids, he says.</p> <p>Ukip is run by people with some understanding of the real world.</p> <p>Ukip has also got better, he says. In the 1990s \"it was a bit shambolic\". But now it is more organised. It came second in the Barnsley byelection.</p> <p>The Human Rights Act has turned justice on its head. People want a debate on that, he says.</p> <p>People support Ukip because they see it as the voice of opposition on a whole range of issues, he goes on.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>12.10pm: Farage says Ukip is \"not a one-trick pony\".</p> <p>It is reaching out to people concerned about things like windfarms.</p> <p>But Europe is the key issue, and it is rising to the top of the agenda.</p> <p>This week Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, gave a speech that let the cat out of the bag. He used the f-word (federation) for the first time.</p> <p>The EU wants a constitutional change that would rule out the need for further referenda, he says.</p> <p>Farage says Barroso called him \"an extreme populist\". And he said Ukip was irrelevant to the main debate.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, Mr Barroso, it is Ukip's intention to make you eat those words.</p> </blockquote> <p>That gets the biggest round of applause so far.</p> <p>He says the new treaty proposed by Barroso is so extreme that no UK party would back it. Even the Lib Dems would not support it, he says.</p> <p>So a referendum on this question is inevitable, he says.</p> <p>People might argue that that is good news.</p> <p>But Farage says he is \"very worried\" by what he sees.</p> <p>From David Owen to Liam Fox, we now see the political class uniting behind a political position.</p> <p>There is growing support for allowing Britain to be part of a customs union with the rest of the EU.</p> <p>He says Cameron will propose a referendum on whether Britain should be part of the full federal EU, or whether it should just be part of a customs union.</p> <p>But this would stop Britain negotiating its own customs agreements with the rest of the EU, he says.</p> <p>Farage says he wants Britain to be able to have a free trade deal with the Commonwealth. (This gets a very big round of applause too.)</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>12.17pm: Farage says the EU wants Britain to have an \"open door\" to the whole of eastern Europe.</p> <p>That would be irresponsible with unemployment as high as it is.</p> <p>And Britain should not be subject to the European court, he says.</p> <p>That's why there needs to be a full in/out referendum.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>12.19pm: Farage turns to the issue of a deal with other political parties.</p> <p>Some of the press reporting is wrong, he says. Ukip is a full, independent party.</p> <p>But Ukip would be \"silly\" not to consider something that might bring closer the chance of an in/out referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>All this talk of a deal with the Conservatives has not come from me. It has come from the Conservatives.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clegg will go to Brussels before the 2015 election to replace Lady Ashton, he says. Under Vince Cable, the Lib Dems will float the idea of a deal with Labour. In those circumstances, if Ukip are 10% in the polls, the Tories will want to do a deal, he says.</p> <p>Farage says he has worked to build up Ukip. He would not do anything to jeopardise its identity, he says.</p> <p>Even if the Tories were to promise a referendum, that might not be enough. Some politicians do not keep their promises, he says. Any deal would have to be \"written in blood\".</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>12.23pm: Farage says Ukip has not yet made a breakthrough in local elections. But next year it will fight more seats than ever. And it will use those as a springboard for the European elections, he says.</p> <p>Ukip's goal will be to win those elections. He will work night and day to achieve that, he says.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>12.26pm: The Farage speech is over. I will post a summary shortly.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>12.58pm: The conference theme music seems to be XTC's \"Making Plans for Nigel\". They played it at the end of Nigel Farage's speech, and it has been blasting intermittently through the main hall ever since. It's almost as catchy and annoying as the Clegg \"sorry\" song.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>1.20pm: Here are the main points from Nigel Farage's speech.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Farage said that Ukip's priority now was to ensure that Britain had a full in/out referendum on membership of the EU, not just a referendum on Britain having a looser relationship with the EU.</strong> None of the main political parties is yet fully committed to an EU referendum, but David Cameron has strongly signalled that the Tories would call one after the next election and it is widely assumed that the plans to renegotiate the EU treaties in the light of the Eurozone crisis will eventually lead to British voters being given a say on any new arrangements. Farage said a referendum was inevitable. But it was not the referendum Ukip wanted, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm very, very worried about what I see. From David Owen to Liam Fox, what we're now seeing is the political class uniting around a position. The position is that we don't want to be part of this new federal superstate, but we do want to be part of the customs union, and we do want to be part of the single market and that there's nothing to fear from all those things because we won't be trapped inside a political union with Europe.</p> <p>Well, I've decided to take that on and I've launched a booklet called A Referendum Stitch-up. Because what is happening is remarkably similar to what happened back in 1975 \u2026 when you were told it was a common market. They are trying to do the same thing again.</p> <p>I think what Cameron will do, next week or the week after, is to say we can have a referendum on whether we join that full federal union, or whether we stay with the single market and a customs union. And that is a battle for us. We have got to go out there as a party and make the arguments. We don't want to be stuck inside a customs union that prevents us from making our own trade deals with the rest of the world, the growing parts of the world ... We in Ukip demand that this country is given a full, free and fair choice in a referendum, so that we can decide who governs Britain.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He played down the prospects of Ukip entering into some form of electoral pact with the Conservatives before the general election. </strong>Ukip was an independent party, with its own agenda and its own candidates at elections, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But if an opportunity came which meant we could get this country closer to walking through a door marked 'UK independence,' if we had the opportunity to do something that was in our national interest, we would be silly not to even consider it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage said that talk of an electoral pact was coming from the Conservatives and that he personally would do nothing to \"sell this party short\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only way we would even consider a negotiation of any kind at all would be if first an absolute promise was made to give this country a full, free and fair referendum so that we could decide whether we remain members of the EU or not. That would have to be on the table before we even considered any proposal.</p> <p>And we would possibly have a problem even then. Some of you may have noticed that there are one or two people in politics who make promises and then break them. So I don't think a cast-iron guarantee would satisfy Ukip. At the minimum, it would have to be written in blood.</p> </blockquote> <p>What does \"written in blood\" actually mean? The only plausible interpretation must be \"written in statute\" - ie, the government would have to pass legislation before the 2015 election for a referendum afterwards. The chances of that are minuscule.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Ukip's aim was to win the European elections in 2014.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>By then we may well have the bones of a new treaty. We will have a political class doing their best to ignore the issue, doing their best to give us a fudged, stitched-up referendum. I think we will be in the driving seat for those European elections. I believe it must be Ukip's aim and goal to win those European elections in 2014, to cause an earthquake in British politics and to change the future of this country forever.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>1.58pm: In the past Ukip never used to receive much media attention, but this year it's rather different. There's a respectable media contingent, including the Today programme's Evan Davis and Channel 4 News' Michael Crick. Crick has been commenting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/249101854796042240\">on Twitter.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of great things about UKIP conference is how it glories in its eccentricity - Union flag ties, colourful waist-coats, great moustaches</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>2.22pm:<strong> Tim Congdon</strong>, the economist, has just finished addressing the conference. He has recently produced a 56-page report called How much does the European Union cost Britain? and it claims that EU membership costs Britain around 10% of GDP, or \u00a3150bn. It is the latest version of a report that Ukip has been producing annually and Congdon said that he wanted it to become \"the best document produced by a political party in the country\".</p> <p>So it's a shame that I can't find a link. There's <a href=\"http://www.betteroffout.net/the-uk-could-be-150-billion-a-year-better-off-out-of-the-eu/\">a brief summary at the Better Off Out website,</a> but I can't find a link to the whole thing.</p> <p>Congdon attributes half the cost - 5% of GDP - to regulation. I haven't had time to read the whole document, but his methodology seems open to challenge, to put it politely. In the chapter on the costs of regulation, he quotes an EU commissioner in October 2006 putting out a statement \"which invited the interpretation that the annual cost of EU regulation was 600 billion euros, or 5% of GDP\". Perhaps it invited other interpretations too, but I don't know because I have not had time to check. And the report also says that Peter Mandelson told the CBI in 2004 that EU red tape cost 4% of GDP. After a quick search, I've been unable to find the quote to back it up. Does anyone have the link? I used to cover CBI conferences regularly during that period and, if Mandelson did say that, I think I would have remembered.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>2.49pm: <strong>Timo Soini</strong>, the leader of the True Finns party (a Ukip sister party in the European Parliament) has just finished speaking now. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/21/true-finns-nationalist-populists-european-parties\">Their electoral success last year generated the kind of political earthquake, apparently, that Farage wants to achieve here. </a>His speech included references to at least two Tory heroes. Describing the Eurocrats as \"pillocks\", he praised Margaret Thatcher and inverted one of her best known sayings.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think they [the Eurocrats] hated your prime minister so much that they decided to do exactly the opposite in every single detail ... Where there is harmony, they will bring discord. Where there is truth, they will bring error. Where there is faith, they will bring doubt. And where there is hope, they will bring despair.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also ended by quoting Churchill: \"We will never surrender.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>3.08pm: The economist <strong>Roger Bootle</strong> is addressing the conference now. He says that the creation of the euro was a mistake and that the best solution would be for Germany to leave. What's more likely to happen is that another country beginning with G (Greece) will leave, he says.<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18721155\"> Bootle, of course, won the Wolfson Economics prize for working out a method as to how this could happen.</a></p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>4.05pm: So, what have we learnt? In news terms, I think I have already summarised the main points. (See 1.20pm.) But the attraction of coming to a party conference is to see what a party looks like close up and, in that respect, coming to Birmingham has been worthwhile. It is refreshing to come to a party conference that is not swamped by corporate lobbyists and PR executives in smart suits. There are none of those here, just hundreds of (mostly quite elderly) party activists. And, even if Ukip isn't your cup of tea, it is generally invigorating to spend time in an environment full of people with a passion for their politics and strong views. It's not always like that at the main party conferences.</p> <p>As for my conclusions, here are four things I've learnt.</p> <p><strong>1. Speculating about a Ukip/Conservative electoral pact is a waste of time because it is not going to happen. </strong>That is not to say I can promise not to write about the prospect. There are <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2010/05/did-ukip-cost-the-tories-a-commons-majority.html\">a significant number of seats where the Ukip vote in 2010 was higher than the amount by which the Conservative candidate lost</a> and, as the election approaches, there is bound to be some kind of pressure for a deal \u2013 either seat-by-seat, or nationally \u2013 that would prevent a split in the Eurosceptic vote. But exactly the same kind of discussions took place before the 2010 general election, and they got nowhere. Even David Heathcoat-Amory, who was so Eurosceptic that he resigned as a minister from John Major's government over the issue, could not persuade Ukip to give him a free run. As he recalls bitterly <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Confessions-Eurosceptic-David-Heathcoat-Amory/dp/1781590486\">in his memoirs,</a> he thinks this led to him being defeated by the much more pro-European Lib Dem, Tessa Munt. Ukip seems too established as a party to want to contemplate these deals. Nigel Farage made this point in his speech and, if you read what he said about the possibility of a deal, it is fairly clear that he does not expect it to happen.</p> <p><strong>2. Ukip is not confident about winning an EU referendum. </strong>If, like me, you have not spent much time thinking about the difference between a free trade agreement and a customs union, you might think that Ukip (who want Britain outside the EU, but with a free trade agreement) would welcome the fact that the Conservatives want a looser relationship with the EU. But Farage clearly sees this as a threat and the most interesting part of his speech was the passage that dealt with this. (See 1.20pm.) He seems to think Cameron would find it relatively easy to win a referendum about whether Britain should remain in the EU as a member of a customs union.</p> <p><strong>3. The Conservative split has already happened.</strong> Earlier I quoted from an article by Paul Goodman, the former Conservative MP, saying that Farage seeks a fundamental realignment of British politics. But, after a day here, I sense that it has already happened. Ukip activists (with a few exceptions) are members of the broad Conservative tribe. They look like old-school Tories, talk like them and sound like them. Anyone who went to a Conservative party conference before they started to become anodyne in the mid-1990s would feel perfectly at home here.<br><strong><br>4. Ukip are not just a single issue party.</strong> I've heard plenty of Euro-bashing from the platform, but they have got strong views on other topics too. After Farage, the most interesting speaker in the morning was <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/policecommisioner.html\">Godfrey Bloom, the MEP who is standing against John Prescott in the elections for police commissioner in Humberside on what could safely be described as a Daily Mail platform:</a> anti-political correctness (there is a post on his blog entitled <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/news.htm\">\"Hate crime is not a crime\"), </a>pro-motorists (speed cameras would only be allowed near accident blackspots or schools) and pro shooting burglars (Bloom said he would take disciplinary action against any officer who arrested a householder for protecting his family). This is a party with a distinct libertarian agenda. Alexandra Swann, who defected to Ukip from Conservative Future, put it like this in her speech to the conference: \"I believe in more than independence from Europe. I believe in independence for the individual.\"</p> <p>That's it for today. I'm off for the train. Tomorrow I will be blogging from the Lib Dem conference, starting at around lunchtime.</p>",
  "<p>On Wednesday, I accused the government of failing to act on the significant and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/29/crop-pesticides-honeybee-decline\">growing evidence</a> that neonicitinoid pesticides cause significant harm to bees. For my trouble, I was \"<a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/09/19/neonicotinoids-bees/\">mythbusted</a>\" by the department for environment, food and rural affairs (Defra).</p> <p>But I am <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/what_we_do/the_bee_cause_35033.html\">far from alone</a> in my concerns and I can now reveal that a full parliamentary enquiry is going ahead into the matter. Joan Walley MP, who chairs the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/eacom\">House of Commons environmental audit committee,</a> a powerful cross-party group that acts as parliament's green watchdog, sent this letter to the Guardian on Friday.</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Dear Sir</p> <p>Damian Carrington's blog on the government's response to recent research on the impact of insecticides on bee populations is timely (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/18/bees-pesticides-neonicitinoids\">The silence of the bees</a>). Last week the Environmental Audit Committee, which I chair, decided to undertake an inquiry looking at the effects of pesticide use in the UK on biodiversity with a specific focus on bees.</p> <p>As Damian's blog pointed out, the use (and abuse) of evidence in policy-making and formulating regulation is clearly at the heart of the matter. But there are other issues that I want our investigation to examine. What monitoring is there of actual - rather than recommended - levels of pesticide usage? What are the potential impacts of these insecticides on human health? And should Defra be encouraging alternative pest-control measures, such as natural predators and plant breeding for insect-resistance, in a bid to make UK farming more bee-friendly?</p> <p>We will be announcing details of the inquiry soon. In the meantime, Defra ministers may want to start doing their homework on pesticide policy and biodiversity, because we will be calling them before parliament to answer questions on these issues. In particular, we will be scrutinising the evidence behind the Government's decision not to revise pesticide regulations or follow other European countries in temporarily suspending the use of insecticides linked to bee decline.</p> <p>Joan Walley MP<br>Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee<br>House of Commons</p> </blockquote> <p>I have very little to add to that, beyond hoping that the MPs can flush out the trials always cited by government and pesticide companies in defence of the chemicals, but which appear not to be in the public domain. The whole issue is very murky and the MPs will shed some very welcome light.</p>",
  "<p>One question never far from scientists' minds is how events might unfold were a giant slime mould to emerge in the Far East and embark on global domination.</p> <p>History tells us what happened when restless humans set out into the world. Kingdoms rose and fell as wars raged. Urban centres grew and connected. Trade networks spread, first across countries, later spanning whole continents.</p> <p>But slime mould is a different beast. Would the same scenarios play out as it colonised the world? After a series of simple experiments involving agar, a globe, a bag of oats, and an obliging slime mould, an answer, of sorts, is now at hand.</p> <p><a href=\"http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/adamatzky/\" title=\"Andy Adamatzky\">Andy Adamatzky</a>, director of the <a href=\"http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/\" title=\"International Centre of  Unconventional Computing\">Unconventional Computing Centre</a> at the University of the West of England in Bristol, picked slime mould \u2013 an amoeba-like, single-celled organism, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physarum_polycephalum\" title=\"Physarum polycephalum\">Physarum polycephalum</a> \u2013 as a harmless and friendly creature to work with. In its vegetative phase, it goes in search of food by extending \"protoplasmic tubes\", which transport nutrients and metabolites through the organism's body.</p> <p>Left to their own devices, slime moulds establish protoplasmic networks that maximise the nutrients they can draw from nearby food sources. This ability makes them natural path-computing machines, says Adamatzky. In the arcane language of the field, he says the organism \"acts like an amorphous massively parallel computer, with distributed inputs, or sensors, decentralised information processing and decision making and parallel actuation.\"</p> <p>The impressive behaviour of <em>P. polycephalum</em> has been likened to a primitive form of intelligence. The Japanese scientist Toshiyuki Nakagaki at Hokkaido University has reported \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11763236\" title=\"Smart behavior of true slime mold in a labyrinth.\">smart behaviour</a>\" in a slime mould that solved a maze after morsels of food were placed at the start and finish points. The slime mould grew through the maze, stumbled upon the food and then withdrew its protoplasmic tubes from dead ends. Not bad for a creature with no brain.</p> <p>Adamatzky took a different tack. \"I poured hot agar gel on a globe to make several good layers, then cut out continents and removed agar corresponding to oceans, seas, and large lakes. Then I placed oat flakes in the locations of the most populated cities and inoculated slime mould in Beijing.\"</p> <p>That's a globe of agar continents with oat flakes in place of major conurbations, and a starter colony of slime mould in the capital of China.</p> <p>Science is not for the impatient. Covering a globe with agar takes time. You have to pour it on layer by layer and let it cool. Then you have to cut round the continents and peel off the seas.</p> <p>And that's before you even get started. It takes over a week for slime mould to colonise a 15cm-diameter globe. \"The real challenge was to be patient,\" says Adamatzky.</p> <p>Typically, <em>Physarum</em> set out from Beijing and hooked up with oat flakes in Seoul and Tokyo, before colonising both Koreas and Japan in less than a day. From there it moved on to Hong Kong and Hanoi. A short branch would link up with Ho Chi Minh and Jakarta, and occasionally bridge over to New Zealand and Australia. The main branch pressed on, from Hanoi to Kolkata, Delhi, Tehran, Istanbul and London.</p> <p>Most surprising to Adamatzky were the patterns that emerged over time. The slime mould recreated more than 76% of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road\" title=\"\">Great Silk Road</a> trading routes and parts of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Highway_Network\" title=\"\">Asian Highway Network</a>.</p> <p>\"It is not just [taking] the shortest path,\" said Adamatsky. \"The slime mould's behaviour is affected by a combination of chemo-attractant gradients released by several metropolitan areas and shapes of continents.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3958?context=nlin\" title=\"The World's Colonisation and Trade Routes Formation as Imitated by Slime Mould\">Here's an early version of the paper</a>, due to be published in the <a href=\"http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/ijbc\" title=\"International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos\">International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos</a>.</p> <p>And what does all this tell us? Adamatzky thinks we have plenty to learn from these brainless organisms. He wants the work to inspire fresh thinking on how ancient roads came to be.</p> <p>But that's not all. The creature's behaviour might spur unorthodox approaches to planning future traffic routes, or predicting the spread of global disease. In taking over the planet, slime mould might help us find our own way in the world.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's multibillion-euro biodiesel industry has been dealt a blow by major policy changes outlined by <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/hedegaard/headlines/news_en.htm\" title=\"\">the EU climate commissioner</a> on Friday.</p> <p>The changes proposed by Connie Hedegaard will limit food-based biofuels to 5%, just above the current output of 4.5%.</p> <p>Green campaigners, who see biodiesel as doing more harm than good, hailed the move as a major victory for the environment. But the biodiesel industry condemned what it sees as a catastrophic U-turn that will cost thousands of jobs.</p> <p>The EU has a target of 10% for renewable transport fuels by 2020. But biofuels have become increasingly controversial because those derived from oil crops such as rape and palm can result in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jan/27/biofuels-biodiesel-ethanol-palm-oil\" title=\"\">greater carbon emissions than the diesel</a> they replace, as well as higher food prices and deforestation.</p> <p>Hedegaard told the Guardian: \"We cannot morally afford to build a very big industry on something that is not good for the environment or for food prices. One of the biggest challenges of the 21st century is ensuring affordable food prices.</p> <p>\"We are not closing down the existing [biodiesel] industry,\" she said. \"What they produce they can continue to produce.\"</p> <p>Much greater incentives will be given the so-called second and third-generation fuels, produced from agricultural or urban waste or by growing algae, with all existing support for food-based biofuels ending in 2020. These technologies are at a much earlier stage of development, but Hedegaard said the changes would give the market a \"very, very strong\" signal.</p> <p>\"These proposals prevent a further spread of today's unsustainable biofuels,\" said Nusa Urbancic, at campaign group <a href=\"http://www.transportenvironment.org/press/commission-efforts-towards-more-sustainable-biofuels-step-right-direction\" title=\"\">Transport &amp; Environment</a>. \"After having dragged its feet for so long, it's encouraging that the commission finally seems to take all the accumulated science seriously and is about to take meaningful action.\"</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.ebb-eu.org/\" title=\"\">European Biodiesel Board</a>, an industry body, said the changes could lead to the <a href=\"http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/8724369\" title=\"\">\"catastrophic\" end of an industry</a> worth \u20ac10bn a year.</p> <p>Alain Brinon, president of <a href=\"http://www.fediol.eu/\" title=\"\">Fediol</a>, another trade group, said: \"The represents a U-turn in EU policy-making and a blow to investors in the renewable energy supply chain.\"</p> <p>\"It is important to get biofuels but it would be absurd to get to the 10% target using something not very good for the environment,\" said Hedegaard. \"We must get our priorities right.\"</p> <p>Another key change in the proposals is to include the impact of deforestation, peatland drainage or other land clearance caused by biofuels in their carbon footprint. Environmental and development campaigners argue this factor \u2013 called indirect land-use change (ILUC) \u2013 has been a missing from calculations of the green credentials of biofuels.</p> <p>A new <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1757-1707.2012.01207.x/abstract;jsessionid=7CD45677AEC331D74AC6C9D782174FB6.d03t04\" title=\"\">peer-reviewed scientific study by Chris Malins</a> at the International Council on Clean Transportation found that without ILUC factors, the EU's biofuel policy \"could be expected to deliver only a 4% carbon saving compared to fossil fuel, with a 30% chance that it would actually cause a net emissions increase.\" Malins added: \"Biodiesel from non-waste vegetable oil is likely to have a worse carbon footprint than fossil diesel.\"</p> <p>Transport &amp; Environment said that not including ILUC factors would result in carbon emissions equivalent to putting between <a href=\"http://www.ieep.eu/assets/786/Analysis_of_ILUC_Based_on_the_National_Renewable_Energy_Action_Plans.pdf\" title=\"\">14 and 29m additional cars</a> on the road across Europe in 2020.</p> <p>The industry has attacked the scientific work upon which the ILUC factors will be based and said more data is needed. \"They always say we need more knowledge, but we have several studies,\" said Hedegaard. \"We have to base political decision making on the available knowledge. Everyone knew from 2007 that ILUC factors were a probability.\"</p>",
  "<p>Times of pressing challenges require great courage to break rank from the ingrained business mind-set. As Michael Porter said when addressing business leaders in New York recently: \"The old models of corporate strategy and capitalism are dead. We are witnessing a paradigm shift from hurting to helping \u2026 where the externalities are turned into opportunities.\"</p> <p>Today's rapidly changing business environment calls for businesses that thrive in such environments: businesses more akin to living systems. These firms of the future learn and adapt; they aren't structured and siloed, which stifles learning and agility. They are bottom-up, decentralised, interdependent, multifunctional, self-organising units \u2013 unlike the centralised, top-down, hierarchically-managed monoliths of the 20th century. Organisations need to transform into units that are inter-connected, value-led and inspired by nature.</p> <p>Over the last 3.8 billion years, nature has survived and flourished through times of radical change and disruption by dynamically networking and collaborating among species and throughout ecosystems. Competition and constraint help shape nature, yet it is collaboration and synergy \u2013 not competition \u2013 that are responsible for nature's sustained success. <br>The species most able to survive and evolve are those most able to sense and respond, adapt and align, and work in partnership with and within their ecosystems. Diversity, flexibility and collaboration, we find, is core to the interwoven evolutionary journey of life \u2013 the driving forces that provide resilience within species and ecosystems.</p> <p>The more we explore nature's wisdom the more we find insight for the transformation our organisations need. Industrial ecology, for example, challenges the over-exploitative nature of the current \"take\u2013make\u2013waste\" industrial paradigm. It takes inspiration from nature in exploring how systems can become less linear and more interconnected \u2013 where waste of one part of the ecosystem is input for another, and hence there is no need for wasteful emissions of any kind (whether gas, liquid or solid waste), as long as the right interconnections are in place. </p> <p>And it is not just processes within business that can be inspired by nature; also the nature of leadership is transforming to become more emergent and adaptive; encouraging bottom-up emergence to flourish; establishing an all-pervasive values-led work ethic while guiding and coaching.</p> <p>As our understanding of our interrelated nature becomes more apparent to us, we recognise that our values as individuals, organisations, communities and a species are fundamentally what drive our ability to behave more sustainably and so embrace the transformational journey ahead.</p> <p>In the words of Paul Polman, global CEO of Unilever: \"Too many people think in terms of trade-offs that if you do something which is good for you, then it must be bad for someone else. That's not right and it comes from old thinking about the way the world works and what business is for: Milton Friedman's optimisation of short-term profits. We have to snap out of that old thinking and move to a new model.\"</p> <p>The more our working environments become value-led and life-enhancing the more alive the organisations and the more aligned we become to the true nature within us and around us. This helps unlock the creative potential within us; individually and collectively reconnecting with our authentic selves and so perceiving business challenges as opportunities for life enhancement. The challenging business environment becomes a sea of opportunities.</p> <p>As Sir Richard Branson points out: \"Those businesses that do well whilst doing good are the ones that will thrive in the coming decades. Those that continue with 'business as usual', focused solely on profit maximisation, shall not be around for long (and don't deserve to be).\"</p> <p>Unified visions, strong culture, corporate transparency and stakeholder dialogues will ensure value-led sustainable business becomes everyday business.</p> <p><em>Giles Hutchins has over 15 years of business transformation experience and is now embarking on a BBC/Open University documentary of the same title and subject as his new book The Nature of Business.

  "<p><strong>The Campaign </strong>comes on with an air of reformist zeal, aiming to make us laugh even as we despair of the current state of American political discourse. It's been trailed in the US with guest appearances by stars Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis on all the big US cable news shows \u2013 including those of Chris Matthews, Piers Morgan (Albion, take him back!), Joe Scarborough and Ed Schultz, among others \u2013 all of whom appear as themselves in the film's faked-up news coverage of the titular campaign.</p> <p>The Campaign musters all sorts of pointed comic moments and manages to harvest some of the lower-hanging satirical fruit available. Ferrell's Cam Brady is a smugly corrupt and priapic North Carolina congressional incumbent used to running unchallenged, who faces upstart Marty Huggins (Galifianakis), spare son of a local pol. He's cynically backed by the Koch-like Motch brothers, evil billionaire siblings intent on selling the district to Chinese manufacturers and \"insourcing\" cheap Chinese labour. The fact that these brothers are played as near carbon-copies of Randolph and Mortimer Duke from Trading Places \u2013 and better yet, that one of them is played by Dan Aykroyd \u2013 suggests that The Campaign is content to coast in second gear in places. Ferrell's performance is Ron Burgundy, Politician, by way of Anthony Weiner (the US congressman forced to resign after a \"sexting\" scandal), while Galifianakis's homespun Huggins, vocally reminiscent of the toxic scold Sarah Palin, is a plump cousin to Chris Farley's useless political scion in Black Sheep.</p> <p>So what? Movies never change elections anyway, so why should we expect anything of The Campaign? Why indeed? But it's worth noting that the lunatic political environment in which this almost unsatirisable election \u2013 November's <em>real </em>election \u2013 is currently unfolding was almost entirely created by movies, most of which we've never seen or heard of.</p> <p>Eight years ago, the rightwing activist group Citizens United took Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 before the Federal Communications Commission, claiming it was a political ad and it should be suppressed for the last 30 days before the election. Case thrown out. Four years later, they filed suit to be permitted to show Hillary: The Movie, a slur-filled slime-job on then-candidate Clinton. That case went to the Supreme Court after Obama won and resulted in the tearing down of a century's-worth of campaign finance laws, leading us into a sci-fi electoral futurescape the likes of which weren't foreseen even by Network or Blade Runner. If you don't believe that a movie can change history then watch the Middle East, and consider those flames were ignited by a half-finished, Z-grade movie trailer called Innocence Of Muslims. The Campaign is busy fighting the last war; the new war may be beyond satire entirely.</p>",
  "<p>Between now and 30 November, Nintendo has a monumental task on its hands. When it launches, the Wii U will be the first new video games console for six years, and while there may still exist a small hardcore of gamers who find the arrival of any new console exciting, the changing, mobile phone-skewed landscape of the modern games industry dictates that Nintendo must do more to ensure the Wii U is a success from day one.</p> <p>And its sheer quirkiness \u2013 embodied by the tablet-like GamePad controller \u2013 renders the Wii U somewhat baffling until you get your hands on one. So the Japanese games giant is embarking on a furious round of buzz-generation, the key component of which will be roadshows traversing the UK.</p> <p>But before those kick-off, Nintendo took us to its European headquarters in Frankfurt for hands-on experience of the vast majority of the first wave of Wii U games.</p> <h2>Killer titles</h2> <p>What every new console needs is a selection of so-called killer games, which are so irresistible that people buy the hardware just so they can play them.</p> <p>Such games, inevitably, are in short supply at launch, since achieving the requisite blend of quality and originality simply won't happen overnight.</p> <p>However, among the Wii U's launch titles, a couple stood out as must-have games with the potential to shift hardware unite.</p> <h2>ZombiU</h2> <p>Chief among them is Ubisoft's ZombiU. Exclusive to and custom-designed for the Wii U, this created quite a stir at the E3 Show, not least when Nintendo's US head honcho, Reggie Fils-Aime \u2013 an already somewhat scary-looking guy \u2013 spent an inordinate amount of time at Nintendo's press conference using it to zombify his own face.</p> <p>Zombie games aren't exactly in short supply, but hands-on time with ZombiU's single-player game swiftly established that Ubisoft has cleverly managed to find a new spin on the genre \u2013 and one that makes great use of the Wii U's unique abilities.</p> <p>Perhaps its most surprising aspect is its sheer rigour \u2013 which is so extreme that it brings to mind From Software's fearsomely hard but deeply satisfying RPGs Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.</p> <p>In the single-player game, you start each mission from a safe house, and must safely navigate to the next one, traversing London (where the game is set) in the process. In the interest of realism, you only get one life \u2013 at least as far as, if you die, you respawn at the safe house as another person.</p> <p>And if you die at the jaws of a zombie, the character you were playing becomes a zombie too. Which means that, in your new guise, you need to get back to where you previously died, with the minimum amount of equipment (a pistol, without much ammo, and a cricket bat), to kill your zombified previous self and retrieve your backpack containing all the useful weapons and items you had previously collected.</p> <p>The zombies themselves are pretty uncompromising \u2013 they can climb, and will attack you if you're fiddling with your backpack. So you have to adopt a tactical approach to despatch them.</p> <p>The Wii U's GamePad operates as a great inventory-arranger, as well as a sniperscope and a sensor for finding hidden objects.</p> <p>ZombiU is gloriously atmospheric \u2013 perhaps the truest survival-horror game yet \u2013 so it's no surprise that it will be available bundled with the Wii U at launch.</p> <h2>NintendoLand</h2> <p>One thing that ZombiU emphatically isn't, though, is the sort of game that your granny will be able to pick up and play \u2013 and the Wii's success was built on such games. Which makes NintendoLand a vital title for the new console.</p> <p>If, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jun/07/wii-u-next-generation-e3\" title=\"\">as Jonathan Ross said in the Guardian</a>, the Wii U is \"the Wii on steroids\", then NintendoLand is Wii Play on steroids. Although it's not as instantly graspable as Wii Play's mini-games.</p> <p>Instead, it's a collection of 12 mini-games, each bearing the theme of one of Nintendo's great franchises. In subtle ways, they've been created to showcase the GamePad's different abilities, and the opportunities for new styles of gameplay that it throws up when used in conjunction with Wii Remote controllers.</p> <p>Thus Mario Chase, for example, puts the player with the GamePad in a colour-coded labyrinth, essentially playing hide-and-seek, while four people, using Wii Remotes, collaborate in order to catch him or her. It's raucous and fun.</p> <p>A couple of previously unseen NintendoLand mini-games surfaced in Frankfurt. Perhaps most notably Pikmin Adventure, a co-operative take on the much-loved Pikmin blueprint, in which the GamePad player takes on the role of Captain Olimar, and two others can essentially play as Pikmin, attacking enemies or, when appropriate, being herded up by Olimar to attack the same enemy or be chucked to otherwise inaccessible places.</p> <p>Balloon Trip Breeze, loosely inspired by the ancient NES game Balloon Fight, is a clever wind-propelled platform effort, controlled entirely by the GamePad's stylus and touchscreen.</p> <p>Metroid Blast, meanwhile, puts players with Wii Remotes on the ground, and whoever wields the GamePad on a floating platform \u2013 its shoot-em-up gameplay and bland environment seemed a bit bland compared with its full-sized predecessors.</p> <p>The Legend of Zelda Battle Quest, in which two people wield Wii Remotes as swords, while the GamePad player fires arrows (often at elevated targets, in order to solve puzzles and acquire extra health), was fun to play, despite its on-rails nature.</p> <p>NintendoLand, then, is undoubtedly a bit patchy, but at least shows off the Wii U's ability to generate new types of gameplay, involving groups of players.</p> <p>The other first-party Nintendo title on show was New Super Mario Bros U, which won't need much by way of introduction for Nintendo-heads.</p> <p>We enjoyed playing it co-operatively, with two players controlling Mario and Luigi using horizontally-held Wii Remotes, while a GamePad player helped them out by drawing platforms to help clear otherwise insurmountable gaps, and by tapping on enemies to distract them. That co-operative dynamic was surprisingly satisfying, although in look and feel terms, New Super Mario Bros U is virtually indistinguishable from its myriad siblings, so it's debatable whether it can be considered a platform-shifter.</p> <h2>Third-party games</h2> <p>Nintendo's Frankfurt showcase featured a pretty sizeable roster of games from third-party publishers \u2013 although there was a void at its heart, in the shape of the Wii U version of Call of Duty: Black Ops II.</p> <p>Just the fact that a the Wii U has the under-bonnet power to run a full-blown Call of Duty game represents real progress for Nintendo, and if it has any unique features, Black Ops II will surely be a key launch title. Activision will no doubt unveil it with a fanfare before long.</p> <p>Power-wise, the Wii was so weedy that it couldn't even dream of running Xbox 360 and PS3 games, but because the Wii U is in their general polygon-shifting ballpark, it will at least have significantly more third-party support than the Wii. Although early adopters will have to root out the truffles from among plenty of mouldy undergrowth.</p> <h2>Big names line up</h2> <p>Perhaps the most impressive third-party title on show was Assassin's Creed III, which certainly demonstrated that the Wii U is at least on a graphical par with the Xbox 360 and PS3.</p> <p>We played a maritime warfare mission, using the GamePad to pilot a ship and order gunners to fire specific types of shot at enemy vessels. It was difficult to detect many design concessions specific to the Wii U, although the GamePad's screen will come in handy for displaying the map and managing inventory items.</p> <p>But despite that, Assassin's Creed III is such an attractive game that it may help the Wii U sell more units.</p> <p>Another Ubisoft game, Rayman Legends, made much more overt use of the Wii U's specific capabilities. The sequel to the glorious Rayman Origins, it will provide plenty of its predecessor's endearingly bonkers side-scrolling platform action, which in itself will be a major draw, but we were able to play two levels specific to the Wii U, feature asymmetric co-operative gameplay.</p> <p>In the first, one player controlled Rayman with a Classic Controller (although you could use a Wii Remote and Nunchuk), while the other assisted by manipulating the environment, using a stylus, on the GamePad.</p> <p>Thus, you could tickle enemies, laying them open to attack, swipe ofver plants or pull them out of the ground for bonus points or, crucially, pull beams around and even manipulate giant wheels using the motion-sensing.</p> <p>The other level was a rhythm-action one, in which the Classic Controller player had to run through the entire level, timing jumps and attacks to precision while, again, the GamePad player cleared a path by distracting enemies and hitting time-stamps.</p> <h2>Surprising gems</h2> <p>Proof that the Wii U's launch can be used to breathe new freshness into a flagging franchise came from a surprising source: Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge.</p> <p>When it arrived on the current-gen consoles early this year, it didn't meet with approval from Ninja Gaiden fans, who reckoned it had been dumbed down. But the much-loved Team Ninja has taken those criticisms on board, and come up with a major reworking for the Wii U, which features a whole new playable character called Ayane \u2013 an anime-influenced babe with pink hair and an eye-catching quick attack accompanied by pink motion-blur.</p> <p>On the Wii U, Ninja Gaiden 3 will once again feature the fierce difficulty-levels of the earlier games, as well as character advancement and greater emphasis on Ninpo \u2013 ninja magic to you and I. Many of the game's annoying Quicktime Events have been removed, too, and while there's light use of the GamePad's touch-screen, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge mainly profits from the time Team Ninja has had to sit back and reflect on what it made on the PS3 and Xbox 360.</p> <h2>And the rest</h2> <p>There were some eShop games on show, suggesting that the Wii U will be the first Nintendo console that attempts to rival Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network \u2013 the RPG Trine 2 and cute, minimal puzzler Toki Tori 2 showed that the Wii U's eShop will support games of all shapes and sizes.</p> <p>But there were some notable disappointments on display, too. Especially Mass Effect 3. We were wildly excited about the prospect of playing BioWare's RPG on a Nintendo console, but disappointingly little had been done to it, apart from the addition of a single-use rocket-launcher, which lets you take out six enemies at once, all the DLC and the Director's Cut ending.</p> <p>Darksiders II was more compelling, at least: it, too, includes all the DLC, and makes excellent use of the GamePad touch-screen, making its overcrowded inventory much more accessible.</p> <h2>Is that enough?</h2> <p>No console has ever launched with a truly satisfying portfolio of launch games \u2013 and it's easy to argue that the Wii U could really do with an absolute must-have at launch \u2013 a Zelda or Super Mario game, say. But they will come eventually, and on balance, the Wii U's launch line-up is pretty good, and perhaps better than we could have expected.</p> <p>At least this time around, the big cross-platform franchises are coming to the party, and ZombiU, NintendoLand and Assassin's Creed II have the potential to drive sales of the consoles itself.</p> <p>Plus there are some solid back-up titles like Rayman Legends, Ninja Gaiden 3, New Super Mario Bros U and Darksiders II. The Wii U will have a critical mass of games from the off, just about, and few consoles can boast that.</p> <p>But now, the ball is in the court of Nintendo's marketing department, which needs to generate a Europe-wide buzz, and do so quickly.</p>",
  "<p>I am asked to guess the water footprint of the fantastic milky coffee that I am drinking in <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/117474000406469263505/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en\" title=\"\">Leila's Shop</a>, a cafe and food shop in Shoreditch, London. I hazard a guess of 10, maybe 15 litres? The actual figure \u2013 207L \u2013 nearly makes me spit it out again.</p> <p>The pressure on our global water supplies has been growing alongside a rapidly increasing human population. At present about 41% of the world's population lives with what Unesco calls \"severe water stress\", and that number is predicted to rise to two-thirds by 2025. A 2006 UN report states: \"The word crisis is sometimes overused in development. But when it comes to water, there is a growing recognition that the world faces a crisis that, left unchecked, will derail progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and hold back human development.\"</p> <p>But awareness and understanding is still low. \"Most of us in the west don't really think this is our problem. We think we use about 150L of water a day, and that's that,\" says Leila McAlister, proprietor of the shop.</p> <p>In reality the picture is much more complicated. We may use 150L of \"real\" water (which is still higher than most countries \u2013 in China average daily \"real\" water use is 86L, and 46 in Kenya). But around 70-80% of accessibly freshwater used by humans is directed towards agriculture. And increasingly experts argue that the water that goes into producing our food and goods should really be included in that total too, in a concept of embodied water known as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/aug/20/water.food1\" title=\"\">\"virtual water\"</a>, or your water footprint.</p> <p>Using this measurement, our water footprint is actually far higher and has far more impact then most of us realise. At the beginning of his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Virtual-Water-Tackling-Precious-Resource/dp/1845119843\" title=\"\">Virtual Water</a>, Prof Tony Allen, creator of the concept, looks at the typical water footprint of your breakfast. The numbers are staggering. Allen quotes 140L for coffee, around 80L for toast, 120L for eggs, 240L for milk: coming, in total, to 1,100L, or around three bathtubs of water.</p> <p>Our globalised agricultural system means that much of that water use is not in the country where the product is being consumed. So developed countries are essentially exporting their water use, just as they export carbon emissions. It's been estimated by the <a href=\"http://www.waterfootprint.org\" title=\"\">Water Footprint Network</a> that Europe exports 42% of its water footprint.</p> <p>It was in order to raise awareness of the situation that McAlister teamed up with Allen to create the <a href=\"http://www.wonderwater.fi/newsposts/coming-soon-wonderwater-cafe-london-16-23-september/\" title=\"\">Wonderwater pop up caf\u00e9</a> (open until Sunday) at Leila's Shop, allowing Allen's team to come in and audit her menu, and then to create <a href=\"http://www.wonderwater.fi/wp-content/uploads/WWCafeLondonMenu.pdf\" title=\"\">a new version</a> with the virtual water footprint of every offering beside it.</p> <p>The eggs fried with tangy, smoky sage? A water footprint of 732L, thanks to the gigantic water footprint of olive oil. The utterly delicious cavolo nero and bean soup? More olive oil means that the footprint is 619L. McAlister admits to having been shocked by the water consumption of the vanilla pods in her damson compote. \"They really take up a lot of water. The footprint for that was 994L.\"</p> <p>It's not really clear, at the moment, what we are supposed to do with this information. \"This is all very skeletal form now,\" says Naho Mirumachi, who works alongside Allen at King's College London. \"The issue is extremely complex, and we are only beginning to make progress and really understand it. There really is no consumer guidance, but as our understanding develops it will come.\"</p> <p>Though McAlister admits it has been fascinating to \"have a team of academics come in and work on my food and tell me things I didn't know about it\", she has yet to stop using any ingredients. \"It has helped me to visualise the issue though.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the new school year approaches in Mali, it is looking increasingly unlikely that hundreds of schools across the Islamist-controlled north that have been closed for several months will be reopening soon.</p> <p>Thousands of children have had their last school year ruined. When the rebel Tuareg MNLA took over the towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu at the beginning of 2012, classes had already been disrupted by teachers on a prolonged strike. Then fighting broke out between the MNLA and Islamist rebels from AQMI, Ansar Dine and MUJAO, and schools were closed and parents kept their children away for safety. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/30/mali-adultery-stoning-radical-islamists\" title=\"\">The victorious Islamists went on to declare that they would impose sharia law</a> across the north, and called for the introduction of Qur'anic schools where girls and boys could not be taught together.</p> <p>Although a new national government was named by Mali's president, Dioncounda Traor\u00e9, in August, the new education ministry has so far been unable to do much to get children back in class.</p> <p>\"This is having an enormous impact on the children psychologically, and on the whole country. How can we train the next generation?\" says Maiga Dramane, head of basic education at the ministry of education. \"But how do you expect us to persuade someone who is pointing an AK47 at us that they should reopen a school?\"</p> <p>In addition to the closed schools, thousands of people have fled from the north \u2013 latest figures suggest at least 174,000 people have been internally displaced and more than 200,000 are in refugee camps in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/12/mali-refugees-burkina-faso-food-crisis\" title=\"\">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2012/aug/15/niger-mali-refugee-crisis-video\" title=\"\">Niger</a> and Mauritania, all with little access to educational opportunities.</p> <p>But a few children have reached the capital, Bamako, and are now benefiting from remedial classes organised by Unicef and the Malian government. An estimated 12,000 displaced people are now living with their extended families in Bamako, and the classes are to support those young people who were supposed to sit their exams in the school year ending in July. The government has promised to make provisions for them to sit exams in October.</p> <p>\"When I heard about these new sessions I was in Mauritania, but I told my family I was going to Bamako,\" says 19-year-old Lala Zeinab Elmouany, originally from Timbuktu. \"All I was thinking about was my exams. I'd worked so hard and you can't get anywhere in life without them. I want to get to university. I only had a few weeks of study this year. I've forgotten so much. I will do my best to pass my exams.\"</p> <p>Many teachers from the north have also fled south, forced out by the Islamists because they were employed by the state to teach a secular curriculum. \"They hate the public school system, so what can I do? I can't teach the Qur'an, I'm classically trained,\" says Souleymane Maiga, who was teaching physics and chemistry in Timbuktu. \"I had to leave, but then all the teachers have come here. I'm not expecting to find another job.\"</p> <p>Mali already has a poor education record. According to the UN children's fund, Unicef, adult literacy rates for 15 to 24-year-olds are 47% for men and 31% for women. Thousands of children, especially girls, barely make it through primary school. Most wealthy parents send their children to private schools where fees can be upwards of $1,000 a year.</p> <p>\"The closure of these schools in the north just compounds an already difficult situation and places extra strain on the system, particularly with the suspension of aid after the military coup in March by some donors,\" says Euphrates Gobina, Unicef's head of education in Bamako. \"We're only reaching a small number of children so far, those in grades 1 to 8 [childen aged five to 15] are not getting anything at the moment.\"</p> <p>There seems little prospect of the lost territory in the north being regained soon. Mali's president has formally requested the regional grouping, the Economic Community Of West African States, to send a force to assist Mali's army in that task, but the issue remains deeply divisive among Malians and some of the soldiers behind March's coup have said they will not accept foreign forces on Malian soil.</p>",

  "<p>\"Call the Samaritans!\" yelps New Zealand's <a href=\"http://www.kimbramusic.com/home/\" title=\"\">Kimbra Lee Johnson</a>, jolting, convulsing and throwing coin-operated Pierrot poses around the Union Chapel stage in a pink puffball mini-dress, like a demonically possessed princess doll come to life. She may be suffering from a new internet-age affliction: Unknown Superstar Syndrome. Kimbra spent five weeks at No 1 as the annoyed new girlfriend on Gotye's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY\" title=\"\">Somebody That I Used to Know</a>, racking up 321m YouTube views, making her as big as seven <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc\" title=\"\">\"Leave Britney Alone</a>\" guys, or 45 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GRSbr0EYYU\" title=\"\">Fentons</a>. Yet most of her viewers would only recognise her from the rear, with painted triangles sliding off her naked back. It's enough to drive the sanest <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/5747730/Kimbra-wins-Critics-Choice-Award\" title=\"\">Antipodean cult star</a> to the brink.</p> <p>Still, it's the kind of global spotlight you get one shot at grabbing. So Kimbra throws every angle of modern fem-pop at the wall with such ball-lightning enthusiasm that all of it sticks. She's a seamless concoction of Regina Spektor's cutesy quirks, Gaga's cranky glamour, Beyonc\u00e9's pop fritz, Adele's outsider soul and the electronic adventurism of St Vincent, building several songs around sampled tribal clatter and backing choirs of her own voice, expertly looped live. Her songs, lifted largely from debut album <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vows_(album)\" title=\"\">Vows</a>, are equally diverse, skipping from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XjNlpe7hII\" title=\"\">sultry cabaret</a> to Bond-theme bombast, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0DAT9UqR0\" title=\"\">samba party-starters</a>, electro disco (her Foster the People collaboration, Warrior) and space-age soul (a stunning take on Kitty White's Plain Gold Ring). It should be a sprawling mess, but her kooky joie de vivre makes her a vivacious Everydiva, straddling styles and riveting to watch.</p> <p>At times she seems genuinely unhinged; when yodelling her desperation for babies in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHV04eSGzAA\" title=\"\">Settle Down</a>, or when she crouches by the altar during Two Way Street, seemingly miming the effects of dysentery. But when she achieves the rare feat of a romantic banking metaphor on encore ballad Withdraw \u2013 \"I can't withdraw your heart from mine\" \u2013 it's clear that Kimbra is a major new pop species: Webwacko Enormicus.</p> <p><em>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>G4S was, until early August of this Olympic year, hardly a household name company. Atos had been the target of disability rights campaigners but beyond the activists not many would know what they get up to. Dow Chemical would hardly register at all.</p> <p>All three of course were either official sponsors or approved suppliers of London 2012. Yet the high profile they paid so much for proved to be almost entirely negative. In <a href=\"http://www.philosophyfootball.com/view_item.php?pid=804\" title=\"\">my book</a> I made a plea for an uncommercial Games, the Olympic five rings to be protected as a symbol of sport, not a logo for the corporations. As an Olympics romantic I resented the Games' historic symbolism being used to flog fast food, fizzy drinks and dodgy internet connections.</p> <p>Yet I needn't have been so bothered, instead of militant opposition the companies managed to foul up their own PR so spectacularly that the commercialisation of London 2012 ended up being anything but the smooth and irresistible process I had feared. G4S will now forever be associated with their failure to provide the security staff and having to be bailed out by the armed services. Atos's unpopularity amongst the disabled community is now far better known than their supply of IT systems for London 2012. And the Bhopal chemical disaster, which many had probably forgotten about, was back in the news and associated with Dow Chemical.</p> <p>But it gets worse. Which marketing genius came up with the deal for Visa? Discovering that Visa is the only card with which you are able to buy tickets or food at the ground does nothing to make you feel warm about the company if you have their card, and inspires unreserved hatred for Visa if you don't own one.</p> <p>The sponsors were also a focus for unremitting scrutiny if they'd snapped up free tickets as part of any deal, especially if they were guilty of causing empty seats because they didn't take up their allocations. And hardly a day went by when the unhealthy products that most of the sponsors are responsible for were in one media spotlight or another with questions being asked why they were allowed to be associated with sport.</p> <p>London 2012 was subject to the strict guidelines for branding in all Olympic venues. These are pleasingly advert-free, an example of tough legislation to prevent the commodification of sport. It meant that outside the arenas, and in the build up, the advertising frenzy went completely overboard. But once the real action began, the standout gold medal-winning performances we'll all remember, there was not an advert or sponsor in sight. This for me is how it should be: the sponsors aren't backing the Olympics out of any charitable intent, they are using it to make money, to sell more products. They need the Olympics every bit as much as London 2012 needed their money. And there's plenty of competition to be a sponsor too, nothing reaches a global audience in the same way as the Olympics. So it was right to regulate their involvement and their profile to ensure they didn't overwhelm the Games.</p> <p>But (whisper it quietly) with no profile in the arenas, the bad press is likely to outweigh the good. What's more, the unpredictability of who wins the gold medals means they are likely to be associated with a non-Olympic sponsor. Mo Farah is a Nike man, so his gold medal was of next to no use to official London 2012 sponsor, Adidas.</p> <p>I could almost feel sorry for all the money the sponsors have wasted, but I won't. They still get all the credit for backing London 2012 rather than the Games' biggest single sponsor: you and me, the British taxpayer.</p>",

  "<p>My heart goes out to Nigella, it really does. Another damn <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n2y25\" title=\"\">TV series</a>. That means <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780701187330\" title=\"\">another damn book</a>. And that means another 150 or so fresh recipes. And that means \u2013 well, what does that mean? It means another slick marketing exercise, complete with a winsome portrait of our heroine, a naff title, \"Nigellissima\" and a crafty surtitle, \"Instant Italian Inspiration\". That's very smart. The \"instant\" signifies that this is quick and easy cooking (which it is, for the most part), and the \"Italian inspiration\" neatly deals with the authenticity/non-authenticity argument. This isn't really a book about Italian cooking at all. It's a collection of Italian dishes as imagined by a British cookery writer.</p> <p>In her introduction, Nigella deals with the question of authenticity in a characteristically intelligent, crisply argued and well written way. Even Italian cooking, she points out, has evolved over the years, which is spot on. However, she goes on: \"It is true that they still respect their traditions but \u2026 Italians are suddenly learning and wanting to learn about other ways of cooking.\" Well, this might come as a surprise to a good many of the natives of Calabria, Molise or even Emilia Romagna. More to the point, however, this newfound curiosity about global cooking cultures has not influenced the food you find cooked in homes or restaurants. Even in Rome, there's a lack of a decent Indian or Chinese restaurants, and the same goes for Thai, Vietnamese, Mexican or Lebanese, not to mention French or Spanish. Italians like eating Italian food.</p> <p>The essence and attraction of Italian food is in its precision, in picking quality ingredients, at the right moment of each season and cooking them with understanding. Simple, but it's difficult to achieve the explosively flavoured delights without the right raw materials.</p> <p>Never mind, this isn't a book about real Italian cooking, so we needn't worry. Need we? The very first recipe in the book is Sicilian pasta with tomatoes, garlic and almonds. Nigellissima's recipe is dauntingly similar to <em>busiati al pesto trapanese</em> which you can find in Giorgio Locatelli's majestic Made in Sicily, with certain additions (anchovy fillets, capers, sultanas and basil), certain omissions (mint), and a non-Sicilian pasta \u2013 Nigellissima specifies long fusilli or \"other pasta of your choice\".</p> <p>As it happens I made the Locatelli version of this dish for a dinner a couple of months back. It was a stunner. The busiati (curlicue pasta, made by hand) had a wonderful delicate softness that carried the sauce with exemplary balance. The mint freshened and sharpened the unlikely, elegant liaison of perfumed almonds and powerful fruitiness of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/feb/07/pass-notes-pachino-tomato\">Pachino tomatoes</a>. It's a very simple recipe with just seven ingredients including salt and pepper and olive oil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396585613\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348224775876/Matthew-Fort-cooks-from-N-004.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Fort cooks from Nigella Lawson's new Itailan cookbook, Nigellissima\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Fort's Sicilian pasta with tomatoes, garlic and almonds from Nigella Lawson's new Italian cookbook, Nigellissima. Photograph: Matthew Fort</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Fort</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nigellissima's version is more rococo and less satisfying. She bungs in everything. It's Sicilian-effect, in the same way that naugahyde is leather-effect. Don't get me wrong. It creates a just-about acceptable pasta sauce, but it misses the point and magic of the real thing. The result is disconcertingly sweet and the anchovies, capers and sultanas add up to overkill. There's nothing actually wrong about Nigellissima's Sicilian pasta with tomatoes, garlic and almonds, but at the same time I can't think why I would want to cook it again.</p> <p>This is a problem that crops up again and again. With the need to produce something different, something original, \u00adNigellissima piles Pelion on Ossa when it comes to ingredients. \u00adSultanas and shallots, marsala and smoked \u00admackerel, capers, red wine \u00advinegar, dill (a herb I've never come across in Italy) and toasted pinenuts in one pasta dish. Or dried chilli flakes, dried and fresh oregano, red wine vinegar and cherry tomatoes in tagliata for two. Or condensed milk, double cream and Aperol, Triple Sec, Cointreau, Grand Marnier, orange juice and zest in instant chocolate-orange mousse. Vermouth, red or white wine crops up in recipe after recipe. Raisins, \u00adsultanas and capers pop up with baffling \u00adregularity. The essential simplicity of Italian cooking gets buried under a welter of unnecessary distractions. The recipes that tempt the most are the most straightforward \u2013 spaghettini with lemon and garlic breadcrumbs; sausages with beans and peppers; \u00adItalian traybake; chicken under a brick, for example.</p> <p>Nigellissima is not without its attractions. Probably the strongest section of the book is that devoted to puddings. Nigellissima is a mistress of the pud, and that's perhaps just as well, for Italy is very weak on the pudding front. I was rather taken with the ideas for figs with honey-cream and pistachios, liquorice pudding and chocolate salami. But for the most part it creaks with the effort of coming up with something new (and something new doesn't always mean something better.</p> <p>You could argue that this kind of deconstruction is a little over the top for the book of a TV series, and so it is. Nigellissima is a promotional exercise pure and simple. The introduction is spotted with references to other books, <a href=\"http://www.nigella.com/\">Lawson's website</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigella_Lawson\">Twitter account</a>, which is a shame. Every now and then Nigellissima fatigue is evident in the limpid prose \u2013 \"from which the views over the Tuscan hills were more enchanting than I can ever say\" \u2013 that sounds like a phrase from a particularly uninspired thank-you letter. I can sympathise. It must be a nightmare cranking out these books to capitalise on a TV series.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Nigellissima begins on BBC2 at 8.30pm, Monday 24 September</em></p>",
  "<p>Where does a creative idea come from? That is the question that leading contemporary artist Doug Aitken is posing in his new exhibition at the Tate in Liverpool.

  "<p>The World Trade Organisation has warned the outlook for global trade is deteriorating, citing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/eurozone-crisis-live\" title=\"\">the eurozone crisis</a> as the main drag on growth.</p> <p>The WTO slashed its forecast for global trade growth this year from 3.7% to 2.5% on Friday, less than half the previous 20-year average. The WTO director general, Pascal Lamy, said there was more risk of things getting worse than better.</p> <p>The news came as Brazil's finance minister lambasted the US and Japan for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/quantitative-easing-not-magic-central-banks\" title=\"\">their latest rounds of quantitative easing</a>, which will devalue their currencies and, he said, trigger a global currency war.</p> <p>Next year the WTO expects trade to grow by 4.5%, compared with previous forecasts of 5.6% growth. That forecast is, however, based on the assumption that current policy measures will be enough to avoid a breakup of the euro and that US politicians will reach an agreement to stabilise public finances and avoid the \"fiscal cliff\".</p> <p>The WTO is targeting 1.5% growth in exports from developed economies, down from its previous forecast of 2% growth. The situation has deteriorated even more for developing countries, where the WTO cut its forecast from 5.6% growth to 3.5%.</p> <p>Lamy said: \"The main reason for the growth slowdown is of course Europe. We also know US growth is lower than expected, [and] Japan is not in great shape.\"</p> <p>The WTO bases its estimates on consensus forecasts that the global economy will grow by 2.1% in 2012 and 2.4% in 2013.</p> <p>The Brazilian finance minister, Guido Mantega, said on Friday that the US announcement on QE had forced the Japanese to follow suit with its own round of printing money, which could have a domino effect around the world. \"They will be stimulating the currency wars as it will lead all countries also to pursue these wars. It's natural other countries will defend themselves from these attitudes.\"</p> <p>He said Brazil, for its part, was prepared to take all necessary steps to prevent the <em>real</em> from appreciating excessively.</p>",
  "<p>It is not very often that a Premier League footballer talks about wanting to see the Loch Ness monster, although this interview with Miguel P\u00e9rez Cuesta, or Michu as he is more commonly known, is always going to be a new experience from the moment we start typing words such as \"coal mining\" and \"<em>humildad</em>\" into Google translate.</p> <p>Michu, the Premier League's joint leading scorer, is an intriguing character, full of surprises. He has found the perfect home at Swansea City, even if he misses the taste of Spanish ham and is wrestling with the language. \"My English is horrible,\" he says as he pulls up a chair at the club's training ground. His English is actually much better than he makes out, although it soon becomes clear that Michu has a habit of underplaying his ability. At one point he claims he is worth no more than \u00a34m, despite the fact that he scored more goals in La Liga last season than any other midfielder and has plundered four in four games in the Premier League.</p> <p>Bought for \u00a32m from Rayo Vallecano in July, Michu was an absolute steal and is already being talked about as the best signing of the summer. \"Thank you so much,\" Michu says, sounding genuinely surprised to hear he is so popular. \"There are a lot of good signings this summer \u2013 [Robin] Van Persie and [Santi] Cazorla. But if people think this I am very happy. To work with Michael Laudrup [Swansea's manager] is good for me. There's only one problem here: the weather. But I love this team, I love this country and I love this city.\"</p> <p>Although Michu's impact has not come as much of a surprise to those who have followed his progress over the past 12 months \u2013 he scored 15 league goals for a team that avoided relegation on the final day \u2013 it is incredible to think that Swansea faced so little competition for his signature and were able to pay next to nothing for a 26-year-old attacking midfielder in the form of his life. \"But Rayo have no money, so \u00a32m is like 'Wow!'\" Michu says. \"I went on a free to Rayo and if they go down [at the end of last season] I am free again. Also there are a lot of crises in Spain \u2014 Rayo's economy is catastrophic. I can tell you that \u00a32m is very good for them. I think my price at the top is only \u00a34m.\"</p> <p>While Michu seems to have little grasp of his value, there is no doubt that his former club were grateful for whatever money they could get. To give an idea of just how bad the financial problems were at Rayo last season, when they travelled to Real Sociedad it took more than five hours because they had to take the scenic route. \"We had no money to pay [for] the toll roads. It was crazy,\" Michu says, shaking his head.</p> <p>That season at Rayo, however, was the making of Michu. His career had never really taken off and at one point, when he was a teenager trying to break through with his hometown club, Real Oviedo, he enrolled on a four-year degree at university studying business administration. He completed the first 12 months but decided to pursue his dream of being a professional footballer and went on to spend several seasons with Oviedo in the lower divisions before joining Celta Vigo.</p> <p>In 2010 Sporting Gijon presented him with a lucrative long-term deal, including the chance to play in La Liga for the first time, but Michu, in an extraordinary show of loyalty to the club he has supported since he was a small child, turned the offer down. \"I could have signed a five-year contract and had more money, but I'm from Oviedo and Sporting is our rival, so I can't play at Sporting,\" Michu says. \"I know [it's unusual]. But Oviedo is my team. Whether they are in the third, second or first division, that never changes.\"</p> <p>About 18 months later it looked as though another opportunity had slipped through his fingers when he missed from the spot in a penalty shoot-out to win promotion via the play-offs. Rayo, however, came in for him that summer and Michu, playing under Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sandoval, the club's coach at the time, was given the confidence to thrive.</p> <p>\"Sandoval was like a father \u2013 he was very important for why I am here now,\" Michu says. \"I believe in myself, but the most important thing is that the trainer believes in you. When I stayed in Celta Vigo for years, I played one Sunday and then two Sundays on the bench \u2013 it's not possible to go to the top. At Rayo Vallecano I played all the minutes. You have the confidence and you can explode, scoring 15 goals. Here I have a lot of confidence from Michael: play, play, play.\"</p> <p>A tall, elegant player, Michu has that knack of arriving in the penalty area at the right time, but he is also prepared to graft, which was why Sandoval liked him so much that he had a picture of him in his office. \"I feel I have two important qualities that represent me: I am a worker and I have <em>humildad</em> [humility],\" Michu says ahead of Saturday's home game against Everton. \"When I arrive at the dressing room people might say: 'You played very bad'. But what I can say is all that I can give is out there on the pitch. When I arrive at the changing room I have died.\"</p> <p>His eyes light up when he talks about the Premier League. Michu has relished the chance to play in front of full stadiums and he says the way that the television money is distributed here makes the league far more competitive than in Spain. \"In England, more or less all the teams have good money. In Spain, it's only Barcelona and Madrid. We can't compete against Barcelona, it's impossible. If you play 100 games, you can win only one. Here, you can win against Manchester United or Manchester City. OK, it's very difficult. But you can win.\"</p> <p>Swansea's remarkable result at Queens Park Rangers on the opening day was proof that the unexpected can happen. Michu laughs as he recalls how Angel Rangel, one of three other Spaniards at the club, told him beforehand that Swansea always struggle at Loftus Road and had stressed how difficult it was to draw, let alone win, away in the Premier League. A couple of hours later Michu got back on the coach and looked at Rangel as if he was mad. He had scored twice in a 5-0 rout. \"It was like a dream,\" Michu says.</p> <p>It was the sort of performance that could not have gone unnoticed back home, especially on the back of a sensational season in La Liga, although Michu is pragmatic about his prospects of a Spain call-up. \"In a lot of national teams if you scored 15 goals you would go to the team. But in Spain it's very difficult. They are the best,\" he says. \"It's a big honour for me that Vicente del Bosque [the coach] talked about me. But there is Villa, Torres, Silva, Cazorla, Mata, Llorente, Pedro, Iniesta, Xavi... a lot of good players. I fight for the dream, but it's not my decision.\"</p> <p>In the meantime he will continue enjoying life in south Wales, which feels like home from home. Asturias, the region of northern Spain where Michu is from, has long been associated with coal mining and steel production and is also popular with tourists because of its rugged coastline and green valleys. \"Wales on steroids\" was how one travel writer described the area. \"They are very, very similar places,\" Michu says, after <em>la miner\u00eda del carb\u00f3n</em> came to our rescue. \"And it does make it much easier for me to acclimatise here.\"</p> <p>Indeed, it is a measure of just how comfortable Michu feels on and off the pitch that he has ventured into a city centre pub to watch football on a couple of occasions and he is already talking about wanting to \"play in the Premier League all my career\". He is also looking forward to travelling around Britain and taking in some tourist attractions. \"I have no time at the moment. But I want to know Wales and Manchester and London,\" he says. \"And I want to go to Loch Ness \u2026 I want to see if I can find the monster!\"</p>",
  "<p>Universal Music has been given the green light for its \u00a31.2bn EMI takeover by the European Commission, but will have to sell off labels that bring in nearly a third of the British company's revenues \u2013 including recordings from Coldplay, Pink Floyd and David Bowie \u2013 in order to gain approval.</p> <p>The deal has already been cleared in Australia and Japan and was also approved in the US on Friday.</p> <p>Valuable EMI assets Universal will have to offload include the historic Parlophone record label \u2013 bar the Beatles \u2013 but also the British company's half share in the perennially popular Now!

Universal will have to sell the labels to companies active in the music industry, or have a \"proven track record\" \u2013 and cannot re-sign any of the artists for a period of 10 years.</p> <p>In the US, the FTC approved the acquisition with a unanimous 5-0 vote, with no remedies or disposals required. The deal has been approved by regulators by all relevant country regulators.</p> <p>Vivendi said that the deal would be able to \"significantly strengthen its ownership of exclusive content\".</p> <p>In an email to staff the outgoing EMI chief executive, Roger Faxon, said: \"With [EC] approval and the imminent clearance in America, as well as those already received from other regulators around the world, UMG has cleared the final hurdle in its quest to become the owner of EMI Music.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Sir Richard Branson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/19/branson-universal-music-virgin-records?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">attempt to buy back Virgin Records UK</a> appears to have been thwarted, as Universal Music will not have to divest the business \u2013 although it is selling Virgin Classics.</p> <p>\"Competition in the music business is crucial to preserve choice, cultural diversity and innovation,\" said the European Commission vice-president in charge of competition policy, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. \"The very significant commitments proposed by Universal will ensure that competition in the music industry is preserved and that European consumers continue to enjoy all its benefits.\"</p> <p>A major concern for the European Commission was the ability for an enlarged Universal Music to dominate the price of digital music, especially licensing deals with players such as Amazon, Apple, Spotify and Vodafone.</p> <p>\"The commission's investigation confirmed that even a customer such as Apple continues to launch new digital music services and that it is not established that it could defeat price increase or other types of worsening of licensing terms by Universal,\" said the commission.</p> <p>Bruce Kilpatrick, head of City competition at law firm Addleshaw Goddard, said that Universal had paid a \"high regulatory price\" but added that the impact of Apple on the music market also helped the deal go through.</p> <p>\"With such an extensive remedies package, Universal has paid a high regulatory price for EMI. But it's important to put this into context: this deal would have been blocked 10 years ago, before iTunes was established, so Universal will still be pleased to have secured clearance and will be confident that it can make the deal work for the benefit of its shareholders.\"</p> <p>As part of the deal Universal has agreed to drop the clause known as \"most favoured nation\" \u2013 which obliges digital customers such as Apple to extend any favourable term granted to rivals also to Universal \u2013 for 10 years.</p> <p>\"This commitment will allow Universal's competitors to negotiate more freely with digital customers and further levels the playing field between these competitors and Universal,\" said the commission. \"The commission concluded that competition on the digital music markets in the European Economic Area will be adequately preserved and that the transaction will have no negative impact on consumers.\"</p> <p>It has come in for intense criticism from the independent music industry, which is concerned about Universal's global dominance, but there has been a positive response to Universal having to sell off valuable EMI's assets to push the deal through.</p> <p>\"Universal are being forced to sell the crown jewels of EMI following their misjudged attempt to persuade the European Commission that there would be no competition concerns,\" said Alison Wenham, chief executive of the Association of Independent Music. \"We congratulate the EC on a very diligent and thorough investigation.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://musicandcopyright.wordpress.com/\">According to the Music &amp; Copyright Blog</a>, Universal has an almost 36% share of total recorded music revenues globally, ahead of Sony Music on almost 22% and Warner Music on 15%.</p> <p>Impala, which represents music companies including Beggars Group, home to Adele, said the remedies were \"not tough enough\" and that Universal's \"arrogance\" had paid off.</p> <p>\"Universal's arrogance has paid off for them ... they have destroyed a significant competitor, and that even with these divestments their ability to dominate and control the market has reached even more unacceptable levels,\" said Martin Mills, chairman of Beggars. \"Anyone trying to start a new digital service will be realising that very soon, and we will continue to look to the regulators to monitor ongoing behaviour.\"</p> <p>EMI's Faxon said it will be \"pretty much business as usual\" for business units of EMI that Universal is retaining.</p> <p>However, the parts that are to be sold off, probably over a period of about six months, will be ringfenced as a separate unit managed independent of Universal.</p> <p>Faxon, who said he will step aside on 28 September when the deal is complete, said that an executive will be appointed in a few days to run the businesses as a \"hold separate manager\".</p> <p>\"His role is to be sure that these businesses continue to be a strong and competitive force on the market, through and beyond the point at which they are sold,\" said Faxon. \"He will report to a trustee whose duty is to assure that the intent of the agreement with the commission is met\".</p> <p>Faxon is already the subject of rumours of a shift to a rival, with Warner Music touted as his most likely future employer.</p> <h2>Full list of divestments</h2> <p>\u2022 EMI Recording Limited (including EMI's iconic Parlophone label, with the exception of the Beatles), featuring artists such as Coldplay, Blur, Kylie Minogue and artists with steady revenues such as Pink Floyd, Cliff Richard and Tina Turner.</p> <p>\u2022 Other EMI labels, such as Chrysalis (featuring Spandau Ballet, but without the Robbie Williams catalogue) and Mute Records (featuring Depeche Mode, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds).</p> <p>\u2022 EMI Classics/Virgin Classics artist and composers and EMI's half share in the popular \"Now!

  "<p>Earlier this week we asked readers to tell us about the first album they bought. The response was huge, and sadly we can only reproduce a handful below.</p> <p>If your first album listed here? Either way, let us know what it was and what you think about it now, in the discussion thread at the foot of the page.</p> <p><a href=\"#139\"><strong>ABBA \u2013 Gold</strong></a><br><a href=\"#120\"><strong>AC/DC \u2013 Powerage</strong></a><br><a href=\"#138\"><strong>Bryan Adams \u2013 Waking Up the Neighbours</strong></a><br><a href=\"#118\"><strong>Blondie \u2013 Plastic Letters</strong></a><br><a href=\"#119\"><strong>Kate Bush \u2013 The Kick Inside</strong></a><br><a href=\"#147\"><strong>Green Day \u2013 American Idiot</strong></a><br><a href=\"#146\"><strong>Limp Bizkit \u2013 Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavoured Water</strong></a><br><a href=\"#115\"><strong>Mike Oldfield \u2013 Tubular Bells</strong></a><br><a href=\"#124\"><strong>Queen \u2013 Flash Gordon</strong></a><br><a href=\"#140\"><strong>Smashing Pumpkins \u2013 Siamese Dream</strong></a><br><a href=\"#111\"><strong>T. Rex \u2013 Electric Warrior</strong></a><br><a href=\"#129\"><strong>Various Artists \u2013 (Street Sounds) Electro 1</strong></a></p> <p></p> <h2>ABBA \u2013 Gold</h2> <p>At the age of 10 I was cajoled into going halfers with my dad on ABBA's greatest hits and thus the momentous occasion of choosing my first album was cruelly snatched away from me by a giant of a man hell-bent on listening to catchy pop melodies. I had only saved up \u00a35 of pocket money and had no idea this wouldn't be enough for an album. Seeing an opportunity to buy the coveted LP at minimum cost to his ego my dad offered to pitch in half the money if I went for ABBA Gold. He then got me, his sweet, blonde daughter to pay for it at the counter (not surprising from the man who baked a cake for his colleagues but told them his wife made it). At the time I was more than happy to go along with it and I can't deny I still enjoy a good bit of Benny and Bjorn on the sly but I do feel a bit deprived since I didn't fully own my first LP and, having grown up listening to the Kinks and David Bowie, I can't help thinking my first album could have been so much cooler.<br><strong>Fiona Hart</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>AC/DC \u2013 Powerage</h2> <p>I was 13 and remember going into the legendary Andy's Records, picking up the cassette (I only had a tape player) and turning it over and over wondering whether to commit several weeks' pocket money to being labelled a 'rocker'. The album did a great deal to improve my street cred as it had come out in a conversation with my friends that had accidentally involved my Mum that 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing' had been the first single I had bought, which received a severe mocking from the cool at school. The shocking album cover with the electric leads coming from Angus Young's hands seems a bit ridiculous now but I couldn't wait for heavy rock that it promised. The songs didn't disappoint: 'Rock 'n' Roll Damnation' was exactly what I wanted to sign up to and 'Sin City' remains one of my favourite AC/DC songs to this day. I've replaced my extensive tape collection with other formats but my cassette of Powerage sits proudly on top of groaning shelves of CDs. Angus's manic expression on the cover will always remind me of the beginning of a fantastic journey of musical discovery.<br><strong>Rob</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Bryan Adams \u2013 Waking Up the Neighbours</h2> <p>The first album that I bought (or rather, asked my parents to buy me) was Waking Up the Neighbours by Bryan Adams, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year.<br> Adams' strongest album, it contained his signature track and record-breaking number one 'Everything I Do (I Do It For You)'. At 6 years old, amidst the hype for Kevin Costner's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, I genuinely believed the music video of a denim-clad Adams strolling across the English countryside and singing of romantic notions was the coolest thing that I would ever see\u2026 and perhaps in some ways I still do! The album is full of catchy rock songs, mostly with lyrics based around a young man being taken with a girl in a whirlwind relationship (\"\"Is Your Mama Gonna Miss Ya?\", \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\", \"There Will Never Be Another Tonight\"). For narrative purposes, I usually omit any mention that this was actually my joint-first album \u2013 I also received Piledriver, a collection of WWF Superstars singing themes based on their characters! <br><strong>Lewis Brown</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Blondie \u2013 Plastic Letters</h2> <p>A Thursday evening in 1978 and I was fourteen years old. Blondie was on OTP, Debbie Harry in an oversized red shirt and red leather boots. That Saturday, I walked to Ealing Broadway, paid \u00a31.79 and hurried out of Boots the Chemist, clutching \"Plastic Letters\". Back home, I gazed at the cover in awe: Debbie Harry in a tight pink dress, the band looking edgy in black leather, adolescent hormones pumping through my blood. <br>I knelt down and lifted the smoked plastic lid on the family music centre. I was careful to touch the only the very rim of the sleek vinyl as I slid it reverently from its sleeve. I placed the record on the spindle, checked it was set to 33rpm, then moved the slider to start. I watched as the turntable started, and the tone arm slowly moved to rest on the spinning vinyl with a tock. Three seconds of hiss, like the drawing in of breath, then the first track leapt out.<br>If you want the music, download it, but it won't be the same.<br><strong>Simon Whitaker-Bott</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Kate Bush \u2013 The Kick Inside</h2> <p>In the summer of 1981, my parents bought me a Ferguson 3016 record player for my ninth birthday. They supplied me with a copy of Absolutely by Madness but I went to Woolworth's with a record token to buy my first album, Kate Bush's The Kick Inside. </p> <p>There has never been a time in 31 years that I haven't listened to it regularly. My first memories of it are deeply connected to the musty smell of the second-hand record player, the mechanical clicking of of the arm as it moved to the edge of the vinyl and sitting listening to this weird and unfamiliar music, alone in my room. </p> <p>The lyrics and sound were a promise of something very grown up, something dark, something strangely pleasing that I was yet to understand...<br><strong>Lucy Sweetman</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Green Day \u2013 American Idiot</h2> <p>My first album was American Idiot by Green Day. My Dad bought this for me in 2006 when I was 12. American Idiot really opened my eyes to music, not just because it's a concept album, but because it helped me through my horrible time at high school. I had never experienced music that could help me feel better. 'Jesus of Suburbia', the second song on American Idiot is probably my favourite of the album. The lyrics and the music was a lot I could- and can still \u2013 relate to. I always listen to the album whenever I'm feeling down because it always reminds me that things will get better. American Idiot paved the way for me to discover other bands who have created rock operas, mainly the godfathers of all rock operas; The Who.<br><strong>Rachel Stewart</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Limp Bizkit \u2013 Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavoured Water</h2> <p>Ask me the question \"what was the first LP you ever bought?\" and several answers come to mind. One is Sonic Youth's 'Dirty', an album that laid the initial paving of the path onto every band I've listened to and enjoyed since, catalysing an ever-growing and invaluable musical lexicon. </p> <p>Or is this 'LP' specifically in the vinyl form? Alas, being born in 1992, vinyl has always seemed mainly superfluous, and thus difficult to romanticise.</p> <p>The real answer, i.e. the first album I exchanged money for in a shop, is of course a much less discerning, far more embarrassing one: 'Chocolate Starfish...' by Limp Bizkit. Fred Durst and co.'s third LP has since come to symbolise, for me, the main reason ten year-olds are essentially without liberty \u2013 they can't vote, smoke, drink or drive, can only see films containing a limited number of 'fuck's, and are often barred from buying CDs with 'Parental Advisory' stickers: they are idiots, and I was no exception.</p> <p>Even if I could find the vocabulary to describe how densely dreadful this album is, it still wouldn't paint a picture any clearer than its equally dreadful cover art. If you're ten reading this, save yourself some time \u2013 buy some Sonic Youth.<br><strong>William Dix</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Mike Oldfield \u2013 Tubular Bells</h2> <p>I was nine and had only one other record (a 45) in my collection which was Sugar Sugar by the Archie's. Actually I had to persuade my brothers to invest in this album with me. I'm glad they did and am a bit ashamed that they never really got their fair share. I still have it and its scratches.</p> <p>This joint investment was made following a visit to a friend's house in Bridgwater where we listened to Mike's bells lounging on beanbags.</p> <p>I was delighted that they featured at the Olympics opening ceremony. I think I'm also right in remembering that this album was Branson's telephone box moment - but I might be wrong.</p> <p>Along with the associated memories above I still enjoy this music with its stilted narration and chrome plated cover art.<br><strong>Adam Winterton</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Smashing Pumpkins \u2013 Siamese Dream</h2> <p>1993 was an unusual year in music. I was 14 and none of my friends could be defined as music lovers. I didn't know anybody whose collection was anything beyond a series of compilation tapes and the odd Prodigy single. Anyone who claims that The Smiths or Stone Roses changed young people's lives simply didn't go to my school. Nobody played guitars. People said East 17 were better than Take That because one of them could play piano! But one day round my uncle's house, I heard Today by The Smashing Pumpkins. He told me they'd done other songs too so I went out and bought Siamese Dream. Songs like Disarm and Geek USA captured so much of what I felt \u2013 youthful and optimistic, yet sort of tragic and hopeless too. The Pumpkins dragged me on to new bands and to music magazines. I couldn't understand why they were mocked, whilst Nirvana were hailed. I truly thought Siamese Dream featured the most beautiful songs ever composed. I don't listen to it anymore, as it's a record that belongs to that time. But I believe that it will have its time again.<br><strong>Ben Morris</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>T. Rex \u2013 Electric Warrior</h2> <p>December 1971. I'm eleven years old, in Brees' Records in Leicester, selecting Christmas presents with my parents. I want some T. Rex. They've been blasting out of the radio all year. Their elfin singer, Marc Bolan, is the coolest thing on the planet. People are saying they're the new Beatles. I don't care. The Beatles are from a different era. T. Rex are our band, for our generation, for now.</p> <p>I choose an album but the girl on the counter says there's a new one. \"Electric Warrior - it's better than this\". She returns with a black sleeve, adorned with an abstract picture of Bolan in gold. Impressive. </p> <p>Christmas arrives and it's on the stereo. It's genius. There are hard-edged tunes, combining swagger with sensibility, and deceptively simple, intriguing lyrics. Words like \"Jeepster\" and \"Mambo Sun\" are invented and chord structures adapted to create memorable signatures, like Get It On. And Life's A Gas is an exemplar of a quality b-side.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2012. Electric Warrior remains timeless. It fused style, inventiveness, attitude and anticipated glam, punk, Britpop. I played it on Sunday, the 35th anniversary of Bolan's passing. It still sounds great, perhaps as great as in 1971.<br><strong>Rob Massey</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Queen \u2013 Flash Gordon</h2> <p>I know others will be retrofitting their youth so that they can claim their first album showed them to be early on the road to the cool, eclectic music lover they are now - but not me. My first album was Flash Gordon by Queen. I was eight years old and having left the cinema with my mum I needed some way to relive the bellowing Brian Blessed and all-American heroes. But in those days there was no other way to do this than buy the soundtrack. Video, DVD, Satellite still mediums of the future and it would be YEARS before it would be on TV! So no alternative but to save up my pocket money, take on a host of the worst chores from my elder sisters and walk past the Our Price store every Saturday to look in at the bright yellow sleeve with Flash emblazoned across the front. When it was finally mine I played it all the time, quoting the lines of dialogue between the tracks (maybe Tarantino had the same album) and although never becoming a Queen fan, it did foreshadow a love of films. Even now as I write this I have an overwhelming urge to shout 'Gordon's Alive' - I just might do it now.<br><strong>Cliff Johnson</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>Various Artists \u2013 (Street Sounds) Electro 1</h2> <p>1984, I was nine years old, attending the mean &amp; edgy classrooms of Steeple Morden village Primary School (Near Royston, Herts).<br>Everyone was into breakdancing, the clothes and the music. How we English country oiks knew about it I don't know, but we did, probably from older kids. We loved the Breakdance movies, showing at the cinema at the time. I used to save up birthday money for trips to Selfridges &amp; Covent Garden with my mum to buy Fila sweatbands, Kappa tracksuits and Adidas &amp; Puma trainers. </p> <p>Electro albums were a way for little kids like me to get a whole load of American Electro/hip hop type music in one go. They were mixed, which was new in those days. No breaks between songs. I bought Electro 1 on tape. You had 'I'm the Packman' by The Packman, 'Break Dance (Electric Boogie) by West Street Mob, with THAT Apache/Incredible Bongo Band break, 'Return of Captain Rock' by Captain Rock and the absolute classic 'Jam on Revenge (The Wikki Wikki Song)' by Newcleus which I still maintain has the greatest synth solo ever recorded. </p> <p>The tape wore out in the end!<br><strong>James Lewis</strong></p>",
  "<p>I recently had the pleasure of hearing from the Conservative MP Robert Goodwill, on the vexed question of \"golliwog\" dolls.</p> <p>These dolls, despite being the subject of dubious collecting fads and a regular feature at BNP festivals, aren't exactly in vogue. The golliwog has long since been removed from Black Jack chews and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1505411.stm\" title=\"\">Robertson's jam jars</a>. In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/05/race-monarchy\" title=\"\">Hamleys declared that it was joining the Queen's estate</a> in banning the items from its shops. Police action has been taken against those displaying such items, on the grounds of incitement to racial hatred.</p> <p>Carol Thatcher with all her charms couldn't avoid the sack from the BBC's The One Show when she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/03/carol-thatcher-faces-ban-over-golliwog-remark\" title=\"\">referred to a black tennis player as resembling a golliwog</a>. And even the redoubts of reaction have decided to part ways with this ugly commodity. Last year, two prospective Tory councillors were expelled for posing with said items as a joke.</p> <p>Still, shops in small towns all across this land are overstuffed with the dolls. While visiting Whitby recently, I learned that golliwog dolls are not just for sale; they can be prizes too.</p> <p>On the West Cliff opposite the famous abbey, overlooking the river inlet from the North Sea, among the fish and chip shops and tourist traps, are the arcade games. The Funland arcade on Pier Road is a main attraction, where you can win yourself a golliwog. There, you find beleaguered mums, straining to win one for the little ones; and kiddies trying to win one for the beleaguered mums. Good old-fashioned family racism.</p> <p>I wrote to the two local Scarborough councillors and to the constituency MP, all Conservatives, and asked if they couldn't take some action over this. If golliwog dolls aren't even considered acceptable in the Conservative party today, there's no reason why they should be accepted in wider society.</p> <p>I received a reply from Robert Goodwill MP, which is worth quoting in detail. First of all, he pointed out that he hadn't received any other complaints, despite the fact that \"large numbers of people from ethnic communities in this country\" visit Whitby. I think \"large\" is pushing it, but there's no reason to get hung up on detail \u2013 certainly not when discussing the \"ethnic communities\".</p> <p>He added that it is \"important that we don't become over-sensitive to situations such as this, where no evidence has been brought to me other than your letter that anyone has been offended or annoyed.\" Roughly translated, this means that even the ethnics are indifferent \u2013 only hysterical PC troublemakers care. But the next passage is a gem: \"I can certainly remember as a child we had dolls of this type at home and it never crossed our minds that it was in any way derogatory to black people in the same way that similar rag dolls with white faces were not deemed to be offensive to any indigenous white people in our country.\"</p> <p>Where does one begin? With the dog-whistling about \"indigenous white people\"? With the classic solipsistic implication that because he didn't experience golliwog dolls as racist, no one else should either? Or with the invocation of childhood innocence, a typical strategy for avoiding historical reality by conjuring a past seemingly undisturbed by racism?</p> <p>Perhaps it would be useful to discuss the tradition of dehumanising racist caricature to which these dolls belong. The English-American author <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Kate_Upton\" title=\"\">Florence Upton invented the golliwog</a> in a series of picture books produced at the onset of the Jim Crow laws, which mandated racial segregation in the American South. She described the character as \"a horrid sight, the blackest gnome\". He was clothed in the same apparel as the black-faced minstrels then prevalent in Europe and North America. He had thick lips, unruly black hair, and his hands and feet were paws.</p> <p>The golliwog, like many related stereotypes of \"primitive\" black people (\"picaninnies\", minstrels, \"mammies\" and so on), quickly found a commercial market, producing a flood of cartoons and advertising imagery. It was taken up as a symbol by Hamleys, Harrods, Trebor and Robertson's jam. This imagery was consistent with a tendency to represent black people through the prism of biological racism. For example, the colonial exhibitions through which European states celebrated their global power featured \"human zoos\" and \"negro villages\".</p> <p>The most insidious feature of these images is that they were intended for consumption by children, part of their socialisation into the adult world of race relations. It is because of this that many apologists for those racist images find it convenient to lapse into sentimental fugue state, in which history is obliterated. Yet, there is always time to grow up. Children may be understandably oblivious to this vile tradition, but adults \u2013 and Robert Goodwill MP is well into his 50s \u2013 have no such excuse.</p>",
  "<p>The party conference season is about to start. The Lib Dems meet in Brighton on Saturday and, over the next three weeks, the three main parties are gathering to talk, drink, affirm their identities and set out their manifesto ideas.</p> <p>But before we hear their policies, we would like to hear yours. We are looking for at least 50 ideas to improve Britain.</p> <p>Please contribute in the comment section below. We're looking for proposals that are specific and practical.

You can also Tweet your suggestions to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnpolitics\">@GdnPolitics</a>.</p> <p>We'll take the best and the most interesting and write them up as a Guardian readers' manifesto.</p> <h2>Social policy</h2> <p><em>Ahead of the Liberal Democrat conference, Patrick Butler has written on the key areas of debate in terms of social policy:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Welfare reform will dominate conference proceedings in Brighton. As one Lib Dem activist puts it: \"The tories want to cut and cut welfare and our job is to scale the cuts back to a position the party is happy with.\" Much of the debate on welfare will centre on where the party draws the line, and whether, as Linda Jack, the chair of the Liberal Left says, the party in coalition can \"hold fast to Liberal values\"</p> <p>In this sense the party's discussions on welfare, as with school examinations, and other areas of social policy will be will be overwhelmingly reactive: a need to find a clear sense of where it stands in negotiations over the limits of existing coalition policy, rather than developing new ideas. </p> <p>But the party also knows it must start to look ahead. Public sector reform is a key area of policy \"differentation\" from the other parties. Mark Pack, co-editor of the blog Liberal Democrat Voice, cites a conference motion and policy paper calling for a revival of mutualisation and co-ops in the NHS, local government, and large private companies as potentially giving a distinctively Liberal Democrat approach to both public sector improvement and more generally, the distribution of power between the state, corporations and individuals.</p> <p>Tim Leunig, chief economist of Centre Left Forum thinktank, sees the the role of the private sector in public services, social mobility, housing, and the environment as crucial policy areas which will enable it to show it is \"a Liberal party and not a conservative one\".</p> <p>More fundamentally, says Jack, the party has to show it can be trusted, that in the wake of its tuition fees fiasco the party's manifesto is \"worth the paper it is written on.\" Social policy development must re-invigorate its grassroots activists demoralised by the loss of hundreds of councillors in May's local authority elections.</p> <p>She says: \"It is not so much about 'is there a big idea?' It is more about how we re-establish our integrity and develop policy in line with our values.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Which policies should British political parties be considering at conference this year?

We can confirm that services have been restored and are now operating normally,\" RIM said in a statement.</p> <p>The glitch was only affecting Vodafone users, a RIM spokeswoman in London said. \"We are currently experiencing a BlackBerry service issue impacting some users in Europe, Middle East and Africa. All relevant support teams are working to resolve the issue. We apologise to any customers who may be affected.\"</p> <p>The outage was not expected to be as damaging as the one RIM suffered last year when BlackBerrys were hobbled for several days.</p> <p>But the timing is far from ideal as Apple continue to lap up worldwide publicity with the much-hyped launch of its iPhone 5.</p> <p>In a now familiar global ritual, Apple fans queued outside shops from Sydney to Tokyo to pick up the tech juggernaut's latest iPhone.</p> <p>Eager buyers formed long lines on Friday at Apple stores in Australia and Japan to be the first to get their hands on the latest version of the smartphone.</p> <p>In Hong Kong and Singapore, buyers had to sign up online for the chance to pick up the device at a prearranged time.</p> <p>The first customers in Hong Kong were greeted by staff cheering, clapping, and chanting \"iPhone 5! iPhone 5!\" and high-fiving them as they were escorted one-by-one through the front door.</p> <p>Apple's new smartphone is also being launched in the US, Britain, Canada, France and Germany. It will go on sale in 22 more countries a week later.</p> <p>The iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, has a taller screen, faster processor, updated software and can work on faster fourth generation mobile networks.</p> <p>The iPhone 5 has become a hot seller despite initial lukewarm reviews and controversy over its decision to dump Google Maps from its standard collection of pre-loaded apps and replace it with its own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/20/apple-maps-ios6-glitches-iphone?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">map app which has been criticised</a> for losing towns, moving zoos and renaming key locations such as Paddington railway station in London.</p> <p>Apple received 2m orders in the first 24 hours of announcing the iPhone 5 release date, more than twice the number for the iPhone 4S in the same period when that phone launched a year ago, and analysts estimate it will ship as many as 10m by the end of September.</p> <p>The controversy over the decision to drop Google Maps is threatening to overshadow the launch as complaints flood in from users. Google is said to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/sep/20/apple-google-maps-headache\" title=\"\">working on a separate map app</a> that iPhone users can download.</p>",

The Department of Health has joined forces with the Alzheimer's Society to launch <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/09/dementia-campaign/\" title=\"\">a new campaign</a> to encourage people to talk to family members showing signs of dementia. On the Not so Big Society blog, social worker and commentator Ermintrude says <a href=\"http://notsobigsociety.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/world-alzheimers-day-2012/\" title=\"\">\"there can be a drive in policy to both marginalise those who have dementias and to increase the pressures on their families\"</a>. She adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dementia still carries a stigma. I know the government refers to a 'dementia challenge' \u2013 subtitled 'Fighting back against dementia' but generally I like to think of it as an opportunity to think about the way that society responds in different way. What are we fighting? Shouldn't we be working with and walking alongside dementia? We talk about an 'ageing population' and a 'tsunami of people with dementia' with an inherent negativity. While most dementias are not reversible, it's importance that the tenets of 'recovery' are not lost in terms of losing hope around a person and promoting a more positive quality of life and environment for those with dementia and for their families where they have them.<br>By referring to a 'dementia challenge' and framing dementia as 'one of the greatest challenges we face' I worry that we remove the responsibility of society to promote a less stigmatising environment around people with dementia. It's that social model of mental health again. Often dementias are forgotten by traditional mental health organisations because there are some differences but I'd like to see a lot of the developments in terms of user voice in mental health extended to dementia services and particularly towards users as well as carers as there is a propensity, particularly in older adults services to assume that the user and carer voice will be one and the same and can be interchangeable. I've been working in services long enough to know the importance of capturing user voice separately from carer voice and think that 'lazy' engagement is much easier than engagement which seeks out those who may have more difficulty communicating. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Dementia UK is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DementiaUK/status/249085399975198720\" title=\"\">inviting Twitter users</a> to \"share ideas about how we can combat stigma and make communities more dementia friendly\", to which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhoseShoes/status/249086976861540352\" title=\"\">Gill Phillips responds</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How to raise dementia awareness? @DementiaUK THROUGH STORIES!

In his latest blog, Mike Barrett, chief executive of the Porchlight homelessness charity, says <a href=\"http://www.porchlight.org.uk/2012/09/20/the-homeless-did-not-choose-the-hand-they-have-been-dealt/\" title=\"\">the number of young people asking for help is on the rise</a>. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... it is at 16-18 years old or even younger for some, that we fall into the myriad of traps that life can spring upon us. Add to that loss of family support and you're in real trouble. Vulnerable young people are just that, vulnerable. They are prey to people who want to exploit them for financial gain, either through prostitution, drug addiction, and drug dealing to feed a habit or through exploitation in an unregistered work place. Surely this is not how we would want to treat our children? But unfortunately we do. So in these cases homelessness is a byproduct or structural issue caused by the loss of guidance and support and, let's not beat around the bush, love. And who is the worst parent? I would say the state. There are more homeless people that have been through the cares system in one form or another than in any other category. The same can be said for our prison population.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Barrett adds that welfare reforms and other budget cuts are making the job of Porchlight and other charities increasingly difficult:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My nightmare is what we do when it comes to making decisions between those we can help and those who we cannot. The spectre of the debate between the deserving and undeserving poor raises its head once again. The problem here of course is that I cannot choose. We have to try and help those who are willing to accept our help, that's why as a charity we spend as little as possible on administration whilst attempting to support our frontline services to deliver the charity's mission.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A new briefing paper for the candidates in the upcoming <strong>police and crime commissioner</strong> elections.

  "<p>No disrespect intended, but Nick Easter is adamant. What has gone before \u2013 and that is three five-point wins; the best start any side has had to a Premiership season \u2013 will count for nothing on Saturday.</p> <p>\"It's been a little bit too comfortable if you like,\" says the Harlequins No8 and former England captain. \"Not with the opposition, but where we've been. We've been at Twickenham. We've been at home. We played an 'away' game across the road at Twickenham and two at The Stoop. We haven't been playing as well as we wanted, the way we finished last season and we want to be moving on, but today is what you play rugby for. We're away at a great venue and it will be a great test.\"</p> <p>The match Easter relishes is Leicester v Harlequins at Welford Road; top versus third, a repeat of last season's Grand Final and, Easter hopes, also a rerun of last season's Harlequins win at Leicester, their only one so far in the league.</p> <p>That 27-18 victory came when Easter, along with a hatful of Leicester players were still in New Zealand and England were still at the World Cup. Harlequins were in the middle of a storming start of the season, while Leicester could barely bag a point and were down the bottom of the table. By the next time the sides met, at The Stoop, Leicester had got their team and their act together and, despite an Easter try, were 43-33 winners and eating in to that early lead that Harlequins had built up.</p> <p>Between times Easter went through a period that, he agrees, was the worst in his career. England got bundled out of the World Cup, Easter was pilloried for his off\u2011the-cuff quip about \u00a335K being flushed down the toilet \u2013 \"I wasn't too worried about that to be honest with you; most people with half a brain could understand that a couple of hours after that defeat it didn't mean anything\" \u2013 and, just to round things off, just before Christmas he got a thanks-but-no-thanks phone call to tell him that after 47 Tests, two as captain, he was not longer wanted by England.</p> <p>At times like that it was handy to have a successful team to which he could turn. \"Conor, [O'Shea, Harlequins' director of rugby] said I could have two weeks off, but I said: 'I'll take one. I want to get back on the horse.'</p> <p>\"You have got to do what you do and we were playing good rugby.\" So good that after a wobble in the semi-final, Harlequins' all-court game and their 30-23 win in the final were seen by some as being a template for the national team, which may have discarded Easter but took nine Harlequins with them to South Africa in the summer.</p> <p>\"We had a fantastic season here last year and we just want to push on a bit,\" says Easter after a particularly testing training session ahead of the Leicester trip. He has not written off his England career, even though he admits a comeback will be \"harder\" this time. However, for a 34-year-old who has just come through a particularly brutal session \u2013 where the natural rhythms of rugby, such as lineout and scrum are discarded for a nonstop action that does not even pause when tries are scored \u2013 he looks particularly spry.</p> <p>Easter calls it a \"challenging\" environment, but one he has committed to for another three seasons. \"You want to get the best out of your self and the environment we have here and the way we want to play it certainly will challenge you. I'm not going to be running it back from the 22 like Mike Brown does and our second-rows are not going to be throwing double miss passes, but it challenges you to be as fit and as good as you can be as an individual.\" It also helps to explain why Easter is rubbing his hands at the thought of Saturday's trip.</p>",
  "<h2>Changes to GCSE exams</h2> <p>Teachers and pupils were keen to share their experiences and thoughts on education secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/17/nick-clegg-gcse-replacement-confidence?commentpage=1#end-of-comments\">Michael Gove's proposed changes to GCSE exams in this thread.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18311907\"><strong>cymraeg147</strong> said:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gove and Clegg have come up with this plan to change GCSE exams to O'levels without any consultation with teachers, pupils, parents, universities or the examining boards. It is just a hobby horse for this self absorbed but incompetent duo. Continuous assessment is out and one exam at the end of a two year course will be the only method of evaluating a students potential. How reckless is that.<br>In so doing they have trashed the existing GCSE qualification in the eyes of industry and the universities, a qualification that many young people have worked hard to achieve.<br>In my experience at uni continuous assessment, as GCSE's currently are, is far more rigorous than a two year course that you can pass or fail on the basis of one exam. When coursework has no relevance to outcomes it may or may not be completed. Individuals can do little work and just cram for a couple of weeks at the end of the course just to get through the exam. Gove and Clegg are reducing the GCSE examination to a memory test devoid of understanding.<br>You couldn't make it up.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18311792\"><strong>misterbee</strong> said:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I took CSE's in the late 60's and they were a complete waste of time.They were the level we were educated to with no encouragement or attempt to raise the our sights any higher.Many people who took them achieved Grade 1 in subjects,which was supposed to be the equivelant to a GCE Grade C,but neither employers nor further ed considered them equal.The fact that Gove tried to bring them back just highlights how divisive this government is.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314784       \"><strong>dobedo</strong> added: </a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As an employer:<br>I do not give GCSE results much consideration at all; previous experience, employment, references and the personal achievements, passtimes, hobbies and activities from outside school carry more weight in assessing employability, as is the appearance and personaility of the prospective employee.<br>For those at 16 and looking for a job, GCSE's lost their credibility a long time ago. Grade inflation has practically made everything below an A a fail.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"     http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314525\"><strong>Thickstp</strong> </a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As someone who benefitted from the old system because I sussed the exam technique early, I was still appalled to see good, bright students get much lower results because their exam technique was weaker.<br>I was doing GCEs at the time when the first experiments with continuous assessment were being tried. In our case with the English Language 'O' Level. This would have been 1972-73. It still included exam elements but the continuous assessment elements were rigorous and I felt it was a much fairer and more balanced system.<br>Some students came into the school to do 'A' Levels as their \"Secondary Modern\" school (a euphemism for a dumping ground in my view), only did CSEs and had no 6th Form. They were in many cases brighter than many who had passed the 11 plus but they again suffered from the exam system when they took A Levels as they had not honed the technique at GCE level.<br>Switching to an exam only system will allow the relatively lazy student like I was at the time, to do better, based on exam technique not substance. I suspect it will also accentuate the advantage for the heavily coached private school candidates. Which is presumably why Gove likes the idea.<br>These so called \"reforms\" are a retrograde step back towards a profoundly flawed system.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18315387\"><strong>ThatWouldbeTelling</strong>:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My own experiences as a school pupil and then as a parent and school governor has given me a concern that school standards have been sacrified over the years in favour of grades and teachers' reputations. This may be unfair but for example:<br>My daughter spent the majority of her year 2 in primary school being taught to the test for her SATs of that year. In effect, that meant that the year was spent mainly on two subjects: Literacy and Numeracy. The school kept putting back the teaching of other subjects until the SATs practice and exams were over. This meant that she only started History lessons in the second half of the summer term. Long before the end of the year the light went out in her eyes to the effect that her mother and I agreed that year 2 was a wasted year for her.<br>I was working on a project covering Germany a couple of years back which requried cold calling German businesses. When a colleague in her mid-20s told me that she had an A @ A' Level in German I asked if she could help with my calls. She said she could barely remember a word of German because her teacher had basically told how to pass her exam but hadn't actually taught her any meaningful aptitude in the language.<br>Two teachers, one my daughter's form teacher in year six in primary school and the other a head teacher speaking to me in my capacity as a school governer, told me directly that these days you have to teach to the test otherwise you can't successfully operate as a teacher or as a school.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314433       \"><strong>mintycakeyfroggy</strong></a> <br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I took GSCE's, I am in no doubt reform needs to take place, GSCE's aren't perfect, largely due to curriculum and differing exam boards. However, if I had not done GSCE's I would have a completely different life. I was suffering in my final year of school from PTSD which included several panic attacks a day. I got extra time in the exam e.t.c. But no one could prevent the anxiety I felt, this undoubtedly affected my memory and my ability within exams. Up until my final 6 months at school I was an A/A* student, my final year exams reduced these grades to B's and C's, as my exam scores were C's or lower. I was not trying any less I was simply ill and unable to perform to my best. Had I had one exam at the end of the year I would have been marked with under C grades, not allowing me to go onto do A-levels, university and post graduate courses. With a final exam there is no look at overall achievemnt.

And they will sell, because you buy the trash in vast quantities.<br>Why oh why do you have this culture of wanting to destroy anything and everything after you build it up first?<br>I am quite convinced that the UK press won't be satisfied until Kate tops herself or is checked into a looney bin. This will be accompanied by endless dirges about the lovely princess who couldn't find happiness. Bleeuuurgggggh. Leave them the fuck alone.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314294   \"><strong>grayfox</strong>:</a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The comparison with page-3 girls is problematic given that these individuals consent to be photographed and are paid following the distribution of the images.<br>But the whole MailOnline sidebar is based around paparazzi shots which makes the faux-outrage at these pictures a little hard to stomach. Didn't the Mail solemnly promise to never use paparazzi shots after Diana? I wonder what happened to that sentiment.<br>In any case I have little sympathy. If you create a personality cult around certain individuals and proclaim them to be special via hysterical coverage, but neglect to establish an absolute dictatorship, this kind of thing is inevitable.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314267\"><strong>ToffeeGuy</strong>:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much as I am no fan of Page 3 or The Sun I don't think the comparison is a fair one.<br>The models on Page 3 want and are paid to be in the paper. Numerous celebrity 'babes' are also complicit in wanting to appear in the papers by attending film premieres in whatever outfit they think will get them noticed. Often there is collusion between media, celebrities and publicists to get their picture in the papers.<br>Ok, getting photographed on a beach is slightly different but celebrities know they are likely to get spotted.<br>The difference here is that Kate was in a private villa. I think there is a hint of naivety in being outdoors anywhere topless within lens distance. A harsh lesson learnt perhaps.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18314092\"><strong>shinything</strong> </a>said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think this is spot on. I could not see the fuss from the beginning. The Dutches was caught topless by the paparazzi, big deal. If it were any other celebrity no one would care, but the British media is still in the illusion that the royals need special treatment. It is fine as you say to have endless parade of topless somen, as long as they are from the lower classes. Kate and William better be prepared, they are treated like the celebrities that they are which means they are top news and anyone who can make money out of them will try. If they wanted to be treated differently they should not holiday in places where they can be caught of guard and as someone said what about the servants, did they not mind seen like that in front of their staff. Clearly not, are we still in the days where kings and queens and dukes and can get away with murder? Clearly we are</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18316082\"><strong>amateurdramatic</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As many of the above have said, Page 3 and \"Boobgate\" (or should that be \"Boobdrawbridge\") are not comparable; however, the criticism of the nip slip / upskirt / long lens culture is spot on. But I think the article is too reductionist and is missing the point. In my opinion, it's not the fetishisation of woman's bodies which is the issue. Remember, the culture is partly driven by photographs in the female glossies of both men and women, sexual and non-sexual images. The issue is one of privacy. Surely it's not difficult to work out if someone would want a photograph printed or not, and surely it's just as easy (if you're unsure) to phone their agent?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18315738\"><strong>ManchePaul</strong> </a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Good grief, the British are so bloody confused, both prurient and puritan at the same time. We are probably the only western European country that is terrified of nudity and freaks out at the possibility of anyone seeing anyone else naked. Certainly France and Germany don't even notice it. Yet at the same time there is this voyeuristic obsession of seeing pictures of half naked women in general, and sneaky long lens shots in particular. The Sun and the Mail seem to have readers who are essentially the looking up women's skirts perverts that appear in court, unless they are taking the pictures for those papers.<br>This woman was not wearing a top on a beach. Pretty normal behaviour on beaches in every other European country. The privacy issue is the one that counts, and it does not matter if she was completely naked or trying on a winter coat: taking long lens pictures is an ugly and wrong business.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18315355\"><strong>Secretary1001</strong></a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Surely the issue is not the body parts that have been photographed but how the photographs have been obtained and whether it's ok to force somebody to share private aspects of their life with the public at large. If you're on private property, a mile from the nearest road and not on a public engagement, surely you have a reasonable right to expect that what you do and how you dress while doing it is something you can keep private. I would have thought that by deliberately choosing such a secluded venue for topless sunbathing it was clear to anybody but a bottom-feeding pap that you didn't want to share any aspect of that sunbathing with anybody but the people with you at the time. It wouldn't matter if they'd only published photos of her picking her nose and eating it, the fact that she didn't want to share her holiday or seek to publicise her holiday and took more than reasonable steps to ensure privacy while on holiday means the photos, let alone the decision to publish them for nothing more that profit and circulation numbers, are indefensible. It's got nothing to do with hypocrisy about tits.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Painkillers</h2> <p>Does taking aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen actually increase your likelihood to get a headache? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/19/headaches-painkillers\">Following new research from NICE</a>, our readers shared their experiences and debated and pros and cons of killing pain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18360039\"><strong>mrsmungo</strong></a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As someone who went to the doctor, after driving back from France where on the road home my vision suddenly split into two very distinctive views !! i went to the doctor where seeing my regular G.P. told me it was a megraine and to take the tablets. The next day my vision split into two very distinctive views again and on returning to the doctors saw a very young locum who immediately asked my wife to drive me thirty miles to the nearest hospital with a C.T. scanner. We arrived at ten o'clock in the morning and after being seen by the junior rergistrar placed on a trolley in a closed down ward to wait my turn at the end of the days scanning list at 6 in the evening. I slept most of the day and when my turn came for the scan i was wheeled into place in the donut shaped C.T. scanner.<br>You know when somethings up when the single technician behind the glass, their face ghastly green from the imaging screen suddenly becomes a multi headed hydra with a plethera of pointing fingers. Within half an hour i was whisked back the other way, thirty miles the other way of my original starting place and starting on a course the changed my life totally. What was on the screen ? A vague image of what was later diagnosed as a super giant cerebral aneursym. NEVER NEVER NEVER under estimate headaches. EVER</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18359443\"><strong>FlamingJune</strong></a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it entirely depends on what is causing the headache or migraine in the first place. I suffered from chronic headaches and migraines for a year and a half (and they are different - migraines can have very varied symptoms for different people, but often people who've never had one can be very scathing). My GP was at a bit of a loss, and kept wanting to prescribe me Migraleve and a mild anti-depressant. I was very against the idea of just medicating the pain without getting to the root of th problem, and certainly didn't want to take an anti-depressant every day. So in my case, this NICE study instinctively rings true and makes sense. I eventually put two and two together and realised there was a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders and a lot of physiotherapy has worked wonders. Unfortunately, as other posters have commented, some people's migraines are triggered by things that are hard to avoid.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18356843\"><strong>misterbee</strong></a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don't know if it's just coincidence,but I used to get a lot of headaches and took painkillers regularly.For some reason (can't remember why now) I stopped taking them and I rarely get headaches now.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18356127\"><strong>Pfutsch</strong></a> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be brutally honest, in a nation which is hopelessly incompetent at dosing its alcohol and junk food intake, it should not surprise us at all that people are over-consuming even simple drugs like aspirin and Ibuprofen. I know several people personally who got into various cycles of 'light' drug use - even things like combining red bull and pro-plus which then develops into a daily habit.<br>A good doctor (and I was lucky enough to find one as a chronic headache sufferer) will enlighten his patient about the causes, steer him/her away from the painkiller approach (which only deals with the symptoms), and recommend massage, exercise, yoga or a change of diet. Stopping smoking and drinking heps enormously (and drinking in combination with Aspirin, Paracetamol or Ibuprofen is really bad for your internal organs in any case).</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18354026   \"><strong>RayNoble</strong></a> <br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I must say I have not been overly impressed by the way this has been handled by NICE in the media. This may not be their fault of course. The key term here is \"could be causing\". Which means that for many it is not 'causing' a problem. It has been estimated that up to 1 in 50 people experience headaches caused by medication overuse and that women are five times more likely to get them than men. NICE haven't really given the background research for this so it is difficult to make sense of it. Of course I don't doubt it. Had someone asked me before this NICE statement I would have suspected that overuse of painkillers had this effect. But I have searched on NICE website but cannot find the evidence behind their press release.<br>One spokespersons for NICE said on TV news this morning that people should consult their GP but then looking rather alarmed pleaded that they don't all rush at once so as not to overload their GPs. A rather inept bit of advice. As if the community can orchestrate when they see their GP.</p> </blockquote> <h2>German week</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/germany-the-accidental-empire\">As part of our week-long series on Germany, </a> readers from the country have been sharing their experiences and thoughts on German society, lifestyle and relationships with Britain. Here is a pick of some of the best comments. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18304824\"><strong>JaneThomas</strong></a> comments on Germany and the economy: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From my experience of Berlin, I have found the Germans to be exceptionally able in administering to the needs of the public. In renting apartments there are those that one can rent if you are a visitor for only a short space of time, there are those that a student can share, there are those reserved for people on a low income and those that can be rented on an ordinary basis. If one is an artist they have the opoortunity of renting their own studio with in a complex or paying a small fee to work in the workshops of the BBK. Transport is varied and generally applied across the city and suburbs. That being said, this steady organisational capacity has begin to be undermined in the past few years by a set of rather greedy investors who wish to benefit from the relative inexpensiveness of the real estate. This will result in accomodation becoming more difficult and a decline in attractiveness for the youth that has made the city a sort-after destination.<br>Will this real-estate boom result in a similar demise that other Euro nations have suffered? Will the German people be able to sustain their economic capacity without standing on the shoulders of the rest of Europe? Or will they find that the developing nations that they have come to rely upon will develop their own capacities to export, thus resulting in declining exports from Germany?<br>Germany lies in the centre of Europe and cannot isolate itself from its neighbours. It needs them to thrive as much as they need Germany.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18300526       \"><strong>callepiedra</strong></a> on German stereotypes:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm half German, half English and knocking on 50. I work in an office in London where sexism and racism are definite no-nos. But when Germany crops up in conversation, so too do the old prejudices and stereotypes. This doesn't offend me because there's invariably no malice behind the comments. I'd say it's more in the way of a conditioned reflex or a conduit for nostalgia for an event that marks Britain's last major contribution to the flow of world history - which I guess brings us back to vfra's Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18330079\"><strong>Brusselsexpats</strong> comments on hipsters in Berlin and the housing market:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can remember the days when residents of Brussels were similarly fed up with \"foreigners\" coming in and causing massive hikes in rent and property prices.<br>Back in the mists of time it was possible for every expat to move into dirt cheap and - unlike Berlin - excellent housing. As the then Common Market expanded, so did the run on property. The result meant that many Belgians on lower or middle incomes were forced to move to the outskirts of Brussels which triggered ever worsening traffic jams into the city.<br>Still housing here is still cheap compared to London (possibly anywhere is cheap compared to London).<br>A friend of mine, whose boyfriend lived in Geneva, said exactly the same thing had happened there only somewhat earlier.<br>At least older Berlin property is spacious. It could always be worse. You could be living in a shoe-box in New York with not even enough space to install a decent kitchen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Thanks for all your contributions this week.</strong></p>",
  "<p>No one has explicitly said it yet. But the suggestion that it might be time to give up on retail is starting to get louder. The latest Local Data Company report, entitled <em><a href=\"http://www.movehut.co.uk/news/ldc-report-warns-too-many-shops/\">Too Many Shops</a></em> makes it clear that we need to bring forward the prospect of alternative uses. Local authorities are already starting the process of turning empty shops into homes. And this week a <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_london_assembly/support-londons-high-streets-agenda\">Greater London Authority debate</a> suggested councils would have to kill some high streets to save others.<br> All this defeatism is against a background of growing indifference in Westminster. Where Government once loudly vowed to save the high street, there's now only the sound of wind whistling down an empty lane. Since the reshuffle of Grant Shapps there hasn't been one single high street announcement from Government. \"Business needs champions, more than ever,\" David Cameron told the country six months ago. Yet, at a time when retail, the UK's largest private sector employer, and one that contributes 20% to GDP no less, is hemorrhaging confidence, there's not so much a show of support from ministers as a resigned shrug of indifference. The recession has taken its toll here in the north west and retailers are angry at the lack of real action by Government to support the high street. In the region with the highest number of empty shops in the country no one is impressed with the Government committing less to its flagship Portas Pilot policy than Jordan Henderson's<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jordan-henderson-not-daunted-by-huge-liverpool-transfer-fee-2297000.html\"> transfer fee </a>to Liverpool.<br> Equally, no one is under any illusion that the high street model of today is sustainable. There are 46,000 empty shops and that's way too many. Yes, the model of yesterday has gone and town centres will never be the same in an era of omni-channel retailing. But that's still no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater and give up on retail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476110\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/13/1326470748653/Rochdale-Pioneers-003.jpg\" alt=\"Rochdale Pioneers\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rochdale knows all about shopping.

It's a big employer, counting for 10.5% of all jobs. In terms of youngsters it accounts for 40% of all under 20's employment. It's a sector that spends 12% of the UK's total investment in training and one that delivers value for money, with goods on average 5% cheaper than the Eurozone and clothes 20% cheaper. It's valuable to the Treasury too. Retailers make a substantial contribution to the Exchequer paying \u00a318billion from the four largest taxes alone. They use fewer Corporation Tax exemptions than other sectors and pay 28% of all business rates. There was a time when the economist Adam Smith said government should listen to our nation of shopkeepers. If Government today were to heed this advice they'd be told in no uncertain terms that bringing in the biggest business rates rise in 20 years during a recession was a foolish policy that could only do great damage to the high street. With reduced consumer spending, too many failed local authority regeneration efforts and counterproductive car parking rises, increased overheads in the form of unrealistic business rates has made retail simply no longer viable in many places. But that doesn't mean the alternative use brigade can proclaim a new beginning for our high street. If the costs have become too prohibitive for retail on our high street how do we think alternative uses can make it pay? Yes there are soft deals to be had. However, this is not sustainable for landlords in the long term. They are businesses too. Too many social enterprises and not for profit organisations with alternative uses will impact upon the nation's coffers through reduced rate income. This will ultimately impact upon front line services. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476111\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/About/General/2012/3/29/1333048931070/Mary-Portas-002.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Portas\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Portas.

Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we want to see diverse high streets with great shops once again at the heart of our communities then Government seriously needs to take a radical approach to business rates, which are proving to be a hindrance to entrepreneurial drive. We're becoming a nation that takes a lot in taxes but gives nothing back.<br> It's no surprise that chains like <a href=\"http://www.kurtgeiger.com/\">Kurt Geiger </a>are now looking to expand overseas because of unreasonably high business rates. For their store in Gateshead they pay \u00a3160,000 in business rates. The chief executive explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>It basically makes the store completely unviable. For a comparable store in the US and Germany, we would pay local taxes of just \u00a310,000.<br> </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Not so long ago I spoke to a retail trendspotter who works for a major department store chain. He laughed at my question about whether the Internet would signal the end of the high street:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nonsense. People will always want to go to the high street because they want to discover things and they want to be with people in a bustling environment. You can't try a dress on over the Internet. You get the 'wow moment' when you pull it off the rack.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> Retailers know this. But they know high streets have to offer a lot more than they currently do to win customers back. To do this we need Government's help to tackle empty shops. The new minister with responsibility for high streets, Mark Prisk, was formerly a small business minister who should be acutely aware of the needs and pressure on small businesses. If he brings this understanding to his new ministerial job along with a sense of urgency then there is still hope for high streets. It's time to move on from competitions and carrots and look at sustainable policy to keep our nation of shopkeepers trading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476112\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348223679311/Paul.jpg\" alt=\"paul turner mitchell\" width=\"140\" height=\"206\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://jp.twitter.com/Paul25Ten\">Paul Turner-Mitchell </a></strong>is a passionate campaigner for North West retail, whether it be taking 'shop local' campaigns to Downing Street, getting his local council to introduce free car parking or setting up an independent flagship local emporium of independent retailers.

  "<p>There are so many dimensions to London's housing crisis I fear that the known universe cannot contain them all.

  "<h2>1) Gene Sarazen v Charles Whitcombe (1927)</h2> <p>A quick quiz question to start, nothing too difficult. When was the first time a visiting Ryder Cup team travelled to the USA kitted out in nice suits, ones that weren't made from garish offcuts and didn't fall apart at the seams? Answer: 1983, when Tony Jacklin became captain of Europe, and ordered the men in charge to stop being such tightwads, and book some bloody seats for the players on Concorde while they were at it. 1983!</p> <p>It should come as little surprise, this being the case, that Great Britain's preparations for the inaugural Ryder Cup, at Worcester Country Club, Massachusetts in 1927, were a risible shambles. Getting to the States in the first place was quite an effort for Ted Ray's men. The magazine Golf Weekly launched an appeal to raise the \u00a33,000 required to send the Brits stateside, but only 216 of Britain's 1,750 golf clubs put their hands in their pockets to donate. In the end, the magazine's editor George Philpot, and garden-seed magnate Samuel Ryder himself, had to chip in a grand to make up the shortfall. The players were sent over on the RMS Aquitania, a six-day cruise over a choppy ocean. Arriving with wobbly sea legs and stomachs to match, they were immediately whisked off to get paggered on fizzy booze at a reception at a nearby country club.</p> <p>In fairness, the US team were strong favourites anyway, despite having been beaten by Britain in a trial run, the \"lost\" Ryder Cup of 1926 at Wentworth. This time they were playing at home, could now call on Gene Sarazen, and were significantly younger than the Brits. The British player-captain Ray, for example, was 50, with his major-winning years (the 1912 Open and 1920 US Open) well behind him; his opposite number Walter Hagen was only 35, had eight majors under his belt, with two Opens and a US PGA still to come. The Brits were also without their first choice as captain, Abe Mitchell \u2013 the cloth-capped chap preparing to tee off on top of the Ryder Cup trophy itself.</p> <p>As it transpired, the US won easily, by 9.5 points to 2.5. They had already secured the cup before Sarazen and Charles Whitcombe completed their singles match, but nevertheless the half Whitcombe earned in an amazing tussle stands as the first great British feat in Ryder Cup history. Sarazen was 25, the hottest property in golf, and would go on to become the first man to complete a career grand slam of all four modern majors. Whitcombe by comparison was a regular top-ten finisher in the Open, but a decent English pro, nothing more. Yet he stormed into a five-shot lead after 15 of 36 holes. Sarazen \u2013 who later described playing in the Ryder Cup as \"a cutthroat proposition\" even in the tournament's infancy \u2013 fought back to all-square within the next ten holes. The two battled tooth and nail until the 35th, which Whitcombe won \u2013 only to capitulate on the last by missing a short par putt to hand Sarazen half a point.</p> <p>Despite the shellacking, the Brits had enjoyed their visit. Arthur Havers, who had won the Open in 1923, recalled being \"submerged by hospitality and kindness\", and was in awe of \"a world of luxury and plenty ... Even the clubhouses were luxurious, with deep-pile carpets, not like the run-down and shabby ones at home, which is all most of us really knew.\"</p> <h2>2) Denny Shute v Syd Easterbrook (1933)</h2> <p>One thing the Brits did really know about was bloody miserable weather, and that's what the two teams had to contend with at the second Ryder Cup, the 1929 staging at Moortown Golf Club in Leeds. The Brits prevailed, the pivotal match being the battle of captains Walter Hagen and George Duncan. Hagen had boasted in the changing room before the match that \"there's a point for our team right there\", but didn't realise Duncan was on the other side of some clothes pegs, had heard every word, and as a result was fuelled by hot and righteous steam power. Duncan whipped Hagen 10&amp;8, posting an early point that would inspire his men to a 7-5 victory. But the weather works both ways, and would scupper British hopes at Scioto Country Club in Ohio two years later, a searing summer sun exhausting Whitcombe's side into a dehydrated dither, the USA sauntering to an easy 9-3 win.</p> <p>Home advantage appeared key, then, but despite the wind getting up at Southport &amp; Ainsdale in 1933, it looked like the USA had finally cracked the code for winning on one's travels. Britain had edged the foursomes by a point, but the States came right back at them in the singles. Sarazen, Hagen, Craig Wood and Horton Smith all posted points for the Americans, while Mitchell, Percy Alliss and Havers recorded wins for the Brits. It all came down to the match between Denny Shute of the USA and Britain's Syd Easterbrook. The showdown became the Ryder Cup's first full-blown classic, a nerve-jangling nonsense right up there with Nicklaus-Jacklin in 1969, Langer-Irwin in 1991, and Leonard-Olazabal in 1999.</p> <p>Shute took all of three holes to go three up, aided and abetted by some hopeless yipping on the greens by Easterbrook. The Brit pulled himself together, and was only one hole behind by lunch, having at one point dragged the scores back all square. Shute retained his advantage until the 15th \u2013 and 33rd \u2013 hole, whereupon Easterbroook drained a 15-foot birdie putt. The pair were all square again. Easterbrook then knocked in a 20-footer on 16 to save a half, before rattling in another saver on 17 which stopped Shute taking the match dormie and retaining the cup for America.</p> <p>And so to the 18th. With a huge crowd gathering, both players nervously dumped their drives into sand. Shute found another bunker, greenside, with his second, while Easterbrook laid up. The Brit then sent a wedge to 20 feet. Shute splashed out to a similar distance. It was at this point that the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII and guest of honour at the event, won the cup for Britain. As the players lined up their putts, the Prince was greenside chatting to Hagen. The US captain desperately wanted to advise Shute to play it safe, lay up for two putts and an almost certain half, a tactic which would ensure the draw. But he felt \"it would be discourteous to walk out on the future king of England\", and so Shute was forced to fly solo.</p> <p>Easterbrook putted first, his ball stopping three feet shy of the cup. Shute then had a putt to win the trophy outright for the US, but instead of playing the percentages, had a rush of blood and trundled his effort seven feet past the hole. Suddenly he had a pressure putt to save a half \u2013 and he missed. Easterbrook still needed to knock in his testy three footer, but did so. Britain had regained the cup, thanks to a superlative putting performance from Easterbrook over the closing holes, doubly remarkable given his early travails on the greens.</p> <p>Watching in the stands was Samuel Ryder. It would be the last action he would ever see, as he failed to make the trip to Ridgewood, New Jersey in 1935, and died a year later. A fitting way to go out, then. And well done to Edward VIII, who seems to have annoyed quite a few people by packing in the King gig in 1936, but did more than enough for the old country with this single act in our book.</p> <h2>3) Lloyd Mangrum v Fred Daly (1949)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396469454\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2012/9/20/1348157390197/Lloyd-Mangrum-008.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyd Mangrum\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyd Mangrum lights up a smoke during a 1940s Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.

Both countries were still recovering from the traumas of war, and the Brits had to cope with the double whammies of food rationing \u2013 never a sportsperson's friend \u2013 and a week-long, two-legged sea and rail journey to get to the Pacific Northwest. A thrashing, yes. But a humiliation? These were the toughest of times, let's show these good people a little respect.</p> <p>Still, an 11-1 scoreline is an 11-1 scoreline, and two of America's biggest wins that weekend came courtesy of Lloyd Mangrum, who won both his foursomes and singles matches 6&amp;5. Now, it's pushing a point to say that the war did Mangrum any favours. But what he had to go through seems to have shaped a somewhat relaxed attitude to the comparatively insignificant pressures of tournament golf.</p> <p>Mangrum \u2013 a debonair Rhett Butler lookalike with pencil moustache and a fag always on \u2013 drove reconnaissance jeeps for the army in the Second World War. During the D-Day landings, he washed up on Omaha beach. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge. On one mission, he shattered his arm and shoulder when his jeep tipped over. On another, a sniper shot him in the knee as he attempted to rescue a stricken colleague. A third big day out ended prematurely when some shrapnel lodged in his granite jaw. He was awarded two Purple Hearts for all this assorted bother, although he would later joke that he had picked up his injuries while hot-footing it half-cut from a Paris brothel. Not a bad record for a man who, as a professional golfer, could legitimately have dodged the draft. \"I don't suppose any golfers who were combat soldiers, marines or sailors will be able to think of a three-putt as one of the really bad troubles in life,\" he suggested, between draws on his snout.</p> <p>In 1949, this insouciant approach helped him to secure the cup for the USA. This staging, at Ganton Golf Club in Scarborough, proved to be the first real needle match between the nations. The Americans swanned over with a crate containing 600 steaks, concerned that rationing would scupper their gannetry. Their offers to share the meat offended the proud British, although that was nothing compared to captain Ben Hogan's official complaint regarding the depth of the grooves on the British team's clubs. The match referee ruled in favour of the USA, and a Scarborough pro had to hastily file down the faces of the offending sticks.</p> <p>The Brits, with blazing pique, came storming out of the blocks to win the foursomes 3-1, but the Americans came straight back at them the following day, becoming the first team to turn around a two-point deficit in the singles. Dutch Harrison mauled Britain's top player Max Faulkner 8&amp;7 in the opening match, and the dye was cast. The cup was retained by the USA before the result of the final match between Mangrum and Fred Daly, though a Daly win would have at least levelled the scores. As it transpired, he had no chance. He shot 66 in the morning, but the ice-cool Mangrum \u2013 perpetually sucking on his cheroot \u2013 shot 65 which gave him a one-hole lead at lunch. Daly won two early holes in the afternoon to momentarily take the lead, but Mangrum simply pressed on the gas, winning five holes in a row to take the tape with a 4&amp;3 win. Daly had done next to nothing wrong, and would have won this outstanding match on nine out of ten other days, but on this one Mangrum was simply unbeatable.</p> <p>The Americans didn't have it all their own way on the trip, mind. Just before they went back home, the British government devalued the pound, causing the victorious team no end of heartache at the bureau de change as they assessed the damage to their previously bulging wallets. Still, at least the steak went down well.</p> <h2>4) and 5) Jim Turnesa v Peter Alliss (1953); Dave Douglas v Bernard Hunt (1953)</h2> <p>Britain hadn't won the Ryder Cup since 1933, but there was genuine hope that Henry Cotton's young team could snatch it from the Americans' grasp at Wentworth in 1953, especially as Ben Hogan \u2013 who had just completed the Hogan Slam by winning that year's Masters, US Open and Open \u2013 announced he wouldn't be available for the USA, having given up competing in 36-hole matches.</p> <p>The Americans, however, still had quality in depth, and they breezed to a 3-1 lead after the foursomes. An illustration of the gap between the two sides came in the match between the American playing captain Mangrum and Sam Snead, and Eric Brown and John Panton. On the 471-yard par-four 12th, Panton welted his drive down the middle, then the teak-tough Brown creamed a 2-wood as hard as he could. The ball came up 80 yards shy of the green. Snead, following up Mangrum's booming drive, hit a lazy 4-iron way over the flag. The US won that particular match 8&amp;7.</p> <p>Much of that British hope rested on the shoulders of two promising youngsters: the 23-year-old Bernard Hunt, and Peter Alliss, who had just finished in the top 10 at the Open and at 22 became, for the time, the youngest player to play in the Ryder Cup. Cotton showed faith in his kids, sending them both out on the first day \u2013 although both lost \u2013 then placing them at the business end of the singles on day two. It would ultimately prove an unwise decision, but how thin the line between right and wrong.</p> <p>The US started singles day by notching another point, Jack Burke seeing off Dai Rees easily enough. But just as the visitors prepared to glide home, the tide turned. Daly eviscerated Ted Kroll 9&amp;7. Eric Brown then dealt with Mangrum in a tetchy match, Brown complaining that the American's yellow pastel sweater was putting him off, Mangrum refusing to concede a one-foot putt simply to annoy his opponent. But Brown was immense, to the extent that the normally unflappable Mangrum four-putted one green. Another British point, Brown winning by two holes.</p> <p>The Americans began to feel jittery. Snead had been five holes up on Harry Weetman with six to play, but then collapsed in a style described by the Guardian's legendary Pat Ward-Thomas as \"pathetic\": he flayed his ball into the trees four times, covering the next five holes 6-4-6-6-5. All square going down the last, Weetman birdied as Snead finished with a miserable par. Another point for the home side, the overall score was level at 4-4, and all the momentum was with Britain.</p> <p>Max Faulkner lost to Cary Middlecoff by one hole in the fifth match of eight, but in the final match Harry Bradshaw saw off Fred Haas 3&amp;2. As Bradshaw \"walked proudly home\" (Ward-Thomas) he left two matches out on the course. The two matches involving the British rookies. Could they deliver the 1.5 points required to bring the cup back home? \"The last tragic moment ... will never be forgotten by the thousands who were present,\" sighed Ward-Thomas, \"nor by the two young men whose awful destiny it was to be the victims of the cruellest turn of fortune that could have been devised.</p> <p>\"The wonderful, almost unbelievable prospect of victory against the great American golfers became suddenly, desperately real. Then just as the cup was touching the lips it was smashed with brutal, heartrending suddenness. The tale must be told and it will be told again and again down the years whenever golfers meet.\"</p> <p>Pick up your heavy hearts, folks, here we go again. First the Alliss match. On the 16th tee, the future voice of golf was leading Jim Turnesa by one hole. Ramping up the tension, he'd just been told that if he held on for a point, Britain would be assured of a tie, and most likely win the cup too. Turnesa drove into the trees, but the ball hit a punter and bounced back out. He found a greenside bunker with his second, from which he scrambled par. Alliss couldn't get up and down from the front of the green and lost the hole, then drove one yard out of bounds on the 17th to lose another. He was now on the 18th tee, one down, desperately hoping to salvage a half, and that Hunt behind him \u2013 one up on Dave Douglas, who had just driven out of bounds on 17 \u2013 could hold on for a win.</p> <p>Turnesa drove into trees again. He could only knock the ball back out into the fairway, and hit his subsequent approach to the par-five closing hole short. Alliss, meanwhile, split the fairway with his drive, then swished the smoothest of irons just in front of the green. Then, disaster. \"Alliss fatally decided to use a pitching club instead of a putter or straight faced iron ... he fluffed his shot,\" reported our man PWT. \"He put the next two feet from the hole. Turnesa holed out in three more anxious-looking shots, and then in tremendous silence poor Alliss missed the hole and victory once more became a dream.\"</p> <p>The hole halved in bogey six, the match lost, the chance of an outright British win gone. \"I made an awful bodge of it,\" Alliss would recall years later. \"I've had to live my whole life with the guilt of messing up that chip.\" Still, a win in the last match would ensure the consolation of a tie, even if the US would retain the cup anyway. Hunt, one up thanks to his opponent's errant drive on 17, just required a half. Both he and Douglas made it to the final green in regulation, roughly 30 feet from the cup. Hunt lagged his first putt to within three feet. Douglas two-putted for his par, meaning all Hunt had to do was tap in to win the match, and level the overall scores. But he couldn't make the shortest shot. \"High above the great trees, beyond the sun-filled sky of evening, one could almost hear the mocking laughter of the gods mingled with American sighs of relief.\" Britain would have to wait a wee while longer yet to regain the cup.</p> <p>But Alliss and Hunt could take at least some consolation from the fact that the pressures of the Ryder Cup can get to any man. Upon accepting the trophy, the winning captain Mangrum, the war hero with two purple hearts, sucked long and hard on a cigarette, exhaled slowly, and announced that he would \"never ever captain an American team again because of the nine thousand deaths I suffered in the last hour\".</p> <h2>6) Tommy Bolt v Eric Brown (1957)</h2> <p>We can't leave poor Alliss and Hunt like that, so here's their feel-good story of redemption. Four years later, at Lindrick Golf Club in Rotherham, both lads \u2013 now men \u2013 were selected once more and pitched straight into battle in the opening match of the foursomes. They lost that match, but there was no shame in coming second best to the strong US pairing of Dow Finsterwald and that year's Masters champion Doug Ford. And anyway, the rest of the team did little better, the States taking what was fast becoming their trademark 3-1 lead going into the singles.</p> <p>The US team had been so certain of retaining the trophy that the PGA didn't bother to cancel the insurance they had taken out on it. This was premium hubris. Britain would come at the Americans at full pelt in the singles. They had illustrated just how desperately they wanted to end their 24-year wait for the cup before a single Titleist had been teed. Rees had dropped Faulkner and Weetman for the final day, and the latter had sent the toys sailing from the pram along the sort of high arc that'd make a Rory McIlroy drive look like a weekend hacker's topper. He moaned to journalists that he'd never play for Rees again. It would earn him a one-year playing ban.</p> <p>It wouldn't be the last tantrum of the day, though, nor the most spectacular. Rees sent out the street-tough Eric Brown in the opening match against Tommy Bolt. With the team already two points adrift, a win was crucial, but Britain had only managed one victory in the opening singles match in 11 previous attempts. Brown lost the opening hole, and scraped a half at the second, but by the 7th was three up, and gained a further hole on Bolt by lunch.</p> <p>Bolt clawed back to within two holes, but with the crowd cheering wildly at Brown's every swing, and according to Ward-Thomas \"exceeding courtesy\" whenever the American slipped up, the Scotsman never relinquished his lead, eventually recording a 4&amp;3 win. \"They are the most unfair crowd I have ever seen,\" spluttered Bolt afterwards. \"They cheered every time I missed a putt. How unsporting can you get?\" The American stormed off to the changing rooms, where he broke the shaft of his wedge over his knee in impotent rage. And you thought this all started at Kiawah in 1991.</p> <p>Britain had the wind in their sails. Peter Mills levelled the overall scores with a victory over Jack Burke. Then it was the turn of Alliss, whose contribution is somewhat bittersweet, but nonetheless crucial to the narrative. He bravely lost 2&amp;1 to Fred Hawkins, Ward-Thomas noting: \"It was sad that Alliss had to lose. In the whole match few had played as well. He <strong>fought</strong> back from three down to one up and then Hawkins, who was on the brink of collapse, produced a faultless finish of rare character that was just too good for him.\" The BBC's mellifluous poet is unlikely to agree, but this defeat added a delicious and wholly necessary zest to the win, for an ecstatic Hawkins had left the course with a click of the heel and a glide in his stride, only to be told that his team-mates had got themselves into an awful pickle behind him. \"I was concentrating on my match and I thought we were winning,\" he muttered, dead eyes staring into the distance as the enormity of what was unfolding hit home.</p> <p>And what was unfolding was this: Ken Bousfield beat Lionel Hebert 4&amp;3, the captain Rees mauled Ed Furgol 7&amp;6, Hunt beat Ford 6&amp;4, Christy O'Connor beat Finsterwald 7&amp;6, and Harry Bradshaw halved with Dick Mayer. Hunt's routing of the Masters champion was payback for the foursomes, and also a personal release from the pain of 1953. Rees' huge captain's contribution was just reward for his years of service, the Welshman having played in every cup since 1937 without once before tasting success.</p> <p>The way the points flooded in, it was Bousfield \u2013 informed of the importance of his match by the rested Faulkner \u2013 who sealed the deal for Britain. \"Those were the days before scoreboards and walkie-talkies,\" recalled Bousfield. \"All of us playing would have no idea what was happening if it wasn't for Max. We might have won without him, but he was magnificent that day. I'll never forget what he did.\" Where the petulant Weetman had got to while Faulkner was ignoring his own personal disappointment and putting in a shift for the team was not reported. Also missing in action due to temper issues was Bolt, who after turning his pitching wedge into several hundred matchsticks, had stormed off site, refusing to appear at the trophy presentation. At least Bolt's team-mates were big enough to congratulate their conquerors in the honourable fashion that, the odd scrape notwithstanding, has to this day remained a signature of this fine competition. \"We were properly thrashed,\" shrugged Ed Furgol. \"I think the British professionals are among the finest in the world,\" added US captain Jackie Burke.</p> <p>The last word went to Harry L Moffitt, head of the US PGA and presumptive policy purchaser, who in his after-dinner speech threw in this zinger, a mix of self-deprecation and defiance: \"Don't bother to insure the trophy. We hope to have it back soon.\" Cue a 28-year stroll over barren terrain for the Brits. But that's another chapter ...</p>",

It will now launch in summer 2013 and the subsidy payments will be made over a period of seven years.</p> <p>For oil-heated homes off the gas grid that install a \u00a33,000 solar hot water system, owners would receive roughly \u00a3200 per year in RHI payments for seven years, in addition to an ongoing annual \u00a380 in bill savings, meaning the upfront cost would be recovered in 20 years.</p> <p>However, most homes are currently heated by cheaper gas and will struggle to recoup their investment for more than 30 years at the proposed rates, only getting back around \u00a3250 a year on bill savings and payments. Most solar thermal systems cost between \u00a33,000-\u00a35,000.</p> <p>Paul Barwell, the chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, welcomed the RHI but said \"the tariff level proposed for solar thermal will concern many of our members\" and the association would be pushing for higher rates.</p> <p>Dave Sowden, chief executive of the Micropower Council, told <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2207017/renewable-heat-incentive-set-to-fire-up-domestic-market\" title=\"\">BusinessGreen</a>: \"The tariff levels for biomass and solar are problematic and will probably not provide adequate returns to help these technologies flourish.\"</p> <p>RHI payments will be estimated based on the likely generation of the renewable heating system, measured in kWh (units), rather than based on a metered system. The rates, paid over seven years, are 17.3p per unit for solar hot-water panels, 12.5-17.3p for ground-source heat pumps, 6.9-11.5p for air-source heat pumps and 5.2-8.7p for biomass boilers.</p> <p>The Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) hopes the scheme could help drive 380,000 renewable heating installations by 2020 - <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-demography/families-and-households/2011/stb-families-households.html\" title=\"\">around 1.5% of the UK's 26m homes.</a> Greg Barker, the climate change minister, said: \"We need to revolutionise the way we heat our homes and businesses and move away from expensive fossil fuels, not only to cut carbon but to help meet our renewables targets and save money on bills.\"</p> <p>Many in the renewables industry welcomed the announcement.

  "<p>Marketing a film in the digital age can be tricky to get right. There's perpetual tug of war between fans who want to find out about the film before its release and the film companies who want to protect their project; at the same time, film-makers also want to promote and create excitement about their films by giving the fans snippets of what they want. </p> <p>But consider this: in a situation where the fans think they have won the tug of war by extracting snippets of new information about a particular film, it could be that the film company marketing gurus have simply let go of the rope. A few days ago, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/17/robocop-first-pictures-joel-kinnaman\" title=\"\">pictures of Joel Kinnaman surfaced online, wearing a thoroughly un-robotic Robocop suit</a> on the set of Jos\u00e9 Padilha's new remake. Despite the largely negative reaction from fans and bloggers, the pictures got people talking passionately about the film. A savvy marketing coup? It's not beyond the realms of possibility that these pictures may even have been leaked by the film company.</p> <p>Giving the fans what they want can, however, be a dangerous game to play. Earlier this year<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/mar/22/ridley-scott-prometheus-fox-ship\" title=\"\"> Ridley Scott's film Prometheus launched what must be one of the most impressive marketing campaigns ever</a>; it even included a company website for the fictional Weyland Enterprises and a video of a fictional TED talk launching the Prometheus project. Combine this with the release of multiple viral video trailers and you have the perfect example of a hype-building, excitement-inducing machine. The campaign took the film to a $380m global box-office takings, but a question remains: did Prometheus' marketing strategy give too much away?</p> <p>The bombardment from grandiose marketing strategies shows no sign of letting up, however \u2013 and we are now seeing almost as much attention directed towards the first airing of official trailers as we have towards the release of the film proper. The teaser trailer has, of course, been around for ages, but the pomp and circumstance surrounding their release has taken a step up lately. Steven Spielberg's new biopic Lincoln offered <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/11/lincoln-teaser-trailer-oscars\" title=\"\">a 44-second trailer </a>advertising the official premiere of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/14/steven-spielberg-lincoln-full-trailer\" title=\"\">full trailer</a> on Google, followed by a webcast with Spielberg himself. This may engage the fans, but the whole process is getting very close to the edge of parody. How long before we get a trailer for the teaser trailer?</p> <p>On top of this, trailers themselves are getting longer, with most official ones clocking in at well over two minutes in length. This means that, assuming there are two or three trailers released for a film, you already have over five minutes of footage to examine before you've even thought about buying a ticket. I've never read Stephen Chbosky's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147832/perks-of-being-a-wallflower\" title=\"\">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a>, but it would be easy to come up with an accurate summary of the plot after a single<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/13/perks-of-being-wallflower-quidditch\" title=\"\"> viewing of the 2:30 trailer</a>. It's the equivalent of giving away all but the last chapter of your book for free in the hope that people will cough up for the final chapter.</p> <p>Do film companies really think this plan is just about crazy enough to work? But the day will surely come when they reveal too much, extinguishing the desire to see the film itself.</p>",
  "<p>Coming out at work is probably one of the most empowering things I've ever done in my career. But deciding to do so was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made.</p> <p>I'd separated from my wife in 2003 and came out to friends and family shortly thereafter, but fear kept me living only part of a life. It wasn't until 2007 that I felt able to tell people at work that I was gay \u2013 and I can honestly say I've not looked back since. Today \u2013 without fear \u2013 I assume greater responsibility because I feel more able to achieve success.</p> <p>Stumbling across IBM's LGBT employee network was the catalyst I needed. If you're in a similar situation, and scared to come out, it's important to find out what your employer offers in terms of general diversity and LGBT-specific network groups. Check out your organisation's intranet to see what you can find; you may be surprised at how much support is out there. Once you know where the resources are, reach out to them (even if it's on a confidential basis) to find out more \u2013 again, you may be surprised at what you learn.</p> <p>If you're still concerned, consider this: no company wants to be seen as discriminatory in any way. Therefore, if you feel discriminated against by taking the brave step of coming out at work you will nearly always find a means of addressing this situation within your organisation.</p> <p>You may also be worried about dealing with clients or external parties \u2013 often one of the hardest aspects of being authentic at work. Discussing your concerns with your managers can help immeasurably, as having them on your side will provide the voice and support you need. You'll be surprised at how many managers are willing to go to bat for you once they know and appreciate your concerns.</p> <p>So why take the step when so many people seem to think that one's sexuality has nothing to do with one's job?</p> <p>The truth is that the lack of authenticity, which comes with hiding your sexuality, can do you a disservice at work. You could appear reserved or distracted when dealing with your colleagues and may not bring your full self to the table to deal with work's challenges. This can have obvious effects on how you are treated by colleagues, as well as restrict your motivation and creative abilities, impacting on your overall performance.</p> <p>Coming out can also have positive ramifications on one's career. In my case, identifying myself as gay led me to be selected by HR internal talent assessments for specific leadership training. This training has helped me transform my leadership capabilities, making me a far more confident and motivated employee and leader. As a member of our LGBT community, I've also become a mentor for a straight member of IBM's UK executive leadership team, providing me with further opportunities to share insights and influence the organisation at a higher level.</p> <p>I realise that the kind of support I've received from IBM is sadly not available to everyone. But it should be. If your organisation doesn't create an environment where everyone feels welcome, it won't be successful in the long term. I wholeheartedly believe that the more someone is allowed to be themselves, the better they are able to do their job.</p> <p>Competition for talent is a huge issue for industry. Companies that do not offer a work environment where people are comfortable about their sexual orientation will limit their ability to recruit the best talent. They will not only fail to hire high calibre LGBT candidates, but also straight candidates who value a diverse and inclusive workplace.</p> <p><em>Vince Cipollone is the corporate development executive at </em><a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/uk/en/\" title=\"\"><em>IBM</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Recent indications of a weakening global economy have led many people to wonder how pervasive poor economic performance will be in the coming years. Are we facing a long global slump, or possibly even a depression?</p> <p>A fundamental problem in forecasting nowadays is that the ultimate causes of the slowdown are really psychological and sociological, and relate to fluctuating confidence and changing \"animal spirits,\" about which George Akerlof and I have written. We argue that such shifts reflect changing stories, epidemics of new narratives, and associated views of the world, which are difficult to quantify.</p> <p>In fact, most professional economists do not seem overly glum about the global economy's prospects. For example, on 6 September, the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oecd.org%2Feco%2Feconomicoutlookanalysisandforecasts%2FInterimassessmentpresentation6September2012.pdf&amp;ei=mhRcUJSiKoyzhAfjioDwBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6AktJh-E76M-E7LMLhyhTniOecg&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">OECD issued an interim assessment on the near-term global outlook, written by Pier Carlo Padoan</a>, that blandly reports \"significant risks\" on the horizon \u2013 the language of uncertainty itself.</p> <p>The problem is that the statistical models that comprise economists' toolkit are best applied in normal times, so economists naturally like to describe the situation as normal. If the current slowdown is typical of other slowdowns in recent decades, then we can predict the same kind of recovery.</p> <p>For example, in a paper presented last spring at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oecd.org%2Feco%2Feconomicoutlookanalysisandforecasts%2FInterimassessmentpresentation6September2012.pdf&amp;ei=mhRcUJSiKoyzhAfjioDwBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6AktJh-E76M-E7LMLhyhTniOecg&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">James Stock of Harvard University and Mark Watson of Princeton University unveiled a new \"dynamic factor model,\"</a> estimated using data from 1959 to 2011. Having thus excluded the Great Depression, they claimed that the recent slowdown in the US is basically no different from other recent slowdowns, except larger.</p> <p>Their model reduces the sources of all recessions to just six shocks \u2013 \"oil, monetary policy, productivity, uncertainty, liquidity/financial risk, and fiscal policy\" \u2013 and explains most of the post-2007 downturn in terms of just two of these factors: \"uncertainty\" and \"liquidity/financial risk.\" But, even if we accept that conclusion, we are left to wonder what caused large shocks to \"uncertainty\" and to \"liquidity/financial risk\" in recent years, and how reliably such shocks can be predicted.</p> <p>When one considers the evidence about external economic shocks over the past year or two, what emerges are stories whose precise significance is unknowable. We only know that most of us have heard them many times.</p> <p>Foremost among those stories is the European financial crisis, which is talked about everywhere around the globe. The OECD's interim assessment called it \"the most important risk for the global economy\". That may seem unlikely: Why should the European crisis be so important elsewhere?</p> <p>Part of the reason, of course, is the rise of global trade and financial markets. But connections between countries do not occur solely through the direct impact of market prices. Interacting public psychology is likely to play a role as well.</p> <p>This brings us to the importance of stories \u2013 and very far from the kind of statistical analysis exemplified by Stock and Watson. Psychologists have stressed that there is a narrative basis to human thinking: people remember \u2013 and are motivated by \u2013 stories, particularly human-interest stories about real people. Popular stories tend to take on moral dimensions, leading people to imagine that bad outcomes reflect some kind of loss of moral resolve.</p> <p>The European crisis began with a Greek meltdown story, and it appears that the entire global economy is threatened by events in a country of only 11 million people. But the economic importance of stories bears no close relation to their monetary value (which can be measured only after the fact, if at all). It depends, instead, on their story value.</p> <p>The Greek crisis story began in 2008 with reports of widespread protests and strikes when the government proposed raising the retirement age to address a pension funding shortfall. Reports began to appear in global news media portraying an excessive sense of entitlement, with Greeks taking to the streets in protest, even though the increase was modest (for example, women with children or in hazardous jobs would be able to retire with full benefits at just 55, up from 50).</p> <p>That story might have invited some gossip outside of Greece, but it gained little purchase on international attention until the end of 2009, when the market for Greek debt started to become increasingly unsettled, with rising interest rates causing further problems for the government. This augmented news reports about Greek profligacy, and thus closed a negative feedback loop by attracting intensifying public interest, which eventually fuelled crises in other European countries. Like a YouTube video, the Greek story went viral.</p> <p>One might object that most people outside of Europe surely were not following the European crisis closely, and the least informed have not even heard of it. But opinion leaders, and friends and relatives of the least informed in each country, were following it, and their influence can create an atmosphere that makes everyone less willing to spend.</p> <p>The Greek story seems connected in many people's minds with the stories of the real-estate and stock-market bubbles that preceded the crisis in 2007. These asset bubbles were inflated by lax lending standards and an excessive willingness to borrow, which seemed similar to the Greek government's willingness to take on debt to pay lavish pensions. Thus, people saw the Greek crisis not just as a metaphor, but also as a morality tale. The natural consequence was to support government austerity programmes, which can only make the situation worse.</p> <p>The European story is with us now, all over the world, so vivid that, even if the euro crisis appears to be resolved satisfactorily, it will not be forgotten until some new story diverts public attention. Then as now, we will not be able to understand the world economic outlook fully without considering the story on people's minds.</p> <p>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a> 1995\u20132012</p>",
  "<p>In 2011, I joined a UK government mission to the Netherlands to study strategies for \"designing out landfill\". The Dutch introduced a ban on landfill in 1995 and are now pioneering new approaches to resource efficiency. Our visit took us to facilities that sorted, recovered and managed \"resource\" (or waste, as we were still defining it in the UK).</p> <p>One of these facilities recycled fridges and freezers, and I was struck by the variety of models being processed. Every single appliance was different. This meant that every time a disassembler tried to get the valuable compressor out from the back of a fridge before it was crushed, a new set of challenges arose, with different sizes and types of screws, fittings and frames all blocking the way. It made me think that if fridge designers were to work alongside disassemblers, they would see with their own eyes the problems inherent in their designs. Perhaps we would have better fridges and better designers as a result.</p> <p>Waste affects every part of our society: businesses, the government, local authorities and the public all play a part in its creation, management and disposal. A staggering 98% of the resources that flow into the economy end up as waste within six months. The UK alone produces about 290m tonnes of waste a year. While there have been significant improvements in the UK's recycling rates in the past decade, we are still losing valuable streams of resource into landfill.</p> <p>The problem is exacerbated by what organic chemist Mike Pitts has called the \"ecological rucksack\" of materials used to make a product. Even a simple A4 piece of white paper requires 10 litres of water to produce.</p> <p>Last year's government review of waste policy deemed the current levels of raw material usage in the UK manufacturing industry to be unsustainable. Like many developed countries, the UK economy is highly dependent on several at-risk materials, and resource security is a growing concern. Nearly a third of profit warnings issued by FTSE 350 companies in 2011 were attributed to rising resource prices.</p> <h2>Wilful ignorance<br></h2> <p>As a society, we seem to have very little knowledge of, or interest in, what goes into making the products we consume. Take our love of the mobile phone. In 2011, when the world's population was 6.8 billion, there were 5bn mobile-phone subscriptions globally. In the UK, there were 80m subscriptions, with 1,000 mobile-phone replacements sold every hour. At the same time, an estimated 80m working mobile phones were retained in UK households, lost in drawers and cupboards.</p> <p>Every mobile phone is made from approximately 40 different elements, including copper in the wiring, indium in the touchscreen and gold in the circuit boards. As the price of metals and minerals rises, it increasingly makes financial sense to recover these elements. There is more gold in a tonne of mobile phones than there is in a tonne of mined rock from a gold mine, and it is far easier to extract it from a phone than from a mine. Other elements could also be extracted, if mobile phones were designed to facilitate material recovery.</p> <p>The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that the EU could save at least \u00a3220bn a year if we were to design products in a way that supported resource recovery and eliminated waste streams. This model of a circular economy is a shift from the old \"take, make, waste\" linear business model to one of \"lease the resource, make the product, recover the resource and then remake it\".</p> <p>With its expertise in design and manufacturing, the UK is well placed to create these cyclical systems. Janez Potocnik, European commissioner for the environment, has said that a move towards the circular economy would reduce material costs and exposure to volatile resource prices. It would also promote innovation and employment in growth sectors of the economy and increase Europe's competitiveness in the global marketplace.</p> <p>Potocnik adds: \"Many business leaders believe the innovation challenge of the century will be to foster prosperity in a world of finite resources.\"</p> <h2>Built to last</h2> <p>Design sits at the heart of the challenge to create a circular economy. Approximately 80% of a product's environmental impact is \"locked in\" at the design stage, so understanding production cycles and reconfiguring them for maximum effectiveness is key. We cannot simply substitute one material for another without understanding the consequences.</p> <p>Designing in this way is complex. Gone are the days of \"sustainable\" or \"eco\" design, when a simple change of material to a recycled alternative would give a project environmental credibility. This system calls for investigation into materials at a molecular scale. It demands true co-creation, with all stakeholders involved in the lifecycle of a particular product. Finally, it requires a new logistical approach to capturing and recirculating materials.</p> <p>This effort needs to be led by businesses. At the moment, it is rare to see a company setting a design brief that includes requirements to recover material. Now, however, the business model is changing and the economic imperative for recovery is growing stronger.</p> <p><em>Sophie Thomas is the co-director of design at the </em><a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/\" title=\"\"><em>RSA</em></a></p> <p><strong>The RSA is launching a programme called the Great Recovery. Run in partnership with the Technology Strategy Board, with support from industrial players, it will seek to fill the knowledge and innovation gaps associated with designing for a circular-economy model.

  "<p>As the economy falters the government is not so much pursuing a comprehensive growth strategy as frantically searching for things to throw out of the basket before the balloon hits the ground. Local government controls are among the first objects to hand.</p> <p>Planning rules are a major target for the deregulators. But in their haste to stimulate economic activity ministers are ignoring the fact that planning is a great deal more than red tape. It is, in part, about conflict resolution \u2013 between competing strategic priorities when looking at the big picture, and about personal wellbeing when it comes to your neighbours plans for their house.</p> <p>Now leafy, Conservative-run Richmond upon Thames council in south-west London <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19657931\" title=\"\">is in open revolt</a> against the government's relaxation of conservatory planning rules.

Pickles may secure a few headlines with this stunt, but he won't shift the growth figures.</p> <p>New environment secretary Owen Paterson has rightly railed against low broadband speeds in rural areas, but the government's solution \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/briefings-and-responses/-/journal_content/56/  10171/3706695/ARTICLE-TEMPLATE\" title=\"\">allowing cable companies</a> much freer rein to rip up streets and install ugly junction boxes in towns and villages \u2013 is a short-sighted solution that will offend many traditional Tory voters.</p> <p>Yet the most dangerous proposal may still be to come: the thinktank Policy Exchange has floated the idea of bribing people to accept building on nearby greenfield sites, including the green belt.</p> <p>The report is called, <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/item/why-aren-t-we-building-enough-  attractive-homes-myths-misunderstandings-and-solutions?category_id=\" 24\"\" title=\"\">Why Aren't We Building Enough Attractive Homes?</a>; a better title would be, Is Urban Sprawl Really So Bad? The whole point of the near-inviolability of green belts is that they improve the quality of life in cities and protect the countryside from generation to generation. Shoving money into the pockets of people who just happen to live nearby at a particular moment is a squalid way to inflict lasting damage.</p> <p>Remember that Nick Boles, the new planning minister, was Policy Exchange's founder. What is striking is how major parts of the planning proposals are likely to be most fiercely resisted by the Tories' core vote. It highlights the tension between the party's free market wing and its traditional small \"c\" conservative base.</p> <p>The red tape slashers have also been targeting procurement rules. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude was unhappy to discover that the pile of central government advice on procurement came close to matching the height of the people trying to understand it. On investigation it became clear that many \"EU rules\" \u2013 the weary explanation for endless public sector procurement hurdles \u2013 were often barnacles that had built up over the years with little or no legal basis. Councils do have something to learn from the centre on this occasion \u2013 speeding up procurement, cutting the costs of tendering and making it easier for small companies to get contracts.</p> <p>When it comes to trying to make public services more efficient the government has made some <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/media-releases/-/journal_content/56/10171/  3716447/NEWS-TEMPLATE\" title=\"\">sensible changes</a> to rules around adoption and fostering which will free up social workers and allow foster carers to make more decisions.</p> <p>But the government has blundered badly in applying its \"small is beautiful\" approach to statutory guidance on safeguarding children. Stripping back over 700 pages of guidance to 68 may seem clever, but the Association of Directors of Children's Services, in an unusually <a href=\"http://www.adcs.org.uk/download/consultation-responses/2012/  ADCS%20response%20to%20consultation%20on%20revised%20safeguarding%20  statutory%20guidance.pdf\" title=\"\">blunt response</a>, attacked the proposals for multiple serious failings. These undermine critical areas such as information sharing, the roles of schools and the NHS and the handling of allegations against people who work with children. There is even confusion over councils' legal responsibilities. Ministers were more interested in cutting the guidance rather than getting it right.</p> <p>In the current frenetic climate, with ministers increasingly desperate to find something \u2013 anything \u2013 that will spur growth or improve public sector efficiency, the government is often showing poor judgment. Regulations and guidance are easy political targets but they are also the means by which we resolve disputes, treat people fairly and keep people safe.</p> <p><em>Richard Vize is a commentator on public policy and management.

  "<p>It is often said,and usually true, that by the time the world becomes fascinated with a particular trend, then those at the cutting edge have already invented the next big thing.</p> <p>The hot device on the stands for the 50,000 television executives at this month's IBC broadcasting technology get-together in Amsterdam was the connected TV, but the true trendsetters were discussing connecting everything. That is, not just syncing your laptop or your mobile to your favourite TV programme, but how to create a new eco-system of connectivity that will involve most of the electronic devices in the home, including the fridge.</p> <p>Among those thinking this was the new executive vice-president of global media for Samsung Electronics, David Eun, who gave his first official appearance in his new role at IBC where he fleshed out an all-embracing vision with, of course, Samsung devices at its heart.</p> <p>As the head of the new global media group and an adviser to the president of Samsung's mobile group, Eun is a leader in the concept of creating a new means of electronic distribution that encompasses more than just the obvious communication devices. Currently, the hype is about all the entertainment screens (such smartphones and laptops and, increasingly, televisions) being connected to the internet, but Eun sees a bigger picture \u2013 all of those devices and more being connected to the internet and to each other.</p> <p>Samsung is not the only consumer electronics firm to be thinking beyond hardware \u2013 LG and Sony have also launched smart TVs loaded with apps as well. But Eun is well-placed to have this kind of a strategic vision because Samsung sells a lot of screens: it has been the leading seller of TVs for seven years now, which is more than Sony, and in the US Samsung sells more each year than its next three competitors combined. The company has also more recently become a powerhouse in mobile phones, outselling Apple's iPhone for several quarters, which has only added to the acrimony between the two companies over patent disputes, especially since the recent US court decision this summer that went against Samsung, awarding Apple $1bn in damages. Samsung's latest smartphone, the Galaxy 3S, shipped 20m in its first 100 days, while Apple's new iPhone 5 sold out online two days after its 12 September launch.</p> <p>Eun won't discuss the patent suit, saying that he sees his job to build on Samsung's device distribution prowess. \"All these screens are connected to the internet but they are not yet all connected to each other,\" he said. \"Once we connect all these devices to each other we will effectively have one of the world's largest platforms for distribution content, services and advertising.\"</p> <p>The question is can Samsung create an \"ecosystem\" of software, hardware, services and customer support with the same kind of success as Apple? According to David Mercer, vice-president of digital consumer practice at Strategy Analytics, Samsung has not yet proven that purchasers of its TVs will also remain loyal to the brand enough to also purchase a Samsung tablet and mobile phone. \"The different branches of the company need to work better together in consumers' minds,\" said Mercer.</p> <p>Eun, a 45-year-old Korean-American and a former executive at AOL, Google and NBC, was employed by Samsung only in January, but has since begun to set out his stall to help take the South Korean electronics giant in a new strategic direction in terms of its future focus. Of course, Samsung will continue to manufacture and innovate its hardware products \u2013 it spent $9bn on R&amp;D last year alone \u2013 but he is also thinking about the company's software developments and he's been meeting with companies and creatives around the world to match up relevant content and services that can be tapped into via the company's own device network. He is also talking about making some strategic investments in companies with services or software that will help build up the appeal of Samsung devices. He said he spends as much time in New York and Silicon Valley as we does in Korea and clearly with the trip to Amsterdam he is looking at Europe as well for both partnerships and acquisitions to build on the approximately 2,000 apps that Samsung already has on its \"Smart Hub\" on its connected TVs. \"Samsung hasn't had to do lots of acquisitions historically because of its scale and share of talent,\" Eun said. \"But acquiring other companies is a way for us to accelerate our entry into the content services space.\"</p> <p>Eun talks a lot about the \"power of the distribution network\", ie the ability to sell lots of devices quickly. One reason for this is that Samsung has embraced a more \"open\" ecosystem than Apple in terms of its approach to payment and content, using both Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows 8 as well as a new alliance with Intel called Tizen, which is an HTML 5-based platform for apps. \"At Samsung I have understood the importance of distribution and the importance of proximity to the user,\" said Eun. \"One the things that has blown me away about the opportunity is that Samsung creates more devices \u2013 and so we have more touch points with consumers \u2013 than virtually any other company on the planet.\"</p> <p>And for Eun it's not just the usual TV and phone suspects he is talking about, but other white goods products like refrigerators and windows, which Samsung also makes. \"We already have windows that are also displays and they have virtual shades,\" explained Eun. \"There is a world, and it is not far away, where the mirror above the sink in the bathroom is a display and is connected to all the other devices that we make.\" Eun says that he already can see the day when his young kids say to him: \"Daddy do you really mean you used paper and magnets on the refrigerator to communicate with Mom? Why didn't you just put a screen there?\"</p> <p>With his background in Silicon Valley, Eun is also keen to see the TV set evolve into a more easily updateable device and he spoke at IBC about Samsung's development of an \"evolution kit\" for that will be used to upgrade TVs already in the market to move them more to the kind of replacement cycle more typical of smart phones, laptops and tablets. \"Our TV sets are increasingly modular,\" said Eun.</p> <p>Samsung may be thinking outside of the box about connectivity ideas for the near future, but the company is certainly not alone. The demand for smart technology devices is increasing almost exponentially \u2013 the demand for connected devices is booming, while second-screen app providers like Shazam and Zeebox are causing a stir in terms of pushing the current boundaries of connected and socialized content. \"Regardless of where you start now \u2013 on the content or on the hardware side \u2013 you need to understand both,\" said Eun. \"There is no silver bullet but there are important paths to pursue and that's what we are doing.\"</p> <p><em>Kate Bulkley is a journalist and media commentator.

  "<h2>What we wanted to do and why </h2> <p>A new initiative launched this week between the <a href=\"http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Canal &amp; River Trust </a>and<a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/?utm_source=PPC_BR_Core_EX_5&amp;gclid=CJjb26DtvLICFYKMfAod13oAgQ\" title=\"\"> JustGiving</a> aims to give supporters more choice and control over how the money they raise is spent. For the first time, people can choose to fundraise for specific canal-related projects, knowing that 100% of their money will go directly to that appeal. Anyone visiting the trust's website can now select from 50 local projects they would like their JustGiving contributions to support.</p> <p>Research shows that people who support the trust have an affinity with a particular stretch of waterway \u2013 the 200 metres they walk their dog each morning or the five miles they run on a Sunday. Fundraisers who use the <a href=\"http://www.canaljunction.com/canal/kennet_avon.htm\" title=\"\">Kennet &amp; Avon Canal </a>want their money spent on improving the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal. Boaters in Birmingham will overwhelmingly want their money spent on their city's canals, rather than London's or Manchester's. And so on.</p> <p>I Donors decide on their preferred project, fundraise and can then monitor the impact their money is having. This will benefit us as a charity; with people confident about how we are using their money, we hope to see a larger increase in the number of people fundraising for us. We also know that donations are being directed on the projects that people care about.</p> <h2>What this kind of approach means for charities </h2> <p>In recent years, the charity sector has made great strides in being more accountable to donors. But being told what your fundraising is being spent on is just a start. Having the control and choice over where it is spent before you begin to fundraise is a different ball game.</p> <p>Choice and control are second nature across our lives. They're everywhere \u2013 from red-button choices on TV to self-booked holidays replacing packaged alternatives. Fundraisers should expect similar options when donating to their favourite charity.</p> <h2>How digital technology enabled us to do this</h2> <p>For charities to succeed in an increasingly competitive environment, it's vital that they use all the technology at their fingertips to give their donors a smooth user journey. Today's digital natives expect a simple and secure online donation process as standard. They aren't going to wait for a six-monthly newsletter to tell them how much was raised. So running these appeals entirely online ensures that there is a sense of momentum for people to get on board.</p> <p>It is also quick and easy to gain support \u2013 no ring-arounds chasing family and friends for the cash they pledged a few months before. It is easy to monitor, with online metrics enabling people to see the impact of their contribution to a particular project.</p> <h2>Will giving more control to supporters mean only the most popular and visible projects are boosted?</h2> <p>The answer is that it shouldn't. Charities remain responsible for setting the right balance. In the trust's case, the 50 projects have been selected to sit alongside our ongoing improvement and maintenance work. So even if donors favour some projects over others, as an organisation we are still ensuring the areas most in need are supported.</p> <p>We hope this initiative is the starting point for a new type of relationship with our supporters. As a new charity launching into a very crowded market, with so many good causes already competing for our shrinking wallets, we know that we need to engage effectively. We need to provide new ways for people to support us, and have those choices better reflect individuals' interests in our work. Only by doing so are we going to earn their support, raise income and, in the longer-term for the Canal &amp; River Trust, help people recognise our inland waterways as the national treasure they are.</p> <p><em>Ruth Ruderham is head of fundraising at the Canal &amp; River Trust</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Dan, a busker who specialises in Beatles songs, peers with more than a little suspicion at the bright green note, before slipping it into his breast pocket. \"Just on the off-chance it'll work,\" he says. \"I'll try and swap it for a cup of tea later.\"</p> <p>It certainly will work as long as Dan finds one of the rapidly rising number of cafes, pubs and restaurants that recognise the <a href=\"http://bristolpound.org/\" title=\"\">Bristol pound</a>, a local currency launched this week to support independent traders, engender civic pride and perhaps nudge the ailing economy in this corner of south-west England in the right direction.</p> <p>More than 300 businesses \u2013 including butchers, bakers, solicitors, plumbers, electricians, book stores, art galleries, a chimney sweep, supplier of firewood, even a pole dancing tutor \u2013 have signed up, making the Bristol pound the largest local currency in the UK.</p> <p>The idea is simple: to encourage consumers to spend more of their money in the local independent shops that accept the one, five, 10 and 20 pound notes and stop money leaking out of the area to faceless multinationals, unknown shareholders or the discredited banking system.</p> <p>The scheme is creating a buzz. New businesses are joining every day and consumers are queuing to exchange their sterling pounds for the Bristol equivalent (the rate is a simple-to-understand 1:1). Shops are planning discounts for customers who proffer the Bristol pound and some businesses considering paying employees partly in the local currency. The city council has said it will accept Bristol pounds as payment for business rates.</p> <p>\"The phone has been ringing off the hook,\" said Cieran Mundy, director of Bristol Pound, the community interest company that runs the scheme with the <a href=\"http://www.bristolcreditunion.org/\" title=\"\">Bristol Credit Union</a>. \"We've had interest from across the globe, from the US, Russia, even China.\"</p> <p>Mundy thinks the world is looking for new ways of doing business, of breaking the grip of huge corporations and banking giants. \"This isn't going to solve the financial crisis but it might inspire others to create their own schemes aimed at improving things locally,\" he said.</p> <p>Before the centralisation of the banking industry it was common for towns and cities to have their own currencies. In more recent times forward-thinking towns and communities including Totnes in Devon, Lewes in East Sussex and Brixton in south London, have launched their own pounds. But the Bristol's is being billed as bigger and more sophisticated.</p> <p>The company (motto: Our City, Our Money) has made available \u00a3125,000 worth of the currency and thinks in excess of \u00a3500,000 will be in circulation by this time next year. Customers can pick up the notes at the credit union and other points across the city. Those with accounts at the credit union can also make payments via their mobile phones. The notes have holograms and other features just like \"real notes\". They are not legal tender \u2013 accepting the notes is voluntary.</p> <p>Big business is taking an interest with one budget airline asking if it can get involved. Unsurprisingly, the Bristol Pound company is not keen. They cannot stop anyone accepting the Bristol pounds but will not encourage national or global companies to take part. It's all about local money for local people.</p> <p>But does the scheme actually work? The Guardian exchanged \u00a320 sterling for four crisp, beautifully-designed Bristol Pound fivers at the Bristol Credit Union in the Stokes Croft area of the city and went on a spending spree.</p> <p>First port of call was the co-operative <a href=\"http://www.cafe-kino.com/\" title=\"\">Cafe Kino</a> a few doors down from the credit union, where barista Yoshino happily accepted one of the fivers for a bowl of soup and gave the change in Bristol one pound notes (plus sterling coins).</p> <p>\"I really like the idea,\" she said. \"We've got a good local community of independent cafes and shops in Bristol. This seems a very good way of keeping the money within the city.\" Cafe Kino is already planning to trade with one of its main suppliers, Essential, using the Bristol pound.</p> <p>The greasy spoon cafe a few doors down does not take the Bristol pound, nor does the amusement arcade. A hot dog seller simply shakes his head when offered a Bristol fiver. There are no signs saying the Bristol pound is accepted outside the various massage parlours in the area.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.prsc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">People's Republic of Stokes Croft shop</a>, whose specialities include Banksy greetings cards, have yet to join officially yet. But assistant Scott makes a phone call and a note is accepted for an anti-Tesco mug.</p> <p>On Christmas Steps, closer to the city centre, art gallery owner <a href=\"http://www.jennylifegallery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Jenny Life</a> is signed up and believes it will be popular with tourists as well as local people.</p> <p>Across the way, Pete Snowman, who runs the <a href=\"http://www.bristolcidershop.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bristol Cider Shop</a>, accepts the Bristol pound and suggests the success of the scheme thus far is a manifestation of a desire to live in a more sustainable, locally-focused way. \"There's a danger it may just be a trendy thing to do for a bit. But with a bit of luck it could go from strength to strength and become a symbol of a new way of thinking about your local community. Let's hope so.\"</p>"
