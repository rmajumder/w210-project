  "<p>The amount of power expected to be generated from gas by 2030 has quadrupled in the last year, according to official projections that will infuriate green campaigners who are demanding greater use of renewable energy sources.</p> <p>They claim that the statistics, buried in recently published government documents, will leave the country unable to meet its carbon emission targets. The figures will reinforce the sense that chancellor George Osborne is winning his battle to downgrade the role of green energy in favour of a dash for gas.</p> <p>The coalition is divided over energy policy, with Osborne favouring a major increase in gas use, promising generous tax subsidies to the shale gas industry at last month's Tory party conference. The Liberal Democrats want greater emphasis on renewable energy. The chasm was laid bare last week when Tory energy minister John Hayes declared \"enough is enough\" over onshore windfarms, only to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\" title=\"\">slapped down within hours</a> by Lib Dem energy secretary Ed Davey.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/ec_social_res/analytic_projs/en_emis_projs/en_emis_projs.aspx\" title=\"\">Data</a> from the department of energy and climate change show the amount of power being generated from gas by 2030 leapt from <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/media/viewfile.ashx?filetype=4&amp;filepath=11/about-us/economics-social-research/3124-annex-i-total-cumulative-new-capacity.xls&amp;minwidth=true\" title=\"\">8GW in its 2011 projections</a> to <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/media/viewfile.ashx?filetype=4&amp;filepath=11/about-us/economics-social-research/6670-annex-i-total-cumulative-new-capacity.xls&amp;minwidth=true\" title=\"\">31GW in the same projections 12 months later</a>. The data also show that, as it stands, the carbon targets for the 2020s \u2013 called the fourth carbon budget \u2013 will be broken. Less than a tenth of the gas power is projected to have carbon capture and storage technology fitted to trap and bury carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p>The revelations come as the coalition's all-powerful \"quad\" \u2013 David Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander \u2013 prepare to meet again this week to hammer out a deal on the government's delayed energy bill, which will set out the UK's energy sources for decades. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/17/energy-policy-coalition-green-agenda\" title=\"\">last meeting</a> failed to agree after discussion was dominated by an impromptu pledge from Cameron to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-bill-tariff-plan\" title=\"\">legislate to force energy companies to give customers the lowest tariffs</a>.</p> <p>The continuing uncertainty has led the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/coalition-wind-farm-dispute-renewables\" title=\"\">energy industry to warn</a> that billions of pounds of investment in the economy may be lost.</p> <p>\"The idea that unabated gas is a long-term solution is mistaken,\" said Tim Yeo, the Conservative MP and chairman of the energy and climate change select committee. \"There is a significant risk in being very dependent on gas in the 2020s because the world price may be much higher than it is now.\"</p> <p>Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy secretary, said: \"There is a real risk the government's dash for gas will blow a hole through our climate change targets, undermine investment in clean energy and leave households vulnerable to price shocks and rising energy bills.\"</p> <p>But Davey said: \"We need more gas-fired power stations to keep the lights on, but the vast majority of this will be to replace old polluting plants. It will be alongside new nuclear, CCS [carbon capture and storage] and the continued deployment of renewables, and it will under no circumstances be allowed to jeopardise our legally binding carbon budgets.\"</p> <p>An energy department spokeswoman said: \"The projections only take account of policies for which funding has been agreed.\"</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> has also learned that subsidies for new gas plants are very unlikely to be limited in the way that support for renewables is capped by Treasury rules. The so-called capacity mechanism compensates gas plants for operating intermittently as back-up for increasing amounts of wind and solar power. Ministers believe capacity payments are crucial to keeping the lights on and that a limit would be unworkable.</p> <p>David Kennedy, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, the government's official advisers, said a capacity mechanism was needed: \"But you have to be very careful about its ambition. You don't want this to trigger a [major] dash for gas and less low carbon investment.\" The CCC has warned that extensive use of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/gas-government-row-energy\" title=\"\">gas was \"incompatible\" with carbon targets</a> and could therefore not be government policy.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: \"Ed Davey has been caught writing a blank cheque to the gas industry. With the impacts of climate change becoming ever more obvious, this is precisely the wrong time to be committing public money to new fossil fuel investment.\"</p> <p>Last week, when appearing before the energy committee, Hayes declined to confirm that the government would meet a coalition commitment to develop four carbon capture storage demonstration plants. CCS is seen as crucial if the UK is to balance its backing for gas with environmental commitments.</p> <p>\"The government committed to supporting four CCS projects,\" said Labour's shadow energy minister, Tom Greatrex. \"Yet this week's announcement on CCS made no commitment to any support to the four projects.\"</p> <p>Privately, some in government think spending billions of pounds on the four plants would be difficult to justify in the current economic climate. But Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, said it was important that all four schemes went ahead.</p> <p>Jeff Chapman, chief executive of the Carbon Capture &amp; Storage Association, said: \"To select less than four projects will deal another devastating blow to investor confidence.\"</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have pinpointed the Scots pine as the next well-loved British tree species that could fall victim to foreign pathogens. They believe that the expected devastation triggered as ash dieback disease sweeps Britain \u2013 which could see most of the country's 90 million ash trees killed off \u2013 could soon be followed by a second invasion.</p> <p><em>Pinus sylvestris</em> is considered to be particularly vulnerable because two major pests that attack it have already established themselves in western Europe: the pine wood nematode, a worm that infects pine trees and causes pine wilt, and the fungus <em>Fusarium circinatum</em>,<em> </em>which causes the disease pitch canker.</p> <p>Both pathogens are poised to spread to Britain, say tree experts, and a simultaneous double attack would be devastating. The Scots pine is the national tree of Scotland and is distinctive for its blue-green needles and rich orange-red bark. It is also an important source of timber in the UK.</p> <p>\"I am extremely worried about the Scots pine,\" said Dr Steve Woodward, reader in tree pathology at Aberdeen University. \"It is an iconic tree to these islands and it is particularly vulnerable to these two tree pathogens, both of which have established themselves in France, Spain and Portugal and are causing tremendous damage there.\"</p> <p>Woodward was speaking last week at a briefing at the Science Media Centre where leading researchers outlined the risks now facing the forests, woods, gardens and parks of Britain following the discovery that ash dieback, caused by the fungus <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, has established itself.</p> <p>Ian Boyd, chief scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said the disease was probably now infecting mature trees in Kent as well as East Anglia, where it was first found. \"The disease almost certainly spreads through spores on the wind but may also spread through fallen leaves,\" said Boyd. However, he ruled out the use of chemicals to treat the disease as impractical given the numbers of trees involved.</p> <p>Ash dieback is just one of \"a tidal wave of pathogens\" that are arriving in Europe, added Dr Martin Ward, Defra's chief plant officer, who described the situation as terrifying. \"Unless we have better biosecurity in the EU it will be very difficult to stop them coming in,\" he added.</p> <p>This view was backed by Woodward, who feared the Scots pine was the most vulnerable of all UK trees to future pathogen invasions. \"We know that pitch canker is now established in northern Spain where it affects native pines, and we know that the Scots pine is susceptible to it. We also know that thousands of hectares of pines have had to be felled in Portugal to try to contain the pine wood nematode there. Now it has spread to Spain. It could arrive at any time.\"</p> <p>Billions of plants and trees are now traded within the EU every year, often with large amounts of soil attached to each plant, and experts like Woodward and Boyd fear such quantities of material make it impossible to control pathogens. \"Some plants have 1,000 litres of soil with them,\" said Joan Webber, principal pathologist of Forest Research, the research agency of the Forestry Commission. \"That soil is a black box full of billions of bacteria. It is very difficult to inspect and intercept.\"</p> <p>Most experts blame the rising trade in exotic plants from Asia as a key cause of the rise in outbreaks of tree diseases in the UK. Webber said that during the whole of the 20th century, Britain had five major pest and pathogen outbreaks, including two outbreaks of Dutch elm disease. So far this century, there have been more than double the total figure for the previous 100 years.</p> <p>Suggestions to try to limit future outbreaks include plant passports to reveal the origin of a sapling or cutting and placing some woods and parks in quarantine. Walkers have been urged to wash their boots after strolling in woods or forests. \"We are going to have to be very careful about how we treat our woods in future,\" Woodward said.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/02/uk-airport-expansion-howard-davies\" title=\"\">Sir Howard Davies</a>, the man with the job of deciding whether Britain needs a new airport, must be looking with some alarm at the precedents. In 1971, after more than 18 months of work, the Roskill commission recommended that a four-runway airport to serve London be built at Cublington, near Aylesbury.</p> <p>When Michael Noble, then minister for trade, opened the debate on the commission's findings in the Commons, he said of its authors: \"I hope that they may draw some comfort from one of my hon friends who said that the fact that he totally rejected their conclusion did not in any way diminish his admiration for the way in which they had done their work and presented their report.\"</p> <p>Their plan, of course, never got off the drawing board.</p> <p>Committing the Conservatives to blocking a third runway at Heathrow was a key plank of David Cameron's strategy to detoxify the Tory brand and prove that he would put polar bears before sharp-suited businessmen. It was also built on political expediency \u2013 he needed to win Conservative seats in the area. Further, it was a recognition that the building of a third runway would hurt Britain's then leading role in reducing global carbon emissions</p> <p>But with the economy trapped in a deep malaise Cameron is having a rethink. There is a strong lobby that suggests that UK plc needs extra airport capacity in order to boost future economic prospects. Also, the UK is on track to meet its Kyoto targets, albeit partly because of economic weakness. There is, too, an argument that the tax system may be a better way of reducing the number of unnecessary flights than a ban on building new runways. Flight travel is simply too cheap compared with rail fares \u2013 this is the fault of a tax system that gives an advantage to airlines.</p> <p>George Osborne now firmly believes that if the UK really wants to build an economy that can properly connect with the rest of the world it needs more airport capacity. But the economic case is being driven largely by self-interested parties, not least British Airways, the British Airports Authority and the bodies that represent them.</p> <p>It will be a crucial part of the Davies commission to identify the economic benefits a new airport or runway would deliver. Multinational companies make inward investment decisions on the basis of a whole range of factors, including the skills of the workforce, the strength of the currency and the generosity of state support for industry. Whether the chief executive can jet in direct from Chicago or Shanghai may be a marginal consideration.</p> <p>However, those advocating the development of a hub airport may have a case. If Britain allows its one airport that comes close to being an international hub to become ever more clogged up while Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Madrid and Paris become transit points for Europeans, including enterprising Brits, wanting to get to the fast-growing economies of China, India or Brazil, there is a risk that economic opportunities will be missed, ambitions stunted, jobs lost.</p> <p>However, if any British government is to press the case for extra airport capacity, it needs to make a convincing case for continuing to meet its ambitious carbon emissions target. As this paper said in 2008: \"It will require a radical programme of wave and wind turbine construction, nuclear industry expansion and the building of underground vaults to store the carbon dioxide that currently pours from the nation's coal, oil and gas power plants.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is absolutely no evidence that this government's energy policy is fit for that purpose. Indeed the government's desire to pursue a dash for gas as a future energy strategy is precisely the wrong direction of travel.</p> <p>Even if the case for a hub airport is established, Heathrow is not the only answer: Heathrow already creates all-but-unbearable noise, pollution and disruption for unlucky residents, and its transport links are groaning. Of those affected by noise pollution in Europe, 30% live in and around Heathrow. Is it really sensible to build more airline capacity in the middle of a major population centre?</p> <p>There is a plausible case that bringing in as many planes as possible \u2013 the proposed estuary airport \u2013 over sea instead of hundreds of thousands of rooftops makes more sense. As importantly, a giant new airport would provide a powerful economic boost for an area where unemployment is high. Although characterised, until now, as a Boris Johnson vanity project, there is support from politicians of all persuasions to the east of London to try and create a hub \u2013 in all senses \u2013 which would address the historical inequalities and poverty to the east of the capital.</p> <p>There is no easy solution. Davies will need wisdom and a good dose of political nous to weigh up the issues \u2013 the financial and environmental costs and any economic advantages. He should use his authority to seize the initiative and insist that the question of airport capacity in the UK be settled sooner rather than later. Otherwise, the likelihood of a repeat of the Roskill commission is all too likely.</p>",
  "<p>It has been a thought-provoking week for Ryan Nelsen. Apart from the obvious concerns that should be on the mind of every QPR player who dares to examine the Premier League table, the New Zealand captain's attention was drawn to the sight of superstorm Sandy bearing down on America's East Coast. It is not just that Nelsen is worldly enough to take an interest in global affairs \u2013 though this former political science student certainly is. More poignantly he can reflect on the personal experience of twice being caught up in terrifying catastrophes.</p> <p>Nelsen was in his first season with DC United, as a 22-year-old enjoying a promising overseas adventure, at the time of the 11 September attacks. \"I lived about a mile away from the Pentagon when it got hit,\" he recalls. A decade later his football career had taken him to Blackburn Rovers and, as he went in for training one day, to prepare for a match against Aston Villa news broke that a powerful earthquake had struck his home city of Christchurch. His family were back home, and his sister, who was expecting a baby, went into labour in the most worrying of circumstances. Nelsen was at a loss to try to cope from afar with something endangering those closest to him.</p> <p>\"It's horrible, a feeling of helplessness actually,\" he recalls. \"My sister went into childbirth when the earthquake happened. She got stuck in a part of Christchurch that got blocked off. Nobody could get to her, all the phones were cut off. My parents were calling me because they couldn't get to her. You just sit there helpless. The whole city had everybody running around looking for their loved ones. It's a pretty crazy time. You feel like it doesn't happen to first world countries, like England, New Zealand, Australia, America. But when it does, it changes reality. It was a pretty emotional time.\"</p> <p>Nelsen recently returned to Christchurch on international duty and was touched by a sense that some of the trauma is slowly being replaced by optimism. \"Half the city is like a ghost town. It needs to be torn down,\" he said. \"There's tumbleweed growing through the streets. But it was the first time when the mood was more positive. The rebuild is starting. It's a blank canvas to rebrand a new city.\"</p> <p>It seems glib to suggest major tragedies bring perspective to problems of a sporting nature but Nelsen goes along with it. It is no coincidence that he betrays not the slightest evidence of anxiety or sensitivity about QPR's predicament. His calmness, his ready supply of good sense, shines through. That characteristic can only be a positive influence on his team.</p> <p>Last season, during Nelsen's short spell at Spurs, Harry Redknpp took a moment to extol his virtues. He spoke passionately about the man, rather than the footballer, and claimed he had seldom had the pleasure of such a decent and inspiring person in his dressing room. \"Every club needs a man like him; you can build a club around him,\" Redknapp said.</p> <p>It is this special quality that ensured Mark Hughes included Nelsen on his summer shopping list. Now 35, he still has defensive assurance to offer but he also has exactly the kind of personality that a manager can rely on in times of trouble.</p> <p>It was Hughes who had bought Nelsen to England in the first place, when the stocky and determined centre-half became a mainstay for for Blackburn. It is not surprising to find Nelsen is a staunch defender of his under-fire manager, who faces a high-pressure fixture against Reading on Sunday in the battle of the winless. \"Mark and all the staff here have a really good work ethic. He is always first in and last out. So that is the foundation,\" Nelsen says. \"But there have been variables in these games that no matter who you are you can't predict. People sent off, injuries and silly individual mistakes. If it's frustrating for me, I can't imagine what it is like for the manager. The microscope always comes down on the manager which is horrible. I feel very bad for him in that sense.\"</p> <p>Nelsen is under no illusions about what is needed to pull QPR round. \"Strength of character,\" he confirms. \"Mental strength more than anything. Players know they have talent, physical attributes, skills. But at times like this I just think talent is easy, it's always there. But mental strength when the pressure is on is key.\"</p> <p>His own reserves come not only from his own personality but also from his years spent in America where a winning mentality is so vehemently fostered in sport. Nelsen spent several years at college in the States, including a spell at Stanford. It was there that he found himself playing golf in the shadow of Tiger Woods. \"I was on the driving range once when he was there,\" Nelsen remembers. \"The founder of Yahoo was also there. I was out of my depth in that conversation.\"</p> <p>It is hard to believe much gets past him these days. QPR will be hoping to say the same about his team-mates on Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>In an increasingly interconnected world, educators, employers and communities all want to see students developing as global citizens; young people that are internationally-aware, tolerant, and able to communicate with people from range of cultures, backgrounds and traditions.<br> In the article, Why global awareness matters to schools, due to be published on the Guardian Teacher Network on Monday, Jeremy Sutcliffe profiles a report called <a href=\"http://www.think-global.org.uk/resources/item.asp?d=6404\">The Global Skills Gap: preparing young people for the global economy</a>, which reveals that employers rate knowledge and awareness of the wider world as more important than a candidate's degree classification or A-level results. The report also finds that businesses believe schools should be doing more to help young people think more globally.<br> Yet, there is already plenty of brilliant work going on in schools to bridge this gap. And it has been going on for some time. This work looks set to continue, with schools seeing their international collaboration work praised by Ofsted and the roll out of Department for International Development's <a href=\"http://www.ideas-forum.org.uk/global_learning_project_in_scotland\">Global Learning Programme</a> - a project hoping to formalise and consolidate global learning in schools, particularly around issues such as international development, global poverty, social justice, citizenship and sustainable development.<br> But it's not just about inspections or feeding industry, for teachers global learning is about education beyond the text book, beyond classroom walls, and helping students see beyond the places they currently call home. Jose Picardo, borrowing the words of Marcel Proust, summed up the benefits of global learning in his blog post: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2012/sep/25/students-global-awareness-other-cultures\">Why students need a global awareness and understanding of other cultures</a>.</p> <p>He writes: \"Marcel Proust, the French novelist, observed that \"the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new lands but in seeing with new eyes\". He realised that by working with other people we learn about their cultures and become able to explore new ideas and prospects. Options that would not have occurred to us before stand out as obvious if we understand how other people experience the world. This is why, I believe, it is so important for students to have a deeper global awareness and understanding of other cultures.\"<br> In addition, citizenship teacher Billie Crombie argues a global education helps students to really understand the world and society they live in. In an interview with GTN, she said: \"If students are going to develop as global citizens they have to be able to question global issues. They have to find out about power balances and be actively involved in asking questions. It's so important not to just be taught about tragedies overseas and then to disconnect from that as it seems nothing to do with your life. I don't like citizenship to be purely about fundraising, I find that a very submissive way of dealing with an issue. When you humanise the stories then you start to make inroads.\" There are many issues to explore. So, on Thursday 8 November, 4pm to 6pm, join us for a live chat to debate all areas of teaching and learning in the global classroom. We'll be exploring opportunities, challenges and ideas around developing global awareness in schools.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>The last time a team tried to go 50 matches unbeaten, the game ended in acrimony, pizza being flung about in the tunnel after the match, cheese and tomato running down Sir Alex Ferguson's suit.</strong> Could it happen again? Well, we are in Italy. So yes. Let's say yes. By 9.30pm, expect to see Antonio Conte covered in pepperoni. </p> <p><strong>Juventus's win over Bologna on Wednesday night, inspired by one Paul Pogba, brought their unbeaten run to 49 games.</strong> Forty-nine! And to think they were in Serie B a few years ago. There's hope yet for Rangers. Sort of. </p> <p><strong>No surprise that the champions are top of Serie A then.</strong> After 10 games, they've won nine and drawn one to lead Inter by four points. Many observers of Italian football are, of course, putting such a stunning record down to the influence of Nicklas Bendtner. It's possible Gigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Mirko Vucinic have played a part too. Conte should probably take some of the credit ... if only for signing Bendtner. </p> <p><strong>They've got a job on their hands tonight though.</strong> After a ropey start to the season, Inter have clicked under young Andrea Stramaccioni and arrive at the Juventus Stadium on the back of a hot seven-match winning streak. The 36-year-old appears to have finally stabilised the club after the hangover caused by Jose Mourinho's departure following their Champions League win in 2010. Stramaccioni is Inter's fifth manager since then; he could well be The Man. </p> <p><strong>Juventus:</strong> Buffon, Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini, Lichtsteiner, Vidal, Pirlo, Marchisio, Asamoah, Vucinic, Giovinco.</p> <p><strong>Inter:</strong> Handanovic; Ranocchia, Samuel, Juan; Zanetti, Gargano, Cambiasso, Nagatomo; Palacio, Cassano, Milito. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.45pm by the British Time.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>An email.</strong> \"Surprised you weren't MBM-officiating the West Ham game, presumably that's to avoid any accusations of Clattenburg-doing-Man U bias,\" says Ryan Dunne. \"Nice Glorious Glasgow Rangers reference too.

Not being a regular serie a follower (Parma's pink strips are cool though), is this Juventus side getting Arsenal-style respect and admiration from neutrals and pundits?\"</p> <p>No idea!

There may be some discussion about the officials afterwards. Call me a cynic, but. It was a wonderfully swift and decisive move, mind you. Inter were all over the place as Vucinic poked a pass through for Asamoah - who was offside - and the midfielder slashed a poor shot across goal from left to right, where Vidal was waiting for a tap-in.

Giovinco pulls over to the right and flashes a brilliant cross into the middle that just evades Marchisio and Asamoah. That could so easily have been 2-0. Pirlo then chips a classic Pirlo pass over the top and Handanovic punches away from Giovinco. Not that it matters: this time the flag is up for offside.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Is there anything more exciting than Italian football?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> \"Assuming ESPN are correct and Inter are going 3-4-3 tonight, isn't Strammacioni using the same system that got Gasperini sacked?\" asks Sam Blanning. Well I suspect Stramaccioni has tried to match his side up with Juve's formation. It hasn't worked especially well so far though.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Andrea Pirlo is quite a good player. He clips a glorious first-time pass over the top of the gawping Inter defence for the onrushing Marchisio, who waits for the ball to drop from the sky before hitting a first-time volley that Handanovic pushes wide for a corner. What a save. What a pass.<em> Pirlo</em>.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Of course, the Inter tactic of letting-Andrea-Pirlo-do-what-he-wants is helping Juventus. There's no pressure on him at all as he finds Marchisio again in the area. The midfielder takes the ball down on his chest and then dribbles a volley straight at Handanovic.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Finally Inter show up front. First Cambiasso cracks one over from 25 yards out, before Juve lose the ball in their own final third, and a loose ball breaks for Cambiasso who whips an instant effort just over. Buffon didn't move, although that might just have been him showing off. There's been more action packed into this opening 10 minutes than you get in most games.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Inter aren't having any luck with the officials. A quick free-kick from the left catches out Juve's defence and Palacio steals in to glance a header low past Buffon, but the flag is up for offside. Let's just say it was a much tighter decision than the Juventus goal. Juve, of course, got away with one against Catania last Sunday too.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Still, when your luck's in...</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Giovinco pierces the Inter defence but Vidal is roughly 453 yards offside. Even these officials can't miss that. \"Re your Italian football being exciting comment, can I say that it's very much dependent on your team,\" says Michael Nimmo. \"I'm a season ticket holder for Genoa, and it looks like being a long old season. Sure, it was exciting when Juve came, but more for their supporters than ours when they inconsiderately kept on scoring goals. Tonight is very much a battle between two unpleasant teams (not on the pitch, there they're quite good), but seeing Juve lose their unbeaten record at home against Inter would be quite fun.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Another lightning Juventus attack is brought to a halt by Javier Zanetti, 83. The delightfully impish Giovinco tries to wriggle into the Inter area but Zanetti <em>uses all his experience</em>. \"On the way home after a bit of a corporate at Craven Cottage,\" says Freeloading's Gary Naylor. \"My first time watching top flight football up close for a few years (maybe from when Wimbledon played at Selhurst Park). God knows football has plenty wrong with it, but it was a helluva spectacle today.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Friendly advice: don't take your eyes off this match.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Nagatomo tries to put in a cross from the left but Lichsteiner blocks it behind for Inter's first corner. There's a delay before the corner can be taken while the referee pretends to sort out some wrestling in the area. The first corner's a waste, but Inter get another go. This time they roll it short to Cassano on the edge of the area and he bends a shot <em>inches</em> past the far post. Buffon was definitely beaten.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Inter have settled now and are starting to exert some control on proceedings. I'm not sure if Juventus can maintain this sort of pace for 90 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> \"Juve are quite strong this year in serie A,\" notes Ben Dunn. \"Milan gave them Pirlo in exchange for a match ball and a set of luminous cones because he was obviously shot (he has yet to lose a game in black and white) and then sold Ibra, who is quite good in Italian football, and Silva, ditto. The other teams, Inter included, are utter pith. Juve in Europe will show their level, which is out of the top four in all other leagues of importance. i.e. not French).\"</p> <!-- Block 20 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WO5y0DMA0LE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WO5y0DMA0LE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Apropos of nothing, here's a wonderful Alessandro Del Piero goal in this fixture in 1998.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Lichsteiner plays a pass to Vucinic, failing to notice the striker had his back to him and had walked off the pitch, looking to sort out a problem with his calf.

Stop it.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Lichsteiner is booked after an industrial-strength challenge on Cambiasso.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Cambiasso's free-kick is an abject waste of time from an Inter perspective and from it, Juventus go close to doubling their lead. Giovinco hares away down the right and with only one Inter defender back, he should find Vucinic to his left. His pass was poor though, allowing another defender to get back to mop up.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Now Samuel is booked after bringing down Giovinco.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Lichsteiner, already booked, catches Palacio. He should be sent off. He's not. How odd.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> A dreadful mistake from the increasingly inept Ranocchia lets Asamoah in down the left. He could drive towards goal - and also has team-mates in the middle - but curiously decides to cut the ball back to Vidal on the edge of the area. He's not expecting the pass and Juan dispossess him.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Lichsteiner, who should have been sent off a few minutes ago, is replaced by Martin Caceres. Are you watching, Arsene?</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> \"My girlfriend, who is absolutely inwardly delighted that I'm reading an MBM and emailing you, was fairly unblown over that you'd published my previous email, despite my satisfaction,\" says Michael Nimmo. \"She said that she'd always wondered who would write into to stuff like this, and I'm pretty sure she had imagined it was the handsome life-and-soul types like me and other emailers, who are of course passing over other saturday night plans with people to follow your updates.

And I hate Juve. But this argument of Juve 'showing (Serie A's) level' in Europe is silly looking at their 2-2 match against Chelsea, ManU needing to scrape come-from-behind wins at home against unknowns, and the champs ManCity being bottom of their group. Serie A remains one the top 4 leagues in Europe, and to say otherwise based on recent results ignores Premier League struggles, as well as seeming petty.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Handanovic has to back-pedal and push an awkward cross from Asamoah over his own bar after it took a deflection off Zanetti. \"An MBMer with a girlfriend?!\" asks Ryan Dunne. \"Emailing on a Saturday night?! I think you should request Michael Nimmo supply photographic proof of this absurdity.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>45 min+1:</strong> Nagatomo and Juan clown about like a pair of ... clowns, actually, each leaving a loose pass for the other, failing to react as Vidal sneaks in between the pair of them and hammers a low drive goalwards from the edge of the area. Handanovic gets down well to save and Vidal blasts the rebound miles wide from a tight angle.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Half time: Juventus 1-0 Inter.</strong> Well that flew by.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>SATURDAY NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT DEP'T:</strong> Nicklas Bendtner has replaced the injured Mirko Vucinic for Juventus. Inter get the ball rolling in the second half. Juve are 45 minutes away from going 50 games unbeaten. \"Re Ryan Dunne's photographic proof-request, I did suggest that i send a photo of her to prove her existence, but she laughed,\" says Michael Nimmo. \"I guess she's embarrassed to be seen on an Italian MBM, English football's much more her bag.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> \"Watching in Co Meath, Ireland, and it's even a Saturday night here, too,\" says Paul Neilan. \"Just one thing; Vucinic, why? He's a donkey. For a team about to go 50 games unbeaten he has been piss-poor all season. He's clunky, immobile, has an attitude etc. I just don't get it anymore (see Saturday night in, above).\" Nicklas Bendtner is his understudy.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Pirlo is booked for hauling back Palacio. Will they take him off now? Probably not. Cassano slices the resulting free-kick miles wide. His response is to just stand there ruefully shaking his head.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> \"Admitedly English teams are on the wane in Europe, despite being current champions,\" admits Ben Dunn. \"But on the European scale (I don't know how it works but there are points accumulated from the last five years) Italian teams are struggling to keep Italy with three Champions league places. They have performed very poorly and this is represented in the their European results - there have been a number of articles in the Gazzetta dello Sport on the subject. I believe England are heading in that general direction too, but at the moment are still considerably stronger, over a period of five years than Serie A.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Bonucci, scourge of gun-wielding muggers, strolls forward from the back and then unleashes from 25 yards out, bringing a fine save out of Handanovic. Moments later Chiellini is booked for persistent fouling.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Ranocchia launches a ball down the inside-right channel for Palacio to chase. He reaches it ahead of Buffon, touching the ball round the Juve keeper, but can only send it into the side-netting from a very tight angle.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Inter's threat is growing. Chiellini loses the ball and Inter set off on the break, Milito running at the backtracking Juventus defence. He moves it to the right for Palacio, who hammers it woefully over the bar. That was awful. There's then a stoppage in play after some moron hits the official behind the goal with something thrown from the crowd. On ESPN, Stewart Robson opines that he hopes the official isn't making the most of it. Comments don't get much stupider than that. The official is fine though. His neck's a bit sore, mind you.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Nagatomo bursts into the area and cracks a rising drive towards the far corner, Buffon beating it away. Inter are the better side.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> <strong>PENALTY TO INTER!</strong> A free-kick to Inter just outside the area. Instead of shooting, they try to work a clever one in the style of Argentina against England in 1998, but it comes to nothing as Marchisio has a handful of Diego Milito's shirt in the area. A clear penalty.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Juventus 1-1 Inter (Milito pen, 59 min):</strong> This is fairly conclusive. Milito slams the penalty high into the top-right corner to level it up. Juve's unbeaten record is under threat now but this is no more than Inter deserve. It's been coming.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> It's all Inter. Bonucci clumsily brings down Milito on the left and goes into the book. Juve are rocking. The free-kick comes to nothing though. \"Fair dos MIchael Nimmo,\" fair-dos Ryan Dunn. \"I should stress that I'm only really dipping into tonight's MBM; my primary online focus being Wookiepedia articles about the new Star Wars movies, plainly a far more girlfriend-conducive online activity.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> From the left, Pirlo curls a free-kick straight at Handanovic, who elects to punch it away.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Giovinco dips and tricks his way into the Inter area, before crumbling underneath the softest of challenges from Gargano. No penalty.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Fredy Guarin replaces Antonio Cassano for Inter.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> I'm not sure that Nicklas Bendtner has touched the ball yet. Taking a throw-in doesn't count.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Javier Zanetti is making Asamoah look very raw indeed.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Caceres makes a great tackle to deny Cambiasso! A low ball was fizzed in from the right by Palacio. Milito couldn't reach it at the near post, but as the ball broke loose Caceres recovered brilliantly to stop Cambiasso shooting from six yards out.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Juventus 1-2 Inter (Milito, 75 min):</strong> Now Juventus's unbeaten run really is on the brink. Arturo Vidal gave the ball away in a dangerous area and the substitute Guarin charged forward, showing a terrific change of pace against the exposed Juventus defence, bursting easily past Chiellini. His low drive from 25 yards out was pushed out by Buffon but only as far as Milito, who made no mistake from eight yards out. Juventus have 15 minutes left to rescue their record, but they have done very little in the second half.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Fabio Quagliarella replaces Martin Caceres for Juventus. Caceres, of course, was subbed on in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Mudingayi comes on for Diego Milito, whose two goals looks like ruining Juve's night.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Handanovic flies to his left to tip a Pirlo piledriver from 25 yards out past the post. The corner is cleared. But now, inevitably, Inter are being pushed back.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Inter nearly shoot themselves in the foot, Gargano's pass back to Handanovic intercepted by Bendtner, whose attempted chip on the turn from a tight angle drifts harmlessly wide.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Zanetti is booked for cynically tugging back Asamoah on the left. Palacio heads Pirlo's free-kick away.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Quagliarella turns, beats his man and hits a rising drive just past the right post from 25 yards out. So close. But the unbeaten record is slipping away.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p>GOAL! THERE GOES THE UNBEATEN RECORD! Juventus 1-3 Inter (Palacio, 90 min): No one's getting past 49 games. Not tonight, anyway. With Juventus committing men forward in search of an equaliser, Inter catch them horribly short on the break. Nagatomo broke down the left and saw his initial shot blocked, but recovered possession, cut inside and slipped a pass through to Palacio, who prodded a shot underneath Buffon. What a turnaround. Inter fully deserve this.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90 min+1:</strong> There will be three minutes of stoppage time. But nothing's doing for Juventus now. The stadium is emptying.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90 min+2:</strong> It will be interesting to see how Juventus react to this defeat. Arsenal never recovered from losing their unbeaten record to Manchester United in 2004.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Full time: Juventus 1-3 Inter.</strong> That's it! Juventus's run ends at 49! No one's touching the 58 games Fabio Capello's Milan put together. Inter celebrate wildly, while Juventus can hardly believe it, either on or off the pitch. Juventus are still top - a point ahead of Inter - but suddenly everyone will look at them in a very different light. They <em>can</em> be beaten. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>",
  "<p>Reclining in an office chair usually filled by the transport minister, Norman Baker, who is away for the day, Sir Howard Davies, 61 \u2013 former senior mandarin at the Treasury, one-time aide to Nigel Lawson, former director of the London School of Economics, head of the Financial Services Authority under Labour and now chairman of Phoenix Insurance \u2013 oozes the confidence of a man who has seen it all before.</p> <p>\"It happened in the way these things do. Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, gave me a call and said, ehm, your number's come up,\" he chuckles. \"I was slightly surprised. It wasn't an obvious thing to do, although, curiously enough, I did a couple of years in the Treasury on aerospace, but I don't think Jeremy was even aware of that when he asked me.\"</p> <p>Ever since, critics have been lining up to point out how far it was from being the \"obvious thing to do\". Heywood was inviting Davies to be the man to decide whether and where to build Britain's next major airport, an issue that in other countries might be regarded as a dry administrative task, but in the UK is a peculiarly red rag to the many-headed bull that is the green lobby, local communities under flight paths, regional tsars jealous of the south-east and political leaders looking to display their environmentally friendly or business credentials \u2013 depending on the fashion.</p> <p>Then, of course, there's Boris Johnson, a London mayor in search of a defining issue for his political career, frustrated that the prime minister has not made a decision on the issue, determined to have a third runway at Heathrow ruled out, and for a new airport, popularly known as \"Boris Island\", to be built swiftly on the Thames estuary.</p> <p>It is a political quagmire that even the most capable of mandarins might struggle with and Davies has not, it is pointed out, enjoyed the easiest of times recently. His period as executive chairman of the FSA, where he stewarded light-touch regulation of the City between 1997 and 2003, cannot be said to have been an unqualified success. It was on his watch that the banking crisis, which in part delivered the UK its double-dip recession, was brewing.</p> <p>His next job was as director of the LSE, a position he resigned from last year after it emerged that the university had taken a \u00a3300,000 donation from a foundation run by none other than the playboy son of Colonel Gaddafi, Saif, who is currently incarcerated by the new Libyan government but wanted by the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Perhaps it was felt that a decision on airport capacity would be a doddle for a man who has dealt with all that. As a Treasury mandarin in 1979 he was, after all, in charge of nationalising British Aerospace under Labour, then equally quickly privatising it under Margaret Thatcher. \"It was crazy,\" he admits.</p> <p>But Davies's frustration at the political debate raging, even on day one of the launch of his commission into Britain's aviation \u2013 due to publish an interim report in 2013 and a final one in 2015 \u2013 is evident: \"Obviously we have to have a public process here but the public process I want is about the issues rather than about the timing and the politics.\"</p> <p>On Friday morning he gave a short interview to the <em>Today</em> programme but didn't know, until he spoke to the producers, that Johnson, all fired up, was coming on later to trash everything he had said, in particular the plan to wait three years for Davies's answers to the big questions. It was an undoubted attempt to ambush Davies on his big day. \"Did he succeed?\" Davies asks. The headlines the following day suggest Johnson may have, although it will be Davies's word on Britain's airports that will be the last.</p> <p>The former mandarin, who will work \"a day, or a day and a half, a week\" in the unpaid role, admits that he \"can't be convinced\" that when he reports in 2015 the politicians will actually listen.</p> <p>It may be a new government; what is certain is that the politics of the moment will be different, and that matters. The Conservatives, who delighted in ruling out a third runway at Heathrow before the 2010 general election on environmental grounds, are now procrastinating and split on the issue, hence pushing it into what Davies admits is the \"long grass\" of his commission.</p> <p>And Labour has been on a diametrically opposite journey. \"I note it is not that long ago that the Labour party was in favour of the third runway and appeared to be going to go ahead and now it is not fashionable again,\" he says. \"I don't think you can take these things as completely fixed anyway.\"</p> <p>So he won't allow Boris and the politics of the moment to come into the commission's thinking? \"No, I don't think we can afford them to be. I think the whole point of asking an independent commission to do this is in order not to do that. I observe the political debate swirling around this, but I don't think it makes sense to get involved in it.</p> <p>\"I think you have to step back a bit and start with demand forecasts, how do you fit it into the climate change commitment? How different is the rail environment, does that open up options that you've not had before? And you have to build from there and see where that takes you. But we have been told that all options, including the third runway, are on the table and for the moment that is where they shall remain.\"</p> <p>Whatever way Davies falls on the issues ahead, there will be critics, fierce ones. How do you weigh up the interests of homeowners under the flight path at Heathrow against the economic stimulus of building a proper hub airport, with one, maybe two, new runways? \"We haven't worked that out yet. The things you have got to look at include 'are you going to create more unpleasant noise for people?'.</p> <p>\"There are some options which say that you wouldn't necessarily do that. If you move where the runways are, there are options for moving Heathrow westward; that's an interesting sort of idea which would reduce the noise envelope. Other countries have got other compensation regimes, but we haven't got an equation for doing that at this point.\"</p> <p>But he is equally keen to look at Boris's plan, which is why he insisted to the prime minister that his commission needed to at least shortlist the options in his 2013 interim report. \"The estuary island has the mayor supporting it, but it doesn't really have a corporate sponsor because it isn't there. So if you decide that is the one you want to look at, you need to have time to do some more work yourself, and the commission will do more work to level the playing field, if you like\".</p> <p>What clearly will not influence Davies, a Manchester Grammar School boy, Oxford graduate and alumnus of Stanford Graduate School of Business, is the prime minister's notion of a happiness index, once promoted by David Cameron as a rival barometer of success to growth which, it was said, would play a key role in the big future policy decisions.</p> <p>\"I think that's quite difficult territory and I haven't seen that that has gone terribly far,\" he says. \"There are these, you know, happiness indices, but I don't quite know what they mean really.\"</p> <p>Neither can we expect him to be a climate change pioneer. He worked as an adviser to the sceptic Nigel Lawson in the 1980s, but refuses to discuss his own views, adding that it is irrelevant because he will work within the government's climate change commitments.</p> <p>\"I am honestly not sufficiently expert to have my own independent views on climate change,\" he says. \"But certainly the fact that I once worked for Nigel Lawson\u2013 now 28 years ago \u2013 is not relevant. What I do is take whatever the commitment is. There is a government commitment, and indeed there is legislation, that says we are going to reduce our emissions by 80% by 2050.\"</p> <p>It is possible, of course, that Davies could simply rejig things and not suggest any building projects at all in 2015. There is spare capacity in less popular airports, while some in the environmental lobby say that the UK would be able to cope with demand up until 2050, based on a recent dip in the number of people travelling and perhaps pessimistic forecasts on the UK's economic growth.</p> <p>But it doesn't sound likely. \"I was in Scotland last week and there were two flights a day to go to Dubai, taking people and rerouting them to India, or wherever. So now we might decide as a nation that that is sustainable, but clearly at the moment it is not the plan is it? Nobody is saying we should stop having any flights here and they should bugger off and go somewhere else.</p> <p>\"So given that the brief is to say how do you maintain international hub status, it does look like doing nothing is not likely to achieve that.\"</p> <p>Is Davies, despite the delays, ultimately going to be seen as a man of action? \"Actually, I've got to go now. I've got an insurance company to run.\"</p>",
  "<p>The head of the new commission deciding the future of Britain's airports has hit back at Boris Johnson for politicising the debate over the location of the country's major air hub.</p> <p>Sir Howard Davies, who launched his inquiry last week, says he wants a public debate first and foremost about the issues surrounding airports.</p> <p>Davies, a former head of the Financial Services Authority, was responding to attempts by the London mayor to ambush the launch of the three-year commission last Friday by publicly complaining that the process was too slow.</p> <p>Davies has been appointed by David Cameron to report on how the UK can maintain its position as Europe's major air hub \u2013 but not until after the next general election in 2015.</p> <p>Johnson also insisted that one of the main options set to be examined by Davies's commission in a bid to increase capacity \u2013 a third runway at Heathrow \u2013 \"simply will not happen\" because of the noise pollution it would cause to Londoners and the political impact it would have.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/03/next-uk-airport\" title=\"\">first newspaper interview</a>, Davies responds to the Tory mayor's criticisms, insisting that a third runway will \"stay on the table\", laments the terms of the debate and says he is determined to ignore the \"swirling\" political row over the issue.</p> <p>\"Obviously we have to have a public process here, but the public process I want is about the issues rather than about the timing and the politics,\" he says. \"But, hey, that is not something I can deal with.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"I don't think we can afford them [the politics] to be [involved], quite frankly. I think the whole point of asking an independent commission to do this is in order not to do that. I observe the political debate swirling around this, but I don't think it makes sense to get involved in it.\"</p> <p>Cameron also chose on Saturday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/03/david-cameron-boris-johnson-airport\" title=\"\">to slap down Johnson</a>, who wants a new airport to be built in the Thames estuary and for the development of Heathrow to be swiftly ruled out.</p> <p>The prime minister urged Johnson to respect the fact that Davies had \"a completely open mind\" on the issue. \"What I would say to Boris, what I have said to Boris, is that for the first time a government has properly put all the options, including estuary options, on the table,\" Cameron said.</p> <p>\"Boris is passionate about the idea of an estuary airport. Now he has a forum in which to put forward his arguments in a way in which he hasn't in the past.\"</p> <p>The future of Britain's airports has been contentious for a number of years, but has been a particularly rancorous issue since the London mayor proposed an alternative \"Boris island\" in the Thames.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> understands that Boris has privately told the chancellor, George Osborne, that his assistance at the next general election cannot be guaranteed if the commission sticks to its timetable. He has also committed himself to causing trouble over the issue, including a possible bid for a judicial review into the commission's role in the process.</p> <p>In the interview, Davies says \"all options are on the table\", but reveals he had insisted to the prime minister that his commission was able to shortlist the options for an increase in capacity by 2013. He said this would allow the more imaginative ideas such as \"Boris island\" to receive extra scoping work after 2013 by the commission if they were found to have potential.

  "<p>We would like to express our concern about the proposal by the mayor of Tower Hamlets to sell the sculpture <a href=\"http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/docklands_tug_o_war_with_yorkshire_for_moore_s_old_flo_draped_seated_lady_1_1679846\" title=\"\"><em>Draped Seated Woman</em></a> by Henry Moore. While we understand the financial pressures that Tower Hamlets faces, we feel that the mayor's proposal goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale to London County Council at a favourable price on the understanding that it would be placed in East London.</p> <p>The presence of the sculpture in Stepney was a demonstration of the postwar belief that everyone, whatever their background, should have access to works of art of the highest quality. That is why Moore was so delighted to see the work sited as the centrepiece of a housing estate in London's East End.</p> <p>We appreciate that times have changed and that the costs of protecting the sculpture are demanding, but we believe that there are a number of sites in the borough where the work could be safely placed for the benefit of the community.

All of these have contributed to making family life unaffordable. To blame childcare costs shows a lack of understanding of the level of care young children need to thrive. Carers and early-years educators are undervalued and largely invisible in this debate, which is often monopolised by the professional elite.</p> <p>There's also an assumption that most parents prefer to use childcare rather than do it themselves. Many parents prize time with their children above all else. I'd say a few mornings in pre-school is enough for most young children, then they need to spend time at home. Childcare shouldn't be designed around an adult's working day \u2013 it should be appropriate for the child.

  "<p>The director of the Tate Gallery and an Oscar-winning film director are among leading arts figures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/nov/03/letters-henry-moore-tower-hamlets\" title=\"\">who have written an impassioned letter to the Observer </a>calling on an east London council to abandon plans to sell a masterpiece by Henry Moore, the renowned British sculptor.</p> <p>Gallery director Sir Nicholas Serota and Danny Boyle, who directed <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> and the spectacular opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics, are dismayed that the UK may lose <em>Draped Seated Woman</em>, a three-metre-tall bronze sculpted in 1957, because Tower Hamlets council needs the money.</p> <p>The artist \u2013 a miner's son and lifelong socialist \u2013 sold it in 1962 for a price far lower than collectors would have paid on the understanding that the sculpture would be on open-air display to enrich the lives of people in a socially deprived area of London. The 1.6-tonne bronze was on the Stifford housing estate in Stepney until 15 years ago when, because the council had failed to prevent it being daubed with graffiti, it was moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.</p> <p>The sale of such an important work could see bidding reach \u00a320m, the council believes \u2013 which would help it to deal with some of Britain's worst deprivation and a \u00a3100m cut in its budget over the next three years. Although the arts figures acknowledge the council's financial pressures, they argue that disposal of the sculpture \"goes against the spirit\" of Moore's original sale. Their letter states: \"The presence of the sculpture in Stepney was a demonstration of the postwar belief that everyone, whatever their background, should have access to works of art of the highest quality.\"</p> <p>The letter's other signatories include Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, who said: \"It is tragic that this sculpture cannot be enjoyed by the community it was intended for. My father always knew the importance of art sited directly in the community and enhancing the life of that community by its daily presence.\"</p> <p>Serota said: \"It's one of Moore's most important and largest single figures. It was clearly seen by Moore as one of his more important pieces. It is a figure of great dignity and humanity and sums up the utopianism of the postwar era. He sold it on the understanding it was going to be placed in the middle of a public housing development in Stepney. His expectation was that it would stand close to council housing and would therefore be seen by people who lived in council homes and form part of their environment.\"</p> <p>Some art experts question the \u00a320m valuation, which would be a record paid for one of Moore's works. One said that he expected a figure closer to \u00a35m. Commenting on the council's need to slash budgets, Serota said: \"This \u00a320m, if it is as much as \u00a320m, will only make a small contribution to that overall problem. It's a one-off, selling the family silver.\"</p> <p>The council believes that its return to an urban display would make it vulnerable to theft by metal thieves and that it is too valuable to insure. Serota noted that part of the Olympic Park is in Tower Hamlets and could provide a permanent home as the area \"will be very well supervised\", although one observer noted that the amount of money that would have to be spent each year maintaining it might make that solution prohibitive.</p> <p>The artistic quality of more recent public art has been the subject of debate and derision, with Paul Day's <em>The Meeting Place </em>at St Pancras station among artworks that have been criticised. Richard Calvocoressi, director of the Henry Moore Foundation, said: \"It's ironic that something of the quality of Moore's sculpture will not be seen in London again when there has been such a proliferation of third-rate sculptures in central London.\"</p> <p>Ian Leith, of the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, said dozens of public artworks \u2013 from war memorials to statues \u2013 were neglected while around one a month was stolen. No firm figures exist because there is no audit of the country's public art. Leith added that \"this is the greatest national gallery of all \u2013 which is outdoors \u2013 and it's completely undefined\". No one was accountable, he said.</p> <p>When a Frink or a Moore is stolen, they get publicity, said Leith, but the public is unaware of the plight of \"99.9%\" of the nation's other artworks.</p> <p>Award-winning sculptor, Robert Erskine \u2013 who will show at The Art for Art's Sake Fair in London in December - is taking legal action over a 50-ft-high sculpture commissioned for Peterborough with lottery money. Twelve years on, he says that the sculpture's installation has not been completed and its base is now covered with graffiti. He is so distraught, he even removed his name.</p> <p>Tower Hamlets will make its final decision about Moore's sculpture on Wednesday. A spokesman said: \"Like other councils, we are considering how best to use our assets to generate much-needed funds to invest in local heritage and priority projects.\"</p>",

  "<p>Rebel groups are accusing Syria's military council of infighting and nepotism and a failure to lead in the wake of a video that shows an opposition unit killing around two dozen captured regime soldiers.</p> <p>Armed opposition units across the Aleppo hinterland say the western-backed council is failing in its bid to create a co-ordinated opposition army, partly because of its refusal to deal with Islamist-leaning Syrian groups.</p> <p>The groups say the military council's favouritism towards some units means other militias are unwilling to act with discipline or to be held accountable. The disturbing scenes of the captured regime troops being killed, shortly after their post near Damascus was overrun, have angered rebel units in the north.</p> <p>\"We have to show we are different from the regime,\" said Sheik Omar Othman from the Islamist-leaning Liwat al-Tawheed unit in Aleppo. \"Because they do it, it means that we don't.\"</p> <p>Syrian Islamist groups have been at the vanguard of the fighting in Aleppo for the past three months, but are not able to match the better-armed and funded global jihadist units, who are increasingly taking centre stage in the war for the north of the country.</p> <p>\"This will soon mean that Jabhat al-Nusraf (an al-Qaida-aligned group) will be the only group capable of mounting the lethal operations on bases and security headquarters,\" said a leader of Liwat al-Tawheed, which has been a key player in the fighting in Aleppo. \"It already means that we can't win without them.\"</p> <p>Islamist groups in Aleppo say that they aim to do no more than oust the Assad regime.

That's a problem when we're doing the fighting.\"</p> <p>The military council is comprised of defected senior officers who have until recently remained in exile in a refugee camp in southern Turkey. They have access to weapons, sourced primarily from Qatar, and to funds from across the Sunni Arab world.</p> <p>Under pressure from the Obama administration, some military council officers have since established a small base just across the Turkish border and are attempting to form a centralised command and control structure to unite the deeply fragmented rebel groups.</p> <p>One of the council's senior officers, Brigadier Mustafa Sheikh, travels frequently to Idlib province, warning communities against supporting Islamists. Another officer regularly offers the same warning near Azaz in Aleppo province.</p> <p>US secretary of state Hillary Clinton last week also reiterated a warning to rebel groups to be careful from whom they accept help.</p> <p>The pleas appear to be falling on deaf ears. \"Tell the Americans 'thanks for the binoculars',\" said an Aleppo rebel leader, Haji Tal-Rifat.</p> <p>Islamist and non-Islamist rebel leaders here say that they are being forced to accept the help of the highly motivated jihadist groups, the predominantly Syrian Jabhat al-Nusraf, and the foreigner group known as al-Muhajirin, because no other assistance is coming their way.</p> <p>Foreign fighters who embrace the al-Qaida worldview are increasingly travelling to Aleppo province, where they are forming training camps and leadership groups and are readily joining the front lines. The foreigners are also taking increasingly prominent fighting positions in non-jihadist units, which claim to be continually low on weapons and ammunition.</p> <p>Rebel officers interviewed by the <em>Observer</em> over the past week say that few recent large attacks against the Syrian military or regime targets have taken place without the presence of several al-Muhajirin members.</p> <p>\"They are fighting here and they are dying here,\" said one rebel officer. \"Sometimes we don't even know their names when we bury them, because they give us an alias when they arrive.</p> <p>\"I know we are playing with fire,\" he said. \"But tell me, what would you do if you were in my position?\"</p> <p>Another Liwat al-Tawheed commander said enough ammunition was arriving from Turkey to keep the battle going, but not enough to win it.</p> <p>\"Compare what we have to what al-Nusraf are getting.

  "<p>Three US states are set to legalise recreational cannabis use this week in votes that could have major implications for the country's war on drugs.</p> <p>Alongside their choice for president, residents of Washington, Oregon and Colorado \u2013 a swing state \u2013 will be asked on Tuesday whether they want to decriminalise cannabis.</p> <p>If the measures are passed, adults over 21 would be able to possess, distribute and use small amounts. Cannabis for authorised medical use is already permitted and regulated by each state, even though it is against federal law.</p> <p>Support is particularly strong in Washington and Colorado, but a \"yes\" vote in any of the states would be interpreted by the Department of Justice as an act of defiance against the federal government's war on drugs \u2013 the national law enforcement programme that spends $44bn a year struggling to stem the tide of illegal drugs in the US.</p> <p>In June 2011, however, the Global Commission on Drug Policy declared that the war on drugs had failed.</p> <p>In a swing state such as Colorado, putting the liberal measure on the ballot could even help to keep the battleground state \u2013 narrowly won for Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 on the president's side. Obama has taken a soft line on medical cannabis use.</p> <p>If recreational use is approved, a new drug industry would inevitably boom and the states expect a tax bonanza from the income generated. Colorado plans to spend the first $40m a year on schools, although the state's largest teachers' union is firmly against legalisation. A yes vote would allow the possession and private use of up to an ounce of cannabis, but it would not be legal to smoke a joint in the street. \"But that's already what people do here anyway, so it won't make any difference. Anyone who's been to a concert in this state will know no one's arrested for pot,\" said Laura Chapin, who runs the \"no\" campaign in Colorado. Denver and the ski town of Breckenridge decriminalised cannabis for private recreational use in 2005 and 2009 respectively. Chapin, who is a Democrat, admitted she had not heard of any dramatic ill effects as a result, but said legalising it statewide was a different matter: \"It effectively establishes Colorado as the cannabis capital of the United States. And it will increase access to the drug for our kids.\"</p> <p>In another political irony, John McKay, a Republican and former US attorney in Washington, is campaigning for a yes vote. Criminalisation of cannabis had been \"an abject failure\", he said, adding that \"millions and millions of Americans\" illegally smoke cannabis, with the proceeds going to illegal cartels. McKay believes that controlling a legal trade would make it safer.</p> <p>Several former senior police officers have also come out in favour. However, operators of medical cannabis dispensaries are divided. Some believe it would ease the taboo around pot, while improving quality. Others fear a threat from new competition or from the federal government blocking the law and launching a wider crackdown.</p> <p>\"I think the federal government will stop us all in our tracks by taking the states straight to court, which will hurt the medical community,\" said Michael Perry, owner of the Sea Weed medical dispensary in Seattle.</p> <p>Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado Republican congressman, argues that prohibition of alcohol did not work in the 1920s \u2013 consumption flourished, as did violence and extortion. He said: \"Cannabis can be used safely and responsibly by adults. Limited law enforcement resources should not be wasted on this, they should be used on preventing crimes that harm others.\"</p>",

  "<p>This week, David Cameron had the opportunity to take action to advance the cause once espoused by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce\" title=\"\">William Wilberforce</a> and support a move against modern-day slavery. He didn't take it.</p> <p>I have always thought there are issues and principles that stand above the usual party political point-scoring. And until recently, I thought that slavery and human trafficking were two of those. Last year, the prime minister made this bold statement: \"<a href=\"http://www.humantraffickingfoundation.org/02/parliamentary-questions-full-list-chronological/\" title=\"\">The UK will lead the world in eradicating modern-day slavery and human trafficking</a>\" and to support that sentiment, the government has slowly moved closer to fully implementing the <a href=\"http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/docs/convntn/cets197_en.asp\" title=\"\">Council of Europe's convention on human trafficking</a>. So when I succeeded in the ballot for a private members bill, it was therefore logical, as vice chair of the parliamentary group on human trafficking, to <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/transparencyinukcompanysupplychainseradicationofslavery.html\" title=\"\">propose a bill</a> that would tackle modern-day slavery.</p> <p>The relevance of such a bill \u2013 one that would require UK companies to audit their supply chains \u2013 has become all the more obvious following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/gangmasters-exploit-flexible-workforce\" title=\"\">Felicity Lawrence's exposure in the Guardian</a> of what was described as the worst case of modern-day slavery ever seen in the UK. In this particular case, the gangmasters have been arrested, but not due to any vigilance on the part of the high street companies that sold products contaminated by slavery to innocent customers.</p> <p>Indeed, most organisations trying to eradicate human trafficking recognise that large numbers are held in enslaved conditions for the exploitation of their labour. My bill would create a framework for large UK companies to audit their supply chain in order to drive out modern-day slavery from their goods and services (this model has recently successfully become law in California).</p> <p>Support for the bill, which I tabled with cross-party support, has been widespread and church leaders, ethical business groups, civic society and specialist anti-slavery groups campaigned together in the runup to its second reading in the Commons on 19 October. I know it is tough to get a bill through that is lower down the ballot, but even Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who toadied up to the government whips by agreeing to talk the bill out, spoke strongly in favour of its ideas and principles.</p> <p>During PMQs two weeks ago, David Cameron said he would \"look very carefully\" at my bill and write to me. I know he has had other troubles since then, but I asked the chief whip, Sir George Young, to consult with the prime minister and seize the opportunity to take a stand on the moral high ground, and take a step to eradicate modern-day slavery from the UK.</p> <p>On 2 November, the government had a second opportunity to allow my bill to pass to the next stage of the parliamentary process, but once again, whips organised filibuster and objection. But this bill and this issue will not go away. It will come before the gouse again on 18 January.</p> <p>Cameron needs to keep his pledge \u2013 that the UK is to lead the global fight against human trafficking and modern-day slavery. Dropping his opposition to the bill would help ensure that. I have still not received the letter he promised me, but a lot of non-governmental organisations <a href=\"http://www.walkfree.org/en/actions/UKtransparencybill\" title=\"\">are writing</a> to urge him to pay close attention \u2013 this includes ManpowerGroup, The Centre for Social Justice (founded by Iain Duncan Smith) and the Church of Scotland and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/unseenuk\" title=\"\">Unseen</a>.</p> <p>We won't give up until we achieve what we thought Wilberforce had already done all those years ago.</p>",
  "<p>When I went to vote last week in New York City, using an absentee ballot (because I will be out of the country on election day), I had a surreal experience that was also very ordinary: I marked my ballot \u2013 put it, as advised by the nice man behind the counter, into a sealed envelope, handed it to him and \u2026 nothing.</p> <p>That is, he looked at me quizzically as I waited. For what? I realized that in every transaction I ever had with the government, I get some kind of receipt or documentation. But I had just handed over my most precious possession, my vote, and I had nothing to show for it. No scrap of paper noting for the record what I had done, and no way to verify that what I wished to do got recorded accurately.</p> <p>The fellow offered, when I expressed some wish for something like this, to use my phone camera to take a picture of me holding the sealed envelope \u2013 for proof I had voted. Seriously.</p> <p>We treat the black hole where our votes vanish as if we don't dare to validate them partly because the process is so highly mystified. One aspect of this mystification, which gatekeepers use effectively against us, is the glamour around the secret ballot. That noble \"secrecy\" is what keeps citizen groups from observing the vote count, demanding verification slips, and so on.</p> <p>The secret vote was, in its time, a great idea. Before the secret ballot was popularized, it was standard practice to intimidate and threaten voters. But few know that America hasn't always had secret ballots. Indeed, the secret ballot didn't even originate in the US \u2013 the system we use is known, actually, as the \"Australian ballot\".</p> <p>The majority of US states did not move to that system \u2013 in which publicly-provided, printed ballots with the names of the candidates are marked in secret \u2013 until after 1884. Until 1891, indeed, Kentucky still held an \"oral ballot\"; and it wasn't till the election of President Grover Cleveland in 1892 that the first US president was elected entirely via secret ballot. </p> <p>Why do I point this out? Because our mystification of the secret ballot is one of the strange ways in which we treat our nation's voting system with truly weird magical thinking \u2013 much like the magical thinking (about which I have written here) that often attends global warming: a defiant, seven-year-old's refusal to connect point A and point B. By now, reams of solid reporting have documented the aberrations, high jinks, missing hard drives, voting machines that weirdly revert to one candidate, voting machines owned by friends of the candidate of one party, and other aspects of systematic corruption that attend America's voting.</p> <p>The dogged and deeply patriotic Mark Crispin Miller has meticulously documented masses more of these examples \u2013 notably in the last election in Ohio \u2013 in his <a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2005/08/none-dare-call-it-stolen/6/\">masterful Harper's essay last month, \"None Dare Call It Stolen.\"</a></p> <p>But this is what is weird about the way we are asked to think about the vote: as if nothing could ever ever ever go wrong with it, and as if it is crazy to entertain the notion that it might. To even raise the issue, with solid documentation, as many reporters and citizens have found out, is to risk immediate mockery \u2013 as Miller notes, citing 2004 headlines: \"Election Paranoia Surfaces: Conspiracy Theorists Call Results Rigged,\" chuckled the&#xa0;Baltimore Sun&#xa0;on 5 November; \"Internet Buzz on Vote Fraud is Dismissed,\" proclaimed the&#xa0;Boston Globe&#xa0;on 10 November; \"Latest Conspiracy Theory \u2013 Kerry Won \u2013 Hits the Ether,\" the&#xa0;Washington Post&#xa0;chortled on 11 November. </p> <p>Meanwhile, solid reporting on the war on voting, and on the corruption of the voting infrastructure, continues to mount, as in the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-gop-war-on-voting-20110830\">Rolling Stone piece this summer on the GOP's \"war on voting\"</a>. and the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/pro-romney-firm-voting-machines_n_2006697.html\">Huffington Post notes the eyebrows raised</a> when a pro-Romney company buys a stake in the company that makes the machines that count our votes.</p> <p>Well, as a student of closing societies, I can tell you that it is crazy to ask Americans to have pure faith that the system is incorruptible, and to ask them to just drop their votes into a black hole and trust in the Lord \u2013 or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diebold#Premier_Election_Solutions_.2F_Diebold_Election_Systems\">Diebold</a>. If you look at weak democracies, the oligarchies that have taken undue control of them always seek to tamper with the vote. It is important for oligarchs to have elections to give their guy a veneer of legitimacy \u2013 and important for the vote always to turn out \"their way\". Indeed, something that is never reported in major news media here is that former President Carter's voting accountability organization sees America's system as relatively flawed and corrupted compared with the systems of many other nations. That is a situation that would typically bring observers from aid organizations like his to our polling places to help us count our vote. (See what happened to foreign poll observers in Miller's Harpers story who tried to watch the vote in America.)</p> <p>Here is my modest proposal: let us end the secret ballot, because we have reached a point, with the internet, in which transparency and accountability is more important than absolute secrecy. Don't panic, because this is what I mean: your vote won't be publicly available, but why can't I get a number when I hand in my ballot, or when I vote in a machine \u2013 just as I do with bloodwork, or computer passwords, or other transactions in which I get accountability, but not disclosure of my actual name? Then, the votes get tallied and posted \u2013 with their corresponding numbers \u2013 online on a public site, and major media reproduce the lists. And I can check my number (unidentifiable to anyone else) to check whether my vote was correctly registered.</p> <p>This would allow, in one sweep, all citizens to watch the watchers. It does not compel anyone to reveal his or her vote \u2013 but gives him or her the option of challenging a discrepancy, and the means to verify what he or she had actually intended to do. And in one easy, inexpensive, technically feasible gesture, it takes the power away from the Diebold-type private corporations and the various parties and the officials, and allows actual verification that cannot be spun or falsified. Most importantly, it removes a psychological blinder, which the American people are asked to wear every two and four years \u2013 the blinder that infantilizes us, that has highly interested individuals and groups say to us, \"we are impartial, this is a magically noble and incorruptible process: trust us.\"</p> <p>As President Ronald Reagan put it in another context: sure \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify\">trust, but verify</a>.</p>",

Two brilliant reflex saves in the first half kept the Sounders out, and then he charged down an Evans shot at point blank range to keep his side level. Then in the second half, with his side under more pressure, he went bravely in for a ball and had a nasty collision with Tiffert for his pains. That moment and the delay for treatment, just took the steam out of the building Seattle momentum, and by the time they'd regained it, they were into the final scheduled minutes and a little panic was creeping in to their decision making.</p> <p>There's a lot to admire about Salt Lake's game management and the way that just at the end a half chance for Saborio might have executed a perfect smash and grab raid. As it was Salt Lake rode their luck a little towards the end (on another night Rosales' shot could have screwed off Beckerman's heel and<em> inside</em> the post) but you can't say that they didn't earn the 0-0 draw they take back to Rio Tinto.&#xa0;</p> <p>So we now essentially have a wild card game hosted by Real Salt Lake for a place in the Western Final. These two sides have only one goal between them in four encounters now - you can't see it opening up in the fifth, but perhaps if Seattle could somehow score an early one it could change the complexion of this fascinating match up. To do so they need to beat Rimando. Surely he can't play like this again. Can he?</p> <p>Thanks for all your tweets and emails. Sorry I couldn't use all of them.

At the other end Gspurning was on hand to make some saves that were less dramatic, but just as vital, including rushing out to execute a perfect sweeper's tackle outside his own box.</p> <p>Salt Lake will be the happier side to be going in level at half time and looking at the first half they will feel that they'll have at least one chance in the second half to take something more from this game, as they did when the sides met earlier in the season. Seattle for their part, just look to be lacking a cutting edge (maybe an Eddie Johnson shaped cutting edge...), but perhaps as the game goes on, they'll be able to pull this defense out of shape a little more decisively, as they seek their first ever aggregate playoff lead. You suspect that with RSL's ability to manage these playoff games, Seattle will need a goal here to put pressure on Salt Lake at home.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509487e0b579f74bac764992\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T02:56:32.544Z\">2.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">HALF TIME: SEATTLE 0 REAL SALT LAKE 0</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Half time thoughts in a moment</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509487c4b579f74bac764991\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T02:56:04.413Z\">2.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">45 mins +2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Parke picks up a yellow for barging into Espindola.

To finish 2nd in a strong Western Conference is no mean feat, and anyone tempted to write them off as an ageing squad after last season, sat up and took notice when they came back to beat the Galaxy 3-1 at the Home Depot Center on opening weekend. From there, RSL hovered near the top of the standings all year, beat the Galaxy at home again, and faced tonight\u2019s opponents three times without conceding a goal (though only scoring one - a recurring theme as the campaign went on). They never quite figured out San Jose (if losing 5-0 on one occasion can be called \u201cnever quite figuring it out\u201d), but generally Jason Kreis made his men into awkward opponents for most sides.&#xa0;</p> <p>The gamble though was keeping this team, that had gone so close to the Champions League title last year, together for one more tilt in spring 2013. With that in mind, perhaps the most significant game for RSL this season was not against MLS opposition, but the 0-0 draw with Herediano that saw them eliminated from the CCL ten days ago. Jason Kreis may now extensively overhaul this side in the off-season - this MLS Cup campaign could be the last one for a core group of players who\u2019ve been the exemplars of the modestly assembled, technically drilled, team-spirited MLS side.</p> <p>The problem lately has been goals though - so just about everything depends on Saborio staying fit for their Cup run, as Espindola has been a little fitful on the goalscoring front this season. As the previous clips show, on his day, Saborio can electrify any game. That second goal in last year\u2019s first leg was just a dagger of a goal...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509475f7b579f74bac764983\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T01:40:08.068Z\">1.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Seattle Sounders</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s been a curious season for the Sounders. They\u2019ve brought in players like Gspurning, Johnson and Tiffert, as well as the bonus return of Steve Zakuani from injury, who\u2019s been like a new signing for them. All of those players have done well: Tiffert has given the midfield a focus point to link defense and attack alongside Alonso; Johnson has broken the club regular season scoring record; Zakuani looks to have added a thoughtful dimension, beyond raw speed, to his game; and Gspurning, as we\u2019ve noted elsewhere, would have been a much more celebrated presence had he not been injured early in his tenure replacing Kasey Keller (though on his return to the team he has demonstrably revived their defensive fortunes).&#xa0;</p> <p>But for every step forward there was a step back. Like LA, Seattle suffered a humbling CCL quarter final defeat, and it cast a pall over an otherwise solid start to their season. They beat LA 2-0 at home with Fredy Montero scoring his first goal of the season (and a beauty it was too), but lost Gspurning to injury in the same game. A nine game winless streak followed soon after. Then Seattle\u2019s Open Cup run seemed to be on cruise control for an amazing fourth consecutive trophy, yet they <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/09/us-open-cup-2012-final-sporting-kansas-city-seattle-sounders\">came off the rails against Sporting KC in the final</a>, when a retaken penalty in the shootout tilted the game irreversibly away from them. They took care of business in their CCL group and seemed to be on cruise control to ease into a high playoff seeding, but slipped up to LA last week, and now find themselves willing on 9th seed Houston, as their only possible opponent in a home MLS Cup final.</p> <p>It\u2019s made their progress appear somewhat <em>treacly</em> - what should have been the next step is looking like a transition year. The only way to alter that impression now, woule appear to be by wining MLS Cup.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509472f995cb1506d2444773\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T01:28:28.295Z\">1.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So here we are again. Seattle Sounders in the post-season, trying to overcome their surprising inability to turn Open Cup prowess into a deep MLS Cup run. Last year, they arrived in the playoffs hard on the heels of eventual winners LA Galaxy, but any hopes of challenging the Galaxy for the Western Conference title was ended at this stage last year, by the opponents they face tonight, the perennially impressive Real Salt Lake.</p> <p>My favorite one-off game of last seasons\u2019 playoffs was the technical battle between LA Galaxy and RSL in the Western Conference final, but for sheer theater, the series between these two sides was hard to beat.</p> <p>Last year it was Seattle who had the notional home advantage going into this game, only to leave themselves with a mountain to climb, after Real Salt Lake hit three perfectly timed goals in the first leg at the Rio Tinto.&#xa0;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlmFzC6gJ4A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SlmFzC6gJ4A?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s always a good time to score a goal, but RSL\u2019s goals each seemed to arrive just as Seattle were beginning to gather a little momentum.

Not bad for an outfit spun off from a ravey record label. What Warp's films have in common is a lean, brains-over-budget approach and an unpretentious focus on entertaining the home crowd, which is often what most strikes a chord elsewhere. This 10th anniversary tribute brings together a This Is England marathon (the film and its spin-off TV series); the Mighty Boosh's Bunny &amp; The Bull; Richard Ayoade's Submarine; and Paddy Considine's Tyrannosaur; plus shorts and guests.

Sitting next to her are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jayz\" title=\"\">Jay-Z</a>, both looking far less at ease with the spotlight than you might expect. They've yet to go public as a pair, and there's scarcely a hint of the megawatt power couple they would become 10 years on.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJDfViozPMwhttp://\">\"So, Solange,\" the interviewer asks, \"being Beyonc\u00e9's sister, do you feel any pressure?\"</a></p> <p>She gives a diplomatic answer: \"She's a beautiful person to be compared to... actually [my music] is a whole different sound.\"</p> <p>That statement is far more true now than it was then. In 2002, she was graduating from Destiny's Child backing dancer to hyper-produced, twangy R&amp;B starlet. Ten years on and Solange has gone from duetting with the kid rapper Lil' Bow Wow to releasing seven-inch singles on New York indie label <a href=\"http://www.terriblerecordsus.com/\" title=\"\">Terrible Records</a> (co-founded by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/grizzly-bear\" title=\"\">Grizzly Bear</a>'s Chris Taylor), steadily becoming a fashion favourite in the process. What's striking about her slow, steady musical journey is that despite long periods of absence over the last decade, the capricious offerings that she has put out \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/dirty-projectors\" title=\"\">Dirty Projectors</a> song here, a duet with Of Montreal there \u2013 were R&amp;B covers of indie, an inverse of the vogue for bands like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">the xx</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/apr/09/new-band-fang-island\" title=\"\">Fang Island</a> doing indie covers of R&amp;B.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hy9W_mrY_Vk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hy9W_mrY_Vk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hy9W_mrY_Vk\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>Solange's latest single, Losing You, her first in four years, is a good indication of why <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/\" title=\"\">Pitchfork</a> once insisted she had \"impeccable taste\". It's short, sweet, bubbly indie pop that sounds like it was made in New York at some point between 1979 and 1981, back when the city was covered in graffiti and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/madonna\" title=\"\">Madonna</a> was waving her demos under Seymour Stein's nose. Co-written and produced by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/06/dev-hynes-blood-orange\" title=\"\">Dev Hynes</a> (Lightspeed Champion, Blood Orange) and benefiting from a sepia-tinged video starring an obscure group of African sartorialists called Le Sapeurs, Losing You completes a decade in which Solange has gone from pop underdog to, well, queen of hipsters.</p> <p>\"Hipster? I despise that word!\" the 26-year-old says, laughing, from her home in New York. Fair enough. Nobody wants to embrace the term, least of all hipsters. Yet it's hard to think of a more appropriate shorthand for her career. \"Come on,\" she counters. \"It's just a lazy way to describe someone who doesn't define themselves in a narrow way, culturally speaking.\"</p> <p>I approached Solange fearing that she might be a spiky interviewee, in part due to an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo-5wI0BdrM\">interview she gave Fox 5 in 2008</a>, which subsequently went viral, in which she berated a presenter for asking about her sister. In fact, she explains, she could hear the Fox team mocking her family off-air, and thought they should know it was disrespectful. \"If I was a male rapper responding in that way, it would have been no big deal,\" she says. \"But when a black woman stands up for herself suddenly she has an attitude problem.\" Besides, she adds, who cares? It's Fox.</p> <p>As it turns out, she's perfectly happy to discuss Beyonc\u00e9. \"My sister and I were not allowed expensive clothes. We so badly wanted these Fila sneakers as kids but my mother took us down to the flea market and got imitation ones. Look at the early Destiny's Child videos, you'll see!\" she says, of their unflashy childhood.</p> <h2>'Hipster? I despise that word. It's just a lazy way to describe someone who doesn't define themselves in a narrow way'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398761817\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351689150483/Solange-Knowles-008.jpg\" alt=\"Solange Knowles\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solange Knowles.

It was always this way. As a child she was deeply attached to her tap shoes and could not be prised away from them. \"At a work party of my dad's, my sister wore this cute little dress and I went stomping along in my tap shoes. They make a lot of noise on a hard floor.\"</p> <p>When Solange was 14, and starting her pop career after signing to Columbia Records, that stubborness reared up, following a family trip to Jamaica. \"I just fell in love with Rastafarian culture, in that way one does at that age, in that you get things a little wrong,\" she recalls. \"I grew my hair right down to my butt, and when I got home I tried making reggae music. My label's reaction was, 'What. The Hell. Is this?'\"</p> <p>Most 14-year-olds on the brink of releasing their first album might back down, but Solange stuck to her guns, evidence of which can be seen in the artwork for Solo Star, which shows the singer wearing a beanie hat in Rastafarian colours. She cracks up: \"Honestly, I'm proud of that album because it reminds me that I did it my way, even if some of it seems a bit... ridiculous now.\" Solo Star reached No 49 on the Billboard chart. She didn't make another album for Columbia.</p> <p>Instead she married a college boy, moved to Idaho and had a baby, all by the ripe old age of 17. \"In retrospect, it was very young to get started on those things, but I had been working since I was 13, so I felt I had a head start. I'm sure deep down my parents were not completely thrilled, but I had my own money. I'd been working for five years by then, so there wasn't much they could do but offer moral support, which they did.\" The sound, perhaps, of those tap shoes still making their own noise.</p> <p>Solange started writing her next album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/aug/15/urban1\" title=\"\">Sol-Angel And The Hadley St Dreams</a>, in 2004, though it didn't see the light of day until 2008. \"I grew up around soul \u2013 Aretha, Marvin Gaye \u2013 so this was my acknowledgement of love for that music.\" Sol-Angel was a smart, exuberant take on 60s Motown but, she says, \"It was actually quite an isolating time for me. I was away from my family, and I loved being a mother, but everything was very new.\" In the four years it took to be released, Solange got divorced and moved to Los Angeles, though ultimately it was \"label issues\" that saw Sol-Angel stuttering to life outside the studio. In a not-unrelated twist, Solange self-released the mellifluous diss track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwrFSKCBXyU\" title=\"\">Fuck The Industry (Signed Sincerely)</a>, which is a good indication of how she felt about Geffen, her record label at the time.</p> <h2>'I walked in and Dev was playing this beat, and it was like a lightbulb went off \u2026 and he was dressed as a wizard, which helped'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398761818\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351689281091/Solange-Knowles-008.jpg\" alt=\"Solange Knowles\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solange Knowles. Photograph: Daniele Tamagni</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Tamagni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She went quiet again until 2010, when she met Dev Hynes. \"One night a friend of mine, the rapper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/feb/04/new-band-theophilus-london\" title=\"\">Theophilus London</a>, called me up and said, 'You have to meet my friend.' I walked in and Dev was standing there, playing this beat, and it was like a lightbulb went off. I thought, 'That's the sound I've been waiting for.' I said to my boyfriend, 'I've found the person I want to make my album with.' He said, 'Don't you want to hear more than one of his songs?'\" The next time they met, Dev showed Solange a playlist that included Chaka Khan and Jimmy Jay, a French 80s hip-hop artist. \"I had practically the same playlist at home! It felt like, 'This has happened for a reason.' Oh, and Dev was dressed as a wizard at the time, which helped.\"</p> <p>Solange won't share album details, even when pressed, because \"we've still got to put all the little finishing touches to it\". Unlike the polite detachment of Solange circa 2002, her coyness now seems to be down to being protective of a project she's clearly excited about, although shortly after we spoke, she confirmed to Pitchfork (where else?) that a seven-track EP called True would be released at the end of November.</p> <p>She did let slip that the new songs are sad, though not because she's miserable. \"Dev had just broken up with his girlfriend, so we closed ourselves away in this house in Santa Barbara and wrote the story of the end of his relationship.\" So the album is actually all about someone else's pain? \"That's right! I'm actually pretty happy right now. But 'I'm happy!' doesn't really work over 12 songs, does it?\"</p> <h2>Solange: a top 5</h2> <p><strong>Losing You (2012)</strong><br>Sounds as if it was made in 1982 in New York, and would have been the summer jam of 2012, had it not been released in early autumn. </p> <p><strong>Fuck The Industry (2005)</strong> <br>This one-off flipped bird to major record labels, media and haters in general. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/solange/i-decided-music-video/736410/\" title=\"\">I Decided</a> (2008)</strong> <br>The stand-out from Solange's second album is a mix of 60s soul, girl-group harmonies and gospel-like devotion. </p> <p><strong>Stillness Is The Move (2010)</strong> <br>This cover laid the words of a typically wonky Dirty Projectors track over a slowed-down version of Royce Da 5'9/Dr Dre's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaK4JfHawVs\" title=\"\">The Way I Be Pimpin</a>. </p> <p><strong>T.O.N.Y (2008)</strong> <br>A soul-spangled lament about the woes of a one-night stand, written with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/cee-lo-green\" title=\"\">Cee-Lo Green</a>, which blends lyrical loquaciousness with dreamy Motown revivalism.</p>"
