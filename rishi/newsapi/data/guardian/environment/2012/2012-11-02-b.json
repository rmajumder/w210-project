  "<p>Xan Brooks's uncomfortable conversation with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/26/john-goodman-argo-ben-affleck\" title=\"\">John Goodman</a> was sad and very illuminating. Like Brooks, I thought of Goodman as warm, funny and gifted, and at first his surliness seemed to demolish that view, but actually what the piece did was explode the artifice of the promotional interview. While the interviewer wants to chat, for the star it's just a brief stop on a contractual merry-go-round. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised when someone wants to get off.<br><strong>Steve Allen</strong><br>Oxford</p> <p>Goodman complains he's asked personal questions instead of being allowed to talk about the movie he's in town to promote. But Brooks gave him lots of opportunity to talk about the movie and got boring, monosyllabic answers, so Goodman only has himself to blame.<br><strong>Tony Bannister</strong><br>London</p> <p>Inspired by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/26/foodie-food-diaries-nigella-heston\" title=\"\">our top chefs</a>, I&#xa0;threw this together on Sunday.<br>Breakfast: got up too late.<br>Lunch: had to skip lunch to take kids swimming.<br>Tea: found a leftover carrot from last Sunday's roast; made a caramelised onion puffy pastry thingy.<br>Supper: bottle and a half of chardonnay, will save other half for tomorrow's breakfast in case I get up late again.<br><strong>Cath O'Hanlon</strong><br>Liverpool</p> <p>The most amusing thing is how many of the foodies have the same on-the-go, carb-grabbing diets as the rest of us, albeit with a yuppyish slant.<br><strong>Thomas Wright</strong><br>London NW2</p> <p>I found <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/golden-dawn-greece-far-right\" title=\"\">Maria Margaronis's report</a> very troubling.

  "<p>Payday lenders, notorious for short-term loans at sky-high interest rates, are moving into the medium-term market offering six-month loans at four-digit APRs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lendingstream.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lending Stream</a> has recently launched a TV advertising campaign with the tag line \"get more out of life\". It shows a couple of football fans cheerfully heading off to a match after getting their car fixed. But what is the APR on their six-month loan, presumably taken out for the season ticket or car repairs? An eye-watering 3,378%.</p> <p>Borrowing money at this rate means \u00a3200 over six months would cost \u00a3440 to repay; \u00a31,000 would spiral to a massive \u00a32,200.</p> <p>Lending Stream also organises customers' repayments in a slightly confusing way which means borrowers don't repay the same amount each month. Essentially, it charges \u00a330 per \u00a3100 borrowed per month \u2013 roughly the same as most 28-day payday loans. In the first month you pay interest on the total amount borrowed, and in months two to six, one-fifth of the capital and interest of \u00a330 per \u00a3100 on the outstanding amount.</p> <p>A customer service representative told Guardian Money repayments on a \u00a31,000 loan over six months would be \u00a3300, \u00a3500, \u00a3440, \u00a3380, \u00a3320 and \u00a3260. This adds up to \u00a32,200.</p> <p>If you default on payments with Lending Stream you'll be charged \u00a312 on the due date, another \u00a310 after 34 days and a further \u00a340 after 48 days.</p> <p>When challenged about their rates, payday lenders have long used the excuse that using an APR (annual percentage rate) to compare short-term loans with other forms of credit doesn't result in a fair comparison. But expanding lending over six months clearly puts holes in this argument. \"There are a few rare situations in which borrowing from a payday lender can be a reasonable choice, however none of these applies when the borrowing term extends beyond a few weeks, the interest costs are simply too high,\" says Paul Crayston, spokesperson for National Debtline.</p> <p>Yet Lending Stream's CEO Michael Thiemann insists: \"We are a responsible lender because we work with borrowers on reasonable repayments and have high repayment rates \u2013 which means we have the right measures in place to enable customers to repay successfully.\"</p> <p>Another concern experts have about Lending Stream, and payday loans in general, is how borrowers can obtain cash with just a few clicks \u2013 making it temptingly easy. Lending Stream boasts it can take just 10 minutes for an extra \u00a315 fee.</p> <p>But Una Farrell of the Consumer Credit Counselling Service (CCCS) says this could be the fast-track route to a debt problem. \"People considering taking out one of these loans really need to step back and not be lured by the offer of money within 10 minutes,\" she warns. \"They need to consider cheaper alternatives such as an authorised overdraft or a credit union loan.\"</p> <p>Figures from the CCCS show the number of people experiencing difficulties with payday loans more than doubled in 2011. The number of calls to the debt charity relating to short-term borrowing rose from 7,841 in 2010 to 17,414 last year.</p> <p>So, who's behind Lending Stream? The company is a brand of US-based \"analytics software company\", Global Analytics. Another company under the brand is <a href=\"http://www.zebit.com/\" title=\"\">Zebit,</a> which offers prepaid Mastercards for borrowers to use online or in shops. But instead of the user loading the card with cash, Zebit does it for you at a hefty 2,012% APR. An \u00a3800 loan over seven months would cost \u00a3285.50 a month, a total of \u00a31,998.50.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pounds2day.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pounds2Day</a> is another company which offers six-month payday loans, charging 2,333% APR. Borrowing \u00a3100 over six months would mean repaying \u00a3220. Although registered at the same address as Lending Stream, the companies are not related.</p> <p>MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy, described payday lenders as \"legal loan sharks\". She's campaigning for an amendment to the Financial Services Bill to give the new Financial Conduct Authority the power to cap the charges made for credit and the cost of borrowing.</p> <p>\"How much worse will things have to get before the government acts?\" she asks.</p> <p>\"Clearly, an increasing number of people excluded by banks are turning to companies charging these kind of rates. These companies can afford big advertising campaigns as, basically, they're making shed loads of money.\"</p> <p>This week Creasy challenged Downing Street to answer a series of questions after an adviser to David Cameron resigned to become a lobbyist for payday lender Wonga.</p> <p>The Labour MP added: \"This appointment only further raises concerns about how seriously this government takes personal debt. When most other countries have capped the costs of credit, British consumers urgently need to know whose side their prime minister is on \u2013 theirs or the legal loan sharks?\"</p>",
  "<p>Ray squats down and inspects the tracks carefully, his rifle held in the crook of one arm. \"These are from yesterday,\" he says, pointing to where the fine dusty edge of the print has been blurred by the breeze. \"It's a big male \u2013 very big. The one we heard roaring just before dawn.\"</p> <p>That was an hour ago. I glance around the silent trees, half expecting to see a big cat staring back at me. Ray gets up and searches the ground nearby. \"Looks like there are two lionesses with him,\" he says.</p> <p>We walk on through the dry forest. At a glance the area looks dead, but closer inspection reveals signs of recovery: green shoots are appearing, the trees are gambling on rain coming soon. Ray leads on for about a mile then stops and inspects another lion print. This time the track is fresh. There is a stiff breeze blowing but the print is perfect. Ray nods and says: \"They were moving around this morning.\" He glances at me. \"Remember the rules. Stay with the gun. Never run.\"</p> <p>I was wondering how I could politely ask: \"Are you a good shot?\" But I knew the answer: all guides in Zimbabwe are great shots. It's part of their training, an apprenticeship that consistently produces top wildlife guides who are supremely competent in those awkward social moments, like a lion charge. In Ray's case, I knew he had spent his life handling such tricky situations, having been born and brought up in this place: Hwange national park. It's a giant of a reserve, 5,400 square miles, bigger than Yorkshire or the state of Massachusetts, but just one element in a vast ecosystem that extends into Botswana, Namibia and southern Angola.</p> <p>We move on again. The bush is thicker and visibility at times down to as little as 10&#xa0;metres. Then we come to a small clearing. \"They slept here,\" whispers Ray. He kneels down by a patch of wet, sandy earth \u2013 lion urine \u2013 and sticks his finger in to take the temperature. \"They are very close.\"</p> <p>He stands and finds the cats' trail leaving the clearing. We follow it. Then&#xa0;we see the dead buffalo, a female&#xa0;lying in the shade of a tree. Its eyes have been pecked out, but it has yet to be disembowelled. Ray touches the carcass.</p> <p>\"Cold.\" He frowns. \"It can't have been killed last night: the birds wouldn't have got to the eyes yet. But if it was the night before last, why have they eaten so little?\"</p> <p>I'm standing, camera at the ready. There are fresh tracks all around us. I feel like I'm watching a chef who is about to whip open the oven door: \"Voila! It's ready!\" All the ingredients in place for a feast of lion-watching \u2013 or maybe just a feast. Who is the masterchef here: is it Ray, or the lion? Three of them against two men and one gun \u2013 which is not with me, thankfully, but I&#xa0;do wish I'd brought something resembling a weapon. Will a&#xa0;Canon EOS 7D camera block up a lion's mouth?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762412\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351789047738/Zimbabwe-map-001.jpg\" alt=\"Zimbabwe map\" width=\"460\" height=\"409\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zimbabwe map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'd arrived in Zimbabwe expecting surprises and with lots of questions. This was a country that had gone from&#xa0;being the bread basket of southern Africa to a basket case in a few short years. The catalogue of disasters was damning: thousands of villagers in Matabeleland had been slaughtered; white farmers had been terrorised and robbed; thousands of black farmworkers had lost their homes and jobs; the economy had been&#xa0;ruined and much of the population had fled abroad. Now there was talk of a recovery and a tourist influx but in the face of such an indictment, I&#xa0;asked myself, should anyone go to Zimbabwe?</p> <p>No sooner had I arrived than I was asking that same question to everyone I met. The replies were always frank.</p> <p>\"It's different now,\" one man told me. \"We have a power-sharing government. Tourists should definitely come,\" he said.</p> <p>\"When there were no tourists,\" said another, \"I never knew if my family would eat.\"</p> <p>Others honed in on underlying issues. \"How much of your money actually goes to the government? I'll tell you \u2013 just the $55 visa fee.\" And, of course, land redistribution came up: \"It had to be done,\" was a common refrain. \"The British stole it, then sold it to each other and thought that was all fine. But the land seizures \u2026 aish!\"</p> <p>That sound: aish, you hear it a lot in Zimbabwe when words are inadequate. When people talk about the period between the 2002 and 2008 elections, you hear it constantly. This was a time when visitor numbers nosedived. Zimbabwe's market share of African tourism had peaked in the 90s at around 8% but that halved in five years. In Hwange the total number of permanent safari lodges and seasonal camps fell from around 35-40 into single figures.</p> <p>Tour operators in the UK had difficult decisions to make. \"We kept Zimbabwe in our brochures,\" says Chris McIntyre of Expert Africa. \"It was important \u2013 especially for the small, owner-run operations that we'd known for years \u2013 to show them that we wouldn't abandon them in the bad times and that we took our responsibilities to them seriously.\"</p> <p>Out in the country I found that loyalty did not go unnoticed. \"We had so few tourists,\" said one man who had kept his job, \"But those few kept us alive.\" When people say such things, the true significance of a decision to boycott a country sinks in.</p> <p>\"For evil to prevail,\" one black Zimbabwean hotel owner told me, \"it only needs good men to do nothing.\"</p> <p>These people, I thought, see tourism as something with real economic and moral power, something that can have a significant and beneficial effect on Zimbabwe's future.</p> <p>So, I am standing there, an hour after first light, watching Ray dip his finger in a dead buffalo, one that belongs to a lion pride that is undoubtedly only metres away. And I start grinning because I had never asked the question: \"Is Zimbabwe safe?\" And if I had, it would have been with people in mind: angry war vets, baton-wielding police, violent mobs. Any safety threat, I'd imagined, would come charging at me in a uniform, not a sandy yellow fur coat with canines as long as my hand. Why hadn't I thought of that? Because the short-term political world distracts us from the deeper, more eternal questions of the natural order, questions such as: am I about to become a feline breakfast?</p> <p>Ray motions with his rifle and moves off. I follow. It is almost impossible to be silent in these dry leaves but fortunately the lions have left a big dusty trail. We walk in their footprints. Then suddenly Ray is pointing. \"There!\"</p> <p>I catch sight of a lioness's backside, then a few flickers of straw-coloured bodies through the trees. Through one gap, a face pauses momentarily. My gaze connects for an instant with a pair of sombre, yellow eyes, then they are gone. We set off in pursuit, but after a few minutes Ray stops. \"They got spooked. We'll never catch them now.\"</p> <p>I hadn't expected that: the king of the jungle to be afraid of us. But Ray nods. \"Sometimes they will sit, rarely they will charge, but usually they run away.\" It doesn't matter to me. I'm elated. Seeing lions on foot is an adrenaline-charged pleasure even when very brief. We decide to call off our lion hunt and go find some breakfast back at Somalisa Camp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762413\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774397239/Somalisa-Camp-Hwange-Zimb-001.jpg\" alt=\"Somalisa Camp, Hwange Zimbabwe\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somalisa Camp</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A tented site, Somalisa is built with minimal impact under a bunch of tall acacia trees that spread between two waterholes. At each there is a small pool, not more than three metres across protected by a shallow moat. As the heat of the day fades, elephants come to both. Once there they drop their trunks in, suck up water, and then pour it down their throats. The particular experience here, however, is to slide into the pool and sit quietly in the water, the vast animals looming overhead as the evening comes. After their drink the giants stroll off through the camp \u2013 there is no fence.</p> <p>When Beks Ndlovu, a black, Zimbabwean wildlife guide, started Somalisa in 2006, it was his first venture and also the worst possible time: electoral violence and land seizures had brought economic chaos. By November 2008 basic commodities were doubling in price every hour of the day and the currency was, quite literally, not worth the paper it was printed on.</p> <p>But elections led to a power-sharing government the following February and after that came recognition that the Zimbabwean dollar was dead. No one would accept it any more. The US dollar was declared the main currency. Since then Zimbabwe has been crawling its way back from the edge of the abyss. \"Things are getting better,\" says Ndlovu. \"Our business has grown to eight camps in Zimbabwe and Botswana.\"</p> <p>Next day I find a sign of the growing confidence a few hours' drive away at Camp Hwange, a new operation set up by Dave Carson. In the dark days of hyperinflation, Dave moved his employees out to wildlife camps in Botswana, saving them from a fate that came to many black Zimbabweans: a border run and escape&#xa0;to Johannesburg. Now there is a new semi-circle of six luxury lodges strung around a waterhole that is filled from a&#xa0;borehole.</p> <p>\"Hwange is a very dry area,\" explains Dave. \"The boreholes and pumps were started in the 1930s and without them, the animals could not survive. They'd all have to move away,\" he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762414\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774570351/Female-elephant-charges-K-001.jpg\" alt=\"Female elephant charges Kevin's Land Rover.\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female elephant charges Kevin's Land Rover. Photograph: Kevin Rushby for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even with the extra water, this time at the end of the dry season is a deadly period. Everywhere we see baobab trees that have been gnawed through by hungry elephants, while each waterhole seems to have the carcass of a young animal that didn't survive, always presided over by a committee of vultures. That evening we see long lines of elephants marching towards the waterhole, a few of them running.</p> <p>\"Some come long distances,\" says Dave as we stand by the campfire, just a couple of hundred metres away. \"We don't know what those animals have been through. Some have probably had bad experiences.\" As if to prove him right, the herd is about to throw up an example of one such individual.</p> <p>Our original plan was to walk out to a hide that Dave has built under an African ebony tree next to the water. Unfortunately, we've left it too late and there are so many elephants rushing in that we need to drive. First, we skirt the pan. In the treeline we spot kudu, impala and sable, all waiting for the elephants to finish. The birds have no such qualms: lines of guinea fowl come chuckling along in the dust while the sky is strafed with pigeons. The elephants take long drinks, then chuck themselves in, throwing great splatters of mud over themselves, and us. The air fills with dust and the contented sounds of animals that know they have survived another day.</p> <p>We motor slowly around the back, attempting to reach the hide. One cow elephant is behaving aggressively, rushing at other animals, waving her ears and trunk. The object of her anger, however, always seems to be other females of similar age and size. She doesn't tackle the big males. She doesn't tackle Land Rovers. Dave goes&#xa0;slowly, keeping a respectful distance. \"We'll just see if she'll let us into the hide.\"</p> <p>No sooner are the words out of his mouth than she drops her head and charges. Our forward path is blocked by lines of elephants who are still pouring in towards the water. Dave slams us into reverse, wrenches the wheel around. We shoot back and around. Then for a split second we are motionless. The elephant is six or seven car lengths away and closing fast. Dave bangs the driver's door and shouts at her, but she is determined to show this tin pachyderm who is boss. We speed away. The mad cow stops, shakes her trunk and ears, then looks around, like a playground bully seeking any signs of mockery in the onlookers. There is another smaller cow elephant standing near. She'd seen everything. Maybe she sniggered. Next thing, the mad cow is chasing her off behind the ebony tree.</p> <p>\"Some of theses elephants might not have seen vehicles or even humans before,\" says Carson. \"So we are careful with them.\"</p> <p>Later on, when the skittish female has gone, we climb into the hide \u2013 a pile of protective logs around the bole of the ebony tree. All around are huge elephants and the sounds of water gurgling down large&#xa0;and thirsty throats. The sun dies in a blazing thorn tree behind us. After&#xa0;dark, when all the big animals have gone, I walk back to the lodge with Dave and we talk about tourism and conservation.</p> <p>\"The wildlife rangers do an amazing&#xa0;job keeping Hwange going,\" says Dave, shining his torch up into a tree to reveal an African scops owl. \"But without tourists it would be very&#xa0;vulnerable.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762415\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774877882/Mana-Pools-National-Park--001.jpg\" alt=\"Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mana Pools, one of Zimbabwe\u2019s\u2019s leading attractions, is under threat from mining companies.

Without the economic clout that tourism brings, wilderness areas can offer little resistance to pressure from other business interests, notably mining. Mana Pools, a world heritage site and one of the country's leading attractions, is under threat from mining companies interested in its mineral sands, and Hwange itself is bordered by open-cast coal operations that are spilling over into the park. Everywhere wildlife is being called on to justify its existence. Beks Ndlovu puts it like this: \"If it is to survive, wildlife must have a value and tourism provides that. When we say that these areas should be protected and not mined or exploited in any other way that appears economically viable, it is tourism that gives us a powerful argument.\"</p>",

  "<p>Research says renewable energy will overtake nuclear power by 2018 (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/30/renewable-energy-nuclear-power\" title=\"\">Windfarm sector grows despite Tory opposition</a>, 30 October), but the government seems about to announce a set of subsidy levels and deployment targets that are radically biased against onshore wind and in favour of nuclear power. Various sources have suggest the government is likely to set the \"strike price\" to be paid for nuclear power at around \u00a3100 per MWh of electricity generated. Yet, onshore wind is likely to get no more than \u00a380 per MWh under the government's electricity market reform. There is also talk that a cap will be announced on windfarm deployment to satisfy anti-windfarm Tories.</p> <p>This smacks of giant political bias in favour of nuclear rather than wind power. If onshore wind was paid \u00a3100 per MWh we could have a lot more onshore windfarms \u2013 but the government clearly prefers to have nuclear if it can. How can they justify such a policy? This is contrary to public opinion, which gives more support to wind power than nuclear. We hear claims that Hitachi's nuclear reactors will be \"reliable\" \u2013 even though half of the advanced boiling water reactors (promoted by Hitachi) being operated work for less than half the time. At least you can predict windspeeds in advance with some accuracy, which is more than you can say for nuclear power stations which suddenly go offline without warning.<br><strong>Dr David Toke</strong><br><em>Senior lecturer in energy policy, University of Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Once again Simon Jenkins (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/wind-turbine-debate\" title=\"\">In the wind turbine debate, who dares utter the B-word?</a>, 2 November) expounds his condescending view that we should all agree that wind turbines are inherently ugly and blots on the landscape. The only reason he can see the view from Mam Tor, or anywhere else for that matter, is because our ancestors cut down all those beautiful trees to make charcoal, build mills, houses and ships. Also visible in the Peak District and Cornwall are the remains of lead and tin mines now deemed worthy of preservation and restoration as part of our industrial heritage. In their heyday I'm sure Simon would have objected to their ruin of the landscape had he been able to write rather than having to fill a tub with ore to earn his crust.</p> <p>Many people find the sight of wind turbines beautiful and a heartwarming indication that at least we are trying. I would love to see a wind farm from my kitchen window on the edge of the Dales National Park. In view of the latest long-term pollution figures from Fukushima, turbines are distinctly more attractive than further nuclear development.<br><strong>Duncan Grimmond</strong><br><em>Harrogate</em></p> <p>\u2022 On-shore wind farms change the character of the countryside. They&#xa0;transform the soul-nurturing nature of the rural landscape into a restless semi-industrial scene with the introduction of artefacts which speak of our stressful hi-tech world. This is a very serious loss for the indigenous population and moreover, in the long term, tourists will realise that much of what they came for has gone. The correct place for wind farms is off shore where the wind is.<br><strong>Jim McCluskey</strong><br><em>Twickenham, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Despite what Simon Jenkins may think, it is simply not the case that the planning&#xa0;system does not try to deal with aesthetics. In Cornwall, at least, the&#xa0;council's landscape officers are consultees for every wind turbine application. They may not use the B word, but they have no hesitation in using phrases such&#xa0;as \"the proposal will adversely impact the existing landscape character of the locality\".</p> <p>The same landscape officers will extol the merits of the redundant 19th-century industry that litters the countryside using adjectives such as iconic. The problem with beauty is that it is in the eye of the beholder. To me, wind turbines are structures of beauty and my view is shared by many; to Jenkins, wind turbines are ugly and his view is shared by many. For a large proportion of the population, however, wind turbines are greeted with the same indifference they display towards pylons: they accept that, if we want to benefit from modern technology, we will inevitably see some manifestation of the industry that supplies it.<br><strong>Bob Egerton</strong><br><em>Cornwall councillor, Truro</em></p>",
  "<p>Until Friday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/denismacshane\" title=\"\">Denis Macshane's</a> public profile was that of a principled politician who was unstinting with his energy and commitment to the causes in which he believed. The former Europe minister is a fluent French speaker, journalist (and occasional Guardian contributor), biographer of one French president and longstanding friend of the current one, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He's been a keen trade unionist, a friend of Solidarity in Poland from its earliest days, and is a past president of the National Union of Journalists. Above all, the more the European project needed friends, the more urgently he made the case in its favour. So the judgment of the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmstnprv/635/63502.htm\" title=\"\">MPs' standards committee</a> that his dishonest claims for more than \u00a312,000 of expenses amounted to \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/02/labour-expels-denis-macshane-expenses\" title=\"\">the gravest case</a>\" it had seen is a deeply regrettable end to what had been an admirable career and one, moreover, that risks tainting the very causes he has supported so well. It is the more to his discredit that the commissioner on standards, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-interests/pcfs/remit/\" title=\"\">John Lyon,</a> found in his report that on top of the original fraud, Mr MacShane had come to be <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmstnprv/635/63505.htm\" title=\"\">downright obstructive</a> in the commissioner's attempts to establish the truth. His career has, sadly but rightly, ended in ignominy.</p> <p>This fall from grace, painfully drawn out over three long years (and, if the police inquiry is reopened, still not over), ought to be the final chapter in the catastrophic saga of politicians cheating the public purse. But it seems as if, like other players in the extraordinary collapse in institutional authority that has marked the first decade of the 21st century, even now some older members still cannot see themselves as others see them. How else to explain this month's reports of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/mps-expenses-row-defend-arrangements\" title=\"\">MPs renting their houses to one another</a> to avoid the tough but necessary new restrictions on claiming mortgage repayments?</p> <p>In his essay The<a href=\"http://libcom.org/files/MORAL%20ECONOMY%20OF%20THE%20ENGLISH%20CROWD.pdf\" title=\"\"> Moral Economy of the English Crowd,</a> the historian EP Thompson described how the tacit consent of the community in the 18th century legitimised unlawful behaviour. It seems this particular moral economy persists among some older MPs. Mr MacShane justified his expenses claims by arguing that the only stream of funding available for the kind of work \u2013 research, travel, writing \u2013 that he wanted to continue after his ministerial career ended in 2005, not least at Tony Blair's behest, was sparse, slow and bureaucratic. He was virtually (he implied) driven to what he might have dismissed as creative accounting in order to pursue his valuable mission as Europe's voice at Westminster. This is sophistry, a cover for the lethal sense of entitlement engendered by an absurdly lax expenses system. At least the class of 2010 knows it has to be, and be seen to be, different.</p>",
  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/02/112263-stephen-king-review\" title=\"\">Stephen King's remarkable time-travel novel 11.22.63</a>, the central character, Jake, journeys back from the America of 2011 to the America of the early 1960s. While he is there, a woman challenges him to tell her one good thing about the future. \"I'll give you two for the price of one,\" Jake eventually replies. \"The cold war is over and the president is a black man.\" The woman's jaw drops. \"You're serious?\" she stammers in disbelief. \"Yes, I am,\" Jake replies. The woman ponders this almost inconceivable news from the future. Finally she asks, very haltingly: \"Is he \u2026 doing a good job?\" Jake explains that opinions of the president vary but, \"If you want mine, he's doing as well as anyone could expect, given the complexities.\"</p> <p>Mr King has surely got <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama's</a> first term about right. The record is certainly not perfect, but he has done about as well as anyone could reasonably expect, given that the economy has been in decline, the banks in crisis, America at war and the Republican party out to destroy him. Leading America through and out of such crises would be a formidable set of challenges at the best of times, but they have been made infinitely more difficult by the Republicans' single-minded commitment to eviscerating the Obama presidency. At a time when the economic role of government has been more important than at any time in a generation, the Republicans have been set on blocking, subverting and dismantling just about every programme that Mr Obama has promoted. In many cases they have succeeded. It is to Mr Obama's credit that he has achieved what he has \u2013 most notably the historic reform of healthcare and the economic stimulus package of 2009, their genuine imperfections rightly overshadowed by the substance of what they contained in spite of congressional resistance. And since the Republican recapture of Congress in 2010, US politics has been dominated by people who do not just despise Mr Obama, but by people who also despise government itself.</p> <p>The election of 2012 was never going to be a repeat of the election of 2008. Four years ago, Americans had the opportunity to repudiate the Bush years \u2013 so uniquely calamitous both at home and abroad \u2013 and to make a historic choice by electing Mr Obama. Even four years ago, never mind when seen from the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/\" title=\"\">Jim Crow</a> era, the 2008 contest was a jaw-dropping, almost redemptive, American moment. Expectations were incredibly high. Even in the best of times, it would have been hard to fulfil them. Mr Obama has fallen short of some important goals. Guant\u00e1namo Bay remains open. The Middle East peace process has got nowhere. Progress on climate change, though not negligible, has been slow. The Iraq war is over and torture has been ended, but the conflict in Afghanistan continues, waged increasingly through drone attacks that solve neither military nor political problems.</p> <p>Four years later, the 2012 contest may lack the glamour of 2008. But it is in every way at least as important. Partly, that is because of what a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mittromney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney</a> victory on Tuesday might mean \u2013 the destruction of welfare safety nets, a free pass for the tax-avoiding rich, indifference to the environment, the dismantling of healthcare, reactionary moves on women's and gay rights, and the chance to stuff the supreme court even more solidly with justices of the anti-government right. More than that, however, it is because the re-election of Mr Obama would be an act of collective national seriousness by Americans who believe in good government not no government and who possess a concern for community that goes beyond material self-interest. This is America's election, not ours, and some Americans think the rest of us have no right to an opinion. But <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/10/31/euro-opinion-us-election/\" title=\"\">our part of the world is clear that it prefers Mr Obama</a> to have four more years in the White House and on Tuesday we hope that Americans will use their votes to ensure that he does.</p>",

This is his last election, he's really energised.\"</p> <p>And so he was. I haven't heard Obama as fired up at a rally like this one since 2008. In the events I've seen him at this year he's always been 10% reserved, 20% professorial. A pale reflection of the \"hope and change\" merchant of four years ago. But this time he was back to the firebrand of 08, his speech belching out of him like it came from the gut.</p> <p>I know it's become unfashionable to talk about Obama the orator \u2013 he over did it with the promises and the rhetoric four years ago and to no small extent he's been paying the price ever since. But when he turns it on, it still sends electricity through the crowd, and it did here.</p> <p>The anger towards Romney was palpable. \"The folks at the top in this country don't need another champion in Washington. They already have a seat at the table,\" he said. Romney didn't represent change, or the future. \"To make sure no matter who you are or where you come from you can make it in America, that's the future.\"</p> <p>It is stating the obvious that Obama's supporters in the crowd loved him. But actually, at this late stage in the election, that is of huge importance. His mission here was to fire up the base so that they get out this weekend knocking on doors and getting out the vote. With poll margins razor-thin in Ohio, the candidate that has the edge in inspiring his faithful followers over the next four days in this crucial battleground state is likely to be the next occupant of the White House.</p> <p>So it matters that Pam Bishop, 60, looked at the end of Obama's speech as though she'd just seen an angel, and vowed to work hard from now to the end of election day. \"I think he is amazing. I think he gets what the country needs and he's willing to work for every single one of us.\"</p> <p>And it particularly mattered that Rick McCurdy, 59, said he found the speech \"very motivating\". McCurdy is one of the one in eight Ohioans who work in the auto industry, in his case for Honda US, and he says without the auto bailout he might have lost his job. \"I'm not ready to go backwards,\" he said, echoing one of Obama's mantras. \"I want to see him moving forwards with the recovery.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T17:04:45.923Z\">at 5.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093e897b579f74bac764970\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:36:55.379Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mitt Romney</strong> appears to be doing his greatest hits here in West Allis, but the latest jobs figures don't get much attention from Romney:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unemployment is higher today than the day Barack Obama took office.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, that is technically true, given that the January 2009 jobs report had 7.8% unemployment, and Obama was inaugurated on 20 January.</p> <p>And here we go with the five-point plan to create jobs.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:42:59.996Z\">at 3.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093e753b579f74bac76496f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:31:31.175Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">MItt Romney speaks in Wisconsin</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Now <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> takes the stage in <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, and he also starts off by mentioning the impact of Sandy.

But these figures today were to have been the killer, with just four full days of campaigning left.</p> <p>It has not worked out like that, mainly because the figures have gone down, dropping below the symbolically-important 8%. It is not just that the figures have gone down but that voters have not attached as much importance to them as the Romney campaign had hoped. Americans have been living with unemployment for four years: it is a fact of life, and the monthly unemployment figures have been largely discounted.</p> <p>These figures are good for the Obama campaign, the 171,000 new jobs higher than expected.

Will job creation beat expectations?</strong></h2> <p>Forecasters are predicting around 125,000 jobs have been created last month. Anything above that will be seen as better than expected, especially a figure of 150,000 or more. Similarly, a total below that will suggest the opposite, especially if the new jobs total dips below 100,000.</p> <h2><strong>2. Will the unemployment rate stay at 7.8%?</strong></h2> <p>Even a slight uptick in the headline rate of unemployment will become ammunition for the Romney campaign \u2013 all the more if the rate goes to 8% or above.</p> <h2><strong>3. Will revisions to previous months add or subtract?</strong></h2> <p>September's positive jobs report may be subject to heavy revision, possibly raising the unemployment rate in retrospect. Look out for revisions to previous months.</p> <h2><strong>4. What about the numbers below the headline figures?</strong></h2> <p>After the job creation total and unemployment rate, the report includes a wealth of other data. The key statistics include hours worked and hourly pay: strong increases in both are signs of an improving labour market, and a better guide to how those in work are faring.</p> <h2><strong>5. What will be the impact from Hurricane Sandy?</strong></h2> <p>The storm's devastation may have come too late in the month to have much impact on October's jobs numbers. But its influence, if any, is likely to be negative, as well as a possible source of confusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-957d65a3-fac3-4146-b624-6d4496d331fd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2012/10/31/1351690402591/Downed-power-lines-after--007.jpg\" alt=\"Downed power lines after superstorm Sandy at Seaside Heights island\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downed power lines at Seaside Heights, New Jersey.

But for Obama and his supporters, the real question is how October's figures stack up alongside the rosy economic data received recently, and whether September's decline in the headline rate of unemployment \u2014 to 7.8% from 8.1% \u2014 was merely a blip or part of an improving trend.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has put jobs at the centre of his pitch for the White House, regularly boasting that he \"knows how to create jobs\" while citing the 23m Americans estimated to be out of work.

  "<p>Doctors were at the forefront of the Aids treatment revolution a decade ago, denouncing stigmatisation and inequality from conference platforms and lobbying politicians alongside the activists. Could we see cancer doctors take up the banners and the slogans on behalf of the poorest in the same way?</p> <p>Until last weekend, I personally did not think so. But in a lakeside hotel in Lugano in Switzerland, at <a href=\"http://www.eso.net/varie/wof.html\">a meeting of the World Oncology Forum</a>, I watched what looked like a process of radicalisation take place. Nearly 100 of the world's leading cancer doctors were there \u2013 extremely eminent clinicians and scientists. The question for discussion over a day and a half was \"Are we winning the war on cancer?\" Broadly speaking, the answer seemed to be no, on two fronts. The first was that scientific progress had not delivered hoped-for cures, even for countries with substantial amounts of money to spend on drugs. The second was that people in low- and middle-income countries are dying of cancers that are preventable and curable in the richer world. And it was that second front that the forum agreed to tackle in an unprecedented way.</p> <p>Some of the oncologists present, who spend their time in high-tech labs and well-equipped wards in Europe and the US, did not anticipate the way the meeting would develop, I suspect. There was much very interesting discussion about the failures of the much-hyped and hoped-for targeted therapies, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/28/targeted-cancer-drugs-expectations-experts\">which I wrote about here</a>. There was also a lot of anger at the tobacco industry, which doctors held directly responsible for millions of deaths past and to come.</p> <p>But tobacco control is now most needed in poorer countries where cigarettes are dirt cheap and the companies look to expand their sales. Cancer is a global issue and growing fastest in low- and middle-income countries. Professors Rifat Atun of the Imperial College Business School and Felicia Knaul, director of the <a href=\"http://globalhealth.harvard.edu/org/harvard-global-equity-initiative\">Harvard Global Equity Initiative</a>, powerfully put the case for doctors to fight for better care and prevention in the developing world. Knaul spoke of the unnecessary deaths of children from leukaemia and women from breast and cervical cancer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>Children with leukaemia divide, such that in Canada almost 90% can hope to survive where in the poorest countries of the world, 90% can expect to die.</p> </blockquote> <p>Atun and Knaul are joint authors of a new book, called <a href=\"http://www.pih.org/news/entry/new-report-released-closing-the-cancer-divide/\">Closing the Cancer Divide: a blueprint to expand access in low- and middle-income countries</a>. It aims to show what can be done and stamp out four pernicious myths:</p> <p>1) Cancer treatment is unnecessary because the burden of disease is not great in the developing world \u2013 untrue. Over half of all new cancer cases and two-thirds of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>2) It is unaffordable for most poor countries \u2013 untrue. The economic burden of cancer on those countries is high, the costs of lost productivity outstrip the costs involved in care and only 5% of global cancer spending takes place in low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>3) Cancer prevention and treatment is unattainable because of inadequate human and physical resources \u2013 untrue. Screening for breast and cervical cancer, for instance, can be integrated into other programmes such as maternal and child health, and HIV care.</p> <p>4) It is inappropriate because the resources are needed for high-burden infectious diseases \u2013 untrue. Expanding cancer care can strengthen whole health systems, many cancers are associated with poverty just like infectious diseases and at least half of all deaths from cancers in developing countries are preventable.</p> <p>Atun told the meeting that what the Aids community did, they could and should do too. By the end of it, goaded as much as guided by Lancet editor Richard Horton, they drew up a list of 10 principles for a declaration to be published in the new year. While some were about better drug development, most were about ending the shameful neglect of cancer in the developing world.</p> <p>Next stop \u2013 the barricades.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article was amended on 12 November 2012. Rifat Atun works at the Imperial College Business School, not the London Business School. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Ash dieback disease will spread across the UK by around 20 miles a year, infecting most of the country's 90m ash trees within a decade, the government was told Friday at a crisis meeting with its leading environment advisers.</p> <p>It is feared many more clusters will be identified in the next year and that spores from the fungus will spread from the east of England and Scotland to eventually cover Britain \u2013 in some cases carried on people's clothes.</p> <p>The grim picture was set out by Prof Ian Boyd, chief scientist with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, at a national emergency Cabinet Office briefing room (Cobra) meeting led by the environment secretary, Owen Paterson.</p> <p>Even if the native ash tree cannot be saved, the meeting was told, such is the tide of similar deadly plant diseases now coming into Britain on millions of imported plants every year that drastic measures like long quarantine periods and passports for all plants may be needed.</p> <p>In the gloomiest prognosis yet made of the disease now known to be infecting trees in Scotland, East Anglia and possibly Kent, Boyd warned ministers that trees cannot be vaccinated, and the airborne disease would be too expensive to treat chemically. He said the spores first found in Britain in March can be spread even by the moving of leaves.</p> <p>But some ash trees are likely to have natural immunity, he said. \"Older trees infected with ash dieback may weaken but die of other diseases. Trees are more likely to be affected in forests than if they are isolated,\" he said.</p> <p>The government will hold a tree summit next week at which proposals will be discussed by the forestry industries, scientists, charities and nurseries. The most radical suggestion is expected to be for more rigorous border checks on the billions of trees and plants imported into Britain and Europe from around the world every year for parks, gardens, woodlands and forests.</p> <p>\"There is a tidal wave of pathogens coming in. It is terrifying. We have to have a strategic response. Unless we have better biosecurity in the EU and Europe it will be very difficult to stop them coming in. It is difficult to ban all imports. It has to be done on a risk basis,\" said Martin Ward, chief plant health officer at Defra's Food and Environment Research Agency.</p> <p>Other measures expected to be discussed by government include forcing nurseries to attach \"plant passports\" to all imported plants; a new system to ensure all plants are safe before they enter Britain; tighter rules on suppliers; restrictions on the public bringing in plants from abroad; and a radical overhaul of the European plant protection system.</p> <p>But other plant experts on Friday called for stronger measures. Tony Kirkham, head of the arboretum at Kew Gardens, which has 14,000 trees, told the Guardian a complete ban was needed on imports of any plants that threatened a species, and a one-year quarantine was needed for all plants coming into Britain.</p> <p>\"Ash dieback shows how fragile our woodlands are and how something can turn into a disaster very quickly. Most of us were not even aware of it until very lately.</p> <p>\"There are so many pests and diseases out there. We can buy trees in Italy, France, anywhere nowadays. I don't think we should be allowed to do that. I think there should be bans on anything that threatens a species, and a one year quarantine system for all woodland species coming into Britain. That's the only way we will stop these diseases,\" he said.</p> <p>Joan Webber, principal pathologist at Forest Research, the research agency of the UK Forestry Commission, said: \"There have been more outbreaks of diseases in the past 10 years than we had in the whole of the last century. These organisms reinvent themselves when they move into an unknown habitat. Plants have little or no resistance to them. It can happen very quickly.\" She urged anyone going into woods to clean their boots and to ask nurseries to be more vigilant for diseases.</p> <p>But she said that a full quarantine system on all plants entering Britain would be difficult to work and some plants might not show evidence of disease for nearly two years.</p> <p>\"We cannot immunise trees to special pathogens. In the very long term we can expect the ash population to evolve and reach a new equilibrium. We may be able to control as die back with fungicides but we would need to spray every few weeks over the whole country. It is inconceivable that you could do this without disastrous side effects. The hope of chemical control is extremely unlikely,\" said Mike Shaw, a leading plant scientist at Reading University.</p>",
  "<p>There are more than 15&#xa0;million children and young people in the UK below the age of 20. They&#xa0;make up one quarter of our population. Each one has individual potential; together, they represent our future. Quite rightly, the government wants to make sure they get the very best education. Unfortunately it has decided to \"reform\" the system in a way that could seriously damage the creative future of this country.</p> <p>The proposals that have been announced for the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/17/gcse-exams-replaced-ebacc-michael-gove\" title=\"\">English Baccalaureate (EBacc)</a> do not include the arts as a core subject, and the way in which the proposals have been formulated suggests that art, design, dance, drama and music&#xa0;will be pushed to the margins with very little space in the timetable for these subjects.</p> <p>We all have an interest in giving our children a broad education. Of course, they need literacy and numeracy. But&#xa0;they also need to develop their imaginations, and exercise their visual skills and emotional creativity. Learning&#xa0;through and about the arts enables young people to make, learn and express themselves. This is fundamental to achieving success in school and in&#xa0;later life.</p> <p>Other subjects suffer in the absence of the arts. Schools that integrate arts into their curriculum also show improved student performance in maths, English, critical thinking and verbal skills. The arts have a primary role in a world that&#xa0;is now highly dependent on visual literacy. Engineers, designers and those&#xa0;employed in the media all have to understand through images as much&#xa0;as&#xa0;through words.</p> <p>Arts shouldn't be seen as an optional extra, beyond the proper \"academic\" subjects. We need an education that is holistic and values the visual as much as numeracy and literacy. Students who engage in arts in school are twice as likely to volunteer and are 20% more likely to vote. Students from low-income families who take part in arts activities at school are three times more likely to take a degree.</p> <p>In February, Darren Henley of radio&#xa0;station Classic FM <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/feb/28/schoolchildren-study-arts-16-report\" title=\"\">published a report for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport</a> that gave a firm endorsement of the importance of earlier cultural learning in the curriculum. At the time, the government gave a favourable response, and promised a&#xa0;national plan for cultural learning. Now there is a fear that his proposals will not be implemented as a result of the review of the curriculum. Yet cultural learning is more significant than ever in&#xa0;a global economy which needs a workforce that is knowledgeable, imaginative and&#xa0;innovative.</p> <p>Anyone who watched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle's Olympic opening ceremony</a> will have seen a celebration of the creative industries in this country over recent years and what a thriving industry that is for the UK today \u2013 one of the few parts of the economy that is still growing.</p> <p>Where would British creative industries be without the great innovators and creators who have been trained in the British system but are recognised internationally? The architect Richard Rogers, the inventor James Dyson, the designer Jonathan Ive or artists like Bridget Riley, to name but a few.</p> <p>That is why the Tate, and others in the <a href=\"http://www.culturallearningalliance.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Cultural Learning Alliance</a>, are calling for the arts to be the sixth strand in the curriculum and form part of the EBacc alongside maths, English, science, modern languages and humanity subjects. By making art a part of the national curriculum, we give artists, designers, engineers, creators and cultural leaders of the future opportunity to develop the imagination and skills that are vital to&#xa0;this country's&#xa0;prosperity.</p> <p>Three years ago I took part in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/dec/13/arts-bosses-school\" title=\"\">a job swap with the headmaster of the Thomas Tallis school</a> in south-east London. It was an incredibly moving and inspiring experience. I was not there to teach but to learn. What I learned was the importance of stimulating children's curiosity, and equipping them with the means to express themselves verbally, physically, visually and imaginatively.</p> <p>There is a real risk that fewer and fewer schools will provide learning opportunities in the arts. The UK's leading edge in creativity may be lost. We cannot deprive an entire generation&#xa0;of children of the cultural skills that&#xa0;they will need.</p>",

At first glance, the photographs in Men and Women look like a mishmash of styles and approaches, with what look like snapshots interspersed with more straightforward portraits, often in black and white. On closer inspection, though, you see the unerring eye of a photographer for whom there are no rules.\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/oct/12/tom-wood-men-women-photographers-gallery\">Sean O'Hagan</a>, the Guardian</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong><br>This is Tom Wood's first major UK exhibition. The show spans more than 40 years' work and features images from his major projects, such as The Football Grounds, Women's Market, and All Zones Off Peak.</p> <p>Wood has photographed his myriad projects over many years, returning to the same locations and people as an empathetic observer. His style is difficult to categorise: he photographs people close up and from a distance, in posed portraits and in informal street photographs. The cumulative result is a compassionate portrait of the environment, Liverpool and its people. The photographs contain individual moments and commonplace scenes that, through time but also through Wood's eye for detail, evolve into compelling insights into everyday life.</p> <h2>Rothko/Sugimoto: Dark Paintings and Seascapes</h2> <p>Until 17 November 2012<br><a href=\"http://www.pacegallery.com/london/exhibitions/11142/rothko-sugimoto-dark-paintings-and-seascapes\">Pace Gallery</a>, London<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What's everyone saying?</strong><br>\"Rothko and Sugimoto think in terms of eras of history and eons of organic life, not the decades of their own lives. Rothko had directed his art, as Sugimoto does now, to a primal, evolutionary sense of being human. What is true of Rothko and Sugimoto becomes true of all of us when we attend to their experience \u2013 if we encounter the limits of human feeling and perception that Rothko's paintings and Sugimoto's photographs represent.\" <a href=\"http://www.pacegallery.com/london/exhibitions/11142/rothko-sugimoto-dark-paintings-and-seascapes\">Richard Shiff</a>, from the exhibition catalogue</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398768513\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/11/2/1351873719486/Bay-of-Sagami-Atami-1997--001.jpg\" alt=\"Bay of Sagami, Atami, 1997, by Hiroshi Sugimoto\" width=\"460\" height=\"327\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bay of Sagami, Atami, 1997, by Hiroshi Sugimoto. \u00a9 Hiroshi Sugimoto, courtesy of Pace Gallery Photograph: Hiroshi Sugimoto</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hiroshi Sugimoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"A show that groups the very late and less familiar paintings of Mark Rothko with the hypnotically beautiful seascape photographs of Hiroshi Sugimoto.\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/oct/03/rothko-hiroshi-sugimoto-pace-london-gallery\">Mark Brown</a>, the Guardian</p> <p>\"While Rothko's late paintings attempt to turn away from romanticism, Sugimoto wholeheartedly embraces the tradition. Given that Sugimoto claims to have been driven in this direction by seeing these particular Rothko works in 1978, the notion that there's a dialogue going on here starts to slip a little. This isn't a conversation, this is a counterpoint duet.\" <a href=\"http://www.theartsdesk.com/visual-arts/rothkosugimoto-dark-paintings-and-seascapes-pace-gallery\">Steven Gambardella</a>, theartsdesk.com</p> <p>\"The formal similarities are striking, with Sugimoto's photographs shot from such a distance as to appear almost abstract: just two contrasting bands of sea and sky, in differing shades of grey. But more than that, the exhibition also makes the case for an affinity of mood and theme: for a shared melancholy and sense of sublime, a feeling of staring into the void \u2013 an idea helped by the knowledge that these works by Rothko were amongst the last he produced before his suicide.\" <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/art/event/269786/rothko-sugimoto-dark-paintings-and-seascapes\">Gabriel Coxhead</a>, Time Out</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong><br>This exhibition juxtaposes eight paintings by the Russian-American abstract expressionist Mark Rothko with eight seascape prints by the Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto.</p> <p>The two artists' work is characterised by the prominent use of greys and blacks. Rothko's series appears connected with his suicide a year later, with colour drained from the canvas and inspiration spent. Sugimoto's prints also seem bleak but there is a calmness in his seascapes. Taken with a large-format camera and very long exposures, he has created abstract images with subtle details that draw you in.</p> <p>The similarity of their work placed side by side is striking, but the themes that emerge from each artist are disparate.</p> <h2>Jitka Hanzlov\u00e1</h2> <p>Until 3 February 2013<br><a href=\"http://www.nationalgalleries.org/visit/floorplans-303/exhibitions/jitka-hanzlova#.UJP1z7-e2IY\">Scottish National Portrait Gallery</a>, Edinburgh</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398768514\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/11/2/1351874598820/Untitled-from-the-series--001.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled, from the series Flowers, 2009. \u00a9 Jitka Hanzlova\u0301\" width=\"220\" height=\"399\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled, from the series Flowers, 2009. \u00a9 Jitka Hanzlova\u0301</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jitka Hanzlova\u0301</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What's everyone saying?</strong><br>\"Hanzlov\u00e1's photography is in constant pursuit of the relationship between the individual and the context in which he or she lives.

The exhibition assembles around 100 pieces, which span her output from the last 20 years and features her works Rokytnik, Bewohner, Flowers and Horses.</p> <p>Hanzlov\u00e1 was heavily influenced by her defection in 1982 from the communist regime in Czechoslovakia to Essen, West Germany. The predicament of being an outsider in a strange town is apparent in the series Bewohner \u2013 German for inhabitants \u2013 as it portrays isolation and detachment in the cityscape through a series of individual portraits. Hanzlov\u00e1 photographs her subjects in the centre of the frame with a disconcerting simplicity.</p> <p>Rokytnik is the village where she grew up before her defection; she returns here after the breakdown of the communist regime in 1990. Her project on the village encapsulates her work, with its recurring themes of distance and isolation.</p>",
  "<p>A week on Saturday Glen Jackson will jog out at Twickenham to referee England's opening autumn Test versus Fiji. It will be the New Zealander's first tier one international and represents one of sport's more impressive role reversals. Less than two and a half years ago Jackson was wearing No10 for Saracens in a Premiership final against Leicester alongside Brad Barritt, Alex Goode and Mouritz Botha. It is a bit like Gary Neville refereeing the next FA Cup final.</p> <p>The obvious question instantly presents itself: Is the 37-year-old stark, raving mad? Does he not appreciate the abuse referees \u2013 and their guide dogs \u2013 ritually receive every Saturday afternoon? Has the vitriolic hounding of other Test referees such as Wayne Barnes and his compatriot Bryce Lawrence not put him off? \"Almost everyone has said I'm bonkers,\" says Jackson, who will also run touch when England face South Africa later this month. \"Sometimes \u2013 actually most of the time \u2013 I do think: 'What the hell am I doing?'\" This, clearly, is a man with a masochistic streak.</p> <p>His fast-track appointment, nevertheless, is both a lesson and an example to every professional player. Not all ex-pros can be a coach or enjoy a seat in a warm television studio. Rugby union is a rapidly changing game with a global reach. If you possess a thick skin and fancy clocking up thousands of air miles, decent careers are available. There is just one snag: in terms of popularity 99% of referees rank with traffic wardens, politicians and journalists. Even in their own homes there is little peace. \"It's not much fun when you sit down, pick up the paper and discover they're calling you this or that,\" says Ed Morrison, the doyen of English refereeing who presided over the 1995 World Cup final.</p> <p>Luckily Jackson knows the score. Barnes, vilified in New Zealand following the All Blacks's defeat by France in 2007, is now a mate, as is the aforementioned Lawrence, savaged in South Africa after last year's Rugby World Cup quarter-final between the Springboks and Australia.</p> <p>The criticism was among the reasons for Lawrence's retirement from refereeing last month. \"The poor bloke had 90,000 South Africans on Facebook not just wanting to criticise his refereeing but to injure him as well,\" recalls Jackson. \"You do wonder why you want to do it but the biggest thing was to encourage more players to get involved because then it'll be better for everyone. Not every player can go into coaching. This is another chance to stay in a great&#xa0;game.\"</p> <p>At least rugby has not had the same kind of situation as in football this week but Jackson, who took his first steps up the refereeing ladder in England by taking charge of college games at Cambridge, was sharply criticised only last week for his decision not to award a penalty try in New Zealand's ITM Cup final between Canterbury and Auckland. \"If you're a coach you probably slag the referee more than your own players. Half the time you know they're just trying to support their team and are unhappy because they've lost. The simplest guy to blame is the one in the middle. It's a bit of a shame but when you're a player you think it's great to have your coach supporting the team.\"</p> <p>The effects of stinging abuse, even so, can be lasting. \"At the end of the day it does get reasonably personal and it does get to me. There's no doubt about that. You've just got to understand it's their job on the line at times and they're trying to support their side.\"</p> <p>He accepts, too, that his notable playing career for Sarries, Bay of Plenty, the Chiefs and NZ Maori will mean diddly if he commits a high-profile error next weekend. \"When you're playing you've usually got a chance to rectify mistakes pretty quickly. When you're refereeing, that's it. It sticks with everyone. It's hard to come out and make a blinding refereeing decision that makes people forget the last one. In that respect it is mentally hard. Ten years ago it was also easier to own up to a mistake, go for a beer and get on with it. I think there was more respect. A player could have a beer with the referee and you got to know him personally. Now any mistake gets replayed 300 times on TV. You just have to try and move on and make sure it doesn't wear you down.\"</p> <p>That can be easier said than done. Jackson has already endured a pithy verdict from the hardened All Blacks hooker Andrew Hore after daring to query his scrummaging technique during one Super 15 game. \"I had no comeback; the whole front row just laughed.\" The breakdown can be even trickier \u2013 \"It doesn't matter how much coaching or preparation you get, there are times when you just don't know what's going on\" \u2013 but Jackson receives grudging admiration from most players. \"Having been a recent player, these guys respect you for having put yourself in that position. My first year was a bit of a honeymoon period; if you made a mistake it was: 'Oh well, he's new.' I wanted that to wear off quickly. I didn't want to be an ex-player refereeing. I just wanted to be a referee.\"</p> <p>Those words should be stuck on every Premiership player's fridge.</p> <p>Without a decent referee, the game will invariably be the poorer. Morrison has duly been seeking to recruit former England players who retired prematurely (he approached both Harry Ellis and Tom Rees without any joy) and is cautiously optimistic \u2013 \"I'm convinced we will eventually pick up the odd gem\" \u2013 about the RFU's new Pro El initiative which delivers a two-day elementary refereeing course to Premiership academy players. Six members of Harlequins academy were trying out their new-found skills at Cranleigh school in Surrey on Friday and the scheme is due to be extended nationwide.</p> <p>Good luck to them. As Morrison concedes, refereeing will always demand a certain type of character. \"There are not many people who want to put their neck in a noose every Saturday and get chastised by thousands of people at the same time.\" Jackson may just be that singular man. \"It's a dream come true to play my last rugby game at the best rugby field in the world and then come back for my first Test as a referee two and a half years later. I feel extremely lucky to have an opportunity I never thought would be possible. I'm very excited.\" Any England player tempted to question the referee next weekend should think long and hard before he does so.</p>",

  "<p>Nigel Davies, Gloucester's director of rugby, believes that his No8 Ben Morgan is still in contention to start for England against Fiji at Twickenham next week despite being one of nine players released back to their clubs from the national squad this week.</p> <p>Morgan will pack down for Gloucester at Harlequins on Saturday evening in a match that will see the winners sit at the top of the Premiership with Saracens not playing until Sunday, when they take on Wasps on their return to Vicarage Road. He started five successive games for England this year before losing the place for the third Test against South Africa to Thomas Waldrom through injury, and Leicester's No8 was not among those released this week.</p> <p>\"It has been good to have Ben back for what is a big match for us,\" said Davies. \"He knows he needs to play well to get back into the England side and that is good from our point of view because everyone will be looking for a reaction from him. Harlequins will be a great opportunity for him, not just because they are the champions but because Nick Easter is one of the form No8s in the Premiership. It will be a really big challenge for Ben.\"</p> <p>Gloucester are unbeaten in six Premiership matches after losing their opener at home to Northampton. Last weekend's victory over Leicester took them to third in the table, a contrast to last season when a collapse in the final months saw them slump to eighth and miss out on the Heineken Cup.</p> <p>\"We have made a good start but things can change quickly in the Premiership,\" said Davies. \"We have spoken as a group this week about how things can be quickly taken away from you. We have got to get our heads down and do what we need to. I am not interested in making predictions about where we will finish at the end of the season: it is about building a platform.\"</p> <p>Leicester went into the weekend outside the top four and with six of their players away with England. They face Northampton on Saturday in the East Midlands derby at Welford Road with their director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, adamant that the club's policy of producing players for England is the right one.</p> <p>\"It does punish us at a time like this and it is pity that a big fixture like Northampton falls now when both sides are short of players, but we want to attract people who have ambitions to play for England,\" said Cockerill. \"If they have the ability, drive and grit the people here will turn them into internationals. It is a harsh environment at Leicester and you have to be good to be in it.</p> <p>\"Northampton is always a big game and is has tended to be feisty in the last three or four years. Bragging rights are important for both sets of supporters and this weekend is a chance for players here who feel they merit a run of games.

What we're looking at here is a London with hardly any children, populated by high earning couples living side by side with doss houses (or houses of multiple occupation, as I believe the polite description is) stuffed full of transient workers, while towns like Hastings and Margate face a massive influx of children without sufficient school places to fit them all in.

I think the trouble is that, 1: we think that everything in the natural world works in the same way the we do; 2: that we can ignore things until the last minute because if it doesn't happen we don't need to spend any money on it; 3: that we can dick about with nature without there being any consequences; and 4: that we know everything about how nature works simply because we are human and can operate bunsen burners thanks to our opposable thumbs and vastly superior intellect. All of which is, of course, bollocks. What is more likely to be true is that until everyone working in horticulture and land management (including conservation as well as commercial) understands all the interactions within and between ecosystems we can't say we understand what we are really doing and should apply the precautionary princpile to everything we do.

  "<h2>THE FIRST TEMPTATION OF ROBERTO</h2> <p>So last season, just after Manchester City lost to Arsenal to extend a stumble that saw them turn a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League into an eight-point deficit, Roberto Mancini figured it was time for some serious talking. Quite right too. Mario Balotelli, for one, needed to be persuaded to concentrate more on football and less on chasing opponents around pitches to boot them up in the air in a manner not dissimilar to berserker pigeon-botherers in Trafalgar Square, except with no cider and a good deal less fist-waving at bendy red buses. Also, someone had to keep checking Carlos Tevez hadn't got his head lodged in his gaping orifice again, and continue blowing smoke up James Milner's, and waking up Adam Johnson in the middle of the night just to say \"oh sorry, wrong number\". Also, we now learn, the manager had to have another chat about getting the hell out of Manchester.</p> <p>As revealed on Thursday exclusively by plucky news peddler Big Paper \u2013 cash-strapped but ever-resourceful, at least for another while \u2013 Mancini last April resumed talks initiated previously with the Russian billionaire owner of AS Monaco, with items on the agenda including (b) Mancini leading the club back into the French top-flight and (a) Mancini being paid the entire global reserves of gold and Jacuzzis.</p> <p>\"Last season I was very close to seven, eight teams,\" confirmed Mancini on Friday, seeing no reason to deny exploring other cash cows at a time when he appeared to be making a dog's dinner of City. As it turned out, neighbouring donkeys Manchester United did a Devon Loch to gift the Premier League to City, meaning the club's owners decided to offer him a new contract themselves, and Mancini was shrewd enough to sign it before he bungled another Big Cup campaign.</p> <p>\"I prefer to stay here because I work well here the first three years,\" beamed the manager who is on course to guide City to successive bottom-place finishes in Big Cup groups. \"If someone thinks we didn't do a good job \u2013 we won three trophies in two years and I'm very happy, we work well,\" continued the 2012 Charity Shield champion.</p> <p>Now Mancini insists his focus is solely on City, with various factors making him feel more comfortable: not, presumably, the purchases of Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair, but the purge of former top banana and prize cabbage Garry Cook, the relocation of Brian Marwood to somewhere out of Mancini's sight, and the recruitment of fancy-dan foreign mandarins such as Ferran Soriano and the new director of football, Txiki Begiristain.</p> <p>\"Now I think the next three or four years will be very important for us,\" crooned Mancini. \"I think that now with Ferran and Begiristain we can work very well \u2013 we can improve our team \u2026 I sign a contract for the next five years because I believe in this squad, because I can work with serious people like the owner and the chairman, really serious people, and to work with these people is fantastic \u2013 it's difficult to find people that work well with the manager and for me it's a fantastic situation. And now I think we have time to improve and build a stronger team.\" Or, at least, more Jacuzzis.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398765178\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351864719948/David-Beckham-008.jpg\" alt=\"David Beckham\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beckham Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Soccer player David Beckham (L) and actor Russell Brand (3rd L) pose for a photo with unidentified fans during the NBA basketball game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks in Los Angeles\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/gallery/gimages/america-has-no-idea-who-robbie-keane-is.jpg\" title=\"\">caption supplied by Reuters for the above photo.

Fighters from the Salafi Dawood brigade overran the camp and captured the soldiers. Initially there were only ten of them so they could not take the soldiers captive, and had to kill them immediately. No trial could be held because the fighting was still going on. This is guerrilla warfare.</p> <p>The soldiers there included snipers who had shot four fighters from the Dawood brigade. </p> <p>The Dawood brigade and the Suqur Al-Sham organisation do not answer to any military council affiliated to the FSA. They work independently and have their own leader whom they call Ameer and his name is Abu Issa.</p> <p>Yesterday we had a demonstration in Jebal al-Zawiyia and we raised banners in response to Hillary Clinton's statement that Assad's end is imminent. We said: \"al-Qaida arrival\u2019s in Syria is imminent too.\"</p> <p>We do not wish to turn Syria into another Afghanistan, but we can't stop these extremists groups. We are really worried about the future of Syria. We need weapons and media support, but there is nothing on the ground.</p> <p>We have four Salafi groups who are fighting in Idlib province. The biggest group is Jabhat al-Nusra which has members all over Syria. There is also the Ansar al-Islam group, the Majless al-Shura group and Suqur al-Sham group.</p> <p>These Salafi groups are gaining support in Idlib province as they are well equipped unlike the FSA brigades. People also admire their bravery.</p> <p>They are tough fighters and when they get hold of soldiers, they kill them at once.</p> <p>They are getting more powerful and in in the future could start forcing people to follow sharia law. It is a big problem.</p> <p>They are so strict about new recruits. If someone smokes or does not pray that much, he is not accepted. They only accept hardliners and we have few Syrians hardliners here. All the suicide fighters come from outside of Syria. Most of the suicide fighters are Saudis.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=200547086913577029119.0004cd806677ade01716d&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;ll=35.876533,36.76403&amp;amp;spn=0.097366,0.145912&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;output=embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;View &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=200547086913577029119.0004cd806677ade01716d&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;ll=35.876533,36.76403&amp;amp;spn=0.097366,0.145912&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;source=embed&quot; style=&quot;color:#0000FF;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Saraqeb&lt;/a&gt; in a larger map&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093d33895cb1506d2444752\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T14:05:44.887Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia condemns Clinton's Syrian opposition plans</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Russia has expressed its alarm about US-backed plans to create a Syrian \"government in exile\".</p> <p>Foreign ministry spokesman <a href=\"http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/newsline/393BD239CFF3687C44257AAA0042C7E9\">Alexander&#xa0;Lukashevich claimed the plans flout an agreement reached in Geneva,</a> brokered in June by former international envoy Kofi Annan.</p> <p>It called for democratic change in Syria \"in accordance with the aspirations of the Syrian people\".</p> <p>He accused the US of trying to settle the Syrian crisis on its own terms.</p> <p>Lukashevich urged the Syrian opposition to enter dialogue with the Assad government.</p> <p>Russia's deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov echoed the same points on his Twitter account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264268987515424768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Syrian opposition's Western sponsors violate Geneva agreements when trying to impose from outside a list of future leadership of the country</p>&mdash; Gennady Gatilov (@GGatilov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264268987515424768\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-02T07:33:31+00:00\">November 2, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264269168470265856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Geneva Communiqu\u00e9 says: \"...transitional governing body ... shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent\".</p>&mdash; Gennady Gatilov (@GGatilov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264269168470265856\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-02T07:34:14+00:00\">November 2, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:15:41.647Z\">at 3.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093cce7b579f74bac764959\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T13:38:47.376Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNC leader dismissive of Clinton plan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The leader of the beleaguered Syrian National Council has accused Hillary Clinton of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zaidbenjamin/statuses/264338402265137152\">ignoring the complexity of the Syrian</a> crisis after she backed a rival opposition council.</p> <p>In an interview the journalist Zaid Benjamin Abdel Basset Sayda insisted that the SNC represented the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zaidbenjamin/statuses/264339356846796800\">\"voice of the revolution\"</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday the US secretary of state confirmed US backing for new a new broad-based opposition council \u2013 the Syrian National Initiative [SNI].</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-live/2012/nov/01/syria-conflict-clinton-opposition-overhaul-live#block-509233f395cb39eabe475ee3\">She said</a>: \"We have recommended names and organisations that we believe should be included in any leadership structure.

This time, Seattle don't have the home advantage that turned out to be not much advantage anyway.</p> <p>Speaking of home advantage, it was one of the very minor issues at stake when <strong>DC United</strong> and <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> made the decision to switch their semi-final venues in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The Red Bull Arena is in a low-lying part of Jersey that has been badly affected by the damage to the state's infrastructure and there is no guarantee that we'll have play there on the rescheduled Wednesday date.</p> <p>A special shout-out, then, to our New York previewers for the semi-finals \u2013 Dan Ryazansky of Metrofanatic and Dan Dickinson of Gothamist, who have been dealing with intermittent power, flooding and God knows what else this week, but still found time to set us up with their takes on the semi-finals. On the other coast, a big shout-out too to our LA contingent, for surfing off pure adrenalin from their game on Thursday night, in order to get us their semi-final previews after a big night at the Home Depot Center. Houston's crew did the same \u2013 deliriously \u2013 on Wednesday. In fact, as usual all of our fan reps, bloggers, podcasters and beat writers have been generous with their time in covering their teams, and we at the Guardian salute them. See you tonight for the next installment \u2013 <strong>Seattle Sounders v Real Salt Lake. We'll be live around 9.30pm</strong>.</p> <p><em>All semi-finals are played over two legs.

After 2011's high-powered offense and a trade to make it better the Sounders scored fewer goals in 2012. There was the long winless run in the regular season after an extraordinary start. Later there would be the loss of the US Open Cup. Finally, with a strong chance at second in the West and third overall the Sounders were shutout by the LA Galaxy. That's a lot of pent up could-have and should-have-beens.</p> <p>If there's something that's awesome about the fact that MLS has playoffs, it's that the short run to end to the season offers a small correction for the unbalanced schedule and a final chance for a club to make its claim for greatness. Seattle has that chance now. Fans are hyped, without expectations. Three straight years of playoff failure weigh heavily on the souls of the Rave Green. It is a weight that could be lifted quickly with a resounding victory on Friday night, or at least removed with a run in the second season.</p> <p>Now is the time for the Sounders to seize the initiative \u2013 to be Sounders. They will only go as far as they can impose their own will.</p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>What a difference a game makes. Prior to the final match of the regular season, everybody seemed excited about what was to come. Finally a healthy starting XI, and a win over the Galaxy would've meant the third-most points and a very good chance at hosting the MLS Cup, should the Sounders be able to get through the Western Conference. But they had to play the match. Much like last year's meaningless match against Chivas USA, when Mauro Rosales went down with an injury, down went Eddie Johnson before the end of the first half in the same stadium against the other team from Carson, CA. Our leading scorer with a hamstring injury, right before the playoffs, not to mention the fact that the Carson Galaxy ended up scoring in the 83rd-minute to drop the Sounders down four places to the No7 overall seeding, thus eliminating any chance of a packed CLink in an MLS Cup unless Houston some how comes out of the Eastern Conference and the Sounders meet what is surely their expectations \u2013 winning the Western Conference. </p> <p>I say that because there are no alternatives at this point. Anything less would mean a season that yielded disappointing results with the talent that we have. From the get go, top down, our ownership and management has made it a priority to compete at the top level in <em>all</em> competitions. The only way the Sounders can continue to meet any part of that expectation is with a trip to the final, as the US Open Cup and Supporters Shield are no longer options. They face a very tough test in Real Salt Lake, a team that matches up very evenly and well with the Sounders. The part that is so frustrating at this point as a fan is knowing that anything can happen. The Sounders are more than capable of winning this series with the Lakers, with or without Eddie Johnson. After that? Not so much. I wouldn't be a supporter if I didn't genuinely believe they can do it. Seattle 2-1 in the home leg, 1-1 in the away leg is my prediction.</p> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslperspective.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a>:</p> <p>So Real Salt Lake heads into the playoffs with what one would have to call a mixed bag of recent results \u2013 the upside is just a single loss in their last 10 overall matches (including eight league matches). The downside is three straight 0-0 draws, including the 0-0 draw at home against CS Herediano that put them out of the Champions League. So while RSL can celebrate the fact that they have given up just three goals in the last two months, they also have to deal with the fact they have scored just two in their last four matches.</p> <p>I like to be the \"glass is half full\" guy when it comes to RSL: the reality is that RSL haven't given up a goal to Seattle in their three regular-season matches this year and RSL is building on playoff experience that has seen them play in three conference finals in the last four years. I won't focus on anything but what RSL has shown this year \u2013 team highs in wins, points and road wins \u2013 when I say that RSL will not only win the series but I think they will pick up a win on the road in the opener at Seattle, 2-1.</p> <p><strong>Matt Montgomery</strong>, <a href=\"http://underthecrossbar.com/\">Under the Crossbar</a>, Real Salt Lake:</p> <p>If you were to write a memoir on Real Salt Lake's 2012 campaign, three or four of the chapters would deal with niggling injuries that kept players out for a few weeks. The back-and-forth, swaying nature of the lineups has been a point of frustration for fans. Going into the playoffs, that's still the case, though there is a sense that it could finally lift as RSL enters the final stage of the campaign.</p> <p>That frustration is perhaps helped along by a sense that, in part because of the Concacaf Champions League exit, chunks of RSL's core squad will start breaking away and a run in the playoffs could well be the last great chance to win a second trophy and make a mark on MLS. If it is to be the last great chance, the uphill battle of the playoffs seems more daunting than usual, with San Jose and LA both presenting clear barriers to an MLS Cup final.</p> <p>There is an air of inevitability about it, though: it was through some rather steep challenges that, in 2009, Real Salt Lake won their first (and only) trophy. But with the promise of 2009 turned into reality by 2012, the lack of further success on the big stage with this group has fans ready for another big win.</p> <p>Prediction: RSL 3-2 over Seattle in a drama-packed rehash of 2011</p> <h2>DC United v New York Red Bulls, Saturday 8pm (NBCSN)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398764267\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346333005640/6dbb1f52-df9b-4bab-9587-dc38df5d3d6c-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Dwayne de Rosario 100 goals DC United New York Red Bulls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dwayne De Rosario, here scoring for DC United against the New York Red Bulls in August, will miss the Conference semi-final between the two teams.

This young team has adopted a slightly more conservative approach since the loss of its captain, emphasizing work rate and defensive posture over flashiness. Its worked like a charm and Ben Olsen is suddenly a dark horse for coach of the year. </p> <p>And yet despite finishing with the third-highest points total in all of MLS and far better recent results, United won't be the favorite heading into its playoff series against the New York Red Bulls. Some will look at the scoring prowess of New York's Thierry Henry, Tim Cahill, Kenny Cooper and Sebastien Le Toux and wrongfully assume that DC doesn't stand a chance. Smarter observers will instead take note of the improved defensive play of Dejan Jakovic and Brandon McDonald and the sudden emergence of Bill Hamid as an elite goalkeeper and see this as a fairly even matchup. But I'll always take the team with four stars on its shirt over the team with no trophies in 17 years of existence.</p> <p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p> <p>United, while not exactly on fire, have come out of the season getting the results they needed. Since the beginning of September, they've lost only once and have rescued a win and tie in the last two games despite falling behind early. Also, in the last nine games United has only given up more than one goal on two occasions, as the defense and Bill Hamid have taken care of their own end. The concern, of course, is over whether United can score \u2013 the cost of the disciplined defense is productivity on the offensive end \u2013 though history has shown that the playoffs lean to defensively disciplined teams, and United has been playing with that playoff mentality since Dwayne DeRosario was lost to injury. The strength of the team in this time hasn't been any one or two individual players but the team as a whole, with different players stepping up to the challenges every week. </p> <p>Due to Hurricane/Frankenstorm Sandy, the game order has been switched to United hosting the first game and NY hosting the second midweek. In reality, this change doesn't have a great effect, especially when considering the short distances and familiarity between the teams. In the two-game total goals series, it's important to get ahead in the first game, regardless of the venue. Prediction: United to win the first game in DC and tie the second in New Jersey.</p> <p><strong>Dan Ryazansky</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://www.metrofanatic.com\">Metrofanatic</a>, New York:</p> <p>When New York entered the last game of the regular season, they knew that homefield advantage was not an option. They could finish as high as third, meaning that playing the second leg at home was impossible (even though the actual value of such \"advantage\" can be debated). And yet they got a \"gift\" from Hurricane Sandy, leading to the reversal of the two legs and DC hosting the opener.</p> <p>It looks like \"Clever\" Hans Backe has finally settled on a lineup, which means Heath Pearce (finally!) on the left, Rafa Marquez (surprisingly adequate in his last two matches) in central defense, Teemu Tainio in defensive midfield and Dax McCarty on the flank \u2013 clearly not his best position but, ever the trooper, he always finds a way to contribute. Titi Henry and Kenny Cooper were up to their old tricks again, combining for three goals in taking care of Philly. At the end this team will go as far as Titi will take them... as long as the patchwork defense holds.</p> <p><strong>Dan Dickinson</strong>, sports editor, <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com\">Gothamist</a>, New York:</p> <p>It's been a strange final stretch for New York. In their last six they managed two landslide wins (over non-playoff Toronto and Philadelphia), two home losses (thrashings delivered by Kansas City and Chicago to blemish an otherwise spotless home record), and two draws (nearly grasping three points at New England before falling apart at the death, then a dominant draw against Kansas City). It's been an inconsistent year, and the final weeks were no exception to that \u2013 but the mixture of tough and weak opponents means that this was a good final opportunity to shake out whatever final issues were there before entering the playoffs.</p> <p>Avoiding the play-in game means NY gets to renew their rivalry with DC \u2013 they've met three times in the playoffs but NY has never made it past them. DC has been no slouch in the final stretch but it's almost entirely been against non-playoff sides. Consider everything NY has gotten through in that last month \u2013 tough competition, the death of a youth coach, Erik Soler's firing, insinuation that Hans Backe is a lame duck, injuries to Lloyd Sam and Brandon Barklage and now a hurricane that has forced their games to be rearranged. And yet with all of that going on, they slowly honed their performances and look like they might be peaking. I think they can easily grind out the series over DC \u2013 but expect United's faithful to demand asterisks be placed next to any victory NY achieves, given their sacrifice of the home-field advantage.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo v Sporting Kansas City, Sunday 3.30pm (NBC)</h2> <p><strong>Eastern semi-final</strong> </p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>At some point I'm going to finally to remember that \"In Dom We Trust\" means \"In Dom We Trust\"\u2026 all the time. Once again, the Dynamo have gone through a season struggling to win on the road, only to become an MLS version of the Road Warrior when the playoffs start. Admittedly, Wednesday night's victory had as much to do with what Chicago didn't do as what Houston did, but all that really matters is that Kinnear set up his team to play a style of game, they executed the plan and the Fire walked into the trap.</p> <p>It's impossible not to be stupidly optimistic about a series against Sporting KC. Yes they are a great team, yes they are the top seed, but Houston has stood toe to toe with them this season and they did roll into LSP last season and beat them for the conference title. Basically, these two teams are familiar with each other and know what to expect. So what could make the difference? Ricardo Clark and Adam Moffat. Our naranja wrecking crew midfield is going to be counted on to disrupt, annoy and hopefully shut down KC's dynamic attack. The uglier the next 180 minutes of soccer are, the better for the Dynamo. The first game will be key. Houston is unbeatable at home, so a solid result on Sunday could put serious pressure on KC and that would be a good thing.</p> <p><strong>Mike Porter</strong>, <a href=\"http://texianarmy.org/\">Texian Army</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Great road performance by the Dynamo! Solid passing and posession throughout the entire match. Will Bruin took advantage of defensive mistakes and that's all she wrote. Tally Hall stepped up and commanded the box when he needed to and came up with saves to secure the win. On to Sporting KC: Graham Zusi basically plays a similiar game to Davis and I wouldn't be surprised if he finds the woodwork with some of his crosses. I believe Kei Kamara will squander a couple chances to score as he seems to lack the ability to finish plays on his own.</p> <p>I predicted a 2-1 road win in Chicago and it came true... so I expect to see a hard fought 3-1 home victory in person on Sunday. Second-half heroics from Brian Ching... we will see... more goals from Bruin, probably.</p> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Sporting KC is ready to win the MLS Cup, looking strong coming into the playoffs. Facing the Houston Dynamo in the Eastern Conference semifinals is the best scenario. SKC was devastated by the loss to the Dynamo in last year's playoffs. The team crumbled at home, and there was a shakeup in the locker room with then DP Omar Bravo upset over his belief that he played too few minutes in the match. This season is different. Not only does Sporting have a better locker-room atmosphere, the team has matured into the best defense in the League. It has been after the cup since the start of the season, and revenge against the Dynamo will fuel that drive.</p> <p>The defense led by goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen and defender Matt Besler will continue to hold it down in the back, and the very motivated goalscorers, Kei Kamara and CJ Sapong, will hold it down up top. Paolo Nagamura will be out for the next match or two, but there is a possibility that Roger Espinoza will feel ready to return. Jacob Peterson has found his rhythm, which will help fill any voids created by the absence of any of the regular starters. And with Zusi directing set pieces, the midfield is in very good shape.</p> <p>My prediction: Sporting KC will advance to the Eastern Conference Championship with a decisive win at home against the Dynamo; SKC will then face New York Red Bulls, shutting down Henry and his boys; and SKC will face and defeat the San Jose Earthquakes for the MLS Cup.</p> <p><strong>Mike Kuhn</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://www.downthebyline.com/\">Down the Byline</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Sporting KC heads into the playoffs on a season-high 12-game unbeaten run, by the time they take the field against the Houston Dynamo on Sunday it will have been almost 100 days since they lost a competitive match. But to make it to 100 days, they'll have to get by a team that has been a bogey ever since they came into the league. The Dynamo have controlled the series against Sporting throughout their history, especially in Houston where KC hasn't won since their very first game there. </p> <p>The 0-1-2 record this year doesn't speak well for the matchup for KC, but they do have the revenge factor on their minds. Dominic Kinnear has had Peter Vermes' number and took him to coaching school in the Eastern Conference finals last year, when the Dynamo played KC off the park. Part of me believes that they wanted this matchup, that they wanted to take it to the team that knocked them out of the playoffs last year. Well, they would get that wish. This series isn't going to be a pretty one \u2013 it's going to be a tough, physical affair. SKC is going to have to rely on their defense and their strong defending against set pieces to see them through on the road and then take care of business at home. In Houston I'm not sure KC takes care of business, but the series as a whole I think KC finds a way past the Dynamo and through to the East finals.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs San Jose Earthquakes, Sunday 9pm (ESPN)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398764268\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351832543128/99886ed7-5e73-49a3-a220-f0cf7b329024-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Omar Gonzalez LA Galaxy Los Angeles Galaxy Vancouver Whitecaps\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los Angeles Galaxy's Omar Gonzalez, left, and Vancouver Whitecaps' Barry Robson contest a header during the first half of their MLS soccer wild-card game in Carson, California.

Hong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><strong>Western Conference semi-final</strong></p> <p><strong>Josie Becker</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://www.lagconfidential.com\">LAG Confidential</a>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>The LA Galaxy played better against Vancouver on Thursday night then they did the last time they faced them, getting balls in amongst the bunkered in defense. It took a second-half substitution to give the Galaxy enough manpower to overcome that wall and breach the Vancouver goal, but it was a goal that was coming as LA practiced siege warfare for almost the entire match. Almost 70% of the possession belonged to the Galaxy \u2013 and it was more than 70% in the first half. </p> <p>It's likely the Galaxy will get the lion's share of possession against San Jose as well, except the Quakes don't give you possession because they want to recreate the Seige of Harfleur, the way Vancouver does. San Jose plays a solid offense \u2013 it's always moving. They aren't interested in keeping possession, they want to push it and take shots as soon as possible. It's tough to stop and few teams have this year, and with the Galaxy in various states of fitness that's going to be a concern. </p> <p>Still, expect a firecracker of a series. </p> <p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p> <p>If you were going to write a script for the perfect Vancouver start, it would have been to score in the opening minutes, taking advantage of an inexperienced right-back (Hector Jimenez) and then park the bus, getting all 11 men behind the ball for the next 87 minutes. Your tactic would be to frustrate your opponent. To make them think there was no way they could break down the two perfect rows of four defenders. To make them think there was no way through to the goal and that they were going to walk out of the Home Depot Center on the wrong end of an improbable upset. </p> <p>All went according to plan until Mike Magee, \"Mr Playoff,\" took a cross from Juninho in the 69th minute and volleyed home a 12-yard strike that brought the game level. The fact that Landon Donovan earned a penalty kick four minutes later, and gave LA the lead for the first time, was almost inconsequential. Once the possession and the effort paid off for the Galaxy, there was no stopping them. </p> <p>After the game, players were quoted as saying they had needed to get past this match because they \"wanted\" another shot at the Supporters' Shield winners. They wanted to rectify a 0-2-1 record against San Jose. They wanted a showdown between two teams that don't like each other. They wanted to settle it on the field. </p> <p>If I am San Jose, the last team I want to play is LA. They are hungry to defend their title and show the upstart Earthquakes where they belong. </p> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Going into the playoffs, there are many metrics by which to judge the San Jose Earthquakes' 2012 season: a Supporters' Shield-winning 66 points; Chris Wondolowski lacing up his golden boots for a career-, club- and MLS-record-tying goal tally of 27; an offensive powerhouse christened the \"Bash Brothers\" with a franchise-record 72 goals. Although many criteria for success have been met, the last and most significant task is now at hand: winning the MLS Cup. All these honors count for nothing on Sunday when the MLS Cup western bracket begins in Los Angeles. David Beckham will have to overcome his small-stadium syndrome and play for the first time at Buck Shaw next Wednesday. Of the Quakes starters, only recent arrival Mehdi Ballouchy is sidelined for the duration, so Frank Yallop has an almost full roster from which to make his selections. </p> <p>Quakes fans are optimistic that the club can go all the way to the final, and yet realistic that anything can happen in a playoff format. The unbeaten streak at Buck Shaw has invigorated the fans \u2013 manifested in standing ovations at each substitution, the beautifully assembled and inventive tifos by the 1906 Ultras and lively criticism of the fourth official as he fumbles with the electronic display for Goonie-Time at the end of each half. The hard work and never-say-die dedication of the players has spilled over into the stands and the fans have rediscovered their voice \u2013 it's louder than ever as they relish the opportunity to support the 2012 Earthquakes in their attempt to reclaim the MLS Cup. The synergy of the San Jose Earthquakes and their fans should ensure the win within the friendly confines of Buck Shaw. </p> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.centerlinesoccer.com \"\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>The Supporters' Shield-winning San Jose Earthquakes are not taking for granted their need to figure out the problem with their defense. Recently, they have looked for their offense, with Chris Wondolowski, Alan Gordon and Steven Lenhart, to outscore all their previous opponents. This has led them to draw three out of four of their last matches. </p> <p>Now that the playoffs are here, Gordon stated: \"There is less forgiveness for errors. You got to tighten things up and you can't make mistakes. When you make mistakes, you're going to get punished. We have to be tuned in as a team and that's what has got us here.\" </p> <p>Defender Jason Hernandez echoed him, saying: \"Each play gets magnified. One mistake or one slip up can make the difference. It will be really important for us to focus on the details and become as close to perfect as possible in the way we play.\" </p> <p>But to look at their last games, it is also important to remember what coach Yallop states: \"Alan hasn't played. Simon [Dawkins] hasn't been fit. Both are key guys. We expect both to be fit for the weekend but you never know. For us, it's about what we've done consistently all year. Usually, if we've lost a game we won't lose two in a row. We haven't done it this year. If we lose one game, we come back and get either a tie or a win. Playoffs are a little different because there are two games, but we find a way to pick our game up and drive on. I don't see any difference with this group. Sunday and Wednesday is tough but I'd expect our players to raise our game.\"</p> <p>What is nice is to remember is the \"Goonies Never Say Die\" attitude \u2013 the Quakes have scored 40 goals after the 60th minute and most have been during stoppage time. The Quakes will have four sets of stoppage time per match up (with playing home and away), so I look to that as being a huge plus. Also, in the regular season the Quakes swept Seattle and Real Salt Lake and didn't lose to LA, so these are teams they know how to beat. I think that the Quakes will come out swinging and stay on top.</p>",
  "<p>Gone are the days when sustainability in business was about environmental compliance or turning up once a year for a community outreach project.

A four-part conspiracy thriller (\"inspired\", the credits thunder, \"by the novel A Very British Coup by Chris Mullin\"), it arrives amid considerable hoopla. Its lavish trailer depicts a downtrodden Byrne gliding glumly through a deserted SW1A in which the blackened remains of a chemical refinery loom over the Houses of Parliament: corruption and politics and slightly wonky CGI chimneys entwined in a spluttering enormoblur of apocalyptic unpleasantness. Here, honks Channel 4, is a Big Drama with a Big Message: a modern thriller with the brass neck and trousers to address hot-potato global skulduggery while harking back to such brooding, labyrinthine classics as Edge Of Darkness, State Of Play and, indeed, A Very British Coup. \"Britain is buggered,\" it bellows from a darkened doorway, \"so let's crack open the all-butter Viennese biscuit assortment and watch Gabriel Byrne do Big Acting in a M&amp;S wool-blend car coat.\"</p> <p>The plot, then: a blast at the American-owned Petrofex chemical plant has left 19 people dead and the residents of Scarrow, Teeside, in high dudgeon. \"A tragedy like this can act to bring us together,\" emotes a craggily concerned Dawkins to a bank of flashing cameras as rhubarbing salt-of-the-earth types in anoraks say things like \"your word means nothing!\" and \"oi\". While national and governmental disquiet grows, rumours of an international cover-up rumble. Then something Really Bad happens to the prime minister, and Dawkins \u2013 the sole glimmer of morality in this bastards' soup \u2013 finds himself in the thick of a corruption-shaped, petrochemical-scented brouhaha.</p> <p>It takes approximately six minutes to realise you could reverse an oil tanker into the gulf between what Secret State thinks it is (important, good) and what it actually is (cobblers with exploding CGI bells on). It's difficult to convey just how splutteringly ludicrous the whole thing is. There is a phalanx of steeple-fingered, baddie-eyed American executives, a pair of monumentally irritating counter-intelligence flunkies and a ball-flattening home secretary with a penchant for bursting into the gents and snarling \"fuck the polls\" as startled frontbenchers attempt to wee. It's a Jacuzzi of obviousness. A journalist in a raincoat (Gina McKee) pops up every so often to deliver a plot development via whispered aside or cryptic text message (\"WHOSE PLANE?\"), then buggers off again. At one point, someone says \"a military background like yours comes in handy at times like this, I suppose\" and we duck for cover as another slab of exposition crashes from the rafters and lands on credulity's skull.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the middle of the woe, there is Gabriel Byrne, peering perpetually into the middle distance with the pained absentmindedness of a man with an undiagnosed urinary tract infection. As is the modern TV thriller way, Secret State refuses to let us breathe. It's all bang this and boom that. Pounding, panicky drums and Meaningful Glances are crammed into every frame, like a herd of bison into a broom cupboard. Everything is spelled out in 3,500pt Hope You're Getting All This At The Back font. At first you may find yourself pining for the silences and the realism of the 80s conspiracy dramas Secret State is so keen to emulate, along with the skull-fizzing thrill of a plot so ferociously complex you need a compass, crampons and slab of Kendal mint cake to make it past the title sequence. But then you watch Charles Dance snarling like a dog as he twiddles his cufflinks outside No 10 and remember the intense joy of unfettered TV stupidity. Secret State is Spooks with its head in a bucket of dumb. It's Tinker Tailor Soldier Sigh. Brains and depth are all very well and good but sometimes you just want something (<em>voice rises, eyebrows scrunch</em>) \u2026 WITH BALLS.</p>",
  "<p>The floods and fires that swept through our city left a path of destruction that will require years of recovery and rebuilding work. And in the short term, our subway system remains partially shut down, and many city residents and businesses still have no power. In just 14 months, two hurricanes have forced us to evacuate neighborhoods - something our city government had never done before. If this is a trend, it is simply not sustainable.</p> <p>Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be - given this week's devastation - should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.</p> <p>Here in New York, our comprehensive sustainability plan - PlaNYC - has helped allow us to cut our carbon footprint by 16 percent in just five years, which is the equivalent of eliminating the carbon footprint of a city twice the size of Seattle. Through the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group - a partnership among many of the world's largest cities - local governments are taking action where national governments are not.</p> <p><strong>Leadership needed</strong></p> <p>But we can't do it alone. We need leadership from the White House - and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. His administration also has adopted tighter controls on mercury emissions, which will help to close the dirtiest coal power plants (an effort I have supported through my philanthropy), which are estimated to kill 13,000 Americans a year.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, too, has a history of tackling climate change. As governor of Massachusetts, he signed on to a regional cap- and-trade plan designed to reduce carbon emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels. \"The benefits (of that plan) will be long-lasting and enormous - benefits to our health, our economy, our quality of life, our very landscape. These are actions we can and must take now, if we are to have 'no regrets' when we transfer our temporary stewardship of this Earth to the next generation,\" he wrote at the time.</p> <p>He couldn't have been more right. But since then, he has reversed course, abandoning the very cap-and-trade program he once supported. This issue is too important. We need determined leadership at the national level to move the nation and the world forward.</p> <p>I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.</p> <p>If the 1994 or 2003 version of Mitt Romney were running for president, I may well have voted for him because, like so many other independents, I have found the past four years to be, in a word, disappointing.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama ran as a pragmatic problem-solver and consensus-builder. But as president, he devoted little time and effort to developing and sustaining a coalition of centrists, which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction. And rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it.</p> <p><strong>Important victories</strong></p> <p>Nevertheless, the president has achieved some important victories on issues that will help define our future. His Race to the Top education program - much of which was opposed by the teachers' unions, a traditional Democratic Party constituency - has helped drive badly needed reform across the country, giving local districts leverage to strengthen accountability in the classroom and expand charter schools. His health-care law -- for all its flaws -- will provide insurance coverage to people who need it most and save lives.</p> <p>When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties' nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America.</p> <p>One believes a woman's right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of Supreme Court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.</p> <p>One recognizes marriage equality as consistent with America's march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.</p> <p>One sees climate change as an urgent problem that threatens our planet; one does not. I want our president to place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics.</p> <p>Of course, neither candidate has specified what hard decisions he will make to get our economy back on track while also balancing the budget. But in the end, what matters most isn't the shape of any particular proposal; it's the work that must be done to bring members of Congress together to achieve bipartisan solutions.</p> <p>Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress - and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfill the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that's why I will be voting for him.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael R Bloomberg is mayor of New York and founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.</p> <p>\u2022 This article <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/a-vote-for-a-president-to-lead-on-climate-change.html\">first appeared on Bloomberg View 2012</a>.

It\u2019s about changing the way the NHS is received by both the staff and patients, and about the move from people as patients to them as partners.

  "<p>The Uruguayan beach resort Punta del Este isn't the most obvious place for a major conference on sustainable farming. Nicknamed the \"Saint-Tropez of South America\", this is where the region's rich come to play.</p> <p>Away from the yachts and nightclubs, however, some serious discussions are going on.</p> <p>At the centre of these debates is the role of agricultural research. With the world population set to increase by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/feeding-nine-billion-people-2050\" title=\"\">two billion people come 2050</a>, this is more than just arcane laboratory chat. We need to ensure there is food on the plates of the next generation. Higher and more sustainable agricultural productivity tomorrow requires more research today.</p> <p>The stakes are high for individual farmers too, insists Mark Holderness, executive secretary of the <a href=\"http://www.egfar.org/\" title=\"\">Global Forum on Agricultural Research</a> (GFAR). Smallholder producers must be \"equal players\", he says, \"because if they are the last in line to access new innovations or knowledge, then they will inevitably be further marginalised.\"</p> <p>Skilling-up small farmers is only the first step towards a more sustainable approach to global agriculture, Holderness concedes. After skills must come scale. In global agriculture terms, that means integrating smallholder farmers into modern markets.</p> <h2>Learning from Uruguay</h2> <p>The conveners of this week's <a href=\"http://www.egfar.org/gcard-2012\" title=\"\">Global Conference on Agricultural Research for Development</a> didn't choose Uruguay on a whim. Sure, it might not be the most obvious choice. Think South American mega-agriculture and it is cash-crop producers like Argentina and Brazil that spring to mind.</p> <p>Yet the minnow state of Uruguay has proved itself remarkably effective in boosting skills and scale for farmers. Its <a href=\"http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/uruguay/crop-production-index\" title=\"\">crop productivity</a> has climbed a staggering 63% over the last decade. With more than two-thirds of total agricultural production sold as exports, the sector's contribution to the country's coffers is not to be sneezed at. Today, Uruguay is the world's second-largest exporter of wool and fifth-largest marketer of dairy products.</p> <p>One of the <a href=\"http://irri.org/index.php%3Foption=com_k2%26view=item%26id=12250:uruguay-a-small-country-big-in-rice%26lang=en\" title=\"\">big success stories</a> of recent decades is rice. Uruguay's farmers typically generate around eight tonnes of rice per hectare of paddy; that puts them on par with the world's best producers from similar climates, such as California, Australia and Egypt.</p> <p>Much of that success comes down to research co-operation through the value chain, says Gonzalo Zorrilla, the Uruguayan-born director for the <a href=\"http://www.flar.org/\" title=\"\">Latin American Fund for Irrigated Rice</a>: \"Over the last 40 years or so, Uruguay has gone through a slow but continuous process of putting institutional agreements together between farmers, government and industry to support research at a local level.\"</p> <p>Co-ordinating that joint effort is the state-run National Institute for Agricultural Research (<a href=\"http://www.inia.org.uy/\" title=\"\">INIA</a>). Almost unique among its kind in South America, INIA enjoys comparative independence from the government and relatively close links with producers and agribusiness.</p> <p>\"All its research is conducted very closely with farmers themselves,\" stresses Zorrilla. \"So farmer associations are involved in the committees for research at INIA, for example, as are the millers.\"</p> <p>This ensures the outputs are relevant both to local geography and to market demand.</p> <p>INIA is directly responsible for developing the rice varieties used across Uruguay, as well as advising on localised weed management and rotation strategies. INIA's close relationship with millers, meanwhile, ensures that what farmers produce from one year to the next actually conforms to what the market wants to buy.</p> <p>Financing is all-important. In the case of INIA, about half of its funding comes directly from a tax paid by farmers on rice exports. Points out GFAR's Holderness: \"This is important because the research is then accountable to the farmers; that's been missing in staple crops in the past.\"</p> <h2>Every stage of the value chain</h2> <p>Large agribusiness and food companies are part of the research puzzle too. Holderness points to the example of US-based Mars, owner of the Uncle Ben's brand, which is funding research by the International Rice Research Institute into the development of <a href=\"http://www.mars.com/global/about-mars/mars-pia/our-supply-chain/rice.aspx\" title=\"\">more sustainable rice varietals</a> and crop management techniques.</p> <p>In a separate venture, Mars is working with the <a href=\"http://worldwildlife.org/stories/freezing-the-footprint-of-food\" title=\"\">African Orphan Crops consortium</a>, which includes partners such as the WWF and the Beijing Genomics Institute. This cross-sector initiative sets out to map the genomes of two-dozen key food crops in Africa and then pass on the results to plant breeders.</p> <p>\"They [international food companies] are looking very hard at every stage of the value chain \u2026 because it makes good economic sense to sustain your source of supply into the long term,\" says Holdness.</p> <p>For smallholder farmers to genuinely participate in research processes requires at least two key factors to be in place.</p> <p>The first is a willingness to work together. Only through collective action can smallholders hope to get heard. Appropriately, 2012 is designated as the <a href=\"http://social.un.org/coopsyear/\" title=\"\">United Nations International Year of Co-operatives</a>.</p> <p>Peru's Junta Nacional de Caf\u00e9 and the Kenya National Federation of Agricultural Producers feature among the panelists in Punta del Este this week. Both participate in the <a href=\"http://www.esfim.org/\" title=\"\">Empowering Smallholder Farmers in Markets</a> initiative, which partners with farmer groups to generate \"demand-driven action research\" for smallholder farmers in developing countries.</p> <p>The second imperative is one of economic incentive. Funding for agricultural development in the developing world is not the stumbling block it once was; earlier this year, for example, the G8 announced a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/18/g8-africa\" title=\"\">three-year donor finance package</a> of more than $3bn (\u00a31.87bn).</p> <h2>Donors not necessarily the answer</h2> <p>It sounds harsh, but throwing money at small farmers won't increase their level of research participation or market competitiveness. In fact, the exact opposite is more likely to be true, says Andrew Shepherd,&#xa0;a consultant with the Netherlands-based <a href=\"http://www.cta.int/\" title=\"\">Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation</a>.</p> <p>\"It's important to get the private sector involved as much as possible and have them work with farmer groups so as to minimise the involvement of donors,\" he argues.</p> <p>Back in Punta del Este, heads are nodding among Uruguay's rice farmers. Unlike many other rice-producing countries, they receive no government subsidies or state purchase agreements. That keeps them alert to any and every opportunity to employ new technologies and knowledge.</p> <p>\"They only profit if they do business\", points out Zorrilla. That's easily said from a five-star hotel on the beach; making it ring true on the farmsteads of the developing world is what really counts.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A massive storm blows in from the Atlantic, bringing the commercial capital of the western hemisphere to a complete standstill. Ferries stop running, trains are immobilized, and in several boroughs, fires rage out of control. \"New York\", a reporter at the New York Times marvels, is as \"completely isolated from the rest of the world as if Manhattan Island was in the middle of the South Sea.\" Seeing their city utterly paralyzed by an act of nature, officials who tour the blacked-out neighborhoods immediately call for a massive investment in better transportation.</p> <p>The tempest in question was not Hurricane Sandy, but the \"Great White Hurricane\", a blizzard that, in the early days of March 1888, wreaked havoc on the eastern seaboard and brought 22in of snow and 80mph wind gusts to New York City. The storm also brought an end to two decades of dickering about infrastructure: from then on, electrical cables and telegraph cables would be buried, and the elevated trains on the avenues, whose steam engines were extinguished by the gale, would be replaced by a weather-proof underground railroad, on the lines of the one already running in London.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/PpoAqY\">most lasting impact of the Blizzard of '88 was the building of the IRT</a>, the first line in what would become, in the 20th century, the world's most extensive subway system. Never again would the great city of New York allow itself to be paralyzed by a simple act of nature.</p> <p>Now, as the Army Corps of Engineers flies in 250 pumps to drain tunnels filled floor-to-ceiling with water, and service haltingly resumes on 14 of the city's 23 subway lines, New Yorkers are being reminded of how completely they have come to rely on public transport for going about the day-to-day business of their lives. On any given day, 95% of commuters get to Manhattan's central business district not by car, but by foot, bicycle, or buses and trains \u2013 mostly the latter. (Realizing this, and to forestall a carmaggedon of gridlock, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has wisely announced that only vehicles with three or more occupants will be allowed in to Manhattan until Friday night.)</p> <p>Rail transportation is the sine qua non of Manhattan: it keeps the economy of the city, the state, and the entire north-east thrumming. It doesn't take an urban planner to realize that if you shut it down, even for a couple of days, New York City will turn into <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=podunk\">Podunk</a>. After touring scenes of devastation in Queens, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-new-york-city-mta-free-rides-20121031,0,2038243.story\">Governor Andrew Cuomo pledged</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We will rebuild the subway system and we will build it better. That's what New York is all about.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Let's hope he keeps his word. As it stands, New York is pitiably lagging behind other global cities when it comes to expanding, or even maintaining, its subway and commuter rail networks. Even as ridership surpasses 1.6bn trips a year, a record since the postwar boom years, the subway continues to rely on early industrial-age technology.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the metal flanges in Union Square <a href=\"http://bit.ly/SzS0lM\">that snap into place as squealing trains</a> arrive (to compensate for a marked curve in the platforms); the analogue signals that prevent dispatchers from boosting the frequency of trains; and the Depression-era relays that, as one commentator told me, \"look like the switchboard at the Grand Hotel\". For decades, New York's subway was the only one in the world that was <em>actually losing</em> track mileage. Now, happily, tunnel-boring machines are again at work beneath the streets: the 7 line is being extended into the far west side, by all of one stop, and if all goes well, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway will be up and running, maybe, by 2016. (A simple replacement project for an elevated line scrapped in 1942, it should have been completed a half century ago.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, Shanghai \u2013 a city where commuters can ride a 268mph magnetic levitation to the airport \u2013 has taken only 17 years to build itself a metro system that now surpasses New York's as the largest in the world.</p> <p>There's no question that New York's legacy transit system faces huge challenges. Even when there is no storm surge to cope with, pumps have to operate day and night to keep the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hurricane-Sandy-Challenges-Subways-Power-Buildings-176188001.html\">estimated 13-15m gallons of water a day</a> that routinely infiltrate tunnel walls from overwhelming the system. (Fortunately, this may be New York's last serious case of tunnel flooding. On the eve of Hurricane Sandy, the department of homeland security was testing giant inflatable plugs that would swiftly close off tunnels in case of terrorist attacks or future storm surges; <a href=\"http://t.co/KmEEPOiB\">see this video</a>.)</p> <p>In New York, trains still cross the Hudson and East Rivers through tunnels that were dug with pickaxes by Irish, Italian and African-American <a href=\"http://sandhogs147.org/\">\"sandhogs\"</a>, who lost their lives by the dozens in caisson failures and explosions. Yet, there are other metropolises \u2013 among them Paris, London, and Berlin \u2013 that face similar challenges. The difference is, they've managed to improve and expand their vintage metro systems. New York has a lot of catching up to do.</p> <p>In 1968, under then Mayor John Lindsay, the newly-created MTA announced plans that would have expanded the <a href=\"http://secondavenuesagas.com/2008/06/04/the-1960s-subway-expansion-that-never-came-to-be/\">subway network by 20%, including new lines to Queens and the Bronx, and a subway spur to JFK airport</a>. The financial crisis of the 1970s put paid to the plans, and the city is nowhere near achieving what, in any other major city, would have been a routine network expansion.</p> <p>And now, at a time when some politicians are making political hay out of natural disaster, it's well to remember that the chief impediment to truly sustainable transportation for American cities continues to be blinkered partisanship. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is being praised for his handling of the aftermath of the hurricane, but he's also the reason that, when Sandy blew in, New Jersey's only rail link across the Hudson River consisted of two easily flooded, century-old, single-track tunnels. </p> <p>Because the Republican governor was determined to keep a campaign promise not to raise the state's very low gas tax during his campaign, <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/PJU8cl\">he exaggerated the cost of \"Access to the Region's Core\" plan</a>, thus killing a project that would have given his constituents faster and more reliable rail access to the jobs in Lower Manhattan. Not to mention brand new, non-leaky tunnels for all New Yorkers.</p> <p>The Great Blizzard of '88 brought an end to the dark ages of transportation in New York, a period typified by the rotund <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Tweed\">Boss Tweed</a>, whose financial interests in horse-car companies had long kept the city mired in congestion, and stalled any progress on the digging of an underground railway. With any luck, the legacy of Hurricane Sandy \u2013 the Great Blow of '12 \u2013 will be serious and sustained commitment to the only transportation that will keep New York running, day-in, day-out.</p> <p>Namely, the public kind.</p>",
  "<p>Publishers swallowing other publishers is nothing new. In the 1980s, you couldn't move for acquisitions \u2013 Penguin bought<a href=\"http://www.penguincatalogue.co.uk/lo/michaeljoseph/division.html?catalogueId=247\" title=\"\"> Michael Joseph</a> and <a href=\"http://fivedials.com/\" title=\"\">Hamish Hamilton</a>; in the 90s, Random House consumed a raft of august lists \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/about-us/about-us/companies/uk-companies-and-imprints/vintage-publishing/harvill-secker\" title=\"\">Secker &amp; Warburg</a>, Heinemann, Methuen in a fire sale by Reed Elsevier. <a href=\"http://www.tindalstreet.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tindal Street Press</a>, the independent champion of Booker shortlisted authors, was bought by Profile Books only this week. So why is everyone so hot under the collar about \"Random Penguin\" (as it is now known in the trade), announced this week?</p> <p>Because it's a game-changer. Or it's business as usual. It depends on whose side of the fence you are on. The CEOs are selling us the vision of sharing costs in order to \"invest more for their author and reader constituencies and to be more adventurous in trying new models\". Publishers have been criticised for doing neither for too long, so forgive me if I wait to see the results before applauding this promise. Big publishers do not make bad publishers, they tend to manage projects in small teams, working on individual titles, but the consequence of a merger is always a rationalisation of the business \u2013 a way to cut costs (warehouses combined and sold off, staff doubling-ups eliminated, skills pooled). Authors will be watching carefully for any dilution of the very things for which Penguin and Random are known: excellence in copy editing, design and innovative marketing.</p> <p>Will the merger increase the leverage with Amazon? Perhaps. But, global bestsellers are not the preserve of the conglomerates, as Quercus's successful publishing of Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy proved (and before that, Bloomsbury's Harry Potter series). However big you are, you can't publish everything. Since the eruption of <em>50 Shades</em> and Pearson's acquisition this year of self-publishing giant <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/pearson-buys-author-solutions-will-integrate-penguin.html\" title=\"\">Author Solutions</a>, cracks in the model have began to show. Self-publishing turned from ugly cousin to favourite step-son overnight. The positive upshot is that, finally, publishing has turned its attention back towards the author. They can come from anywhere!</p> <p>I expect more talk of consolidation in the coming months as the challenge from Amazon grows, the decline of high street chains becomes too hard to ignore and ebook pricing drops even further (can it?). Agencies will also consolidate and provide a bigger platform for their clients in response to this changing scene. At Curtis Brown we have doubled in size, produced two in-house movies and set up a creative writing school; United Agents acquired AP Watt this month and smaller agencies are looking for safe harbour in the storm. If the new publisher decides it is too big to listen to the author, too powerful to hear new voices and too profit driven to understand risk, the publishing community may well witness another seismic event before long \u2013 the demise of the publisher.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonny Geller is an agent at Curtis Brown</p>",

But <a href=\"http://www.trevornoah.com/\" title=\"\">Trevor Noah</a> is changing people's perceptions of South African humour, and looks to have every chance of becoming a serious global player. His combination of terribly polite, butter-wouldn't-melt stage presence and biting, often brutal gags has already made him a star in his home country, where he's had his own TV shows and plays to packed houses. Yet he's increasingly making a splash in the States and over here: this summer, he made his Edinburgh fringe debut with financial backing from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/eddie-izzard\" title=\"\">Eddie Izzard</a>, and was one of the most talked-about acts at the festival.</p> <h2>Vivek Mahbubani, Hong Kong</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398770631\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351772834342/Vivek-Mahbubani-008.jpg\" alt=\"Vivek Mahbubani\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Long Guan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Long Guan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's going out on a limb, and then there's setting up the TakeOut Comedy Club. The Hong Kong venue believes it was the first full-time comedy club in the entire Asian continent, and it's devoted to nurturing local talent. Probably the finest act they've unearthed so far is web designer and heavy metal drummer-turned-comic <a href=\"http://funnyvivek.com/\" title=\"\">Vivek Mahbubani</a>. You'd struggle to find a better embodiment of the comedy global village than Mahbubani, an Indian comedian who performs in Cantonese and English (though not usually in the same set). His shtick is heavily American-influenced \u2013 with more than a touch of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/jerry-seinfeld\" title=\"\">Jerry Seinfeld</a> \u2013 but it's filtered through the highly unusual perspective of a performer drawing on three different cultural inheritances.</p> <h2>Danilo Gentili, Brazil</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398770632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351772900210/Danilo-Gentili-008.jpg\" alt=\"Danilo Gentili\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Karina Santiago</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karina Santiago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Standup is booming in Brazil, with new comics and clubs emerging all the time across the country. At the vanguard of all this is <a href=\"http://www.danilogentili.com/\" title=\"\">Danilo Gentili</a>, a straight-talker who deals in blunt home truths about the state of Brazilian politics. As the host of Agora \u00e9 Tarde (It's Too Late), he slams the country's leaders and subjects hapless politicos to uncomfortable and inventive questioning. With his stubble, baseball cap and habitual bleary-eyed look, he's like a shabbier version of The Daily Show's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/jon-stewart\" title=\"\">Jon Stewart</a>. His approach isn't always subtle, sometimes abusing the powers that be in terms that would make <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/frankie-boyle\" title=\"\">Frankie Boyle</a> blanch \u2013 as when he suggested the Brazilian president, a former victim of brutal state torture, had brought it upon herself \u2013 but it's won him a considerable domestic following among those who find his uncompromising style a breath of fresh air.</p> <h2>Fahad Albutairi, Saudi Arabia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398770633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351772951626/Fahad-Albutairi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fahad Albutairi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: La Yekthar Show</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: La Yekthar Show</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahad_Albutairi\" title=\"\">Fahad Albutairi</a>, when he tells people he's a Saudi standup, their first reaction is, \"Ha ha \u2026 wait, <em>what</em>?\" But despite his country's chequered reputation when it comes to freedom of expression, he and a few like-minded acts have managed to set up something of a homegrown comedy scene. While Albutairi \u2013 who, with his nerdish manner, would be ideal casting for an Arabic Big Bang Theory \u2013 sometimes performs live, he does most of his best stuff on YouTube under the banner of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7leV0Zc7qI4\" title=\"\">La Yekthar Show</a>. Whether by choice or by necessity, he doesn't deal much with politics or human rights issues, trading instead in more lighthearted observational material.

Frustrated with the limited scope of the stand-up scene in Norway, Simonsen moved to London a few years back and instantly started to make a big impact on the UK circuit. He's made appearances on Russell Howard's Good News, and picked up a much-deserved nomination for Best Newcomer at this summer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/edinburgh-festival-2012\" title=\"\">Edinburgh</a> fringe. His deadpan comedy is rooted in the fact that he's a perpetual outsider, not just as a Norwegian in the UK, but as a natural oddball whose reactions to the world around him are always at right angles to other people's. A properly funny young comic with the potential for mass appeal, Norway's loss is our gain.</p> <h2>Helen Paul, Nigeria</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398770635\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351773067467/Helen-Paul-008.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Paul\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Paul</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's a lot of comic creativity in Nigeria, and mischievous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Paul\" title=\"\">Helen Paul </a>is one of its most unusual and arresting performers. While she spends much of her time presenting glitzy TV shows and talent contests like a sort of Nigerian Holly Willoughby, Paul's real skills emerge when she adopts the guise of Tatafo, an endlessly curious, deeply peculiar child whose innocent observations cut the adult world down to size. Giggling, kissing her teeth and shrilly telling her audience what she thinks about religion, politics and modern society, Paul uses Tatafo as a battering ram of broad comedy that allows her to smuggle in intelligent comment on serious issues. It's an act that makes most sense to her home crowd, but Paul's obvious skills and seemingly innate ability to entertain mean she could certainly find an appreciative international audience.</p> <h2>Anatol Durbala, Moldova</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398770636\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351773129370/Anatol-Durbala-008.jpg\" alt=\"Anatol Durbala\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: www.moldovansmovie.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.moldovansmovie.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we think about Moldova at all, it's probably as one of those tiny impoverished former Iron Curtain countries that we only usually hear about when they're being thrashed by England at football. The big surprise about the movie version of Tony Hawks's <a href=\"http://www.moldovansmovie.com/\" title=\"\">Playing The Moldovans At Tennis</a> was that the stand-out comic performance came not from British veteran Hawks, but courtesy of Moldovan comic Anatol Durbala. Playing surly, neurotic interpreter Iulian, Durbala added extra comic value to every scene in which he appeared, like an eastern European <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/jul/31/kevin-eldon-edinburgh-festival-fringe\" title=\"\">Kevin Eldon</a> or Bill Bailey. Back home in Chisinau, he's properly famous as the star of Ora De Ras (Laugh Hour), a kind of Moldovan Saturday Night Live. Durbala's fiercely proud of his home country, but if there's any justice, the acting chops he displayed in Hawks's film will win him a much bigger profile internationally.</p> <h2>Rahmens, Japan</h2> <p>In Japan, sketch comedy is much bigger than standup, and few acts come much bigger \u2013 in a number of senses \u2013 than double-act <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/channel/HC-LG8jF9HhWs\" title=\"\">Rahmens</a>, a kind of <a href=\"http://www.timanderic.com/\" title=\"\">Tim &amp; Eric</a> for the sushi set. Jin Katagiri (longer, frizzier hair, slightly away with the fairies) and Kentaro Kobayashi (shorter hair and more self-consciously hip) have been working together for over a decade, honing their unique comic chemistry. Their best stuff is all about spoofing Japanese culture, and while that could be alienating to an international audience, the energy and all-round silliness with which they conduct themselves overcomes the cultural barriers. Their iconic status back home was cemented once and for all when Apple picked them for the Japanese \"I'm a PC, and I'm a Mac\" adverts. That said, they're a much more out-there proposition than Mitchell and Webb.</p>",

  "<p>NHS hospitals in England buy a lot of food, enough for 300 million patient meals a year. Much of it is poor quality and unpopular with those who are asked to eat it.</p> <p>Most people have a negative view of hospital food. This is perhaps not surprising given the endless stream of horrendous hospital food stories in the press, including revelations that <a href=\"http://www.ssentif.com/archive/4_oct2011.shtml\" title=\"\">one in every 10 patient meals is returned to the kitchen</a> uneaten. A recent sample of hospital ready meals by the <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/hospitalfood/\" title=\"\">Campaign for Better Hospital Food</a> found that three out of every four dishes would be given a red (high) traffic light for saturated fat under the <a href=\"http://www.food.gov.uk/northern-ireland/nutritionni/niyoungpeople/survivorform/bestreadbefore/signposting#.UJOby7-e2IY\" title=\"\">Food Standards Agency's traffic light model</a>.

These include easily achieved nutritional, environmental and ethical standards.</p> <p>For example, we want mandatory standards to require hospitals to serve more fruit and vegetables which have been sustainably grown (such as organic), using less oil and water and without damaging soil and biodiversity. This would be the single most effective way to support patient dietary health and would help to protect the environment at the same time.</p> <p>We also want standards to require hospitals to serve fresh fish, but only fish which is certified by organisations like the <a href=\"http://www.msc.org/\" title=\"\">Marine Stewardship Council</a> to have come from stocks which are not in danger of becoming endangered. We also want hospitals to give their patients more water, but ensure it comes from the tap rather than in a bottle. The list goes on.</p> <p>It is true that better hospital food may sometimes cost more, but it is also certain to achieve huge long-term financial benefits, not least in tackling diet-related ill health, helping patients to recover more quickly and investing in British farmers producing high quality ingredients.</p> <p>Although the government is much less interested in long-term gains than short-term cuts, it should open its eyes to the pleasant reality that hospitals can buy better food without breaking their budgets. <a href=\"http://www.nuh.nhs.uk/communications-and-media/news/2012/july/inspection-scores-hospital-excellent-for-food/\" title=\"\">Nottingham University Hospitals, for example,</a> has found that it has not had to pay more for better patient meals, despite shifting to high quality ingredients like cage-free eggs and RSPCA accredited chicken and pork.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/229423/0062185.pdf\" title=\"\">Scotland introduced nutritional standards</a> for hospital food in 2008 and Wales in 2011 and while there is not doubt that food is now healthier, it is too early to yet measure the longer-term benefits, for example faster patient recover times.</p> <p>Successive governments have tinkered with hospital food but have shied away from setting mandatory standards. The current government's drive for localism has only entrenched this problem, because it aims to restrict state intervention in health services.</p> <p>New health secretary Jeremy Hunt recently announced eight new \"principles\" for patient meals which he hopes hospitals will meet. But we don't expect this to achieve any more progress than the previous <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/pdf/GFFOM_Hospital_Food_Second_Report.pdf\" title=\"\">20 or so failed voluntary efforts to improve hospital food </a>which have been launched by government in the last 10 years alone.

  "<p>On the BBC a few weeks ago the New York Times pundit David Brooks explained to his British audience that American voters are \"looking for an excuse to vote against the president\". Spot on, I thought. Voters are disappointed in the promise that Barack Obama represented in 2008, but Mitt Romney has been making it hard for swing voters to elect him president instead.</p> <p>Since then it's looked as if next Tuesday's ballot may swing Romney's way after all. But no. As hurricane Sandy roared up the US eastern seaboard, fate may have tipped the balance back in Obama's direction by showing him quietly in charge and reminding folks the government \u2013 local, state or federal \u2013 isn't always the enemy of Tea Party fantasy.</p> <p>Overnight we've also learned that New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, the little guy with the sign language aide at his side, soft-spoken but reassuring and on top of the detail, is backing Obama and by implication the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-obama-endorsement-vote-big-government\" title=\"\">benign power of government</a>.</p> <p>That's quite a big deal, like Boris Johnson endorsing Ed Miliband \u2013 don't hold your breath, Ed \u2013 at the 2015 election here. Except that Bloomberg is an ex-Republican independent, a self-made billionaire who has the gravitas that Boris lacks, though he generally makes worse jokes.</p> <p>Hizzoner \u2013 as Americans call their big city mayors \u2013 is shrewdly political enough to praise Romney as a \"good and decent man\" who has done good things. Alas, \"he has reversed course on all of them\", including the healthcare model he created as governor of Massachusetts, the mayor noted in a statement. But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\" title=\"\">clincher for Bloomberg is Romney's hostility to climate change</a>.</p> <p>This week's devastation \"may or may not be\" a result, but the risk requires \"immediate action\", Bloomberg concludes. That's spot on too. When I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/30/frankenstorm-sandy-monstrous-media-hysteria\" title=\"\">mocked CNN's hysterical buildup</a> to hurricane Sandy here this week I got it partly wrong. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/east-coast-normalcy-hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">havoc and death it actually wreaked</a> \u2013 as opposed to the spine-chilling advance publicity \u2013 was more severe than I initially grasped, as we all now know.</p> <p>But one of my complaints, which remains valid, was the widespread reluctance of many Americans to concede that manmade climate change may be a crucial driver of its increasingly turbulent continental weather. The daily US weather map that most newspapers carry can be extraordinary, a Wagnerian drama which piles two feet of snow on Idaho on the same day that oranges are ripening in Florida sunshine. Floods, snow, twisters, droughts; it's never dull.</p> <p>Yet it remains an article of faith with many Americans that they can master nature as they mastered their vast land \u2013 chopped down its forests, dammed its rivers, cultivated its deserts, drilled for its oil, tamed its forest fires. Herman Melville's classic MobyDick told them otherwise \u2013 the sea always wins \u2013 but it's not a message everyone wants to hear. Obama's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-climate-change-closet-romney\" title=\"\">strategy</a> has been to let events talk for themselves.</p> <p>Bloomberg knows it \u2013 if you take a look at the storm, be careful, nature is stronger than us, he warned New Yorkers this week. After all, the great port city is surrounded by water \u2013 Manhattan, Long Island and Staten Island are just that \u2013 and the East and Hudson rivers are close to the vast Atlantic swell. The Thames Barrier, a mighty undertaking, currently protects London. It would not be enough to protect New York as water levels rise.</p> <p>The polarised ideological gridlock of Washington politics, far more severe than in post-cold-war Europe, exaggerates disagreements and damages politics: the failure to reach a compromise on federal taxes and spending still threatens the economic recovery, whoever wins on Tuesday. It needn't be that way. Just look at the courteous way Obama and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a>, admired Republican governor of New Jersey, have treated each other in this week's crisis.</p> <p>None of this plays Romney's way or the way Tea Party types want to see the world. I hesitate to say it's clinched re-election for the president. When Romney made his coarse assessment of the Democratic electoral base \u2013 the 47% of people who depend on benefits from the state \u2013 in September <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-video-leak-gaffe\" title=\"\">I suggested it might</a> \u2013 might \u2013 be the turning point, ensuring the challenger's defeat.</p> <p>So it might have done, but for Obama's strikingly feeble performance in the first presidential debate. It was precisely the sort of event which \u2013 to quote Brooks \u2013 gave wavering voters an excuse to vote him out. If he looked so disengaged that he didn't seem to want the job, why not let the other fellow have a go?</p> <p>After all, he had not lived up to expectations, though in fairness to Obama a kind reader on Twitter draws my attention to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/barack-obama-is-a-great-president-yes-great.html\" title=\"\">this robust defence</a> of the president's record by Jonathan Chait in the New York magazine. In the later debates Obama fought back \u2013 and now the hurricane has played to his strengths.</p> <p>Does it matter who wins? At the Cambridge Festival of Ideas last weekend I heard a panel of experts on Asia \u2013 one Korean, one Japanese and one Chinese \u2013 saying there is less interest than usual in the contest on their side of the Pacific. The US focus is tilting towards China (60% of US warships are now in the Pacific, we were told) but the anti-China rhetoric \u2013 formerly anti-Japanese \u2013 over unfair trade is much quieter in 2012.</p> <p>Whoever wins won't change US policy much (whatever aggressive pledges Romney is making) seemed to be east Asia's verdict. Well, maybe.</p> <p>I'd still say it matters quite a lot. Romney may plan to govern from the centre if he becomes president and Republican forces in Congress and the country allow him to \u2013 as they denied much scope to Obama. But it is certainly not what he's been saying.</p> <p>On climate change, denial is dominant. Republicans still want to deport millions of illegal immigrants, they would cut spending on benefits for those layabout Democrats \u2013 healthcare and stuff \u2013 while increasing defence spending AND cutting taxes for everyone. A constitutional curb on gays rights, the outlawing of abortion etc etc.</p> <p>A pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear plants, support for more West Bank settlements, the list is a long one \u2013 and scary. What we know from the record, two Bushes and Ronald Reagan, is that Republicans are better at cutting taxes, mostly for the rich, than cutting spending the way they promise to cut it. That's why the US has a crippling debt problem, a more serious budget imbalance than our own, possible only because of the residual prestige (for now) of the dollar.</p> <p>Add all that to the superior organisational power of the Democratic machine \u2013 the Obama team's better grasp of social media as campaign tools that offset the billionaire bank-rolling of Romney \u2013 together with the changing demographics of the US, and it points me to the same conclusion.</p> <p>Obama's crowds are much smaller than in 2008, but they're multiracial. That's America's future, black, white, Hispanic, Asian. Indeed the insurgency of the Tea Party, which was forced to settle for Romney (Paul Ryan, a consolation prize who could prove an error), may be the last hurrah of the old all-white hegemony.</p> <p>If they can't beat a disappointing incumbent, they may have to come to terms with the new realities at home and abroad. Modernisation of the Republican party is long overdue. Obama to scrape home after all.</p>",
  "<p>There has never been a greater interest in African film. The Nigerian video film industry, Nollywood \u2013 now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/sep/21/nollywood-nigerian-film-industry\" title=\"\">the second largest</a> in the world after Bollywood in terms of number of films produced \u2013 has revolutionised film production and distribution on the continent.</p> <p>Celebrating the best of these productions, the UK's largest annual festival of African cinema, <a href=\"http://www.filmafrica.org.uk\" title=\"\">Film Africa 2012</a>, opened in London on Thursday night, offering 10 days of 70 African films, film-maker Q&amp;As, professional workshops, and nine nights of African music.</p> <p>With the African-born residents of London including 105,000 Nigerians, 80,000 South Africans, 53,000 Zimbabweans, 44,000 Somalis, 39,000 Ghanaians, 25,000 Libyans, 18,000 Mauritians, 15,000 Kenyans, and 12,000 Eritreans, it is the perfect place to host the festival.</p> <p>Film Africa 2012 confronts issues that are not entirely specific to Africa, but that are explored from a uniquely African perspective. Africa is not a single, monolithic entity, however, and nor are its films. Alongside the distinctive energy of Nollywood there are also the unique flavours of African films from country to country.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, Film Africa gives special attention to certain African countries; this year it is South Africa, with 17 South African films scheduled. The programme comprises fiction, documentaries, and shorts, covering all aspects of the country: from victimisation and its inspirational overcoming; surfing and coming of age, the psychological fallout of apartheid, music and creativity, the contemporary struggles of gay people, the recent xenophobic riots, football and journeys of discovery, and the power of social movements to hold the government to account.</p> <p>This year, co-directors Lindiwe Dovey and Namvula Rennie are particularly eager to highlight the increasingly transnational nature of African film, both in its narrative content and its production values. In one of the major programming strands \u2013 continental crossings \u2013 the films have been chosen to inspire a vision of a global Africa connected to the western and the non-western world.</p> <p>Like the London film festival, Film Africa 2012 is divided into separate thematic focuses: in addition to continental crossings there is elections and democracy, Mama Africa, spotlight on sexualities, sport, and public space and citizen journalism.</p> <p>The opening night film, Nairobi Half Life, is an unlikely collaboration between leading German director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, The International) and rising Kenyan film talent David Tosh Gitonga. Other notable UK premieres include: The Education of Auma Obama, a portrait of the Kenyan half-sister of US president Barack Obama who introduced him to his Kenyan roots; the multi-award winning <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/nov/01/call-me-kuchu-review\" title=\"\">Call Me Kuchu</a>, a devastating tribute to the Ugandan gay activist David Kato; and Sons of the Clouds, which explores the refugee camps after the colonisation of western Sahara, starring Javier Bardem.</p> <p>The festival will close with a screening of Mama Africa, a documentary about Miriam Makeba \u2013 one of the most outspoken opponents of apartheid who was also affectionately known as the empress of African song \u2013 directed with the transnational and global consciousness of Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki.</p> <p><em>Film Africa is hosted by the Hackney Picturehouse, with screenings also at the BFI Southbank, Rich Mix in Shoreditch, The Ritzy in Brixton, Screen on the Green in Islington, and The South London Gallery. It is supported by the Royal African Society and London's School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas). Film Africa 2012 runs from November 1 \u2013 11.</em></p>",
  "<p>Basingstoke this week marked a new innovatory advance for the popular e2e4 tournaments, which allow English amateurs to qualify for official world ratings and titles awarded by Fide, the global chess body. Nine games against already rated opponents suffice, so an average amateur can qualify for a Fide rating in just two weekends.</p> <p>The e2e4 organisers run around a dozen events a year in upmarket hotels, and positive feedback on the good playing conditions means that most weekends are sold out. The next is at Brighton on 9-11 November, with many more to follow in 2013, so if you are interested it is worth checking the website calendar for future dates.</p> <p>Basingstoke featured a nine-round international played over five days with a dozen grandmasters and masters and thus the chance for Fide title norms. The innovation? There were no prizes, but entry fees were lower than at other weekends. Few were deterred, since the norm possibility is the major attraction in such events.</p> <p>The perennial GM entrant in e2e4 opens is Keith Arkell, 51, winner of some 300 mostly weekend tournaments whose greatest success was sharing the English championship in 2008. In the course of his long career Arkell has developed a unique playing style where he often settles for minimal opening edges and relies on his endgame technique. Just one arresting statistic is that he has reached the theoretically drawn endgame of king, rook and bishop against king and rook around 20 times and has almost always scored the point.</p> <p>This summer his autobiography, Arkell's Odyssey (Keverel Books, \u00a315.99) was published with 70 of his best games and his frank account of the highs and lows of a chess pro's life. It has plenty of nuggets of shrewd advice, so word of mouth has made it a popular buy for&#xa0;amateurs.</p> <p>Arkell's first round at Basingstoke illustrated a recurring theme where White builds an impressive pawn centre which Black tries to undermine at the edges. White scores rather easily, but his strategy was not risk-free if Black had used his knights actively. Thus 7...Bxf3! 8 gxf3 Na5, 12...Na5! 13 Ba2 Nh5 and 13...Ng6! are all improvements. Black's final chance was 17...Qh3! since as played White got the h file to complement his megacentre and Black was crushed.</p> <p><strong>K Arkell v M Lyell</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> d4 d5 <strong>2</strong> c4 dxc4 <strong>3</strong> Nf3 Nf6 <strong>4</strong> Nc3 a6 <strong>5</strong> a4 Nc6 <strong>6</strong>&#xa0;e4 Bg4 <strong>7</strong> Be3 e6?! <strong>8</strong> Bxc4 Bb4 <strong>9</strong> Qd3 0-0 <strong>10</strong> 0-0 Bxf3 <strong>11</strong>&#xa0;gxf3 e5 <strong>12</strong> d5 Ne7?! <strong>13</strong> f4 exf4?! <strong>14</strong> Bxf4 Ng6 <strong>15</strong>&#xa0;Bg3 Nh5 <strong>16</strong> f4 Qd7 <strong>17</strong> Qe2 Nxg3?! <strong>18</strong> hxg3 Rac8 <strong>19</strong> Kg2 Rfe8 <strong>20</strong> e5 Bxc3 <strong>21</strong> bxc3 Kh8 <strong>22</strong> Rh1 Nf8 <strong>23</strong>&#xa0;a5 f6 <strong>24</strong> Qe4 g6 <strong>25</strong> Qd4 fxe5 <strong>26</strong> fxe5 Qg7 <strong>27</strong>&#xa0;e6 Qxd4 <strong>28</strong> cxd4 Rcd8 <strong>29</strong> Rhf1 Re7 <strong>30</strong> Rab1 Kg7<strong> 31&#xa0;</strong>Rxb7 Rd6 <strong>32</strong> Rb8 <strong>1-0</strong></p> <p><strong>3278</strong> 1 b8R!

  "<p>Direct Line has issued its first update to the stock market since its impressive listing last month with cautious optimism, while insurance rival Admiral reported a sales fall that sent it to the top of the FTSE's biggest faller list.</p> <p>At <strong>Direct Line</strong>, the results for the three months to end of September saw operating profit down 4% to \u00a3123.7m compared with the same period last year due, however, the number of policies in place increased 500,000 from 19.4m at the beginning of the year to 20.1m.</p> <p>Operating profits from ongoing operations (which excluded restructuring costs) were up 3% to \u00a3346.9m in the first nine months of the year, compared with 2011, thanks in part to cost cutting at the firm, including 70 senior redundancies.</p> <p>Chief executive Paul Geddes said:</p> <blockquote> We continue to make good progress on the initiatives that will deliver our previously announced target of reducing gross annual costs by \u00a3100 million in 2014. <br> As part of these initiatives, we have undertaken a significant simplification of our head office, including the loss of around 70 senior leadership roles.  These changes, combined with previous actions, mean we have now announced approximately 50% of our 2014 cost saving target. </blockquote> <p>The company, previously part of Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance arm, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/11/direct-line-shares-flotation-strong-start\" title=\"\">floated last month at 175p</a>, with 15% of the issued stock snapped up by retail investors.</p> <p>They quickly rose to 180p and today trade at 196.3p (down 2.8p on the day).</p> <p>Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Overall, steady as she goes, with the group's first report to the market, as a quoted company, safely navigated. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, car insurance firm <strong>Admiral Group</strong> was the FTSE 100's biggest faller, down 61p, 5.3%, at \u00a310.81.</p> <p>A fall in third quarter turnover suggested growth will slow and make it harder for the company to justify the premium its shares currently trade at, according to analysts.</p> <p>The company, which insures one in ten cars on UK roads, said the number of policies increased 8% to 3.55m vehicles in the first nine months of the year.</p> <p>However, revenues in the quarter compared with a year earlier were down 2% to \u00a3570m and 5% within the UK car insurance market to \u00a3502m.</p> <p>Again, Eammon Flanagan at Shore Capital weighed in and said:</p> <blockquote> Admiral has issued probably its most cautious Interim Management Statement to date, in terms of outlook, in our view. <br> We view the shares as materially over-valued given the softening rating environment, the struggle the group faces to deliver the growth expected by the market and the very real threat of changes to its business model which might arise following the Competition Commission investigation. </blockquote> <p>In September, the Office of Fair Trading passed to the Competition Commission its findings into uncompetitive practices across the car insurance sector, with an investigation set to last up to two years.</p> <p>Oriel Securities wrote:</p> <blockquote> The Q3 IMS shows group turnover going into decline. Consensus estimates for 2013 and 2014 look too high and we expect will be coming down. The shares look overvalued and we reiterate our SELL recommendation. </blockquote> <p>Investec wrote:</p> <blockquote> Admiral issued a 3Q IMS today which was very brief, with few numbers. The group's revenue is slowing and profit is under pressure in our view. <br> The company states that it is \"on track to meet our expectations for 2012\". We do not know what these are or how they relate to market expectations. </blockquote> <p>And Peter Eliot at Berenberg wrote:</p> <blockquote> We expect Admiral to continue to face stiffer competition from its competitors than it has done in recent years, especially in its traditional higher premium segments, which Admiral is in any case now focusing less on. Regulatory headwinds are ahead and we believe that the maturing of the price comparison site channel in the UK, which Admiral has dominated, will remove a major growth driver for the company. </blockquote>",
  "<p>The leader of the newly launched airports commission has countered claims that his inquiry will serve as a political delaying tactic by pledging to offer practical answers by next year, well before the next general election.</p> <p>The commission is charged with examining \"the scale and timing of any requirement for additional [aviation] capacity\", according to its terms of reference released on Friday. It will produce its final report in June 2015, a month after the election, but Sir Howard Davies, who is leading the inquiry, said its interim report in 2013 would narrow down the options for airport expansion to those it considered feasible.</p> <p>\"The experience of recent years shows we need a robust evidence base which has the support of a broad consensus of opinion,\" Davies said. He has pledged to provide an open-minded assessment of the business and environmental cases for and against airport expansion.</p> <p>Davies admitted he was highly aware of criticisms that his review would be \"booting into the long grass\" what has become a toxic political issue, and promised to deliver full, feasible solutions ready for implementation \u2013 including producing short-term options for expanding aviation capacity in the south-east in his interim report.</p> <p>Earlier, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/boris-johnson-airport-expansion-slow\" title=\"\">criticised the commission as too slow</a> and described it as a \"policy of utter inertia\".</p> <p>Davies said by next year he would have given feasible options for any measures short of runway expansion, which is ruled out in the current coalition agreement. His interim report will narrow down the options for airport expansion to those the commission believes are workable, potentially refocusing the debate on Heathrow versus a new four-runway hub airport \u2013 the mayor's preferring solution \u2013 before the election.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, announcing the commission's terms of reference and which academics and aviation experts would be assisting Davies, said: \"Aviation is vital to the UK economy and we need to have a long-term aviation policy which meets the challenges of the future. Sir Howard and his team will now take forward this vitally important work for the government and bring a much-needed fresh perspective to the debate.\"</p> <p>Davies said his team, who between them have worked on delivering the Olympics, managed airports and sat on key environmental bodies, had the range of skills and experience required. \"With open minds, we will take time to explore the evidence, consider the options and aim to develop a lasting solution to the nation's aviation needs,\" he said. \"Our ambition is to do a thorough piece of work that will ensure aviation continues to support this country's economic, social and environmental ambitions. We aim to put the next government into a position in which rapid and implementable decisions can be soundly made.\"</p> <p>The other five commissioners are Sir John Armitt, former chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority and former chief executive of Network Rail; Ricky Burdett, professor of urban studies at the London School of Economics; Vivienne Cox, former CEO and executive vice-president of BP Alternative Energy; Dame Julia King, vice-chancellor of Aston University and a member of the Committee on Climate Change; and Geoff Muirhead, the former CEO of the Manchester Airport Group.</p> <p>The government said the commission would \"examine the scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK's position as Europe's most important aviation hub; and it will identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term\".</p> <p>Davies seemed to implicitly accept an underlying need for new capacity, but he has pledged to examine all the evidence, including Department for Transport forecasts for passenger growth that underpin the debate.</p> <p>A spokesman for Heathrow, whose planned third runway was cancelled by the coalition government in 2010, said: \"We hope the Davies commission will build consensus on the UK's requirements for hub capacity and then rigorously assess every option against those needs. None of the options for hub airport capacity is easy. Every choice, including doing nothing, has its consequences.\"</p> <p>Gatwick airport said it would be submitting full plans to Davies for building its second runway.</p> <p>Despite Davies's pledge to advance the timetable as much as he could within the current political constraints, business groups urged the government to let him report sooner. Corin Taylor, of the Institute of Directors, said: \"Sir Howard Davies is obviously doing the best he can with the hand he was dealt, but it seems that the commission will have solid conclusions based on extensive research ready well before 2015. Business needs to know what they are as soon as possible.\"</p>",
  "<p>I was hunkered down in a top floor hotel room in Washington DC, with superstorm Sandy furiously rapping at the window and battering the ceiling, when I first saw this picture of a transformer explosion at a power plant in Manhattan. I was still in the same situation when I saw it the second, third and 10th times. The dramatic white light bursting like a supernova in the rain-lashed dark was one of the few images that enabled news broadcasters to give an instant sense of how serious this night was becoming in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/31/us-north-east-struggle-recovery-sandy\" title=\"\">New York and New Jersey</a>.</p> <p>In Washington, which was also in the path of the vast storm, they had been talking power outages all weekend, after some DC areas were blacked out for weeks by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irene\" title=\"\">Hurricane Irene</a> in 2011. This image of a <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/10/30/massive-con-ed-transformer-explosion-blamed-for-widespread-outage/\" title=\"\">blinding flash that signified a massive loss of electricity</a> was exactly what I didn't want to think about, up in an elevator-accessed hotel room. Before giving in to Washington's lockdown \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/29/storm-sandy-washington-metro-idUSL1E8LTCJ62012102\" title=\"\">closing the metro and government offices was one thing </a> but when Starbucks shut, I knew it had to be serious \u2013 I procured hurricane supplies at a bookshop. A power cut now would stop me reading the next chapter of Philip Roth's novel The Ghost Writer.</p> <p>The build-up to Sandy in Washington was apocalyptic, the city's shutdown total, and the rain savage, but the next morning I could walk through the deserted streets kicking the odd fallen branch, and get breakfast at a bakery that had worked through the night. The disaster was elsewhere.</p> <p>Here is the paradox, for me, of this image. Superstorm Sandy is the most \"historic\" event I have personally been involved in, along with many millions of other people, but what is it to be involved? That was definitely Sandy howling and raging outside the window but it was clearly a much more benign experience of the storm than what I was seeing in this explosive image from New York. That is the nature of big events that get in the history books: even if you were \"there\" you were probably not there. You were looking the wrong way when Napoleon rode by, on the wrong ship when Nelson expired, manning a forgotten fortification outside Boston when <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Y-DbBvf7R5Y/TRXxLN1-PSI/AAAAAAAAfVc/7gK5b7r17-Y/s1600/32-Washington_Crossing_Delaware.jpg\" title=\"\">Washington crossed the Delaware</a>.</p> <p>Obviously I was glad to be on the margins of the horror night. Even this image is not the essence of Sandy. The blast of light does not show the human tragedies that were happening in New York, the sad stories of people trapped or overtaken by events or tempted to see the storm up close or determined to walk a dog. There are no pictures of the worst things that happened because when <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1005934/superstorm-sandy-death-toll-continues-to-rise\" title=\"\">the worst is happening the cameras cannot get there</a>. In that sense a mighty storm is harsher even than war. It is more secret, and death is more private. People get cut off, isolated.</p> <p>The reason CNN kept showing this image all night is that it captures the deep unlikeliness of this hurricane's assault on the most advanced society on earth. The lights of Manhattan are about to go out: the city of skyscrapers is falling before nature's onslaught. With a furious pulse of light, this power plant goes boom and plunges an untold number of people into darkness.</p> <p>Yet I became angry with this image, seeing it again and again on rolling news programmes. In all the hours of live coverage, as reporters and news anchors mulled over the apocalyptic resonance of this transformer explosion, with all the time and silence they had to fill, all those hours of weather to chronicle \u2013 there was not a single mention of climate change.</p> <p>Not that anyone needed to make a dogmatic connection between one storm and global warming \u2026 But not even to raise it? Now in the aftermath of the storm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\" title=\"\">the mayor of New York has spoken out on the subject</a>. But it would be naive to think America universally drew an environmental \"lesson\" from the storm. In a way the scale of it was too colossal to be turned into a parable about climate change or anything else.</p> <p>Storms, like battles, are not experienced as allegories but as complex fields of events. At 11 o'clock the next morning I was huddled in a doorway discussing an article on the phone while police officers kept an eye on the near-empty street. The bright light of the exploding generator was a fading, distant flash.</p>",
  "<p>Recently the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has been consulting on its <a href=\"http://scienceandsociety.bis.gov.uk/blog/2012/10/12/x/\">Science and Society programme</a>, and I for one have fed my thoughts back to their team. On their web pages they also detail the progress they have made against previous objectives, set up a couple of years ago. Progress on some fronts is good, particularly in the way <a href=\"http://scienceandsociety.bis.gov.uk/media/2012/09/04/september-2012-review-of-science-and-the-media-action-plan/\">interactions with the media</a> are progressing. Nevertheless, there are hints in the text implying unhealthy mental separation of different groupings. For example, language relating to how \"we\", that is the scientists, are expected to engage with \"you\", the public, might perhaps benefit from closer scrutiny. There are also some notable omissions of people who don't seem to be expected to participate in engagement very much at all, notably \"them\" - those who set the agenda at the centre of power, comprising MP's, civil servants and policy-makers in general.</p> <p>Before I return to considering why I think their omission is so important, let me just say a few words about a couple of the <a href=\"http://scienceandsociety.bis.gov.uk/blog/2012/10/12/x/#Objectives\">objectives</a> listed in their consultation document. The first one says<br></p> <ul> <li>The value of public investment in science and innovation and their contribution to economic and societal well-being is widely recognised.</li> </ul> <br>Value is a loaded word. It too readily smacks of economic value, particularly when juxtaposed with words like investment. It could be interpreted more widely than that and may well have been intended to encompass a range of other connotations. However, scientists themselves may be chary of a word like \"value\". Using this word right at the start raises the danger of alarm bells being set off for scientists who believe the benefits of their work extend far more broadly than on purely economic grounds. <p>For instance, the public engagement agenda that sits at the heart of the BIS consultation document implies a value that is hard to put a pound sign against, but is none the less real for this. This sort of engagement is of course at the heart of this document, but even so, looking at the last of the 6 objectives, I detect a slightly patronising view of it:<br></p> <ul> <li>Scientists better at communicating and engaging with the public.</li> </ul> <br>Personally, this reads rather like a school report describing some naughty pupil, rather than text acknowledging that maybe many scientists actually do a pretty good job of it already. I would prefer any statement referring to performance in this area to recognize that, at the very least, there are pockets of excellence well and truly established. A better worded objective would give a sense of encouragement, by implying that scientists should continue to improve in how they engage with the public, not by implication chastising us all for being tucked up in our little ivory tower silos. We're not perfect, and some clearly and regrettably don't engage at all, but things have progressed in the right direction over the recent past. This can be seen from the increasing numbers of individuals, at all levels of seniority, who participate in Science Festivals across the country, as <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/sciencefestival/events/?uid=5984be33-9435-4d3e-9e06-1297371028b7&amp;date=2012-03-24\">I</a> and many of my Cambridge colleagues do in our own annual <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/sciencefestival/\">Festival</a>. <p>Beneath the list of objectives, there is a similar list of what success will look like referring to the media, employers and industry, for instance. But the text is silent on 'them', the policy makers. They are not asked to improve their engagement with scientists, nor heed scientific evidence under the list of objectives. Neither does 'success' seem to involve them. No aspiration that policy will be based on scientific advice and evidence, nor that the Civil Service will become a destination of choice for fresh graduates. No sense that science should and indeed does permeate many ministries beyond BIS, and that some cross-ministry joined-up thinking around policy involving science might be beneficial \u2013 dare I say have value for \u2013 the country. You only have to think about the muddled mess involving the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) that represents the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/25/badgers-wildlife\">on-again/off-again badger cull</a> to realise that critical weighing of evidence, so crucial to scientific activities, does not sit centre stage when it comes to policy. Civil servants who write policy documents across the board only too rarely have formal scientific training.</p> <p>Nor does success, according to BIS, contain any mention of the <a href=\"http://www.adamafriyie.org/articles-&amp;-speeches/press-release-adam-afriyie-mp-renews-call-for/178\">suggestion</a>, made by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Afriyie\">Adam Afriyie</a> (then shadow Science Minister) before the last election, that MPs should get remedial science lessons. To quote my own MP and erstwhile colleague in Physics at the University of Cambridge, <a href=\"http://julianhuppert.org.uk/\">Dr Julian Huppert</a> shortly after election as an MP in 2010, who <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/only-scientist-in-commons-alarmed-at-mps-ignorance-2041677.html\">said</a> <em>\u00e0 propos </em>of this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It would be really important for all MPs to have some exposure, because some of them will not have studied any science since they were 15 and it's important to understand how to engage with it. You would then have a lot of MPs who were able to understand the information they were being presented with.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I would urge the powers-that-be to think more about the role that policy-makers have when it comes to contributing to what BIS headlines as \"Our vision is of a UK which values the contribution of science to culture, society and sustainable economic development and growth.\"</p> <p>It isn't just about \"us\" the scientists.</p>",
  "<p>The following interesting question arose yesterday from what at first appeared to be some petty Twitter bickering: who was the worst president for civil liberties in US history? That question is a difficult one to answer because it is so reliant upon which of many valid standards of measurement one chooses; it depends at least as much on the specific rights which one understands the phrase \"civil liberties\" to encompass. That makes the question irresolvable in any definitive way, but its examination is nonetheless valuable for the light it sheds on current political disputes.</p> <p>It's worthwhile first to set forth the context in which the question arose. At their Lawfare blog, Ritika Singh and Benjamin Wittes <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/10/civil-liberties-in-the-war-of-1812/\">posted an excerpt</a> of an essay they wrote for a new book on the War of 1812; their essay pertains to the impact of that war on civil liberties and executive power. The two Brookings writers note that despite intense domestic opposition to the war, President Madison \"eschewed the authority to detain American citizens in military custody or try them in military tribunals, and more generally, declined to undertake the sorts of executive overreaches we have come to expect - and even encourage - from our presidents in war.\" </p> <p>After Julian Sanchez, I and others tweeted that essay by remarking that Madison refrained from exploiting the war to abridge civil liberties, Slate's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/264005363010002945\">Matt Yglesias' wrote</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398788006\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351853066074/yglesias.png\" alt=\"yglesias tweet\" width=\"360\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That struck me as a cheap and vapid reply. Nobody was suggesting that Madison was the personification of civil liberties nirvana. Rather, the point was a very narrow and discrete one: he largely refrained from exploiting the War of 1812 as a pretext for abridging extant political rights. Whether he owned slaves - or was otherwise the worst monster in history - does not remotely pertain to, let alone negate, that specific and important historical fact about Madison's presidency.</p> <p>Moreover, the issue raised by the essay on Madison was about the extent to which presidents use their power to erode civil liberties which exist when they assumed the office, or refrain from attacking those rights despite having the opportunity in the form of war or other crises. That a person is born into a society in which the evil of slavery already exists has little to do with that historical question.</p> <p>That said, once one posits a president's personal slavery ownership as inconsistent with a positive civil liberties record - as Yglesias implicitly did - then that must be the number one factor in assessing a president's place on the civil liberties list. By that metric, all slave-owning presidents, or one who <a href=\"http://billofrightsinstitute.org/resources/educator-resources/lessons-plans/presidents/dred-scott/\">expressly endorsed the Dred Scott decision as James Buchanan did</a>, would automatically have to be deemed the worst.</p> <p>After all, owning human beings as chattel is the supreme civil liberties violation, by far the gravest civil liberties abuse in US history. That goes without saying. It is sui generis.</p> <p>That's why it was so bizarre to see that the very same Matt Yglesias, just moments later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/264006669296615425\">pronounced Woodrow Wilson</a> - a president who never owned any slaves and never presided over slavery - to be the \"worst-ever president on civil liberties\", even suggesting that Wilson has no \"serious competition\" for that ignominious title. It was when I pointed out the irony of Yglesias' selection of a non-slave-owning president in light of his tweet that the interesting question arose of who should be considered the worst civil liberties president in US history.</p> <p>If one were simply to consider specific acts which constituted grave assaults on civil liberties - narrowly defined as the core political rights explicitly protected by the Bill of Rights: free speech, freedom from deprivation of life and liberty without due process, etc. - one could make a strong argument for several presidents. John Adams <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Alien.html\">signed The Alien and Sedition Acts</a>, which essentially criminalized certain forms of government criticism in preparation for a war with France, a radical assault on the First Amendment. </p> <p>Abraham Lincoln <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0029.205?rgn=main;view=fulltext\">illegally suspended the core liberty of habeas corpus</a> without Congressional approval. Wilson's <a href=\"http://www.chicora.org/woodrow-wilson.html\">attacks on basic free speech in the name of national security</a> were indeed legion and probably unparalleled. Franklin Roosevelt <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/roosevelt-ushers-in-japanese-american-internment\">oversaw the due-process-free internment</a> of more than 100,000 law-abiding Japanese-Americans into concentration camps.</p> <p>And then there are the two War on Terror presidents. George Bush seized on the 9/11 attack to usher in radical new surveillance and detention powers in the PATRIOT ACT, spied for years on the communications of US citizens without the warrants required by law, and claimed the power to indefinitely imprison even US citizens without charges in military brigs. </p> <p>His successor, Barack Obama, went further by claiming the power <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/02/president-obama-signed-the-national-defense-authorization-act-now-what/\">not merely to detain citizens without judicial review</a> but <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/04/07/assassinations_2/\">to assassinate them</a> (about which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07yemen.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">the New York Times said</a>: \"It is extremely rare, if not unprecedented, for an American to be approved for targeted killing\"). He has waged an unprecedented war on whistleblowers, dusting off Wilson's Espionage Act of 1917 to prosecute more then double the number of whistleblowers than all prior presidents combined. And he has draped his actions with at least as much secrecy, if not more so, than any president in US history.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is close to impossible to rank these abuses strictly as a qualitative matter, in terms of the powers seized. How does one say that interning citizens in concentration camps (Roosevelt) is better or worse than imprisoning people for dissent (Adams and Wilson), putting people in cages with no charges (Lincoln, Bush, Obama), or claiming the power to execute citizens in total secrecy and without any checks of any kind (Obama)? If anything, one could reasonably argue that the power of due-process-free executions is the most menacing since it's the only act that is permanent and irreversible.</p> <p>Certainly, the quantity of abuse matters. In that regard, Roosevelt's interments and Wilson's free speech prosecutions would appear worse than, say, Adams' attacks on dissent, Bush's indefinite detentions, or Obama's citizen assassinations. </p> <p>Moreover, it is one of the ironies of US history that <a href=\"http://hnn.us/articles/19113.html\">civil liberties erosions are often accompanied by civil liberties progress from the same leader</a>: Adams was integral in the founding of the republic and its rights-enshrining documents; Lincoln freed the slaves; Wilson supported women's suffrage; Roosevelt appointed two of the most sterling civil liberties advocates to the supreme court; Obama withdrew authorization for some torture techniques (ones that were not in use when he was inaugurated) and banned CIA black sites (ones that were empty when he assumed office). </p> <p>Ultimately, there are two critical factors that, for me at least, are highly influential if not decisive in determining the proper ranking. The first is the extent to which the civil liberties abuses are <strong>temporary or permanent</strong>.</p> <p>Most of the contenders for worst civil liberties abuses were \"justified\" by traditional wars that had a finite end and thus dissipated once the wars were over. Lincoln's habeas suspension did not survive the end of the Civil War, nor did FDR's internment camps survive the end of World War II. The Alien and Sedition Acts were severely diluted fairly quickly, while the bulk of Wilson's abuses which survived World War I lay dormant until the War on Terror. As horrible as they were, these radical erosions were often finite, arguably by design, since the wars which served as their pretext would foreseeably end at some point.</p> <p>This is one key factor that distinguishes the War on Terror. By its nature, it will never end, at least not in the foreseeable future. It is a \"war\" far more in a metaphorical sense than a real one. </p> <p>Since it began, both administrations who have waged it have expressly acknowledged its virtually indefinite - and thus unique - nature. In May 2009, when <a href=\"http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article22688.htm\">Obama unveiled his proposal</a> for \"preventive detention\", <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/us/politics/21obama.text.html?_r=0\">he said</a>: \"Unlike the Civil War or World War II, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.\" He added that we'll still be fighting this war \"a year from now, five years from now, and - in all probability - 10 years from now.\" </p> <p>Just last week, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/24/obama-terrorism-kill-list\">reported</a> that the Obama administration is creating permanent bureaucratic systems to implement its War on Terror powers as it \"expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years\". Specifically, \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade.\" That \"suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism.\"</p> <p>Civil liberties abuses justified by a finite war can be awful while they last, but then they cease. Abuses that are systematized based on the premise that they are to be permanent do far more than that: they radically alter the nature of the government and the relationship of the political class to the citizenry. </p> <p>This, to me, has always been the most uniquely pernicious aspect of the War on Terror civil liberties assaults of the last decade: they will not end when the \"war\" does because the \"war\" will have no end. Each new power is embedded permanently into the political framework, incrementally transforming the political culture and the species of government itself.</p> <p>The second vital factor is the<strong> justification used</strong> for these assaults. However critical one wants to be of Lincoln, Wilson and Roosevelt - and harsh criticism is appropriate in all three cases - they were actually fighting major wars that had the potential to severely harm if not destroy the US. To the extent that war is a justification for increasing the powers of the executive, those three wars are clearly the most compelling examples.</p> <p>By contrast, the \"War on Terror\" is not even legitimately described as a \"war\", let alone one anywhere near the magnitude of its predecessors. Shortly after I began writing about politics in late 2005, I <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com.br/2005/12/idiotic-and-revealing-civil-war.html\">examined the inane tactic</a> of Bush-following neoconservatives - one that is, like so many neocon views, now vigorously embraced by many Obama defenders - to cite Lincoln's civil liberties abridgments during the Civil War to justify abridgments in the name of the War on Terror. The fundamental differences are obvious:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"During Lincoln's Presidency, the entire nation was engulfed in an internal, all-out war. Half of the country was fully devoted to the destruction of the other half. The existence of the nation was very much in doubt. Americans were dying violent deaths every day at a staggering rate. One million American were wounded and a half-million Americans died (a total which represented 5% of the total population), making it the deadliest war America has ever faced, by far, including all wars through the present. On multiple occasions, more than 25,000 Americans \u2013 and sometimes as many as 50,000 \u2013 were killed in battles lasting no more than three days. The scope of carnage, killing, and chaos \u2013 all within the country, on American soil \u2013 is difficult to comprehend.</p> <p>\"Making matters worse \u2013 much worse \u2013 the country was only 70 years old at the time. And even before the Civil War began, America was teetering precariously from these unresolved internal conflicts. The country then was a shadow of what it is today, with a tiny faction of the strength, stability and cohesion which, 140 years later, characterize the United States.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It takes little effort to demonstrate that the \"War on Terror\" is not in the same universe. As Professor Richard Jackson has <a href=\"http://richardjacksonterrorismblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/the-threat-of-terrorism/\">documented</a>, there is a greater risk of dying from lightning strikes or bathtub falls than terrorism. Professors John Mueller and Mark G. Stewart, writing <a href=\"http://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller//absisfin.pdf\">in the latest issue of International Security</a>, condemned the \"extraordinarily exaggerated and essentially delusional response\" to 9/11. As Professor Stephen Walt <a href=\"http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/13/what_terrorist_threat#.UClvYIJhDFA.twitter\">described their article</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Mueller and Stewart analyze 50 cases of supposed 'Islamic terrorist plots' against the United States, and show how virtually all of the perpetrators were (in their words) 'incompetent, ineffective, unintelligent, idiotic, ignorant, unorganized, misguided, muddled, amateurish, dopey, unrealistic, moronic, irrational and foolish.' They quote former Glenn Carle, former deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats saying 'we must see jihadists for the small, lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents that they are,' noting further that al-Qaida's 'capabilities are far inferior to its desires.'\" </p> </blockquote> <p>To the extent the validity of the proffered justification matters, and it must matter some, the War on Terror abuses are easily the worst for this metric. Unlike the actual, threatening wars of the past, this \"war\" is pure pretext, a total farce: so out of proportion to the civil liberties assaults employed in its name as to be inconceivable.</p> <p>As noted, this discussion assumes a rather narrow range of the term \"civil liberties\": namely a focus on the original core political liberties expressly guaranteed by the Bill of Rights: freedom of speech, freedom from deprivation of life and liberty without due process, habeas corpus. If one expands the term to include more contemporary debates surrounding issues such as gay equality and reproductive rights, as is proper, then the overall picture meaningfully changes.</p> <p>The one common strain running through these historic civil liberties assaults is war. War almost always erodes political liberties. That has always been true. Cicero <a href=\"http://liberalwarjournal.blogspot.com.br/2006/01/inter-arma-enim-silent-leges_10.html\">famously observed</a> \"inter arma, enim silent leges\" (in times of war, the law falls mute). </p> <p>That fact - that wars maximize a political leader's power - is a key reason they often crave war and why wars, under the Constitution, were supposed to be extremely difficult for presidents to start. As John Jay <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed04.asp\">wrote in Federalist 4</a>, \"absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal\" (that's also why the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamas-negation-of-hostilities-in-libya-draws-criticism/2011/06/20/AGV2zTdH_story.html\">absurd contortions</a> invoked by President Obama to fight a war in Libya not only in the absence of Congressional approval, but in the face of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-20073996.html\">formal Congressional disapproval</a>, belongs high on the list of his worst and likely most enduring civil liberties assaults).</p> <p>But in terms of the role played by war in enabling civil liberties assaults, at least the exploited wars are usually real. In the case of the \"War on Terror\", it is far more illusory and frivolous than real. That - along with their permanence - is a major factor in determining where the civil liberties erosions of the last decade, and the presidents responsible for them, rank in history.</p>",
  "<p>Could the backing of Barack Obama by the mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg be \"the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theduncanclark/statuses/264126160504492032\">most important news story</a> of all time\"? Was the \"Frankenstorm\" Sandy the disaster some, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/25/climate-change-david-attenborough\">David Attenborough this week</a>, believed was unfortunately necessary to wake the US and the world from its slumber over global warming?</p> <p>It has certainly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-climate-change-closet-romney?intcmp=239\">resurrected the issue in the US</a>, as my colleague there Suzanne Goldenberg reports, and has broken the extraordinary <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/01/obama-strategy-silence-climate-change\">climate silence Obama instigated in the spring of 2009</a> - having decided that climate change was not a winning issue for him. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2012/oct/30/superstorm-sandy-new-york-in-pictures\">devastation of New York and New Jersey</a> has changed that and Bloomberg's intervention is certainly striking. His <a href=\"http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=BD2B64EB-C29C-7CA2-F83198E3B4EF0938\">endorsement was headlined</a> \"Vote for a president who will lead on climate change\", while his <a href=\"http://news.wsiu.org/post/bloomberg-businessweeks-cover-its-global-warming-stupid\">Business Week magazine cover</a> was ever starker: \"It's climate change, stupid.\"</p> <p>However, people suggested hurricane Katrina in 2005 would galvanise climate action and it clearly did not. On our current trend of greenhouse gas emissions, the world is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/apr/25/governments-catastrophic-climate-change-iea\">on track for 6C of warming</a>, i.e. catastrophe. Other natural disasters, droughts, floods and storms all supercharged by climate change, have struck across the world since and caused far more human suffering than Sandy. </p> <p>But what has changed is two things. First, this latest disaster has struck the most famous city on Earth at the moment it is electing the most powerful person on the planet. Second, the 2007 report from the UN's climate scientists and everything since has built an incontrovertible case that the burning of fossil fuels is a severe threat to the benign climate that has prevailed for millennia.</p> <p>The reason why Bloomberg's backing for Obama will, I think, resonate beyond the US election is that it strikes at the very heart of the inaction on climate change: the lack of political will. The low-carbon technology exists to tackle the problem, as does the clear economic case for doing so. What was missing was, as Bloomberg put it, the desire to \"place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics\".</p> <p>The shock of Bloomberg's endorsement for Obama is clear: the mayor was elected as a Republican before becoming an independent. It's a little like London mayor and Conservative Boris Johnson backing Labour leader Ed Milliband for prime minister in the wake of the capital flooding. Some might even think that Bloomberg's attack on Mitt Romney for \"reversing course\" on climate change action could apply to David Cameron, who has indulged in his own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/24/cameron-green-speech-clean-energy\">politically convenient climate silence</a> since being elected.</p> <p>Only time will reveal the ultimate significance of Bloomberg's choice. But the US has been a huge barrier to international progress on dealing with climate change. </p> <p>If Sandy \u2013 and this summer's record US heatwave \u2013 end up blowing Obama back into the White House with enough wind in his sails to persuade him to make climate change a winning issue, it really could have positive global consequences. If not, I shudder to think what scale of apocalyptic disaster will be needed to destroy the political cowardice among world leaders that is stoking the ever greater climate change storms of the future.</p>",
  "<p>Meeting targets for saving energy, reducing waste or increasing recycling is a global challenge. The UK is no exception and, having missed the target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2010, sustainable development is more important than ever.</p> <p><a href=\"http://naei.defra.gov.uk/actiondetail.php?action_id=12\" title=\"\">Almost half of the UK's emissions are caused by buildings</a> and engineering successful cities is vital in helping the UK \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 meet, or even exceed, sustainability targets.</p> <p>There are many buildings across the world which have been lauded for their sustainable design, even before significant carbon reduction targets were put in place. In the 1980s, for example, it was the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) headquarters in the UK, followed by the Beddington Zero Energy Development (BedZed) in Sutton in the late 1990s. More recently the Aquatic Centre in Beijing and the California Academy of Sciences, which were completed in 2008, both fitted the bill.</p> <p>The recently opened Construction Industry Council's (CIC) Zero Carbon Building in Hong Kong can also be added to the list of impressive sustainable developments. The CIC building goes beyond the traditional definition of zero carbon. It's connected to the local grid and produces renewable energy on site from a combination of photovoltaic panels and a biodiesel tri-generation system, which offsets the power consumed on an annual basis.</p> <p>The large-scale use of such renewable fuel is a first in Hong Kong and by using waste cooking oil to generate power, two problems are solved \u2013 waste treatment and energy generation. Excess energy is also exported to the local grid to recover the energy used its construction process and building materials.</p> <p>These exemplar buildings demonstrate that we have the technology to achieve low-carbon, low-water consumption buildings, made from low impact or recycled material.</p> <p>However, while projects such as CIC, BedZed and CEGB highlight the rise and benefits of sustainable design, this type of urban development is still not commonplace. With such tough environmental targets to meet \u2013 particularly in developed countries \u2013 why are our cities not full of sustainable buildings, enabling the city as a whole to operate in this way?</p> <h2><strong>Building leadership</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps the first point to address is a country's cultural and political landscape. For example, the government in China is committed to delivering sustainable developments, but when this policy is handed down to local development level it rarely is delivered in practice.</p> <p>The success of northern Europe in delivering green developments can perhaps be partly attributed to the countries' more socialist structure. The government in Finland, for example, is committed to the sustainable agenda and has the backing of its communities to deliver. In 1990, Finland became the first country in the world to establish a carbon tax. Also, 3.4% of its GDP is invested into research and development \u2013 the largest amount in the world \u2013 leading to innovative and sustainable solutions across all areas.</p> <p>Sustainable buildings and city-wide projects need committed, forward-thinking leadership to drive through change. Risk aversion tends to be the default of the development industry and will not deliver the changes we require.</p> <p>Most people believe that sustainable buildings are too costly. However, if the design is considered holistically, in many cases a sustainable building will cost no more. For instance, a building's fa\u00e7ade can be engineered to operate differently in the winter and summer to reduce the lighting and heating required in the building. Good integrated design may increase the fa\u00e7ade cost but reduces the heating and air conditioning equipment required, resulting in an efficient building at a similar overall cost.</p> <p>Examples like this consider cost and benefits over the entire project life cycle and design decisions aren't rooted in the immediate financial implications alone. This leads to a far more efficient and cost effective building design in the long-run.</p> <p>The Marine and Freshwater Resources Institute is a fantastic example of this theory in practice, setting a benchmark <a href=\"http://www.arup.com/Services/Sustainable_Buildings_Design.aspx\" title=\"\">for&#xa0;sustainable building design</a> and reclamation of contaminated land.</p> <p>The building was designed to respond to the seasons; there is no central air conditioning in the building and the centre's slanting fa\u00e7ade operates as a solar controller. In the winter (when the sun is low) the sunlight streams in, warming the building. In the summer (when the sun is higher in the sky) the building is protected from overheating. A control system for the windows also allows warm air to escape in the evening and cool night air to circulate within the building, making significant savings on utility bills.</p> <p>As well as new developments, we shouldn't forget older buildings in the sustainability equation. There's no question that buildings today are better than they were 20 years ago \u2013 regulations have seen to that. However, most of our cities are full of structures built more than 20 years ago, so much more needs to be done to retrofit these buildings to make them more efficient.</p> <p>Projects such as CIC and the institute highlight again and again the high return of sustainable projects and the increasing need to educate the public on the benefits. Owners, developers and tenants do not push, or are not properly advised by their professional team about what can be achieved and they set their sights too low.</p> <p>Instead, policy makers, designers and engineers alike need to push through these new innovative projects as the decisions made today will set the path for our future cities and impact the everyday lives of communities for years to come.</p> <p><em>Alistair Guthrie is global sustainable buildings design leader at </em><a href=\"http://www.arup.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Arup</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Britain's construction industry had another difficult month in October, as new work dropped for the fifth month running, forcing firms to lay off workers at the fastest rate since August 2011.</p> <p>Overall, construction activity improved slightly last month. The construction PMI from Markit/CIPS rose to 50.9 in October from 49.5 in September, indicating expansion rather than contraction, but the reading was much weaker than the average seen in the decade leading up to the global financial crisis in 2008 (56.3).</p> <p>The improvement was due to higher levels of output in civil engineering, while housebuilding remained weak, with output declining for the fifth month in a row. Commercial activity also dropped in October.</p> <p>\"The construction sector continues to be hampered by major headwinds, notably including public spending cuts, an extended weak economy, a struggling housing sector, and problems in getting funding for large-scale projects,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. \"In particular, the government's spending cuts are limiting overall expenditure on public buildings, schools and hospitals.\"</p> <p>Squeezed budgets and clients' worries about the economic outlook have resulted in the longest period of falling new order volumes since the height of the crisis in 2008/09, according to the PMI survey. A lack of new work to replace completed projects meant companies returned to job shedding and cut back on the use of subcontractors, for a third month.</p> <p>Adding to construction firms' woes, their costs rose at the fastest rate in nearly a year due to higher fuel and energy prices, ramping up the pressure on margins.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Britain emerged from double-dip recession recently, growing by 1%</a> in the third quarter, construction was one sector that remained in the doldrums, shrinking by 2.5%.</p> <p>In an independent report commissioned by Wickes, construction industry leaders are calling for young people to be trained in skills such as plastering and bricklaying from the age of 15, as in eastern Europe. They also call for VAT to be cut to 5% for the trade to ensure tradesmen are not out-priced by \"cowboy builders\" offering cash-in-hand quotations to homeowners on a budget.</p>",
  "<p>The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has been saved from being dismantled after a climbdown from the universities and science minister, David Willetts, and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).</p> <p>The proposed merger with the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton would have irreparably damaged one of world's leading centres for polar research, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/merge-british-antarctic-survey\" title=\"\">many critics</a>.</p> <p>\"BAS is a national and international asset that delivers world-class environmental science, and this country's strategic presence in Antarctica and the South Atlantic,\" Willetts said in a <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/work/boards/council/bas-noc-outcome.asp\" title=\"\">statement to parliament on Friday</a>. \"NERC agreed that it will not proceed with the proposal for merger.\"</p> <p>\"I am delighted that the right decision has been made,\" said John Dudeney, BAS deputy director until 2006. \"But the devil is in the detail. What you don't want is want is to leave a husk of BAS that only provides logistics.\" He said ensuring science remained an integrated part of work at BAS \u2013 whose scientists discovered the ozone hole \u2013 was vital.</p> <p>\"BAS is outstanding and has always been so,\" he said, noting it was about to embark on a landmark experiment to drill into a lake hidden deep under the Antarctic ice, a feat he compared to landing spacecraft on Mars.</p> <p>The announcement was also greeted as \"fantastic news\" by Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge Julian Huppert.</p> <p>Vicky Wyatt, Greenpeace arctic campaigner, said: \"The decision acknowledges the critical role that British science does and can play in protecting the polar regions. Right now, with the Arctic summer sea ice melting at a record rate, and growing uncertainty over the effect of climate change on the Antarctic, we need Britain's scientists more than ever.\"</p> <p>The decision ends a period of turmoil at BAS, which has been without a permanent director since February. The interim director appointed was also the director of the National Oceanography Centre with which BAS was to have been merged to save costs. Dudeney said: \"NERC needs to consider how they got into such a mess.\"</p> <p>The proposed merger met with opposition from politicians, scientists and environmentalists in the UK and abroad. Former US vice-president Al Gore defended BAS as a \"globally significant institution\", while Prof Jonathan Shanklin, one of the scientists who discovered the ozone hole in 1985, said: \"BAS is almost synonymous with the Antarctic ozone hole. Losing it would create a comparable hole in British science.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/1201031-nerc-report/\" title=\"\">House of Commons science and technology committee also condemned the merger</a> in a report published on Wednesday, the day before NERC decided to abandon the plan. \"We concluded that NERC have not made a proper case for it nor demonstrated political nous on the strong non science-related issues surrounding BAS,\" said committee chair Andrew Miller.</p> <p>Four of the UK's biggest green NGOs \u2013 Greenpeace, the RSPB, WWF-UK and Friends of the Earth \u2013 had also signalled their strong opposition to the merger.</p> <p>The plan attracted further controversy after the Guardian revealed the merger would require BAS to use its skills to help <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/14/environmental-science-agencies-oil-polar\" title=\"\">\"de-risk\" investment for UK oil companies exploring the polar regions</a>.</p> <p>Environmentalist Tony Juniper, who was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/29/axing-british-antarctic-survey-juniper\" title=\"\">prominent critic of the merger plan</a>, said: \"It is a good day for polar science and very encouraging that argument has won out over dogma.\" He said NERC must appoint a new director for BAS as a matter of urgency in order to confirm that the institution was safe in its current form.</p>",

  "<p><em>Lesley Batchelor is director general of the </em><a href=\"http://www.export.org.uk/about-us\" title=\"\"><em>Institute of Export</em></a></p> <p><strong>There are many ways in which to cope with languages:</strong> It's important to communicate in your customers' local language. A customer is four times more likely to purchase from a website in their own language. The next thing to realise is that you need help from linguists and to learn how to cost this additional help into the price of the goods in the new market. Finally, learn how to use an interpreter as they will become your link and your voice in that new market until you are established. Even if they say they speak English it would be a mark of your commitment to communicate if you bring one along.</p> <p><em>Rhiannon Price is an international market researcher for </em><a href=\"http://www.northstarhub.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Northstar Research</em></a></p> <p><strong>Choosing the right city to export to is just as important as the country:</strong> Choosing the right city for our clients to research their products, brand or services is so important. The difference in usage and attitude within markets can be profound, and it can be very short sighted to assume that what works in one city will work in another.</p> <p><strong>Be aware of business etiquette in different countries:</strong> Cultural nuance is important. We face this problem every day when liaising with our agencies in other countries and even more so when actually in the market on research fieldwork and communicating with consumers. It is imperative to learn some of the basic cultural business etiquette when visiting a county. For example <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kiss-Bow-Shake-Hands-2nd/dp/1593373686\" title=\"\">Kiss, Bow or Shake Hands by Morrison and Conaway</a> gives advice on how to conduct yourself in more than 60 countries.</p> <p><strong>Once you're in your target country, you will need to find your potential customers:</strong> From a research perspective, first you need to understand the usage and attitude within the market. Then identify different groups or segments depending on their usage and attitude, and then finally identify which is most appropriate for your business and your business goals. From this you can create a target customer which will help you to hone your product, marketing and communications. This might seem like a big challenge but any global research agency will be able to help if you have budget. If you don't have budget, desk research and in-market observation is the best place to start.</p> <p><strong>Use social media:</strong> Social media mining or tracking is a great way of looking for trends in different markets. If this feels like too big of a job to do internally, there are social media mining companies that can deliver some really insightful reports.</p> <p><em>James Hardy is the director of international business development and marketing for </em><a href=\"http://www.alibaba.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Alibaba.com</em></a><em> in the European region</em></p> <p><strong>Selling online is a good form of market research:</strong> It would be better to establish if there is a demand in your chosen market first. Maybe sell online initially and use online tools such as social media channels and advertising to promote the website to overseas customers and see if there is a demand.</p> <p><strong>You can get your message out about your business online: </strong>Facebook is a great channel for our small business customers. We've seen fantastic Facebook business pages with huge fanbases. Even if you don't have a huge fanbase, you can try Facebook advertising which can be a great way to acquire new customers. Many of our customers use promoted posts because it is inexpensive and you reach your existing fanbase but also friends of your fans. LinkedIn is also a good way to target B2B customers and even suppliers. They also have advertising but I recommend going to the LinkedIn group pages and engage in the discussions as a good starting point.</p> <p><em>Peter Hogarth is the East Midlands regional director for </em><a href=\"http://www.ukti.gov.uk/home.html?guid=none\" title=\"\"><em>UKTI</em></a></p> <p><strong>Think about your online presence:</strong> Don't forget your website. If necessary, change it to better suit the demand of particular markets and search engines.</p> <p><em>Geraldine Abrahams is the director of production company </em><a href=\"http://www.tummywithmummy.com/\" title=\"\"><em>TWM Productions</em></a></p> <p><strong>Go and visit your target market:</strong> Nothing beats hands-on experience. It's very important to research the markets but the real learning comes from being there and experiencing the market. I agree that trade missions can be invaluable and the more planning done ahead, the better the experience. I recently attended a trade mission to the US. Before I went, I liaised with UKTI over there so that they could help identify potential relationships. It worked out really well in terms of learning about the culture, practices and of course the face-to-face building of relationships is fantastically effective.</p> <p><em>Ignaty Dyakov is a director of </em><a href=\"http://russialocal.co.uk/en/\" title=\"\"><em>Russia Local Ltd</em></a></p> <p><strong>Social media is a great market research tool:</strong> Do not forget that in certain countries people use social media differently. For example, in Russia Vkontakte is used much more than Facebook.</p> <p><strong>Employing language and cultural awareness trainers is a good idea: </strong>It's always good to at least understand the language of the country you are going to work in. You will gain much more confidence when you're there on a visit; and this confidence alone can bring you more business. A good language trainer will always talk about cultural and mentality differences, so that the language is placed in the context. But there are providers of cultural awareness training specifically.</p> <p><em>Dick Brentnall is an associate with </em><a href=\"http://www.strongandherd.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Strong &amp; Herd LLP</em></a></p> <p><strong>I use a simple acronym to outline the basic research you have to do:</strong> PEST \u2013 political, economic, social, technical. For any exporter there is essential information in each of these categories. As a quick illustration, under political, how many exporters, new or established, know when the next election will be in that country? We all know what a destabilising effect it can have on doing business as well as impacting future policies.</p> <p><strong>If you know your language skills aren't strong, get someone to help out:</strong> I always, without exception, hired a local interpreter or car driver when visiting a market. Frankly most of contacts I made locally appreciated this, it saved time and I very quickly was able to understand local customs and practice. It is easy to arrange. I normally booked the service in advance from my hotel or in a few exceptions used the local British embassy services.</p> <p>You can see the full Q&amp;A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/small-business-network/2012/oct/29/exporting-understanding-overseas-customers-markets\" title=\"\">here.</a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Last week, Costa Coffee announced that, in the face of huge opposition from the community and traders of the Devon town of Totnes, the UK's first <a href=\"http://www.transitiontowntotnes.org/\" title=\"\">transition town</a>, and in spite of being granted planning permission, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/costa-coffee-totnes-outlet-protests\" title=\"\">they would not be opening after all</a>. It was a much-celebrated decision, one for which they deserve real credit.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/15/totnes-war-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">campaign in Totnes</a> focused around arguments that the town has a unique high street economy, characterised by the absence of the \"Clone Town Britain\" phenomenon seen in so many other places, and a prevalence of independent businesses which, for many other parts of the UK, is but a distant memory. It was argued that the community's economic resilience lies in diversity and local markets, not in long supply chains and distant, remote ownership.</p> <p>Costa claimed that their store would \"add to the vibrancy of the town\", adding to the choice already on offer. But if Totnes already has 41 places that sell coffee, almost all independently owned and already quite \"vibrant\" enough thank you very much, what does \"choice\" mean in this context? It is this question of \"choice\", and how the word can be used or abused, that I want to explore here.</p> <p>\"Choice\" is one of those motherhood-and-apple-pie words which can surely only be a good thing, can't it? We all love \"choice\". It is, of course, ultimately your choice whether you buy your coffee from an independent local business or a chain such as Costa. But would opening a chain in a local economy introduce more choice, or ultimately lead to less? Would it lead to job creation, or to greater job losses, to job displacement? Would the chain support the local bakers, farmers and services that enable more money to cycle locally and give a local economy its robustness?</p> <p>Last year's <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bis.gov.uk%2Fassets%2Fbiscore%2Fbusiness-sectors%2Fdocs%2Fp%2F11-1434-portas-review-future-of-high-streets&amp;ei=pLqSUI_nO8izhAfg54HYBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkHjxHtOttWfsaNP7YQPd1kGS2Og&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Portas review</a> identified that, between 2001 and 2011, the number of off-licences and tobacconists fell by more than 50% and food specialists by 30%, while the number of superstores grew by 35%, to a point now where 8,000 supermarket outlets now account for over 97% of total grocery sales in the UK. Our obsession with \"choice\", or what is presented to us as that, has actually narrowed our choices hugely. Costa or Starbucks? Tesco or Asda? Apple or Microsoft?</p> <p>Costa proudly declares that it pays the full 25% corporation tax, unlike certain coffee chains we could mention. But with many independents, such as book shops, being undercut by huge chains with questionable tax arrangements, once again the question of which offers more \"choice\", in the wider sense, arises. And choice for whom?</p> <p>In 2009, Slaithwaite in Yorkshire, also a <a href=\"http://www.mastt.org.uk/\" title=\"\">transition initiative</a>, opened the \"<a href=\"http://www.slaithwaite.coop/\" title=\"\">Green Valley Grocer</a>\", a thriving co-operative community greengrocer, funded by community shares, selling fresh produce, some of it grown by another co-operative set up to supply the shop, and aiming to source 50% of what it sells within 30 miles by 2015. Recently, Morrisons have announced plans for a huge store in a former mill building nearby. Which ultimately adds the most choice \u2013 and resilience \u2013 to the economy of Slaithwaite?</p> <p>Choices come with consequences, however hard we may wish that was not so. Surely it should be our choice if we want a high street resilient to predatory markets and remote corporations? It is the reweaving of local food webs, community-owned enterprises, a culture of entrepreneurship focused around community resilience that, in the long term, truly offers choice, rather than the no-holds-barred dash for economic growth at all costs that is currently being forced upon us. It is this choice that the people of Totnes have wrestled back, creatively, imaginatively, but firmly.</p>",
  "<p>The London mayor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a>, has attacked a major inquiry into airport expansion as too slow just hours before it is due to be launched.</p> <p>Johnson said the inquiry, headed by the former Financial Services Authority boss Sir Howard Davies, should not even consider a third runway at Heathrow, which he said would be \"a complete disaster for the people of London\".</p> <p>The mayor, who has become more adamant in his opposition to a third runway, said it would be toxic for the Davies commission to report after the general election in 2015 adding that it represented a \"policy of utter inertia\".</p> <p>\"Its going to be toxic and disastrous to go into the election of 2015 with Heathrow runway three still on the agenda,\" he <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9765000/9765927.stm\" title=\"\">told the BBC's Today programme</a>, adding that the commission should not even consider a third runway because it would simply be a short-term solution to a long-term problem.</p> <p>\"As soon as that runway came on stream, you would not only be aggravating the nuisance for \u2026 millions of other Londoners, you would immediately find you would need to build a fourth runway.\"</p> <p>Davies's task is to bring out an interim report by the end of 2013 and then a full report in summer 2015 \u2013 after the next general election.</p> <p>Airlines and airport operators are pushing for more capacity, particularly in the south-east. But unanimity about just how to achieve this is in short supply, with Johnson backing a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/thames-estuary-airport\" title=\"\">Thames estuary airport</a> and others preferring to see expansion at Heathrow or at one of the other major airports.</p> <p>\"What you can't do, and what is completely wrong for this country, is to continue to put a quart into a pint pot, continue to expand Heathrow, put a third runway then a fourth runway and inflict more and more misery on the people of west London and expect that to count as a long-term solution to the infrastructure needs of this country. This is really, really desperately bad economics,\" Johnson said.</p> <p>London's mayor also suggested that the review would not be reasonable or impartial: \"I think there's every possibility that the government under the pressure from business will come up with what they think is the best short-term solution.\"</p> <p>The former Tory cabinet minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/heseltine-report-blasts-coalition-growth\" title=\"\">Lord Heseltine has also been critical of the government</a>, saying this week that he would like to see more progress on airports and other big infrastructure problems.</p> <p>Expansion at the airport is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/heathrow-battle-third-runway-ministers\" title=\"\">fraught with political sensitivity</a>, with widespread opposition in west London and the Liberal Democrats firmly against it.</p> <p>The Tory MP for Richmond Park and a former green adviser to Cameron, Zac Goldsmith, said he would<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/03/george-osborne-runway-plan-attacked\" title=\"\"> quit his seat</a> if Cameron reversed his opposition to a third runway. He has described a U-turn on the issue as an \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/07/third-runway-heathrow-betrayal\" title=\"\">off-the-scale betrayal</a>\".</p> <p>Davies was appointed in September after Patrick McLoughlin took over as transport secretary from Justine Greening. Greening, who represents Putney in south-west London, was also firmly opposed to a third runway at Heathrow and her move to international development during a recent government reshuffle was seen by some as reopening the door to Heathrow expansion after it was ruled out at the last election.</p> <p>Lady Valentine of the business lobby group <a href=\"http://londonfirst.co.uk/\" title=\"\">London First</a> told the BBC she was \"frustrated by 50 years of prevarication\" over the issue.</p> <p>\"Pragmatically we have to welcome the commission as a once-in-a-generation change to get cross-party consensus around some rational and independent evaluation of the options.\"</p> <p>Valentine acknowledged that Heathrow expansion would increase noise pollution but added that it would be \"bizarre not to consider our existing international airport as one of the options\".</p>",
  "<p>Standing opposite Singapore, across the strait of Johor, is the site of a new project that its architects and developers hope will be the future of urban life in south-east Asia \u2013 a mega-city built along eco-friendly lines, with green energy and an end to the pollution that afflicts so many of Asia's cities.</p> <p>Occupying an area the size of Luxembourg, the site is expected to have a population of 3 million by 2025, living as an ultra-modern \"smart metropolis\".

The plans are for a city that not only incorporates the latest in environmentally friendly technology, but that is designed for social integration.

Skyscrapers will be mixed with low-rise buildings and small self-contained \"neighbourhoods\".</p> <p>Najib Razak, prime minister of Malaysia, said in a speech: \"Iskandar Malaysia [is] a smart city template \u2013 protecting the environment, promoting equitable development and addressing urban development challenges [through] the creation of smart, liveable urban communities that will yield an improved quality of life for thousands of citizens, with safer, cleaner, healthier, more affordable and more vibrant neighbourhoods, serviced by more efficient and accessible transportation systems \u2013 great destinations for businesses.\"</p> <p>Ellis Rubinstein, president of the New York Academy of Sciences, which is working on the \"edu-city\" university campus area, said it could be \"a model to countries needing to accommodate the social and economic needs of fast-rising populations and environmental challenges\".</p> <p>However, the project's developers will have to overcome significant obstacles.

  "<p>Think of computer game management simulations, and you usually think of aspirational jobs - or at least the things we dreamed of doing as kids. Theme parks, railroads, game development studios, farms \u2013 all have featured in this popular genre since it flourished in the '90s. But right now, there is something very different out there, something intriguing enough to attract over 10,000 players into its paid online alpha test. That something is <a href=\"http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/\">Prison Architect</a> and it may just be the most fascinating and troubling management title ever devised. </p> <p>Developed by UK studio Introversion, the game challenges players to build their own functioning jails, from a variety of components. Cells, canteens, exercise areas and even morgues all have to be constructed to keep the ever-growing inmate population healthy, if not exactly happy. There's a sandbox mode where the aim is simply to keep constructing and modifying the facility, but in the campaign mode, there's a series of story-driven chapters where you have specific objectives based around a range of characters. And these look like they're going to be pretty dark.</p> <p>\"The idea came from a holiday in California with my wife,\" explains designer and programmer Chris Delay. \"We were going around Alcatraz, and it had a really nice audio guide with all these atmospheric stories. There was also a guide demonstrating the doors - cranking these enormous levers. It's all pre-electronics, it's a purely mechanical, gear-based system and it gives it this amazing sound. I was really geeking out over this stuff. I felt that I wanted to make a game based on prisons that had really elaborate mechanics and complex AI - very much presented in the style of classic Bullfrog management games like Dungeon Keeper with a British sense of humour to it\".</p> <p>The gameplay structure is based around Maslow's hierarchy of needs \u2013 prisoners need basic care to begin with but will become more demanding as standards increase. \"It's like a pyramid that starts with food and sleep,\" says Delay. \"If these are not satisfied they override all the other needs above. The next level is safety, the next is social, and each level is harder to get to, especially in a prison where you don't have freedom of movement. That model underpins the inmates' lives and drives them through the day - they do their best to satisfy their needs, depending on where they're allowed to go at that particular time \u2013 so if they're dying for a shower and it's not shower time they get more and more angry\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398737084\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351803624669/PA2_riot.png\" alt=\"Prison Architect\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>And of course, what you don't want is a prison full of furious and frustrated criminals, because that means only one thing. \"Yes riots can kick off,\" says Delay. \"It happens when some angry prisoners successfully 'capture' their zone, which entails defeating the guards in the area.&nbsp; They then take the guards' weapon and keys, unlock all the cell doors to let the other prisoners out, and barricade themselves in.&nbsp; They can be incredibly destructive.&nbsp; Your staff will fall back and even your guards will refuse to go into the lost zone, because it's just too dangerous.&nbsp; You have to use Riot Police to retake the zone by force\".</p> <p>In effect, then, the game is has a classic management sim objective: keep the punters happy. Except these punters won't just wander disillusioned out of your sim construction when it fails to meet their approval, they'll burn it down. Furthermore, whereas in titles like Theme Park it's pretty easy to spread joy on a micro level, running a prison is all about controlling the masses. </p> <p>\"Every prisoner has their AI running - but from a player's point of view you can't really make decisions based on individual inmates,\" says Delay. \"You may have 100 inmates so you need to look at the whole society of your prison - if half the prisoners want a shower then you might improve the washing facilities to make them more efficient. After that, you can you start thinking about the next level, which is physical health, exercise and well-being. And once you start talking about really high level leftwing concepts like education and rehabilitation, these are really hard to get to because everything underneath has to be taken care of. You can build a school in the middle of the prison but if everyone is starving or scared that they're going to be shanked, they won't get anything out of it.\"</p> <p>Although there's a streak of humour running through the game with its teeny thugs wandering the corridors cutely battering each other, Prison Architect also tackles the complex ethics of punishment and incarceration. Players will need to decide on the morality of their institution - will it be an impressing citadel of punishment or an idyll of correction and rehabilitation? The right answer seems to be the latter, but Introversion is keen to ensure that there really is no right answer in this complex arena.</p> <p>\"We don't really want you to be able to build a leftwing utopian paradise and have it work seamlessly,\" says the studio's MD, Mark Morris. \"For example, if you put pay phones in, you're meeting the needs of prisoners who want to contact loved ones. However, there are others who'll use them to phone up for getaway cars, or arrange drug drops. Some prisoners will always abuse the facilities - and where that line is drawn is what I find most interesting. If you've been sent down for 20 years, being able to call your mum and dad isn't really going to have that much effect. The player needs to feel they have agency in the world, and we have embryonic ideas on how we'll be able to communicate all this. You should be able to build a rightwing hell-hole or a liberal paradise but neither will entirely work - that would be a fantasy\". </p> <p>The story mode, which has the player working as a private prison contractor, will also explore the morality of running these facilities. In one mission, you're required to build an execution chamber to deal with a death row inmate - but while you do that, the game reveals the backstory of the prisoner, casting questions on his guilt. \"I love playing with that quite dark idea of whether you can separate yourself from the reality of what you're doing,\" says Delay. \"There are lots of other games where you're just building roller coasters and stuff - they're just facilities. This is a building for an execution: does that change anything? The mean part of me likes putting players in that slightly uncomfortable position and then pushing it further\".</p> <p>These sorts of dilemmas become somehow more complex in the sandbox mode, where players are driven, not by a linear narrative that demands acquiescence, but by the desire to succeed. Can we view the construction of an execution chamber in the same way we'd view the building of a ferris wheel in Theme Park? Are these just virtual game pieces? \"You'll probably be paid more for taking in a death row prisoner,\" says Morris. \"You'll have to ask yourself whether you're comfortable with that or not. We've really highlighted that moral decision. The next time you play through you may well have a prison full of execution chambers - a killing factory. People do that -they explore the different elements. If you just said to players, 'are you going to put in an execution chamber - yes or no' there's no moral context; you've done nothing to remind them what it means to kill someone. You're not just killing a little sprite, you're killing a character who you're not entirely convinced deserves to die\". </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the team has had to carry out extensive research into prison construction and management. \"There are some fascinating architects' bibles about the exact amount of light you get through roof and the effect it has on people,\" says Delay. \"There are rules on how big the slit in a cell wall needs to be; actual EU regulations! That's all very interesting to me. I mean, how do they decide that?\"</p> <p>But even if everything is based on scrupulous research, was there a worry about creating a game based around such an emotive and controversial subject? \"Yes,\" answers Delay, simply. \"And we realised a while ago that we were quite out of our depth. We had one of those panic moments as game designers\" oh crap, we're dealing with this incredibly contentious topic on which a lot of people in the world hold very strong opinions. And we're in a slightly isolated environment where we don't really see prisons in the same way as somebody living in America might do\".</p> <p>America seems to have figured highly in the team's thinking. They tell me about Ca\u00f1on City in Colorado, home to 13 prisons including the Supermax facility, containing some of the country's most dangerous convicts. This is an area of 36,000 people, the nearby town mostly inhabited by prisoner and guard families, the economy relying on the facilities like a industrial city. Introversion has immersed itself in all this, studying the award-winning web documentary, <a href=\"http://prisonvalley.arte.tv/?lang=en\">Prison Valley</a>, which analyses the town and its populace.</p> <p>\"We started talking to some ex-prisoners and ex-prison staff, some very interesting characters - we can't tell you who yet,\" says Delay. \"We want them to let us know if anything in the game is totally ridiculous. For example, we've been looking into escape tunnels, which from a gameplay point of view make total sense; you get prisoners trying to escape, they leave little clues about what's happening and you have to think about a shield to prevent them. But in reality, nobody tunnels out of their cell! It's not realistic, but we're trying to find a line - the place where the gameplay mechanics and the real world implications meet is where it's most interesting. I mean, do you start thinking that you need sniper towers around the parameter, turning the place into a hellhole just because one guy decides to tunnel?\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398737085\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351803695556/PA1.png\" alt=\"Prison Architect\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In early October, Introversion made an alpha version of the game available online. Players could pay $30 to download it or a series of higher payments to get the game plus bonus items. It's a model that combines the Kickstarter perks model with the roll-out of Mojang's hugely successful building sim Minecraft. And it turned out to be an incredibly good idea. \"In our first four weeks over 10,000 people have bought our alpha, generating about $360,000,\" says Delay. \"We never expected this level of response, and it's hugely exciting to be at the helm of such a big following. Before we launched the alpha we agreed we'd be happy with a couple of hundred sales in the first day and maybe a thousand by the end of the first month, so this is way in excess of what we expected\".</p> <p>This being an alpha (i.e. incomplete) release, Introversion has been able to update the game based on feedback. \"We polled our community for most requested feature, and the current top rated option is the ability to Zone your prison into wings,\" explains Delay.&nbsp; \"So you could set up one areas as Zone A, and prisoners in those cells are only allowed to stay in Zone A, they have to eat and shower there, too.&nbsp; Using that feature you can divide up your prison into self-contained areas, and this paves the way for different types of prisoners like Max Sec.&nbsp;We changed direction a fair amount because none of this was particularly high priority for us until we saw how much people wanted it\".</p> <p>At the moment, players are able to share their best prison maps online with other fans, but there's no multiplayer: \"I'd love to have it,\" says Morris. \" But we need to have the game out there and working\". The game is currently PC and Mac only, and eventually Steam distribution is likely. There's also talk of a tablet version further down the line, but a console version is\u2026 well\u2026 unlikely. As a company, Introversion was almost ruined when it tried to port its cult classic Darwinia to Xbox Live, a four-year process that cost tens of thousands of pounds and brought in few sales. </p> <p>And it's not necessary. Despite the fact that running a prison is hardly something we all dream of, there is clearly plenty of curiosity out there. \"We have a really active community already, and we are polling them to find out what features they most want to see,\" says Delay. \"We've got people suggesting crazy stuff like all-female prisons, guard dogs that can be distracted by bacon, all kinds of stuff.&nbsp; The general feedback is that our fans love the game they are playing already and are almost as excited as we are about the new features coming!\"</p>",
  "<p>It is prudent to take the work of future-gazers with a pinch of salt. Even if you're an expert it's easy to get it wrong: in 1943 the chair of IBM, Thomas Watson, <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pogue-all-time-worst-tech-predictions\" title=\"\">famously declared</a> that there was \"a world market for maybe five computers\". He passed away in the 1950s, so never lived to cringe at his gross miscalculation over the speed of social change.</p> <p>Nevertheless <a href=\"http://www.orbit.org.uk/main.cfm?type=NI&amp;objectid=2829\" title=\"\">this week's report from Orbit Group</a>, which looks ahead to the social, political and financial environment in 2020, makes interesting reading. The housing providers asked seven academics to reflect on this turbulent decade and help chief executives and their teams plan for a sustainable future for housing.</p> <p>It makes stark, sometimes quite shocking, reading. Among the socio-economic trends the group anticipates are:</p> <p>\u2022 Slow economic growth, with a slowing in both demand and supply within housing. National growth is likely to remain between 2.25% at best, and just 1.5% at worst.</p> <p>\u2022 A general election in 2015 is unlikely to alter the direction of policy, with a majority Labour government only taking \"the rougher edges off the current approach\".</p> <p>\u2022 A volatile and unstable political system, with a democratic gap emerging due to voter alienation.</p> <p>\u2022 Stronger political competition around public service reform.</p> <p>\u2022 Living standards will not recover by the end of the decade, with high unemployment persisting.</p> <p>\u2022 75% of the reduction in the national deficit drawn from cuts to public spending</p> <p>\u2022 Relative and absolute child poverty will be higher at the end of the decade, though pensioner poverty will fall, with the \"real prospect\" of being eliminated by 2020.</p> <p>\u2022 Differences between the costs of social and private housing will increase.</p> <p>At first glance it's a relatively negative vision of the years ahead and one which makes it difficult for housing associations to prepare. As Gerry Stoker, professor of politics and governance at the University of Southampton, warns: \"The scale of the recession as so prolonged in its austerity that ad hoc response rather than strategic choice will be the only option available in most localities.\"</p> <p>But there are also some important trends for housing providers. Tenants will be poorer than they are today \u2013 particularly those with children \u2013 which will have a knock-on effect on their ability to pay rent. Social rent will be in greater demand. But will it be less attractive?</p> <p>The likely convergence between the offer of for-profit and social landlords, which will happen as both sectors try to move into the gaps that are left by a shrinking public sector and slashed funds for housing and communities, could reduce the perceived advantages of social renting. Providers may become \"indistinguishable\", the report concludes.</p> <p>To deal with the political vacuum created by democratic turbulance, housing associations may need to become more focused on values as well as economic efficiency, and lead on local democracy (localism in action, perhaps?) rather than treating all tenants as simple consumers.</p> <p>These cultural shifts also offer a chance for housing associations to reshape their businesses. Flexible tenures, private rent, \"super shared ownership\" where tenants are able to purchase very small stakes in a property, and buy-back guarantees for low-income shared owners are all examples of healthy adaptations to an economy in flux.</p> <p>In future, local authorities will need support to meet their community's needs. This provides new opportunities for housing to offer new services to tenants: childcare, welfare support, employment and debt advice (of course many are already doing this today).</p> <p>There are some tough decisions for housing leaders to make between now and 2015, let alone in the latter half of the decade. Speaking at the launch of Orbit's report in Westminster this week, Lord Best cautioned the gathered housing staff to avoid the temptation of becoming more like private-sector businesses in the rush for stability. Your ethos is your strength, he told them.</p> <p>The report makes interesting reading, but it doesn't contain all the answers. To be smart, housing providers should take these lessons on board but be willing to adapt year by year. It is impossible to predict all our future successes. After all, at the 2004 World Economic Forum, <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pogue-all-time-worst-tech-predictions\" title=\"\">Bill Gates said</a>: \"Two years from now, spam will be solved.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and the latest career opportunities</strong></p>",
  "<p>My days start at 6am so I can jump in the shower \u2013 and have one in peace \u2013 before my son wakes at 6.30am. Our morning routine is well rehearsed to try and ensure it runs as smoothly as possible before my 'work day' begins.</p> <p>I work for the multisystemic therapy team. Multisystemic therapy (MST) was developed by the Family Services Research Centre at the Medical University of South Carolina to address the multiple sources of anti-social and criminal behaviour in young people.</p> <p>The intensive, family and community based treatment helps high-risk young people modify their conduct or emotional problems.</p> <p>A therapist works with the family or carers to identify and reduce unacceptable behaviour and to support positive change. MST primarily involves the young person's parents or carers but also their teachers, peers and other professionals \u2013 including social workers, youth offending workers and the police.</p> <p>I head straight to a school meeting which starts at 8am. I meet with the deputy head teacher of the local school. We have 30 minutes to discuss the current barriers; his aggressive behaviour towards staff and pupils, inability to take responsibility for his actions or utilise the support systems in place at school to calm him down when he is angry.</p> <p>Together we outline a plan for the school to try and maintain his placement and consider ways MST and the family can support this plan based on the strategies and strengths of the family which have worked in the past.</p> <p>The young person arrives with his older brother and sister, both extremely supportive of the school and agree a way forward. The young person's mother has mental health needs and it is agreed his brother and sister will act as the link between home and school for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>I'm running late (as usual) although I manage to make it to the next meeting with 10 minutes to spare. This young person is again struggling within the school environment due to different reasons. Mum arrives prepared with her agenda, we talk through any worries she has regarding the meeting and formulate a plan if her daughter needs sometime to compose herself.</p> <p>I grab my lunch on the move. This is quite typical, some parents may only have time to see us during their lunch break or teachers squeeze us in when they have a break to avoid disrupting teaching time.</p> <p>Within this job, we are fortunate to have a maximum of six families we work with at any one time, this allows us to work around the other agencies and families' time commitments although this can result in long days, especially if you need to see families in the evenings after they have finished work.</p> <p>I previously worked as a senior social worker and was able to use MST with the most complex families on my caseload to help young people remain at home with their parents or carers. When a new MST team was being started within my local area, I was extremely keen to apply due to the successful outcomes I had previously observed.</p> <p>Onto my final visit. The family have arranged a 'family meeting' with mum, dad, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins whom are all keen to support their daughter, granddaughter and cousin to making positive changes.</p> <p>The young person was involved in two house burglaries, smoked cannabis everyday, didn't attend school, had physically assaulted her mum and wasn't attending any structured positive activities. The family have arranged transport to school, her auntie is taking her dancing each week, she is swimming twice a week with cousins and a safety plan has been put in place to reduce the risk of mum being assaulted. Together they have agreed to support their daughter through this difficult time, a really positive piece of work by the family.</p> <p>I head home and promptly write up the minutes and notes from today's meeting and sessions. My partner puts our bundle of joy to bed and I head back to the laptop to write another closure report. It's an exciting time as I know I will soon be working with a new family which will have new challenges, new barriers and new strengths to work with.</p> <p><em>If you would like to be feature in our 'Day in the life of ...' series \u2013 or know someone who would \u2013 then you can let us know by</em><a href=\"mailto:jessica.fuhl@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em> emailing us</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Why not join our community?

  "<p>My worry, as the high-level panel on post-2015 development goals meets this week, is that my voice \u2013 and those of many others working at the sharp end of development \u2013 won't ultimately have much influence.</p> <p>Every day, thousands of community health workers, voluntary groups, teachers, entrepreneurs and civil servants engage in development activities in their own communities. They're hands on, responding to the needs of their communities \u2013 sometimes with the assistance of NGOs and donors, sometimes not. They know what works, because they're out there doing it; and they know what doesn't work, because they've seen it fail.</p> <p>There's a real danger that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/24/un-panel-development-goals-ambitious-timetable\" title=\"\">the post-2015 process</a> \u2013 though inspired by the same noble aims as the millennium development goals (MDGs) \u2013 will also share their failings. That is to say, they'll be a set of goals and targets created by distant elites, and they'll treat people as passive recipients of aid and development. Yet people are tired of being told what they need.</p> <p>I'm not saying the MDGs have brought no benefits. They have focused attention and funding on important areas. Working in midwifery in Sierra Leone, <a href=\"http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241500265_eng.pdf\" title=\"\">where one in eight women still dies during pregnancy or childbirth</a> (pdf) and thousands more bleed to death after giving birth, I'm all too aware of the focus on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-maternal-health\" title=\"\">reducing maternal mortality and the impact MDG five</a> has had. Yet every day I work with nurses training to be midwives, and they don't know what the MDGs mean for their work. To them the goals are distant targets, far removed from the daily realities faced by a midwife in a developing country.</p> <p>My midwifery school in Makeni trains community health nurses to become midwives, responding to the appalling lack of trained birth attendants in Sierra Leone. Previously, only state registered nurses could train to be midwives. Many would undertake further training and enter other fields, leaving us still short of practising midwives. Our aim is to train new midwives who remain in their communities \u2013 particularly in rural areas \u2013 helping women to give birth safely. This year, another 69 students graduated and are doing just that.</p> <p>Sierra Leone has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/17/traditional-birth-attendants-sierra-leone\" title=\"\">a shortage of midwives in rural areas</a>. The problem is compounded by a lack of support for the childbirth assistants who do serve rural communities, who often have to leave their families behind in towns and cities to work in areas hard to access by road. Thus isolated, they have difficulty caring for, educating and \u2013 because they are based in distant villages with no mobile reception \u2013 even communicating with their own children. They often struggle to find somewhere to live, and have to manage without regular electricity and running water. It's little wonder some leave the profession or try to get work closer to home, once more leaving the community they served without a midwife.</p> <p>Birth assistants working in maternity wards and communities don't need another system that replaces MDG five, creates a whole new layer of bureaucracy, and forces donors and governments to rethink their priorities. Particularly not one based on a document that comes out of London or New York. We need a framework that recognises the good work that's already happening in our poorest communities, and focuses on supporting and enhancing it.</p> <p>We also need to be empowered to hold governments to account on these targets. When it comes to maternal health, leaders should be accountable to the women who are risking their lives just by having a baby. Poor and marginalised communities must have a say in measuring whether poverty-reduction measures are working. And we need specific goals and targets to tackle the inequality faced by women, who are excluded from so many of the decision-making processes that affect their lives.</p> <p>In my country it is, slowly, getting safer for women to give birth. As I watched new midwives graduate this year, I could see the progress we are making. The MDGs have certainly played a part, and whatever comes after them has the potential to achieve much, much more. But to avoid squandering that potential, the panel must remember three things.</p> <p>First, they must listen to people actively engaged in development in their own communities, ensuring those people are genuinely able to influence the post-2015 development framework, so that it supports the work they're doing.</p> <p>Second, they must build on what has already been achieved. Don't tear up the MDGs and start again, and don't create new international commitments where they already exist. Instead, strengthen and implement what we already have.</p> <p>Third, we need to find better ways to ensure governments are accountable to people living in poverty, and to the people actively working in poor and marginalised communities.</p> <p>It's these points that I will make when I address the panel on Friday. If they are serious about tackling poverty, and I hope they are, they will need to listen to the thousands of people already actively engaged in development, and work together with them.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Francess Fornah is based at </em><a href=\"http://www.kingshealthpartners.org/\" title=\"\"><em>King's Health Partners</em></a><em> in London as part of a three-month commonwealth fellowship placement organised by </em><a href=\"http://www.vso.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>VSO</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Kostas Vaxevanis hates being the centre of attention. On Thursday moments before taking the stand in one of the most sensational trials to grip Greece in modern times, the journalist said he was not in the business of making news. \"My job is simply to tell the news and tell it straight,\" he averred. \"My job is to tell the truth.\"</p> <p>Truth in the case of Vaxevanis has been a rollercoaster that has catapulted the 46-year-old from relative obscurity to global stardom in a matter of days. But , after a hearing that lasted almost 12 hours \u2013 with a three-member panel of judges sitting stony-faced throughout, he was vindicated: the court found him not guilty of breaking data privacy laws by publishing the names in Hot Doc, the weekly magazine he edits, of some 2,059 Greeks believed to have bank accounts in Switzerland.</p> <p>\"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed; everything else is public relations,\" Vaxevanis said, citing George Orwell, before observers packed into the crammed courtroom broke into applause. \"As such it was my duty to reveal this list.\"</p> <p>Even before Thursday's court drama \u2013 proceedings that veered from comic to tragic as handcuffed Asian migrants looked on in bewilderment \u2013 the nation was up in arms over the list.</p> <p>In the two years since it had been handed to Greek authorities by the IMF's chief Christine Lagarde, the infamous tally of suspected tax evaders had caught the popular imagination. With tax avoidance widely blamed for the debt-stricken country's inability to balance the books, the failure of successive governments to act on the list and crack down on tax evaders had raised suspicions that corrupt vested interests ran to the top of society.</p> <p>\"It is quite clear the political system did everything not to publish this list,\" said Vaxevanis, who had faced up to two years in jail and a \u20ac30,000 fine (\u00a324,000) if convicted.</p> <p>\"If you look at the names, or the offshore companies linked to certain individuals, you see that these are all friends of those in power. Phoney lists had also begun to circulate. It was time for the truth,\" he told the Guardian during a recess.</p> <p>\"We live in a country where, on the one hand, tax evasion is rampant and, on the other, people are eating out of rubbish trucks because of salary cuts, because they can't make ends meet.\"</p> <p>Three years after Europe's worst crisis in decades erupted in Athens, Vaxevanis has emerged as an unwitting crusader \u2013 a defender of truth in an environment ever more electrified by the perceived menaces of malfeasance and mendacity.</p> <p>Five days after a public prosecutor ordered his arrest \u2013 dispatching special agents to seize the journalist in a nation whose justice system has almost never moved with such alacrity \u2013 there are few who do not agree that his trial has been \"politically motivated\". For defence witnesses such as the popular singer Dimitra Galani, bringing Vaxevanis before the court was proof that even press freedom was now at risk in the birthplace of democracy. \"The whole thing is absurd, the theatre of the absurd. Greeks really don't know what to think anymore,\" she said.</p> <p>For veteran leftists such as Nikos Kostantopouloulos, one of the reporter's three lawyers, the affair was further evidence that the country at the centre of the continent's debt drama was falling down a very slippery slope. \"We have a schizophrenic situation where, on the one hand, a journalist is being penalised for revealing a document in the interests of informing public opinion and, on the other, the parliament itself is now saying the handling of the list should be investigated.\"</p> <p>From the outset, said Kostantopouloulos, a former leftist politician, the case had defied the principles of justice.</p> <p>\"Right down to the way the prosecutor so hastily issued the charge sheet without even bothering to stamp it, it has been handled very badly,\" he said. \"Furthermore, none of those on the list have even filed a complaint about privacy violation.\"</p> <p>With ordinary Greeks hammered by a fifth year of recession, the case has ignited widespread fury. The list, reprinted on Monday by the leading daily Ta Nea, includes politicians, businessmen, shipping magnates, doctors, lawyers \u2013 a far cry from those who have borne the brunt of relentless austerity measures on the margins of society.</p> <p>\"While we have been paying our taxes, some out there have been stashing their loot away in Switzerland, not being taxed at all,\" said Petros Hadzopoulos, a retiree, who had come to the court to get a glance of the journalist he called \"his new, best hero\". Hot Doc, which normally has a circulation of about 25,000, sold 100,000 last week.</p> <p>As Athens teeters once again on the brink of bankruptcy \u2013 its public coffers set to run dry in less than a month \u2013 Vaxevanis's arrest has highlighted the pitfalls of press freedom in a nation where this week alone two anchors on state television were also fired for publicly \"undermining\" a minister.</p> <p>The presenters' \"crime\" had been to question the failure of the public order minister Nikos Dendias to act on a threat to sue the Guardian for publishing a story alleging police torture of protesters that he said had \"defamed Greek democracy\".</p> <p>For those packed into the chamber it was clear that in the birthplace of freedom, democracy itself was at stake. Yesterday's often shambolic proceedings, which frequently saw the panel's presiding female magistrate thumping the bench as she demanded \"silence\" under an icon of Jesus Christ, included court-appointed interpreters being unable to translate with one confusing friend for French and absurd with illegal.</p> <p>\"I am very pained to have to be here in Greece the mother of democracy explaining the obvious,\" said Jim Boumela, who, as president of the International Federation of Journalists, flew in from London to testify at the trial.</p> <p>\"This is what I have to do in countries like Uganda,\" he said. \"Kostas should be applauded for what he has done. It's a very worrying turn that journalists are being suppressed in Greece \u2013 and I think we are going to see more of it.\"</p> <h2><strong>HMRC scours list</strong></h2> <p>More than 500 individuals on the so-called \"Lagarde list\" of suspected tax evaders with secret bank accounts in Switzerland have been, or are currently, under investigation by UK Revenue and Customs for serious fraud.</p> <p>Tax investigators are still working their way through the 6,000 names on the list, two and a half years after it was handed over to the UK by then French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, who also passed versions to other European members states, including Greece.</p> <p>While HMRC said its handling of the data was \"a major success\" and expected to recover hundreds of millions of unpaid taxes, only one person has been successfully prosecuted so far. The long-standing HMRC policy of reaching settlements and imposing penalties mean that the vast majority of those on the list are unlikely to be prosecuted or named as a result. <strong>Ben Quinn</strong></p>",
  "<p>The UK must brace itself for a high likelihood of winter floods, the Met Office and the government's flooding watchdog have warned.</p> <p>Saturated ground around the country, and high river and groundwater levels from the wet summer, will mean that much less rainfall than usual is needed to top up water levels and cause severe flooding, according to the Environment Agency.</p> <p>There is now a significantly higher risk of flooding this autumn and winter, even with small amounts of rain, so households have been advised to check warnings for their area. One in six homes is at some risk of flooding.</p> <p>Sarah Jackson, of the Met Office, said: \"We are heading into the winter period which is traditionally the wetter period of the year in the UK. Because the ground is so wet, if we do have any prolonged heavy rainfall in any part of the country, there is going to be heightened risk of flooding.\"</p> <p>Any severe flooding this winter will also raise questions over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt\" title=\"\">government's cuts to some proposed new flood defences</a>, some of which are now being abandoned or scaled back. Insurers have warned that they may end their long-standing agreement to provide all UK homes with flood cover. If they do so, some people will find themselves in uninsurable homes.</p> <p>Experts singled out Devon, Dorset and Hampshire in the south as being particularly at risk, because of high groundwater levels, while in the north of England and Wales the risk has been heightened from recent heavy rainfall. In the south-west, the main threat will be from rivers, especially this month and next.</p> <p>Coastal areas are braced for high spring tides occurring in the middle of this month and from 12 to 18 December.</p> <p>Paul Mustow, head of flood incident management at the Environment Agency, urged people to take action against \"the UK's number one natural hazard\". He advised: \"The most important step people can take in protecting themselves from the worst impacts is to find out if they are at risk, and sign up to our free flood warnings service.\" More than a million people are currently signed up.</p> <p>One question that the Met Office researchers are now working on is whether the unusually grim weather this year was the result of global warming. For six years in a row, the UK has suffered unusually wet summers with less sunlight than normal. This has been largely owing to the positioning of the \"jet stream\", a northern latitudes weather system that usually brings periods of settled weather to UK summers but for several years has been changing position, resulting in the opposite.</p> <p>Some experts think the positioning of the weather system has been affected by the melting Arctic. This year, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">Arctic ice reached the lowest extent ever recorded</a>, and there was more widespread melting of the Greenland ice sheet than seen before.</p> <p>The Environment Agency said households and businesses should check their flood risk and sign up to receive free flood warnings at <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood\" title=\"\">www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood</a>.</p>"
