[
  "<p>Football, which has always been weird, seemed to get just a little bit weirder in the dog days of the Premier League transfer window. Perhaps the strangest moment of a slightly fretful summer arrived this week with the news that Manchester City, the richest club in the world, had signed 1990s goalkeeping curiosity Richard Wright.</p> <p>This is a move that seems not so much surprising as unsettling, the kind of transfer that might happen in a slightly confusing dream. In the case of Wright to City it is as though some kind of basic category mistake has been made, like catching a glimpse of a dog wearing a hat, or hearing someone describe in great detail what the colour red smells like, a mid-range Premier League goalkeeping version of that moment in the 1980s when the aged Let's Dance-era David Bowie reappeared suddenly at the top of the charts pretending to be a regular guy who wears chinos and sings pop songs, but resembling to the child weaned on Wham! and Duran Duran a frightening alien robot-lizard disguised as a country estate agent.</p> <p>This is not to denigrate the very talented Wright, who seemed for a long time all set to leap into the bovine void left by the delayed retirement of David Seaman at Arsenal. If he now seems less an actual goalkeeper and more a kind of Shed Seven-listening, Tony Blair-high\u2011fiving, Millennium Bug-solving nostalgia item, this is no doubt related to the fact that after a productive start to his career he has averaged little more than 10 games a season over the past decade, most recently leaving Preston North End after five days at the club due to \"homesickness\".</p> <p>Plus he seems unshakeably associated with a very specific era in English goalkeeping, a generation of itchy, jumpy, pink-faced young men maddened to the point of distraction by the evolution of the keeper's role from shamefaced Gollum of last resort into a kind of spangle-shirted quarterback, the goalkeeper-athlete with his \"distribution\", his goal somersaults, his bargingly self-important sprints downfield.</p> <p>Goalkeepers of his era often seemed prone to calamitous strokes of ill fortune. Wright is remembered for the injury he sustained while warming up in a goalmouth after falling over a sign warning him of the dangers of warming up in the goalmouth. On his England debut he gave away two penalties, the first of which crossed the line after bouncing in off the back of his head. He also suffered a serious injury after falling out of his loft hatch at home, something I remember with a sense of distant kinship because I have also fallen out of my loft hatch and it is an unnerving experience, creating in that moment of freefall through the hatch a sense of having been betrayed on some basic level by the floor. Perhaps Wright, as he fell, also grabbed uselessly at a piece of yellow foam ceiling insulation, shredding it into horrible feathery strips and creating a mist of falling grit and fibres that stung his eyes and tickled his throat as he lay splayed on the carpet thinking: \"This exact same thing happened to that goalkeeper. Richard Wright.\"</p> <p>Wright is not the only unexpected new arrival this summer. Jack Rodwell is already providing a mini-Yaya presence in the revolving arm-wrestle of City's midfield. Rodwell remains a slightly confusing player, an almost-prodigy of wonderful semi-talent who looks fantastic and runs around nicely but doesn't seem to actually do anything you can put your finger on, performing most noticeably in the thrusting midfield run-hulk role or more defensively as a non-specific central trot-about, all the while harbouring ambitions of performing as a high spec central mooch-about. Scott Sinclair has also arrived from Swansea to provide occasional midweek jink-relief, and beyond that to reinforce the sense of City's money being spent rather frugally this summer, like the kind of cobwebbed ancestral millionaire who emerges every fortnight in yellowing tweeds and spends \u00a34,000 on cat food and candles.</p> <p>Of course all three have something else in common. They are English-reared, thereby assisting in the annual rejig required by Premier League rules on \"homegrown\" players. Before Wright City had seven in their likely first-team squad, one short of the required eight. From this perspective Wright's one-year contract is a deeply canny deadline-week investment, defusing at a stroke the need to panic-negotiate any last-minute bids for English players and perhaps, who knows, shaving a little off the Sinclair deal.</p> <p>Some have suggested City's low key signings are an indication of a fatal stodginess in the relationship between Brian Marwood and Roberto Mancini. By now they were supposed to have towed an iceberg into dock, cloned William Shakespeare, lassoed the sun, announced the immediate capture of the vast parmesan cheese deposits of Mars. Instead they have tinkered with the base-notes, adding depth and a little regulatory compliance. There is also, no doubt inadvertently, some tactical sense in this. In a market borne aloft on twice-yearly carbon dollar injections City have shied away from domestic bidding wars, trading at a net gain right up to the final day of the window, at which point spending was down 20% on the last three seasons. Intentionally or not, a form of tourniquet has been applied, with a summer of thriftiness \u2013 on the basis that the only thing that can compete with City's money is City's money \u2013 depriving the rest of the Premier League of that surging liquidity. Manchester United have bought well and Chelsea have their own resources but if City don't go shopping nobody's going shopping much these days.</p> <p>For now they have two fine young English players and the summer-oddity Wright, who may yet end up experiencing a dramatic late-career renaissance. But who at the very least perhaps deserves his own entry in the transfer lexicon as the Memorabilia Signing: a bargaining tool, a regulatory shemozzle, and another peculiar entry in the Premier League's own grand shark-eyed fiscal odyssey.</p>",
  "<p>In 2005, Lydia Cacho was approached by several police officers. They bundled her into a van and for the 20 hours it took to drive from Cancun in southern Mexico, where she lives, north to the city of Puebla she was, she says, \"tortured\". Sexual assault was threatened. A gun was pushed into her mouth. A sickening see-saw: \"I kept thinking one minute I was going to die, then that I would survive.\"</p> <p>When they arrived, a female guard told her she would be raped in jail. In fact, a network of friends, contacts and activists swung into action and she was bailed. Attempts on her life continued, and she has become well known as one of Mexico's bravest journalists. A recent estimate put the number killed there since 2006 at 67. Amid this, Cacho started work on her next book.</p> <p>This story tells you several things about Cacho and the world she works in: alleged corruption (tapes surfaced that appeared to show her arrest was orchestrated by a man she had written about, alleging he had connections to a paedophile ring), the vulnerability of Mexico's journalists, and that Cacho is not somebody who can be silenced. Her new book, Slavery Inc: the Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking, is about to be published in the UK. Although she has lived with death threats for years, she took the most recent one four weeks ago seriously enough to leave the country.</p> <p>On 29 July, she received a call on her satellite radio from a man who told her she was a \"fucking bitch\" who had ignored their warnings, concluding: \"We are going to send you home in pieces.\" \"The way they interfered with my radio, it had to be someone who had the power and the means,\" she says. \"Immediately I called some security experts, one here in London, and told them. They said to get out of the house immediately. I&#xa0;called my lawyers and they said the same thing, so I did. I just took my passport and a bag and got out of there.\"</p> <p>Is Cacho frightened? If the question is obvious, the answer isn't. She sits across the table in an office in central London, utterly composed, an occasional flicker of rage behind dark eyes. \"I think it's absurd,\" she says. \"I'm telling the truth, I'm a good journalist and I have to flee my country.\" Later she says: \"I don't scare easily.\" She has been offered asylum in several countries \u2013 not just on this occasion, but in the past \u2013 but has never wanted to take it. \"I like my country. [In Mexico] really good journalists are so badly needed. It's important. I&#xa0;want to be there to see the change.\"</p> <p>Is she prepared for how long she might have to stay away? A deep sigh. \"I want to go back home, everything is there \u2013 my house, my dogs. I'm trying to find out who did it and expose them, which is the only thing I can do to save my life.\" She thinks this threat is related to her book, in which she names men who she says are involved in sex trafficking in Mexico.</p> <p>She travels to some of the world's sex tourism centres to piece together her story on the thriving global sex trade, much of it told through the testimonies of women and children. She met children rescued from sex slavery in Cambodia and Guatemala. A North American woman who told her how her \"employers\" \u2013 she thought she would be working as a singer in a nightclub \u2013 confiscated her visa and plane ticket and over several days kept her prisoner in a hotel room where she was drugged and raped by dozens of men. A woman from Venezuela, who escaped her traffickers in Mexico, was able to identify numerous immigration officials either as clients or those who had facilitated the passage of girls flown into the country. Dressed as a nun in Mexico City \u2013 the only safe way, she decided, for a woman to walk its mafia-controlled areas \u2013 Cacho saw children working as prostitutes in motels.</p> <p>Finding figures for the number of people trafficked and enslaved is notoriously difficult; in 2005, the International Labour Organisation said 2.4 million at any one time are trafficked into forced labour, with at least 43% of these forced to work in the sex industry, but it's a conservative estimate. \"The point of the&#xa0;book was to understand how the international markets are connected,\" she says. \"As a reporter, I was really frustrated, because every time I&#xa0;interviewed an expert, everyone kept telling me they're not linked, that this isn't an international business. But it is.\"</p> <p>She was threatened throughout her research. \"In Bangkok, I stayed in very nice hotels because it was the way to see the rich European clients who bring girls or boys to the hotel. I would be sitting in the bar, and have my camera with me, and someone would always come over, a&#xa0;waiter, saying, 'Be careful, don't do that, you're a journalist, right?' In Cambodia, I had to flee a casino and hide in my hotel.\" She tried to barricade herself into her room with furniture. \"I thought it was clever.\" She laughs. \"And then I thought: 'This is stupid, they have guns and I just have a chair against the door.'\"</p> <p>Before she started the investigation, Cacho says she was open to the idea of legalising and regulating prostitution, and had listened to many academics and feminists who advocated it. \"Then the more I travelled, and the more women I&#xa0;interviewed, the more worried I got,\" she says. \"I'm absolutely convinced that all forms of prostitution are just a way of normalising gender discrimination and violence against women, and women are 'trained' to become prostitutes because they are objects in a society that&#xa0;wants to have ghettoes of women who can be raped.\"</p> <p>She adds she doesn't really believe women can \"choose\" to become a prostitute: \"In order to make a choice, you really need to have opportunities and options. If you don't, you are not really choosing, you are just getting by.\" She says there isn't just the stereotypical idea of children and women who are abducted and enslaved (though these do, of course, exist); there are the women who are duped and find themselves owing thousands of dollars to the men who control them. Women, Cacho writes, who \"have been conditioned to sell their bodies, and believe prostitution is the only way for them to make a living\". In Cambodia, Cacho met a woman who runs a brothel who explained how she \"reprograms\" girls by \"normalising sexual exploitation through systematic exposure to pornography. They have to be convinced that they were the ones who chose to do this, and&#xa0;they must be constantly reminded that their lives are worth nothing.\"</p> <p>Even the women she met who were earning thousands of dollars, seemingly free to leave when they wanted, didn't convince her that sex work could be a rational and free labour choice. \"After a while, when you get in depth in an interview, they start telling you how miserable they are, how they are mistreated by clients, how they hate the&#xa0;smell of them, or the way the clients behave. They start giving you little stories that are stories of violence.\"</p> <p>She tries to knit together the links that stretch across the world. She met the former wife of a drug trafficker who described how young women were first exploited as prostitutes, then forced to work in their factories making illegal drugs, and how contacts were met in London, and were formed with gangs in&#xa0;Mexico and Cuba. Police in different countries have told her how many police, politicians and the judiciary are clients of brothels run by organised criminals. The tangle she portrays is overwhelming. The sex trade is growing, she says, in part \"because politicians all&#xa0;over the world are not addressing poverty. They are not really improving the lives of women and girls.\"</p> <p>One reason for the growth of pornography and prostitution, Cacho believes, is that while women's rights are improving in many places, \"the culture of masculinity has not changed at all\". The fact that there are men, she points out, from Europe and North America, who \"go to Mexico, Venezuela, Cambodia, Thailand to have sex with women there is telling you something\". She remembers a young man in Spain who explained he used prostitutes because he couldn't be bothered to talk to the women he met in&#xa0;his everyday life as equals. What she would love to see, she writes, is a \"new masculine revolution \u2026 a new generation of men, not warriors, not armed, not threatening divine punishment, not violent, but men who possess a strong sense of progress and justice\".</p> <p>Cacho was born into a large family in Mexico City. Her father was an engineer, her French mother a psychologist who was involved in the feminist movement. \"They way she saw the world was really enlightening for me,\" she says. \"It was shocking to live in a house in which equality was really implemented every day with my brothers and sisters, and then go out in to a country that didn't respect the rights of women.\"</p> <p>At 23, she became a reporter, and started writing about violence against women. \"My editor said, 'This is good, stick to that.' I thought, yes, this is what I like doing.\" In 1999, a man followed her into the bathroom of a bus station in Cancun and inflicted a brutal attack, in which she was raped and had several bones broken \u2013 an attack, she believes, that was \"punishment\" for her work.</p> <p>And so the threats continued, especially once she started trying to expose a paedophile ring in Cancun for her previous book, Demons of Eden (one of the men she wrote about, Jean Succar Kuri, was sentenced last year). For a time, she travelled in an armoured car and had federal bodyguards; she dispensed with them three years ago after her car was sabotaged. \"I lost a lot of friends and I&#xa0;respected that \u2013 they said they didn't want to be seen with me in public. My social life changed dramatically. You learn how to walk the&#xa0;street and be looking all the time for&#xa0;signs of somebody coming, like a&#xa0;motorcycle.\"</p> <p>The psychological toll is alleviated with therapy, yoga, and \u2013 until now \u2013 spending time in her garden with her dogs, \"getting in touch with the earth, life. I have a sense of humour. A lot of people think I'm weird because I can laugh about the worst things that happen \u2013 not when they're happening, but afterwards. I think that's healthy. You get cynical if you can't laugh.\"</p> <p>The risks are real. In April, her friend, the Mexican investigative journalist Regina Martinez, was killed. Anna Politkovskaya was also a friend; Cacho recalls they met two months before the&#xa0;Russian journalist was murdered in&#xa0;2006. She searches for the words: \"Reality. Shock.\"</p> <p>The only thing to do is to keep working. (She can't stop \u2013 yesterday, she says, she was in her hotel room forwarding a Facebook page she believes is used by a paedophile ring to Interpol.) As well as her writing, she has founded a women's shelter in Cancun; last year, it provided refuge or psychological and legal help to 30,000 women fleeing abuse. Cacho never wanted to become the story, but&#xa0;the threats on her life also bring a spotlight to her work, and to the dangers faced by her colleagues. \"I've never wanted a quiet life, otherwise I wouldn't be a reporter or an activist,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Of course, I get fed up with the politics and the corruption, but I never question my work. We are journalists because we want to change the world.\" She smiles. \"I think my job has made a&#xa0;difference.\"</p> <p><em>Slavery Inc: the Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking by Lydia Cacho is published on 6 September by Portobello Books, priced \u00a314.99.

  "<p>My fascination with my family history was&#xa0;ignited by my Barbadian uncle, Trevor Ashby, a brown-skinned man with a perfectly topiaried afro, who was an executive with Coca-Cola on the island of Barbados.</p> <p>In my early teens, he began telling me stories of his and my&#xa0;mother's plantation childhood. Fascinated by his anecdotes, I started searching archives all over the world for details of&#xa0;my ancestors' births, deaths and marriages. My parents were interested but knew little. Undeterred, I badgered relatives I barely knew for information.</p> <p>The story that emerged was almost four centuries old and replete with drama, tragedy and grief: the story of Atlantic slavery in microcosm.</p> <p>In the late 1630s, my oldest identifiable ancestor, a young blacksmith called George Ashby, set sail from England to Barbados in search of a better life. The journey was difficult and dangerous; arrival no less so. Barbados was a wild land populated by a handful of unfettered young men with little to lose. Travelling across this small island meant hacking pathways through dense foliage in scorching heat, assailed by unfamiliar wildlife and bereft of familiar comforts. Life as a planter was exhausting and the crops he had hoped would make him rich \u2013 indigo, tobacco, cotton \u2013 barely allowed him to scrape a living.</p> <p>But then he and his contemporaries turned to sugar, and their life was transformed. A few centuries before, sugar had erupted in popularity, becoming known as \"white gold\". To meet demand, planters like George Ashby sought more cost-effective means of production, and replaced their indentured white servants with a more oppressed workforce: African slaves. The horrors these captives endured on their journey to the Americas \u2013 my African ancestors included \u2013 and the collateral damage of the trade, which cost millions of lives, has been numbered as one of history's worst atrocities.</p> <p>These \"forced migrants\" soon became more numerous than the white settlers who had initially colonised the island, a subjugated majority with every reason to hate their \"masters\": in&#xa0;response, a paranoid and oppressive society evolved. White and black lived cheek by jowl on the plantations, and in this state of intimate terror, bloodlines inevitably intermingled. Over generations, Ashby's family mutated from a traditionally English one, to a multi-hued one with white, brown and black faces. (His descendant, my great-great-great-great grandfather, had at least 15 slave children, all of whom lived and worked on his plantation.) Many of their descendants would, in their turn, migrate. Some, like my own family, ended up back in Ashby's original homeland.</p> <p>I realised that being able to trace my ancestors back to the 17th century was a gift that would allow me to show how one family was shaped by centuries of slavery and settlement. But it put me in a&#xa0;quandary. How would I make sense of this disturbing story for my children, for whom Barbados is an occasional holiday destination, a place of relaxation and family fun?</p> <p>My elder daughter, a blue-eyed, porcelain-skinned six-year-old, is at an age where she is asking questions, trying to make sense of her world and her family. She has great curiosity, but also a strong need to see the world as a&#xa0;safe and fair place. My younger child is a brown-skinned three-year-old who is just beginning to question why people have different colour skins, why she looks so different from her sister, and why it seems to matter to those around her. How do I explain that one branch of our family was&#xa0;enslaved by the other? How do I&#xa0;educate them about contemporary racism without distressing and dividing them? These are questions for every family of Caribbean descent, but equally pertinent for white British families, whose heritage is inextricably tied to the same history.</p> <p>At the moment, I have to confess, I&#xa0;have told them little, not least because I can still remember my own reaction when my parents explained what \"racial prejudice\" meant, and how shocked and frightened it made me feel. (That I was 11 at the time is a testament to how sheltered I was in my Caribbean milieu.) When I finally got around to explaining the idea that some people disliked others simply because of the colour of their skin, my outraged elder child sensibly declared: \"But Mama, it would be really boring if we all looked the same.\"</p> <p>Ultimately I want my daughters to understand both how history has made them, and how it is possible to step beyond the confines of historical legacy. I want them to comprehend the atrocities of the slave system and to recognise how the oppressors were even more debased by the process than their victims; hence their exploitation of their own kin.</p> <p>I want them to appreciate how the intertwined forces of sugar and slavery created the world we live in today, enriching Britain but also leading to the bigotry that means descendants of Africans remain disadvantaged in comparison to those who promoted the trade against them. I want to explain that these prejudices, still wielded today, have nothing do with the reality of black people's abilities or worth, but were developed to justify slavery.</p> <p>Slavery wasn't just about some people being vile to others, but was part of a global industry that had its own terrible logic and justification; a monument to the dangers of greed and venality.&#xa0;In part, too, I simply want my children to bear witness: to remember how slavery relentlessly dehumanised its victims, the systematic torture and violence, generating self-hatred and \"abolishing families\". Planters did not recognise or respect the family bonds slaves brought with them or chose to create. They abused the women they owned and treated the men as studs to create&#xa0;new workers. They separated black mothers from their children, sometimes to nurse white children. Black African culture and family life were smashed on the rocks of the Caribbean shores, and the impact of that is still felt 300 years later.</p> <p>I also want them to know that slaves were not just victims but survivors. I&#xa0;want to remind them that it was not the abolitionists alone who brought about emancipation, but the enslaved themselves. By the end of the 18th century, slave revolts exploded like fireworks across the English Americas; each disruption making slavery more untenable. I want them to salute the courage of these hundreds of thousands of forgotten rebels, such as the Jamaican slave-woman who declared, as she went into the fray: \"I know I will die but my children will be free!\"</p> <p>So why can't I just tell them in the words I&#xa0;have used here? Finding the way to have these conversations has another layer of complexity in my case as I have a very modern family. Neither of my children is biologically or genetically connected to me. One is my partner's birth child, the other ours by adoption. One is white while the other is of white and black Caribbean heritage. So there is no way of telling how they will relate to my family story. Will they see it as theirs&#xa0;by right or only borrowed?</p> <p>Will my black child feel she is able to claim it \u2013 because her own birth family heritage is likely to look similar \u2013 but my white child feel alienated by it, that she is tainted by association with the baddies? Does sharing this story of slavery risk introducing a fissure into our family unity, a feeling that the two white members are entwined with the oppressors while the two black members are associated with the victims?</p> <p>My daughters may wonder if they should absorb this family history at all. As the adopted one, the outsider gathered in, my younger child might feel my story isn't hers; my white daughter may reject exploring it out of shame. And how do I give them a healthy, critical loyalty to both my country of birth, where families like ours are not fully understood, and to their country of birth, where racism continues to run through the culture like a dark seam of coal?</p> <p>Of course, I am not in control of how my daughters will understand their heritage. What I say is only the start \u2013 they will receive messages from friends, school and the wider society about who they are and where they belong. They will have their own experiences of racism and will form their own identifications and allegiances.&#xa0;But right now, what their mum tells them is like the word of God, and I will be telling them that this story is theirs as well as mine; and that they are both part of this historical epic. Black as well as white people helped to found the country they live in; and we have worked and suffered and died for our place here.</p> <p>I want them to realise that who they are is the result of these earlier events and that they are the outcome of these people and what they did. So the three-and-a-half centuries of Atlantic slavery are just the early chapters of the story in which they now appear.</p> <p>I want them to appreciate that genetics is only one of the connections that link a family. Our families are connected in other ways: allegiances, traditions, preferences and a myriad other idiosyncrasies. That one of the things that binds us is our storytelling \u2013 and as a writer whose passion is creating narratives \u2013 I hope this will feel as important for my daughters as it feels for me. I want them to understand that love is more important than blood.</p> <p>For many people, inheritance is something we carry in our bodies \u2013 so that Great Uncle Claude's experiences are, in a&#xa0;very real sense, built into us. But there is another way of understanding how our heritage makes us who we are. It is as heirloom, a gift, a chronicle handed down between the generations, one that can easily be lost, discarded or&#xa0;reclaimed.</p> <p>Just as I see my non-biological children displaying my own traits \u2013 pulling faces as I do, or laughing at the same things, or dancing in the exact same style \u2013 so they can inherit my history.&#xa0; It is just another gift from me, alongside my love and devotion, should they choose to accept it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sugar in the Blood: A Family's Story of Slavery and Empire by Andrea Stuart is published by Portobello Books, \u00a318.99.

  "<p><strong>My early family life was crap</strong>,<strong> </strong>basically.<strong> </strong>My birth mother died when I was 18 months old. My father was married several times and I was very devoted to him, but he was a product of a broken family himself and was sent to an orphanage. I&#xa0;think he was carrying his own baggage and couldn't relate to anybody. I was farmed out for foster care at the age of about seven.</p> <p>It is the best thing that ever happened to me.</p> <p><strong>Before I was fostered,</strong> I didn't have any social stimulus. I had governesses, a private tutor and a nanny, but it didn't nourish my soul. I was the sort of child who would darkly sit in the corner and watch, which paid dividends when I&#xa0;became an actor. Eventually, I settled with a family on a farm in Devon in an environment that was absolutely a marriage of souls.</p> <p><strong>My new family immediately gave me </strong>the company of other children, and it knocked me back into shape. I get annoyed when people say, \"Oh well, they had a bad upbringing,\" or \"They had a bad background and that's why they behave like that.\" What happened to you in the past does not have to be the eternal stamp on your personality.</p> <p><strong>My relationship with my birth father</strong> continued after I was fostered. I had contact with him and a stepmother. When she died, I was an adult, by which point I had realised that perhaps my father wasn't quite the nice person my infant self had thought he was. We didn't really have anything in common so I just did my dutiful bits and made sure he was OK, but there wasn't an awful lot of heart there.</p> <p><strong>Despite lacking a consistent mother figure</strong> I don't feel emotionally incomplete, and I think that's because I ended up with the right people, but you could say I was at an age when I'd already been formulated. Like the Jesuits said, \"Give me a boy to the age of seven and I'll show you the man.\"</p> <p><strong>I have not felt tempted to explore my genealogy.</strong> I know who my mother was. I've got her birth certificate. I&#xa0;know she died of tuberculosis. It was during the war and they were short of penicillin, as it was used on the front more than anywhere else. She didn't have the medication that she should have had, but I also think probably she'd given up. From what I've heard from people, maybe she had given up with my father.</p> <p><strong>I started boarding school when I was fostered</strong> and it instilled all sorts of values. It became home to me once I got over the first week of crying. Boarding school was like a family and I loved it. I&#xa0;suddenly came into my own. I loved the discipline and structure, and by structure I mean who gives you that moral code and direction. I've always thought that I quite like the idea of the traditional family, but actually you can get those structures and that moral direction from any sort of family structure.</p> <p><strong>I'm very, very strongly in favour</strong> of giving people the opportunity of a family. Today, people wanting to enter the fostering system have to jump through a lot of hoops. There have to be legal parameters, but I still think a family that is not 100% perfect is better than a children's home. It's got to be. I didn't have to spend any time in a children's home, thank goodness. I&#xa0;agree with the discipline that a children's home would encourage and foster, but it is also instilling in a child that they are just something that can be put away. It's like kennelling a dog. Nobody is really caring.</p> <p><strong>I've never had any children</strong>. I felt when I was younger that I would be a lousy parent because of my background. But I think now I would have been a better parent. I've got an enormous number of surrogate kids, including distant family youngsters, which is lovely because that is giving me grandma status. But most of the surrogate kids I have, I'm a second mum to.</p> <p><em>\u2022 See Pam St Clement on </em><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/thismorning/\" title=\"\"><em>This Morning, weekdays, 10.30am on ITV1</em></a></p>",
  "<p>America's worst drought in half a century, poor harvests in Russia and Ukraine, and Britain's washout early summer will all push up the costs of basic staple foods such as bread and pasta, while rising animal feed prices will send the price of meat soaring, experts are warning.</p> <p>Shoppers are already feeling the pinch, according to <a href=\"http://mysupermarket.co.uk/\" title=\"mySupermarket website\">mySupermarket.co.uk</a>, which compares prices at the major retailers. It said minced beef is up 19% over the past year, while peas, carrots and potatoes are up by 4%-8% \u2013 though some of this is due to seasonal factors. Overall, global food prices rose by 6% in July, according to the UN.</p> <p>America's searing summer, which has seen temperatures hit 43C (110F) day after day, has left the once-rich cornfields of the Midwest brown and shrivelled. The worst-hit farmers are reporting corn harvests of just a 10th of the previous year. It is estimated that, in total, 45% of the corn and 35% of the soya bean crop has been destroyed.</p> <p>The impact on family budgets, already hit by a steep rise in train fares and near-record petrol prices, could be severe, with economists nervous it will further delay any economic recovery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395472365\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346410224144/Food-prices-table-001.jpg\" alt=\"Food prices table\" width=\"220\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food prices table Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while the crops are withering, speculators are rubbing their hands. At Glencore, the world's biggest commodities trader, the head of its food trading business said this month that the US drought will be \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business\" title=\"Glencore food chief says US drought is 'good for business'\">good for Glencore</a>\" because it will lead to opportunities to exploit soaring prices. The Swiss and Jersey-based dealer in wheat, corn, oil and copper, made a profit of $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn) in the first half of 2012.</p> <p>It's not just big traders that have jumped on the food price bandwagon. Small investors are being encouraged to use exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of individual commodities, and where minimum investments are as low as \u00a32.</p> <p>Trawl the internet and you'll find articles such as \"<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/777681-how-to-invest-for-the-global-food-crisis\" title=\"Seeking Alpha: How To Invest For The Global Food Crisis\">How to invest for the global food crisis</a>\" by Seeking Alpha, which claims it is home to \"savvy and inquisitive investors\".

It's calling for consumers to <a href=\"http://www.makefinancework.org/the-food-crises-the-us-drought/food-speculation/\" title=\"Make Finance Work petition\">sign a petition aimed at MEPs on its website</a>. \"If done right, it could protect the world's most vulnerable from the whims of Europe's big financial players,\" campaigners say.</p> <p>\"But the MEPs, whose votes are vital, are being heavily lobbied by the financial industry. We need to tell MEPs to vote to end excessive food speculation, and put the hunger of people before the greed of banks.\"</p> <p>A German lobby group, <a href=\"http://foodwatch.de/presse/pressearchiv/2012/rohstoff_fonds_umgebildet/index_ger.html\" title=\"FoodWatch website\">Foodwatch</a>, last month claimed success in its campaign against speculation after Commerzbank removed agricultural products from its ETF offering.</p> <p>\"It is reacting to the debate about a series of studies which show that investment in this type of commodity fund pushes food prices upwards and so contributes to the hunger crisis in many parts of the world,\" Foodwatch says. Last year, Deutsche Bank also said it would \"refrain from launching new staples-based exchange traded products this year.\"</p> <p>But Fidelity Investments, the biggest fund manager, says investors should be looking at agribusiness stocks, such as fertiliser companies and farm machinery makers, as the solution to the world's food challenges. In a recent research note \"<a href=\"https://www.fidelity.co.uk/investor/news-insights/21-century-themes/episode4.page\" title=\"Fidelity website\">Food: from crisis to crisis</a>\", Fidelity highlighted World Bank estimates that demand will rise by 50% by 2030. Much of that will be driven by population growth and a big shift in Asian diets to more meat and dairy products. This has a significant knock-on effect on grain demand as it takes 7 kilos to produce 1 kilo of meat.</p> <p>Fidelity reckons there could be a \"second green revolution\" as increased fertiliser usage improves yields in Africa and Asia. It tips fertiliser companies such as Potash Corp, Uralkali and Mosaic as potentially star stocks.</p> <p>Currently, British investors have a number of specialist agricultural funds to choose from including Allianz RCM Global Agricultural Trends, Baring Global Agriculture, Eclectica Agriculture, First State Global Agribusiness and Sarasin Agrisar.</p> <p>James Govan, manager of the \u00a3132m Baring Global Agriculture fund, says: \"The things we are investing in are about expanding food supply, such as fertilisers, drought-resistant seed, irrigation equipment and so on.\"</p> <p>Although volumes are down in America, farm incomes are up because of rising prices, which has sparked an investment boom. It's one reason why Govan is a holder of stocks such as tractor maker John Deere, whose share price has more than doubled over the past three years.</p> <p>But despite the rise in global food prices, the agricultural funds have had surprisingly weak performance. Baring's fund is up just 4.6% over the past year, Sarasin 9.7%, First State 6.2% and Allianz 3.6%. Eclectica's fund has fallen 2%. In contrast, the average fund in the UK All Companies sector is up about 16% over the past year.</p> <p>The hot money suggests there will be a fall in agricultural prices rather than a drought-inspired rise. According to ETF Securities, there has been an outflow of $622m from agricultural ETFs in the past year, much of it in recent months. Meanwhile, the ETFs which short agricultural prices \u2013 in other words, they bet on a fall in prices \u2013 are seeing inflows.</p> <p>Says Nick Brooks of <a href=\"http://www.etfsecurities.com/\" title=\"ETF Securities website\">ETF Securities</a>: \"Many investors built up positions in agricultural ETFs a year to 18 months ago, but have been selling this year. A lot of investors view agricultural prices as too high, are selling their long positions, and some are going short.\"</p>",
  "<p>Is the great gold rush over? The price of the precious metal has soared over the last decade, jumping from below $300 (\u00a3189) in 2001 to peak at $1,920 (\u00a31,211) in September 2011. But, since then, it has fallen to around $1,660 (\u00a31,047) defying predictions \u2013 and the hopes of speculators \u2013 that it would continue to hit new peaks during the ongoing financial turmoil.</p> <p>The fall has puzzled analysts. At the end of 2011, Goldman Sachs predicted another glittering year with a rise towards $2,000 (\u00a31,262), averaging around $1,800 (\u00a31,135).</p> <p>It said low interest rates, limited appetite for risky assets and constrained supply would keep it shining. Others fretted that \"quantitative easing\" could spark a collapse in confidence in so-called \"fiat money\" (issuing paper money without the backing of gold reserves).</p> <p>Typical was this analysis, made in mid-2011, by Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, \"There is a new type of crisis. Investors are losing confidence in governments and paper currencies ... the flight to the safety of gold could easily see the price surge well above $1,950 (\u00a31,250).</p> <p>Yet in the final quarter of 2011 the price fell sharply, with only a brief recovery in early 2012 before it began sliding again. Figures from financial adviser group Hargreaves Lansdown reveal that seven of the 10 worst-performing funds for small investors in 2012 have been gold, as the value of shares in gold mining companies fell&#xa0;even harder than gold itself.</p> <p>But critics will welcome losses for speculators, given the conditions under which some gold is mined. An investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches in June 2011 revealed that an estimated 90% of gold miners worldwide, many of them children, work for a pittance, using methods that do huge damage both to health and the environment.</p> <p>So why is gold falling in value, will the fall continue, or will it bounce back?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395466884\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346407634678/Gold-prices-graph-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gold prices graph\" width=\"220\" height=\"199\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold prices graph Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In part, the decline of gold is because investors have preferred the dollar as a safe haven during the economic turmoil. Generally, when the dollar is strong, gold is weak.</p> <p>Neil Gregson, manager of JP Morgan's \u00a31.6bn Natural Resources fund, says shares in gold mining companies have fallen faster than the price of gold itself. \"They have been the worst offenders on blowing out capital costs and operating costs, so there has been a substantial margin squeeze,\" he says.</p> <p>But more important is the behaviour of investors in India, which is the biggest buyer of gold in the world \u2013 and they have been selling. Says Gregson: \"The gold price is all about investment demand, not supply. India is important, as they are the biggest individual holders, with probably $1 trillion-worth of gold. But they are very price sensitive and buy less as the price goes up.\"</p> <p>Investors can choose between buying gold directly through an exchange traded fund, or through a fund that buys shares in gold mines. Many financial advisers currently favour the funds because they have fallen harder than the gold price.</p> <p>Danny Cox, head of advice at Hargreaves Landsdown, says there is a recognisable breakdown in the relationship between mining shares and physical gold. He believes this is likely to eventually correct itself, so there may be an opportunity to invest in undervalued gold funds, such as JPM Natural Resources and Smith and Williamson Global Gold and Resources.</p> <p>But Charlie Parker, director of Citywire, an online financial news and advice site, believes any investment in gold should be strictly long term, as a means of providing insulation and protection from an unpredictable economic environment, rather than a mechanism for short-term gains.</p>",
  "<p>As summer begins to lapse into autumn, the fields around <a href=\"http://www.greatdixter.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Great Dixter</a> turn biscuit brown and the leaves on trees and hedges grow tired. The trick is to realise the gardening season is not over by August but continues and can do so all guns blazing. Every year we plan a kaleidoscope of rich tones to bring the garden to a late crescendo.</p> <h2>Grasses<br></h2> <p>The show is supported by seasonal plants such as fawn-coloured grasses, waving their feathery plumes in the wind, linking one season to another. <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=5700\" title=\"\"><em>Miscanthus sinensis</em> 'Malepartus'</a> is 2m tall and upright, its purple brown flowers shimmering above a body of leaves.

Yellow-leaved <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=341\" title=\"\"><em>Catalpa bignonioides</em> 'Aurea'</a>, dark plum <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=372\" title=\"\"><em>Cercis canadensis </em>'Forest Pansy'</a> and metallic grey <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospermum_lanigerum\" title=\"\"><em>Leptospermum lanigerum</em></a> add to the pleasing mosaic.</p> <h2>Daisies<br></h2> <p>Late summer perennials keep the party going. Many heleniums flower from July to September, but some, such as <a href=\"http://www.plantify.co.uk/Helenium-Riverton-Beauty/plant-4705\" title=\"\">'Riverton Beauty'</a>, stay the course until late October.

With gracefully dangling inflorescences of rich pink, it flowers from July until the first frost and towers over other plants, softening the picture without blocking your view. Seed is best sown fresh into pots in autumn, then left outside for winter cold to break its dormancy; germination takes place in spring, ready for planting out in May.</p> <h2>Marigolds<br></h2> <p>Many marigolds have been dwarfed by modern breeding, losing a good deal of their branching habit and elegance. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagetes_patula\" title=\"\"><em>Tagetes patula</em></a>, the wild French marigold, makes bushy plants over 1m tall, with delicate orange flowers.

From a May planting, flowering runs from July to October. <a href=\"http://thegardenwall.net/node/17028\" title=\"\"><em>T. patula</em> 'Cinnabar'</a> is similar in height and stature but comes with striking deep copper flowers.

  "<p>US central bank chief Ben Bernanke sparked a surge in share values on Friday after he signalled his willingness to embark on a third phase of money creation to boost the US economy.</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed the day with a gain of 90 points after the chairman of the Federal Reserve gave a robust defence of past central bank interventions, which, traders said, prepared the ground for a third round of quantitative easing should the economic picture worsen. France's CAC and the German DAX closed up 1%.</p> <p>In his much anticipated a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bernanke described the current economic situation as \"far from satisfactory\". He said that high rates of unemployment were a \"grave concern, not only because of the enormous suffering and waste of human talent it entails, but also because persistently high levels of unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for years\".</p> <p>His speech to the annual central bank symposium came ahead of September's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open markets committee (FOMC), which sets US economic policy. Recently released minutes from its last meeting show the committee has become increasingly concerned about the US recovery and is weighing further action.</p> <p>However, since the last FOMC meeting, more positive economic news has emerged on jobs and housing. Next week the closely watched non-farm payroll survey of monthly employment trends will be released. After a sharp rise over the winter, job growth slowed in the spring, but appears to be picking up again.</p> <p>He urged European leaders to make faster progress in tackling the debt crisis affecting Greece and other indebted eurozone countries. His concerns that Europe may drag the US back into recession were highlighted by figures showing that unemployment across the zone remained at an all-time high in July.</p> <p>The European Union's statistical agency, Eurostat, said 88,000 more people were without a job in July, pushing the total out of work in the eurozone to 18m, the highest level since monetary union in 1999.</p> <p>The 11.3% unemployment rate, up 1.2 points from a year earlier, failed to come down after joblessness increased in Spain and bailed-out Greece. In Spain youth unemployment stood at 52.9%, in Greece at 53.8%.</p> <p>Any monetary action by the Fed is likely to trigger a furious response from elements within the Republican party who have criticised his past actions and warned against new measures.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has made it clear he will replace the Fed chief, who he accuses of putting taxpayers' cash at risk, if he is elected in November.</p> <p>The House financial services committee chairman, Spencer Bachus, told Bernanke last month at a congressional hearing: \"The truth is the Federal Reserve cannot rescue Americans from the consequences of failed economic and regulatory policies passed by Congress and signed by the president.\"</p> <p>The initial US quantitative easing programme from November 2008 to May 2010 saw the Fed buy $1.75tn in debt held by mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a range of mortgage-backed securities and government bonds, mostly from the country's 3,000 banks.</p> <p>A second round, dubbed QE2, involved an additional $600bn. \"Operation Twist\" began in September 2011 with a pledge to swap $400bn in short-term loans for longer term bonds, with an extension in June adding a further $267bn.</p> <p>Bernanke offered a strong defence of his actions at Jackson Hole. \"A balanced reading of the evidence supports the conclusion that central bank securities purchases have provided meaningful support to the economic recovery while mitigating deflationary risks,\" he said.</p> <p>In a swipe at Republican critics who accuse him of jeopardising hundreds of billions of taxpayer funds following the expansion of Federal Reserve loans, he said loans by the Fed since the bank rescues of 2008 had earned money for the exchequer.</p> <p>David Zervos, head of global fixed income strategy at US investment bank Jefferies, said it was unlikely the Fed would back a further round of central bank lending before the presidential election in November.</p> <p>\"The idea that the Fed would come out with unconventional monetary policy, such as credit easing of some kind, seems to be a little bit of a stretch,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This was a backstop speech that gets Bernanke through. If the data turns or Europe turns, then the Fed is back in.\"</p> <p>Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services, said: \"It sure sounds to me like he is getting ready to act.\"</p> <p>He said the FOMC would now be waiting for the non-farm payroll figures. In July, the US added 163,000 new jobs, more than many economists had expected. Faucher is predicting that 130,000 new jobs were added in August, while other analysts are expecting about 100,000.</p> <p>\"If it comes in below 100,000, I think the Fed will act,\" he said. \"That would be four out of five months below 100,000. That's not good enough.\"</p>",
  "<p>Five miles south of Carlisle, at a crossroads of four Cumbrian country lanes, lies the village of Wreay, pronounced locally as \"Rhea\" (to rhyme with \"near\"). \"As a girl\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/12/jenny-uglow-interview-paul-laity\" title=\"\">Jenny Uglow</a> recalls happening upon an incongruous sight beside Wreay's village green: what \"looks like a small Romanesque chapel from northern Italy\". Constructed in 1842, the church deviated markedly from contemporary fashion, particularly from the architectural traits of the Gothic revival that had been championed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/24/pugin-gothic-architect\" title=\"\">Augustus Welby Pugin</a> from the 1830s. Whereas Pugin's buildings were \"dark and claustrophobic, richly coloured and emotional\", <a href=\"http://www.stmaryswreay.org/sara_losh.html\" title=\"\">the church of St Mary's at Wreay</a> was strikingly plain. The \"nave was so simple,\" Uglow writes, \"that it could almost be a local fellside barn.\" Joined to a curved apse, the overall effect was of a small northern Italian chapel or \"a small Byzantine basilica\", even echoing the style of Norman ecclesiastical architecture.</p> <p>But if its structure was merely strange and anachronistic, the Wreay church's decoration was utterly extraordinary and quite unique. Its fa\u00e7ade, pillars, windows, altar and doorway were crammed with carvings: symbols from creation myths, from early religions and cults, personifications of gods from east and west, representatives of the natural world and the local Cumbrian landscape, and ammonites, fossils and coral. On the walls of the chapel, \"emblematical monsters\" hung \"like gargoyles\": a huge dinosaur-like snake, a crocodile poised to attack, a winged turtle and a chubby vertiginous tortoise. These had a utilitarian function, concealing ventilators or emitting smoke from the boiler.</p> <p>Stained-glass windows were adorned with flowers and fossils, or comprised mosaics made from remnants \"picked up from the floor of the glazier's workshop\". The church's interiors were similarly recycled, from the spoils of its creator's travels: candelabra from Pompeii, a 14th-century bronze holy-water pail from Normandy, two oak chairs from Paris and, on the floor, bearskins, perhaps from Russia. The pulpit was fashioned from bog oak, reclaimed from a tree that had lain in a bog for at least three thousand years. And everywhere there were pinecones: on the arches that enfolded the door, on square pediments at the well of the nave and on each massive oak cross-beam in the roof.</p> <p>The pinecone was at once an ancient symbol of reproduction and regeneration, and a Masonic emblem of enlightenment. Descartes had suggested that the pinecone-shaped pineal gland might be the \"abode of the spirit of man\", from which the soul \"radiates forth through all the remainder of the body\". Uglow describes how \"the cone's slow ripening and opening to release the seeds came to stand for the expansion of consciousness.\"</p> <p>The pinecone was also mathematically significant. The arrangement of its scales follows the Fibonacci sequence, in which each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. Occurring in a multitude of biological settings, from an artichoke to a snail shell, the Fibonacci sequence articulates, as Uglow puts it, \"the geometry of life\". The pinecone, with its meanings that proliferated as enthusiastically as its scales, neatly encapsulated the catholic nature of the references that were contained in the Wreay church's decoration. That building's rich symbolic vocabulary was gleaned from east and west, past and present, from ancient notions in theology and current trends in geology, from superstition and enlightenment, the local and the wholly distant. But the pinecone was also imbued with meanings that were intensely personal to the church's architect and maker. It was a memorial to the local landscape around Wreay that, in the late 18th-century, was replete with newly planted larches and their clusters of small cones.</p> <p><em>The Pinecone</em> is Uglow's love song to St Mary's church and to its creator, Sarah Losh. Born in 1786 to landowning parents, whose wealth derived largely from a prosperous alkali works in Newcastle, Losh's educational development was chiefly entrusted to her uncle, James Losh. A lawyer immersed in the radical political circles of 1790s Britain, James numbered among his friends the philosopher William Godwin, the essayist Thomas Holcroft and the poets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/william-wordsworth\" title=\"\">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/samuel-taylor-coleridge\" title=\"\">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>.</p> <p>In the political ferment that followed the outbreak of the French revolution, James Losh was one of many who passionately advocated, among other causes, voting reform and education for all, including women. Under James's tutelage, Sarah was introduced to some of the period's most innovative writers, and Uglow surmises that she \"must have been one of the first girls to hear Wordsworth's 'Michael', or Coleridge's 'Ancient Mariner'\". After a formative period travelling around Italy after the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars, Sarah's interests turned to architecture. She became a Wordsworth in stone, sharing his belief that in \"low and rustic life \u2026 the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity, are less under restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic language\". As heiress to her father's estate, she bore responsibility for the upkeep of the village's infrastructure. The church at Wreay \u2013 her crowning achievement \u2013 was one of a number of local construction projects that included wells, cottages, schools and a Celtic carved cross and mortuary chapel for Losh's beloved sister, Katharine. All bore the hallmarks of her exceptional imagination and demonstrated her consistent attentiveness to \"the poor, arguing for the rights of the people\". Like Wordsworth in his poetry, Losh's style attempted to incorporate \"the passions of men \u2026 with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature\".</p> <p>In the epilogue to <em>The Pinecone</em>, Uglow assesses Losh's importance in architectural history, citing another biographer's comment that \"if artistic feeling is to be measured by an ability to seize the currents of thought and feeling that flow through the age and give them fresh and vital expression, Sarah Losh and her church are very important indeed.\" Losh's talent for encapsulating historical and trans-historical trends in a fiercely local setting mirrors the great strength of Uglow's biography. <em>The Pinecone</em> uses Losh and her church as the intimate foil for a magnificent sweeping prospect of the natural and intellectual landscape of the late-18th and early-19th centuries, incorporating geology, the industrial revolution, the coming of the railways, trends in antiquarianism and architecture, changing perspectives on female education \u2013 and the Afghan war.</p> <p>But Losh is clearly a tricky character for a biographer. Uglow repeatedly makes reference to the dearth of archival sources pertaining to her subject: Losh destroyed most of her own writings, and her journals, if extant, are missing. So her own voice remains muted. Uglow instead moulds her persona out of external sources, from her relationships with her father, uncle and sister, and chiefly, from Losh's own creations. \"It is in her buildings that we have to look for her,\" Uglow writes; \"she left stones and wood, not letters, for us to read.\" In this respect, the form of Uglow's biography reflects its content. The silence at the heart of <em>The Pinecone</em> is not only the silence of Losh's voice, but also mirrors the \"mystery\" at the centre of the church at Wreay, its unexplained theological significance. And form mirrors content elsewhere too. In its intimate tone, its lavishly detailed depictions of Losh's creations, and its seamless interweaving of the local and immediate with the global and the timeless, Uglow's book is an exuberant match for the beautiful, ornate and movingly personal nature of Losh's extraordinary church.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Hewitt's <em>Map of a Nation</em> is published by Granta.</p>",
  "<p>If you watch the eponymous 1970s TV show, or indeed the <a href=\"http://www.channel5.com/dallas\" title=\"\">new shiny 2012 version</a> which airs in the UK on Channel 5 next week, you'd think Dallas was all big ranches, cowboy hats and oil money. Well, take it from someone who lives here \u2013 it's not. I am not saying the shows are completely inaccurate; I like the series, and they surely did something right to become one of the longest-running American soaps of all time. Yet despite the reputation for thick accents, over-the-top fashion and cattle barons, there is an arty side, bohemian even, that rarely gets covered.</p> <p>Here is my list of off-the-beaten path attractions, plus some of the unmissable and historic sites, that make Dallas such a fun city to visit.</p> <h2>Neighbourhood watch<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395588770\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/8/30/1346347733101/Dallas-composite-008.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas composite\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nasher Sculpture Center and Billy Bob's country music club in Fort Worth.

It has gone through periods of boom and bust but is on an upswing now, with new bars and the recently opened Deep Ellum Brewing Company (2823 St Louis Street, <a href=\"http://www.deepellumbrewing.com\" title=\"\">deepellumbrewing.com</a>), with public tours on Thursdays and Saturdays. Classic spots include The Meridian Room (3611 Parry Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.themeridianroom.com/\" title=\"\">themeridianroom.com</a>) and Amsterdam (831 Exposition Avenue, <a href=\"http://amsterdambar.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">theamsterdambar.com</a>), and legendary music venues include Trees (2709 Elm Street, <a href=\"http://treesdallas.com/\" title=\"\">treesdallas.com</a>) where Nirvana, Soul Asylum, and other grunge bands played in the early 1990s; Club Dada (2720 Elm Street, <a href=\"http://dadadallas.com/\" title=\"\">dadadallas.com</a>), and for metal music heads Reno's Chop Shop (210 N Crowdus Street, <a href=\"http://www.renoschopshop.com/\" title=\"\">renoschopshop.com</a>). See <a href=\"http://deepellumtexas.com/\" title=\"\">DeepEllumTexas.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://deepellumsocial.com/\" title=\"\">DeepEllumSocial.com</a> for more ideas.</p> <p>Further west, <strong>Oak Cliff </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.gooakcliff.org/\" title=\"\">gooakcliff.org</a>) and the <strong>Bishop Arts District</strong> (<a href=\"http://bishopartsdistrict.weebly.com/\" title=\"\">bishopartsdistrict.weebly.com</a>) at Davis Street corridor, and the <strong>Tyler Davis Art District</strong> (<a href=\"http://tyler-davis.org/\" title=\"\">tyler-davis.org</a>) are full of good food, culture, and cyclists wearing nerdy glasses and hats. Over the years this historic area has been the home of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Erykah Badu, Edie Brickell, Dennis Rodman, and T-Bone Walker. Oak Cliff&#xa0; gets slapped around a lot in the media \u2013 it was the home of Bonnie and Clyde, and Lee Harvey Oswald \u2013 but it has undergone a renaissance lately.</p> <p>Lockhart Smokehouse (400 West Davis, <a href=\"http://www.lockhartsmokehouse.com\" title=\"\">lockhartsmokehouse.com</a>) does the best barbecue in Dallas in my opinion \u2013 order from the counter and eat with your fingers. Bolsa (614 West Davis, +1 214 367 9367, <a href=\"http://bolsadallas.com\" title=\"\">bolsadallas.com</a>) does great modern American; and Eno's (407 North Bishop Avenue, <a href=\"http://enospizza.com/\" title=\"\">enospizza.com</a>), a pizza place and tavern, is also worth checking out. There are some cool vintage clothing and antique shops, such as Zola's Everyday Vintage (414 North Bishop Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.zolasvintage.com\" title=\"\">zolasvintage.com</a>) and DFW M'Antiques (424 West Davis Street), an antique store geared towards men that offers free beer.</p> <p><strong>Lakewood</strong> (<a href=\"http://lakewoodguide.net/\" title=\"\">lakewoodguide.net</a>) next to White Rock Lake, has a relaxed vibe that leaves you wondering if it's a suburb of Austin. You might also call it Dallas for People Who Hate the Big City. It has drawn hippies, hipsters, artists and families, creating a sense of community. A few favourite haunts include the Cock and Bull (1920 Abrams Parkway, <a href=\"http://www.cockandbulldallas.com/\" title=\"\">cockandbulldallas.com</a>) a pub that also serves the best burger in Dallas; Cosmo's Lounge (1212 Skillman Street, <a href=\"http://cosmosbar.com/\" title=\"\">cosmosbar.com</a>) a 1960s-style martini bar with excellent pizza; Arcade Bar (1825 Abrams Parkway), and the Lakewood Landing (5818 Liveoak, +1 214 823 2410, <a href=\"http://lakewood-landing.com/\" title=\"\">lakewood-landing.com</a>). It's also home to the historic Lakewood Theater (<a href=\"http://www.lakewoodtheater.com/\" title=\"\">lakewoodtheater.com</a>), which opened in&#xa0;1938, and features occasional burlesque shows and gigs.</p> <p>The Dallas Museum of Art (<a href=\"http://dm-art.org/\" title=\"\">dm-art.org</a>), the Nasher Sculpture garden (<a href=\"http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org/\" title=\"\">nashersculpturecenter.org</a>) and the Crow Collection of Asian Art (<a href=\"http://www.crowcollection.com/\" title=\"\">crowcollection.com</a>) stand together downtown in the <strong>Arts District </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.thedallasartsdistrict.org\" title=\"\">thedallasartsdistrict.org</a>).<strong> </strong>Both the DMA and the Nasher have late-night events once a month or so, with bands, movies, and food trucks.</p> <h2>Fun things to do<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395588771\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/8/30/1346346738438/M-Line-trolley-in-Dallas.-001.jpg\" alt=\"M-Line trolley in Dallas. \" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dallas's M-Line trolley </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The M-Line (<a href=\"http://www.mata.org/map.shtml\" title=\"\">mata.org</a>) is a system of four (mostly) air-conditioned and heated vintage <strong>trolley buses</strong> running 365 days a year around Dallas's vibrant Uptown neighbourhood. All rides are free, though there is a donations box.</p> <p>The <strong>Dallas skyline</strong> is well worth admiring. The bar of my favourite hotel, the Belmont (<a href=\"http://www.belmontdallas.com\" title=\"\">belmontdallas.com</a>, stylish rooms from $99), patios at Bryan Street Tavern (<a href=\"http://www.bryanstreettavern.com/\" title=\"\">bryanstreettavern.com</a>) and The Cedars Social (<a href=\"http://thecedarssocial.com/\" title=\"\">thecedarssocial.com</a>) are some of the locations affording great views. A scene in the second episode of Dallas was filmed here, with John Ross Ewing and Christopher Ewing. Or take a free elevator ride to the roof of the old <strong>Sears Roebuck</strong> building (<a href=\"http://www.southsideonlamar.com/The-Building/Past.aspx\" title=\"\">southsideonlamar.com</a>) which is now loft housing. It has the most amazing view: as you stand below it, the rooftop sign feels a bit like the Hollywood hill sign.&#xa0; The cast of Dallas actually stayed here for some portion of the filming of the series. </p> <p>But the best panorama of the city is from <strong>Reunion Tower</strong> (+1 214 741 5560, <a href=\"http://www.reuniontower.com/\" title=\"\">reuniontower.com</a>). The Big Ball on its top is synonymous with the Dallas skyline. Catch a happy hour or eat in the restaurant Five Sixty by Wolfgang Puck (+1 214 741 5560, <a href=\"http://www.wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/fine-dining/3917/\" title=\"\">wolfgangpuck.com</a>), named for the number of feet it sits above ground.</p> <p>Since 1989, the <strong>Sixth Floor Museum</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.jfk.org/\" title=\"\">jfk.org</a>) at Dealey Plaza has welcomed more than six million visitors seeking information about the assassination of President Kennedy on 22 November 1963 in the plaza outside. The 50th anniversary of the shooting is coming up and the conspiracy theorists are foaming at the mouth. I've heard that the X on the street that marks the spot where Kennedy was shot moves every year. How's that for a conspiracy?</p> <p>Adults can relive their childhood playing two-foot-high Jenga and 1980s video games at <strong>Barcadia</strong> (1917 North Henderson Avenue, <a href=\"http://barcadiabars.com/\" title=\"\">barcadiabars.com</a>). It has several nostalgic video games as well as early-20th-century arcade game skeeball, all for 50 cents a game.&#xa0;</p> <p>Lots of people come to Dallas expecting to see <strong>cowboys</strong> and are disappointed. But the cowboy is alive and well in Fort Worth (part of the Dallas \"metroplex\"), and nowhere more so than at the <strong>Fort Worth Stockyards </strong>(140 East Exchange Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.fortworthstockyards.org/\" title=\"\">fortworthstockyards.org</a>), a working Old West ranch which is touristy but fun. Go on a Friday or Saturday night to see the rodeo or catch a show at Billy Bob's, the country music club that bills itself as the world's largest honky tonk. Nearby at <strong>Sundance Square</strong> in downtown are hip restaurants and rooftop cocktail bars.</p> <p>If you'd rather hear some real <strong>Texas blues</strong>, head for The Goat (7248 Gaston Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatdallas.com/\" title=\"\">thegoatdallas.com</a>) and Brooklyn's (1701 South Lamar Street, <a href=\"http://www.brooklynjazzcafe.com/\" title=\"\">brooklynjazzcafe.com</a>) which have blues bands or open mic opportunities nearly every night.</p> <h2>Where to eat</h2> <p>Unless you're vegetarian, you can't visit Dallas without chowing down on some <strong>barbecue</strong>. Off the Bone (1734 South Lamar Street, +1 214 565 9551, <a href=\"http://offthebonebarbeque.com/\" title=\"\">offthebonebarbeque.com</a>) is best for ribs. Hispanic culture is huge in Texas \u2013 but Texans like to put our own spin on the classics, which is why we call it <strong>Tex-Mex</strong>. My two favourite Tex-Mex establishments are Desperados (4818 Greenville Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.desperadosrestaurant.com/index.php#\" title=\"\">desperadosrestaurant.com</a>), a family-owned joint with great fajitas, and Pepe's &amp; Mito's in Deep Ellum (2911 Elm Street, <a href=\"http://www.pepesandmitos.com/\" title=\"\">pepesandmitos.com</a>), which does chipotle wine sauce enchiladas I have had dreams about.</p> <p>Dallas is also big on street tacos, except they are not on the street. Fuel City (<a href=\"http://www.fuelcity-tacos.com/home.htm\" title=\"\">fuelcity-tacos.com</a>), Rusty Taco (<a href=\"http://www.therustytaco.com/\" title=\"\">therustytaco.com</a>), and Good 2 Go Taco (<a href=\"http://www.good2gotaco.com/\" title=\"\">good2gotaco.com</a>) are three of the best for inexpensive fajita, shrimp, and picadillo (ground beef with spices) tacos. All these places, especially Good 2 Go Taco, offer vegetarian and healthy options that are just as yummy.</p> <p>If meat is not your thing, try the healthy fare at the <strong>Dallas Farmers Market</strong> (1010 South Pearl Expressway, <a href=\"http://www.dallasfarmersmarket.org/\" title=\"\">dallasfarmersmarket.org</a>), a downtown fixture for six decades and now one of the largest public markets of its type in the country.

  "<p>I was a principal lecturer at <a href=\"http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University</a> until 2009. It is a scandal that those suffering the consequences of the mismanagement that has led to the revocation of its licence to educate non-EU students will again be the students and staff rather than the culpable (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Ban on non-EU students leaves 3,000 at risk of deportation</a>, 30 August).</p> <p>The university management under vice-chancellor Malcolm Gillies seems to have wilfully ignored warnings of things going wrong. In 2010 I wrote to Professor Gillies expressing my concerns about what I saw as widespread failure of institutional processes. A new senior management team was essential if systems and procedures were to improve, but in fact little changed and things only got worse. The government needs to focus on finding a better way of running and regulating our universities, not punishing international students for the sins of administrators and regulators.<br><strong>Dr James Chiriyankandath </strong><br><em>Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Anyone concerned about the UK's reputation overseas and London's global status as the most popular destination city for foreign students will be dismayed at the damaging and disproportionate way in which the <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency</a> has handled its dispute with London Met over its sponsorship of students from outside the EU. Of course the agency is right to expect a high level of administrative competence from trusted sponsors, so the public retains confidence in the system. It would be justified in requiring any university found wanting to improve its procedures. But pulling the rug from beneath all the university's existing non-EU students has caused unnecessary distress to people who are here legitimately and who have invested a great deal of money in their education and, thus, in the UK.</p> <p>Moreover, it has undermined an institution that plays a vital role in London's, and the UK's, educational infrastructure. For example, London Met educates more students from ethnic minorities than all of the Oxbridge colleges put together and attracts thousands of bona fide overseas students, whose fees effectively subsidise indigenous students' education.</p> <p>The harm done to Britain's reputation in their countries of origin will inevitably affect future applications to all British universities. Foreign students contributed about \u00a38bn to the UK economy in 2009. The government says it wants to encourage them, but its actions \u2013 from heavy-handed behaviour by UKBA to their illogical inclusion in the statistics on permanent migration \u2013 suggest the opposite.<br><strong>John Dickie</strong><br><em>Director of strategy and policy, </em><a href=\"http://www.london-first.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>London&#xa0;First</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 With the threat to compromise the Ecuadorean embassy's status and the continued difficulty with tourist visa processes for many prospective visitors, is there some kind of ministerial competition to see who can cause most damage to the UK's image abroad? We should welcome bona fide visitors and students, be grateful for their interest and not treat them like criminals.<br><strong>Tim Fairhurst</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I was a lecturer at one of the precursor colleges of LMU and elsewhere in higher education, so know the potential difficulties of telling second- and third-year students to transfer to another institution. While it may be appropriate to penalise LMU by withdrawing its licence to admit new first-year students, it is entirely wrong to penalise students who have got to the later stages of their courses. If the courses are still running with UK and EU students, which I assume they will be, then why not allow the non-EU students to enrol and finish their qualifications? The benefits to the students and to the reputation of UK higher education will be immense.<br><strong>Dr Roger Lowery</strong><br><em>Bromyard, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am a former Metropolitan police border control officer and, while working on the controls over the years, have witnessed some amazing decisions in relation to the admission of bogus students. There should be two major barriers to bogus students \u2013 first, the visa and, second, UK border control when the student arrives. The issuing of UK visas has been subject to cost-cutting to the extent that virtually no visa applicants are interviewed. Everything is paper/email-based (a recent decision does allow prospective Pakistani students to be interviewed, owing to the complete shambles that exists in relation to UK visas in that country).</p> <p>Despite the rhetoric, a bogus student who re-enters the UK after, say, a holiday and who is discovered as bogus by the UKBF officer (for example, if he or she is barely literate) is still allowed into the UK to appeal, and is told to report back for interview and further enquiries. Many chief immigration officers have so little faith in the system that they instruct that the \"student\" be landed even though they are clearly bogus. Virtually no bogus students who are discovered in this way are ever removed.</p> <p>Yet genuine foreign students are often treated appallingly, especially in their dealings with the Home Office. Genuine students already here should be allowed to complete their courses without undergoing the stress that this situation creates. Any task force should focus on those foreign students due to arrive in the UK over the next few days with the intention of studying at London Met. <br><strong>Chris Hobbs</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I teach ESL students in Ethiopia and Romania for the Open University, and used to teach very diverse students at LMU.

  "<p>The chef de mission of the US Paralympic team has added her voice to the row over the lack of TV coverage in the US, saying it was disappointing that American viewers were not able to see more live broadcasts of the Games.</p> <p>Aimee Mullins, a retired Paralympian, said: \"I don't know what the rationale was behind the decision, but we have a way to go. That disconnect between the US being a world leader in disability issues and the broadcast coverage in real time of the Games is disappointing.\" Her comments follow criticism of the decision by the US host broadcaster, NBC, to only show four hour-long highlights packages of the Paralympics on its sports channel.</p> <p>Mullins said she was confident US broadcasters would not be able to neglect the Games in the future. \"The fact that not just the UK, but millions of people all over the world are watching this on some of their largest television stations \u2013 Australia, France, Germany \u2013 I think that the value of Paralympics broadcast rights are going to be something that NBC won't be able to ignore.</p> <p>\"Of course I would love for more live coverage while the Games is happening, but I am less distressed about it than I was in past Paralympic years because the glory of the internet means that people aren't being deterred by the fact that it's not on NBC \u2013 they're going to the internet and watching it anyway.\"</p> <p>Since retiring from sport, Mullins has worked as a model and actor and was recently made a L'Or\u00e9al Paris brand ambassador. She has also made a name for herself as a sharp commentator on disability issues in the US, which as recently as last year she would have described as being where \"race or gender was 50 or 60 years ago\".</p> <p>\"When I watch Mad Men and I see the patronising attitudes to women that are so shocking for all of us to watch now, I feel that I've lived and see the same evolution in this regard around disability.\"</p> <p>Mullins was born without her outer shinbones and had both legs amputated below the knee; doctors said she might never walk. Instead she competed at top level of collegiate sport in the US, and competed at the Atlanta Paralympics, in the 200m, 400m and long jump, wearing one of the first pairs of Cheetah legs, the type now worn by Oscar Pistorius.</p> <p>\"I do feel that something has been happening in this last year, and I'm not saying this to be Pollyanna-like, but there's been a quantum leap,\" Mullins said.</p> <p>She points to pop culture and new sophistication in prosthetics as the reason why US attitudes towards disability are beginning to improve.</p> <p>Pulling up her trousers to reveal her woven carbon-fibre legs, she said: \"If I'm running around New York with these legs on, children come up to me with questions like: 'Where are the rocket boosters?'&#xa0;\u2026 'Why can't you fly?' 'When are you going to fix that?' It's been a paradigm shift in the last 10 years.</p> <p>\"Before, if people wanted to be polite they didn't stare, they were afraid of what they didn't understand, they didn't want to sound rude, so they don't ask questions. It creates this horrible impasse of discomfort for everyone. I feel like that's really changed because of the role of aesthetics in all this gear.\"</p> <p>The numbers of people returning with serious war injuries has also forced people to reconsider their attitudes. \"The veterans that are returning from Afghanistan and Iraq are the first generation of war veterans that, with their changed bodies, do not see themselves as 'less than'; they do not expect to have a lesser-quality of life. I think a lot of that is to do with pop culture,\" she said. \"These kids have grown up with Terminator and Robocop and Avatar and all these video games where rebuilding your body to better suit your environment is actually beneficial.\"</p> <p>This shift has helped spark new interest in the Paralympics in the US. \"The advertisements in the US \u2013 saying they were proud sponsors of the US Olympic and Paralympic team \u2013 that was also new. Coca-Cola and Samsung haven't done patronising saccharine commercials about Paralympians; they're doing beautifully shot advertisements about amazing athletic feats. It is extraordinary to run 400m in 46 seconds, it's extraordinary to do the back stroke without arms. I think that advertisers have understood that. The general population has.\"</p> <p>Despite the controversy over NBC's coverage, she pointed out that there was more coverage this year than ever before. \"I don't want to detract from that by pointing out what is lacking.\"</p> <p>Mullins said it was vital that people become more educated and open-minded about disability, not least because increased life expectancy meant it was something most people would encounter. \"At some point in every person's life you will need an assisted medical device \u2013 whether it's your glasses, your contacts, or as you age and you have a hip replacement or a knee replacement or a pacemaker. The prosthetic generation is all around us. People don't realise it, but it's going to be you&#xa0;\u2026 your parents, your child&#xa0;\u2026 but that's OK because it's never been a better time for that to happen.

No one would want a man with a PhD in political science to then write textbooks claiming that those misadventures are best medical practice.</p> <p>Society understands the architecture of academia and knows there are relevant qualifications in different fields, and the media accepts the idea of specialisations and accords greater respect to those with greater expertise. With one exception: climate science.</p> <p>When it comes to this academic discipline, it seems that if you are a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._E._North\" title=\"\">specialist in public sector food-poisoning surveillance</a> or possess a <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/06/matt-ridley-optimism-without-limits.html\" title=\"\">zoology doctorate on sexual selection in pheasants</a>, editors will seek your contrarian views more avidly than if you have qualifications in climate science and a lifetime's professional expertise. The press is further littered with climate \"heretics\" almost all of whom have academic backgrounds in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/8917737/Is-the-global-warming-scare-the-greatest-delusion-in-history.html\" title=\"\">history</a>, <a href=\"http://melaniephillips.com/fakegate-the-new-nadir-of-the-climate-change-swindle\" title=\"\">literature</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1533290/Climate-chaos-Dont-believe-it.html\" title=\"\">classics with a diploma in media studies</a>. (All these examples are true.) One <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6598056/Eco-hero-David-Bellamy-botanist-and-campaigner.html\" title=\"\">botanist</a> trying to argue that glaciers were advancing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/may/10/environment.columnists\" title=\"\">took his data (described as simply false by the World Glacier Monitoring Service) from a former architect</a>.</p> <p>I recently watched a debate between a climate scientist and that pheasant-expert-turned-journalist. An audience member asked: \"Please could you explain how it is that you are 'right' while all climate scientists are 'wrong'?\" He could not. I almost felt sorry for him. I know that he has lectured publicly on scientific heresy. I think that he wants to be Galileo.</p> <p>Contrary to the beliefs of some contrarians, academia welcomes the Galileos and encourages scepticism. It wants its hypotheses robustly tested precisely because it wants to pass those tests. Its stern system of peer review is judicious and conscientious.</p> <p>One more thing is required of academia: to play its role right at the heart of democracy. Being adequately informed is a democratic duty, just as the vote is a democratic right. A misinformed electorate, voting without knowledge, is not a true democracy. Society needs the expertise of academics in the most important issues: climate science above all.</p> <p>A democracy then needs the press to disseminate academia's knowledge and to do so with integrity. But the media's ambition to be entertaining and provocative too often overrules its respect for intellectual rigour. Journalists cannot hold degrees in every subject they report on, but their job is not to claim they know the science better than the experts, or to practise that consummate deception of pretending there is controversy when the consensus is overwhelming. But a controversy is more fun, and the media \u2013 skedaddling towards infotainment \u2013 is losing sight of the core purpose of its activity: to be a truthful messenger, in this case between the world of academia and the public.</p> <p>I would propose a system of certification for media articles in which there is a clear issue of social responsibility \u2013 a kitemark of quality assurance. It would be awarded by teams of academics, and be given to the article, not the journalist, recognising the facts, not the sometimes spurious credibility of being a \"personality\". It would be awarded when the article is accurate, using reliable sources and peer reviewed studies. There already exists the <a href=\"http://www.climaterapidresponse.org/\" title=\"\">Climate Science Rapid Response Team</a>, which answers journalists' questions to help them achieve accuracy. The formality of certification is necessary, though, for the reader to know whether to trust an article. Accuracy must not only be achieved, but be seen to have been achieved.</p> <p>The certification should be voluntary. I'm not against entertainment: if someone wants to read nonsense-mongers, let them, but I resent the appearance of parity between two articles on an issue as serious as climate change when one article is actually gibberish masked in pseudoscience and the other is well informed and accurate.</p> <p>When the pheasant expert proffered his climate-heretic views in a hugely popular book, <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/06/matt-ridley-comments.html\" title=\"\">the New Scientist gave his work to a handful of specialists</a>. According to them, the author \"completely ignores the mainstream scientific literature\", \"has a very poor understanding of the core issues\", and \"introduces confusion\". He \"cherry-picked evidence to form opinions which are unsupported by the bulk of scientific evidence\". His work was \"misleading\", and an \"ideological account\".</p> <p>So, no certification there, then. The author has fallen victim to the Galileo fallacy. Just because Galileo was a heretic doesn't make every heretic a Galileo.</p>",
  "<p>Prince Charles has described himself as a meddling prince, but prefers to describe what he does as \"mobilising\". He told an NBC documentary crew in 2010 he felt \"born into this position for a purpose\", explaining: \"I don't want my grandchildren or yours to come along and say to me: 'Why the hell didn't you come and do something about this?'\"</p> <p>So he has waded into the political sphere on pet topics, such as planning, the environment and medicine. He scrawls \"black spider memos\" to government ministers, calls secretaries of state into Clarence House for private conversations about policy, and writes confidential notes to high-level contacts to get planning matters changed.</p> <p>As his influence has grown, so has interest in understanding how that influence operates. Anyone trying to find out quickly discovers that an edifice of state-enabled secrecy surrounds the prince's power.</p> <p>In recent years, cracks have begun to appear and royal aides and ministers are now battling on several fronts to maintain discretion around Charles's interventions.</p> <p>This autumn a seven-year campaign by the Guardian to expose some of Charles's letters to ministers in seven Whitehall departments enters its final stages. The government is resisting the application, which will be decided by a freedom of information tribunal. Ministers are relying on a \"well-established constitutional doctrine that the heir to throne has a right and duty to be instructed in the business of government in preparation for the time when he himself will be the sovereign\".</p> <p>On the environment, the tribunal last year ruled that the Duchy of Cornwall must be considered a public authority and therefore should release information about its impact. The ruling stemmed from a request by environmental campaigner Michael Bruton, who was concerned about the Duchy leasing waters for farming Pacific oysters in the Lower Fal and Helford intertidal area in Cornwall. Bruton asked the Duchy what assessments it had made of the environmental impact of the lease. The Duchy refused to answer, saying it was a private estate. The judgment means that many of the activities of the estate that provides Charles with a \u00a317m-a-year private income should be made public, although it is being challenged by the prince's lawyers.</p> <p>In February the information commissioner ordered the release of a limited number of papers that show how the prince was consulted over the marine and coastal access bill, but it was decided many others should remain confidential.</p> <p>The bad news for freedom of information campaigners is that rules on disclosure around royal dealings with government are getting tighter. Changes to the Freedom of Information Act in 2010 granted the heir to the throne an absolute exemption from the release of details about his contacts with ministers and senior civil servants.</p>",
  "<p>Some international conferences can be turgid events during which policy wonks compete to inflict a didactic death by PowerPoint on their audience.</p> <p>But World Water Week is a rare thing: a genuinely useful talkfest. It's where representatives from governments, aid agencies, business, the research community and NGOs come together to share ideas, form partnerships and exchange knowledge. It's the place to be every August if you're struggling to fix a water or river-related problem, or if you have bright ideas that might be helpful to others.</p> <p>This week's hot topic has been the nexus. It might sound like the latest electric car coming out of Korea but in fact this is policy jargon for the profound, but sometimes hidden, links between the fast-growing demand for food, water and energy.</p> <p>In a nutshell, the upward trend in global population combined with rapid development in many emerging economies means that demand for food and electricity is sky-rocketing. Water is a critical and irreplaceable ingredient in the production of both. So, in many parts of the world, withdrawals of water from the world's rivers, lakes and aquifers now exceed the rate at which nature can replenish flows.</p> <p>As 1980s beat combo Depeche Mode might have put it, had they sung about water, \"we just can't get enough.\"</p> <p>WWF's most recent <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/\" title=\"\">Living Planet Report</a> highlighted the disastrous impacts of such unsustainable water withdrawals on freshwater biodiversity.</p> <p>How do you solve a problem like the nexus? Well, there is no silver bullet. But one part of the puzzle is better water allocation.</p> <p>Essentially this involves smarter decisions about who gets water, how much, and when. In an ideal world such decisions would balance economic efficiency, socially equity and, of course, environmentally sustainability.</p> <p>We don't live in an ideal world. Water withdrawals are often none of the above. And when water becomes scarce, environmental sustainability is normally the first thing to go.</p> <p>In recent years, WWF has looked closely at how sophisticated techniques and tools can be used to bring about better water allocation decisions. At an event on Tuesday, I helped to present our most recent work on the issue, the result of a close collaboration with China's Ministry of Water.</p> <p>China is concerned that lack of water might act as a brake on development. The OECD said this week that it is now looking at the topic. Corporate giants such as SABMiller and Coca-Cola are also stepping up efforts to address business risk from water scarcity. It's an issue which commands the attention of powerful economic players, as well as conservation groups.</p> <p>And it's an international problem, affecting most of us. Even in rainy old England over-allocation of water is becoming more of an issue.</p> <p>The nexus, water scarcity and water allocation are serious issues, among the great challenges facing the world in the 21st Century. </p> <p><em>Dave Tickner is head of freshwater at WWF-UK</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Leading shares ended an uncertain week on a downbeat note, despite a rebound in mining companies after their recent falls.</p> <p>The sector had been hit by worries about a global economic slowdown, particularly in China, which in turn led to falling metal prices, with iron ore especially weak. But investors seemed to feel the declines may have been overdone and dipped their toes back in the water, albeit fairly tentatively.</p> <p>So <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 6.5p to 593p while precious metals miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> finished 18p higher at \u00a315.61 and Rio Tinto rose 20p to 2735.5p.</p> <p><strong>Glencore</strong> shook off the prospect of a collapse in its proposed merger with <strong>Xstrata</strong>, adding 27.6p to 385.05p. Qatar, the second largest investor in Xstrata, confirmed on Thursday it would vote against the deal unless the terms were improved, while fellow shareholder Knight Vincke was also negative.</p> <p>But analyst Ash Lazenby at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Glencore should strongly outperform the sector from here whatever the outcome on the deal. Glencore/Xstrata is the cheapest major on a merged basis and has no exposure to plummeting iron ore, standalone Glencore is by far the cheapest and has the best free cash flow metrics and earnings momentum. <br> We retain our buy recommendation on Glencore and hold on Xstrata, and while we see limited downside to Xstrata on a break we estimate 25% outperformance in Glencore. </blockquote> <p>Xstrata added 51.2p to 952.2p.</p> <p>But <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation </strong>missed out, falling 4.6p to 301.9p as Nomura issued a reduce recommendation and cut its target price from 400p to 375p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished at 5711.48, down 7.97 points on the day and around 65 points on the shortened Bank Holiday week.</p> <p>Investors had spent much of the time since Tuesday's market open waiting for Ben Bernanke's words of wisdom at Friday's US Federal Reserve's annual meeting at Jackson Hole. There was much anticipation the Fed chairman would unveil further measures to boost the US economy, such as another round of quantitative easing. In the event he did not specifically indicate further action, but nor did he rule it out. So the market is now betting on something happening at the next Fed meeting on 13 September.</p> <p>Meanwhile attention will shift next week to the European Central Bank's meeting, with hopes of action to ease the eurozone crisis boosted by news that ECB president Mario Draghi had cancelled a planned trip to Jackson Hole. Optimists saw this as confirmation the ECB was busy at work on new measures to help alleviate the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>Among the fallers, <strong>Barclays</strong> ended 0.25p lower at 183.25p. On Thursday the bank appointed retail banker Antony Jenkins as its new chief executive in place of Bob Diamond, who left after the libor-fixing scandal. His task is not helped by the bank facing a Serious Fraud Office investigation into payments made when the bank tapped Middle Eastern investors for emergency funds in 2008.</p> <p>Marketing group <strong>WPP</strong> lost another 3.5p to 815p following Thursday's cut in its annual growth forecast as clients in the US and western Europe became more cautious about their advertising spending. Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We move to hold from buy as we see limited near-term catalysts, but will revisit when the third and fourth quarters become clearer. Outlook reduction is a disappointment but not a disaster, in our view, and fundamental attractions remain, i.e. international/emerging exposure. Shares may drift for now, and we believe it would be interesting to look to buy on any general market setback. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>BAE Systems</strong> has returned around \u00a32bn to shareholders over the past two years, but analysts suggested this golden period could be coming to an end.</p> <p>With defence budgets coming under pressure, particularly in the company's key US market which is facing cuts of up to $1bn, Morgan Stanley said there was less room for BAE to mount more buybacks. It put an equalweight rating on the shares, which nevertheless edged up 3.2p to 318.5p.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, online gaming group <strong>Bwin.party Digital</strong> dropped 4.9p to 94.1p. Half year profits climbed 13% to \u20ac92m but there was some caution on the outlook and the prospects of regulation in Germany, its largest market in terms of revenue.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Beowulf Mining</strong>, where Sweeney star Ray Winstone invested, rose nearly 3% to 9.75p after positive assay results from its Kallak north project in Sweden, with high grades of iron ore over a wider area than expected.</p>",
  "<p>A little-known power enjoyed by the Queen and Prince of Wales to alter new laws is due to be exposed after the government lost a legal battle to keep details of its application private.</p> <p>The information commissioner has ruled that the Cabinet Office must publish an internal Whitehall guide to the way the senior royals are consulted before legislation is introduced to ensure it does not harm their private interests.</p> <p>The application of the controversial veto was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/30/prince-charles-offered-veto-legislation\" title=\"\">revealed by the Guardian</a> last year and has been described by constitutional lawyers as \"a royal nuclear deterrent\". Some believe it may underpin the influence Prince Charles appears to wield in Whitehall over pet issues ranging from architecture to healthcare.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2012/aug/31/ruling-royal-veto-guidelines\" title=\"\">A judgment issued last week</a> by the deputy information commissioner, Graham Smith, means the Cabinet Office has until 25 September to release the confidential internal manual. It details how the consent of \"The Crown and The Duchy of Cornwall\" is obtained before bills are passed into law and what criteria ministers apply before asking the royals to amend draft laws. If it fails to do so it could face high court action.</p> <p>In the past two parliamentary sessions Charles has been asked to consent to at least 12 draft bills on everything from wreck removals to co-operative societies. Between 2007 and 2009 he was consulted on bills relating to coroners, economic development and construction, marine and coastal access, housing and regeneration, energy and planning. In Charles's case, the little-known power stems from his role as the head of the \u00a3700m Duchy of Cornwall estate, which provides his \u00a317m-a-year private income.</p> <p>The government battled to keep the manual secret, claiming publication would breach legal professional privilege, and a spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office said it was still deciding whether to challenge the ruling at the information tribunal.</p> <p>Lord Berkeley, a Labour peer who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2011/oct/30/letter-marine-navigation-bill?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">told to seek Charles's consent</a> on a marine navigation bill, said the commissioner's decision was \"absolutely right\". He said publication could shed light on a little-known procedure that allows the prince and the Queen \"to fiddle around with bills to make sure they don't affect their private interests\".</p> <p>\"People will start thinking, what the hell is going on?\" he said. \"We are in the 21st century, not the 18th century and it is crazy to think they are even trying to do this. The royal family should give up this special privilege and we should all obey the law of the land. Just because they have private estates, private incomes and land from several centuries ago doesn't mean they should have the right to interfere.\"</p> <p>The latest crack in the edifice of secrecy around Charles's influence on public life came after a legal scholar, John Kirkhope, asked for Whitehall's internal manuals on consulting the royals. He said it was \"clearly in the public interest that citizens understand how laws are made and applied as well as the circumstances in which the Duchy of Cornwall is consulted\".</p> <p>Kirkhope was researching a university thesis about the legal status of the duchy and wanted to know how ministers decided whether new laws affected the \"hereditary revenues, personal property of the Duke [Charles] or other interests\".</p> <p>The Duchy of Cornwall runs farms and industrial property, builds houses and acts as a landlord as well as taking responsibility for large areas of the natural environment in south-west England. Its interests often overlap with Charles's own in areas such as town planning where past interventions in public debate have seen the prince accused of abusing his influence to distort the democratic process.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/25/chelsea-barracks-trial-prince-charles\" title=\"\">In 2009 Charles caused a storm</a> when he stepped into the public planning debate for the Chelsea Barracks housing development designed by Richard Rogers. He privately complained to the site's owner, the prime minister of Qatar, that the design was \"a gigantic experiment with the very soul of our capital city\". Rogers was promptly sacked and the scheme redrawn in line with the prince's tastes.</p> <p>Kirkhope said evidence he had gathered suggested the process of seeking royal consent for draft bills was not a mere formality. \"The correspondence indicates that the effects of the bills are explained to the royal household, including the Duchy of Cornwall, discussions ensue and if necessary changes are made to proposed legislation,\" he said. \"Departments of state have fought to avoid releasing correspondence which gives some hint of how the process works and the Cabinet Office has resisted releasing details of the guidance which determines whether the prince as Duke of Cornwall is consulted in the first place.</p> <p>\"As a citizen of this country I have a proper interest in ensuring the process by which laws are made should be transparent and that those who are given special privileges should be accountable. That is demonstrably not the case with regard to the Duchy of Cornwall.\"</p> <p>Earlier in August Kirkhope forced the government to release edited emails showing how the Ministry of Justice consulted Buckingham Palace in 2008 and 2009 over the detail of the apprenticeships bill and how it would affect the Queen \"in her personal capacity\". As an employer of 1,200 staff the royal household stood to be affected, along with thousands of other employers. The civil servants wanted to know \"Her Majesty's intentions in relation to the bill\" before its second reading in the House of Commons.</p> <p>One email refers to a note from the Queen's solicitors, Farrer and Co, \"setting out his instructions in relation to the application of the apprenticeships bill to Her Majesty in her personal capacity\".</p> <p>The official states: \"I understand from our discussion today that it might not be possible for what they want to happen without there being express provision in the bill\".</p> <p>It echoes correspondence released last year in which a minister wrote to the prince's office requesting his consent to a new planning bill because it was \"capable of applying to ... [the] Prince of Wales' private interests\".</p> <p>Buckingham Palace and Clarence House released a joint statement in response to the information commissioner's ruling. \"The royal household understands that the Cabinet Office is considering the information commissioner's decision and next step,\" it said. \"It would not be a matter for the royal household to challenge any decision.\"</p>",
  "<p>The world's biggest offshore windfarm could be built off the northern Scottish coast, after a scheme with enough capacity to power 40% of Scottish households was submitted for planning permission.</p> <p>The \u00a34.5bn complex would have 339 turbines covering 300 square kilometres off Caithness, making it 50% bigger than the giant London Array scheme off Kent. It is expected to be the first in a series of deep water schemes under \"Round 3\" licensing.</p> <p>The renewable industry has hailed it as a watershed moment but warned these new deep water farms might only be fully realised if the government provides policy stability by pushing through its proposed Energy Bill.</p> <p>The 1.5-gigawatt farm is being developed by Moray Offshore Renewables, a joint venture between Spanish oil company Repsol, and an arm of Portuguese power group EDP, which has recently become partly owned by China's state-owned Three Gorges Corporation.</p> <p>Dan Finch, project director for the scheme due to come on stream in 2018, said working more than 12 miles from shore allowed it to take advantage of the excellent wind resource in the outer Moray Firth.</p> <p>\"We estimate that the project will be capable of supplying the electricity needs of 800,000 to 1m households ... Each year this development could save between 3.5m and 4.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide compared with coal fired generation, and between 1.5m and 2m tonnes of carbon dioxide compared with gas fired generation,\" he said.</p> <p>The industry body, RenewableUK, said a further 4.5 gigawatts of offshore wind schemes should follow into the planning process this year with a total of 18 gigawatts expected to become operational over the next eight years.</p> <p>But Maria McCaffery, RenewableUK's chief executive, emphasised that this progress could only be achieved if the policy certainty laid out in the upcoming Energy Bill was achieved.</p> <p>\"We're marking a watershed moment as Round Three starts to become a reality with this planning application. It's the first of many coming forward. As well as delivering secure supplies of low carbon electricity to British homes and businesses, our global leadership role in offshore wind can provide tens of thousands of jobs across the country, building and maintaining these turbines.\"</p> <p>The Moray Firth wind farm, which will be given significant subsidies, compares with the 1-gigawatt at the London Array, which is currently in the construction phase, and compares with the largest British coal-fired plant, Drax in northern Yorkshire of 4 gigawatts, and the planned new EDF nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset with a combined output of 3.2 gigawatts and a bill of at least \u00a310bn.</p> <p>China Three Gorges Corporation acquired a 21% holding from the cash-strapped Portuguese government in Energias de Portugal, EDP, for \u20ac2.69bn (\u00a32.13bn). The Beijing-based energy company was responsible for construction of the also controversial Three Gorges Dam-project, the world largest hydroelectric power plant, that went into operation in 2008.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 September 2012 to remove a reference to Donald Trump opposing the windfarm off Caithness because he believes the turbines will spoil the view from his new golf course. That objection relates to a different offshore windfarm project near his Aberdeenshire golf course.</p>",

  "<p>Four years ago I had never heard of the Paralympic Games, let alone watched them. The word \"disability\" was not in my vocabulary. I was in the Royal Marines, surrounded by the most able bodied guys you could possibly imagine. If ever someone did get blown up, they were quickly taken away elsewhere. As a sports fanatic I loved watching the Olympic Games when I could but as an able-bodied bloke it never even crossed my mind to watch the Paralympic Games.</p> <p>It took an horrific accident to open up my eyes to the world of Paralympic sport. In the television coverage we are working on now it is one of our most important aims to give people that insight into the sport without having to go through a tortuous journey of their own. Because it seems to me that the world has been missing out \u2013 the Paralympics is incredible. I've been alive since 1986 and it pains me to think of all the Paralympics I've missed. And I genuinely feel that I have missed out \u2013 on Seoul, on Barcelona, on Atlanta, on Sydney, on Athens and on Beijing. All those incredible sporting moments \u2013 my life would have been much richer for&#xa0;them.</p> <p>Watching the opening ceremony was phenomenal. Apparently 11&#xa0;million people seemed to think so too \u2013 Channel&#xa0;4's highest viewing figures in a decade. The public seem to be embracing the event in a way we have never seen before \u2013 open minded, and without preconceived ideas. The whole concept of the Paralympic Games is that it should be on a par with the Olympic games. On Wednesday night, with the energy, the crowds, the volunteers, the fireworks, the noise, that really was the case. To have Stephen Hawking at the centre of it all, a genius with a truly global profile who for many symbolises what can be achieved as a disabled person, was awesome. A lot of people tweeted to say you couldn't have found anyone more appropriate to the job, and I agree.</p> <p>So why do I love the Paralympics? There are 4,260 athletes competing and every single one has a story of overcoming the most adverse conditions imaginable. I have to admit to being an emotional man \u2013 when I see those athletes stood on the podiums it brings tears to my&#xa0;eyes.</p> <p>Some people argue that the classifications detract from the sport but I really enjoy those complexities. For me it taps into that vein of nerdy sporting obsessive, going down the pub and correcting each other: \"No, no, no, he's a T34.\" I love all that. Anyway, it's not as unfamiliar as you may think, when you remember that other sports, such as boxing, have similar classifications.</p> <p>And you cannot help but be inspired. These athletes train just as hard as their Olympic colleagues but on top of that they have to go through the daily rigours of dealing with their disability. Look at some of the more severely disabled athletes, such as the boccia players, they've got to manage care schedules, make sure their medication does not contravene anti-doping rules, face the logistical problems of getting to and from their training base, as well as deal with the additional level of fatigue that many disabled people suffer from. It's mind blowing. Able-bodied people could look at what those athletes are doing through commitment and dedication and realise just how much the human body can achieve.</p> <p>It is not entirely true that I never came into contact with anyone disabled in the marines. There was one exceptional guy, Captain Jim Booney. He was the first to be allowed back into the corps after becoming disabled \u2013 he had his foot amputated following a climbing accident. It was a ground-breaking decision by the Ministry of Defence that took us all by&#xa0;surprise.</p> <p>Quite honestly we were stunned. I remember thinking: \"Wow, that guy must be seriously impressive if he can do all that with one metal foot.\"</p> <p>He had to pass all of the same fitness and commando tests as everyone else, which he did. He was a true inspiration. That was in 2004 and I've been delighted to see a number of disabled marines working as Gamesmakers around the Olympic Park.</p> <p>It just shows how far we, as a society, have come in the last decade or so. I hope that these Games will play an important role in seeing us through an equally progressive next 10 years.</p> <p><em>Arthur Williams is a former Royal Marine and Paralympic cyclist.

  "<p>When clubs hurl vast amounts into the transfer market they will often convince themselves that those sums are just the premiums paid on an insurance policy. Status is supposed to be secure thereafter.</p> <p>The logic is easy to follow among the well-funded managers. Roberto Di Matteo, for instance, was bound to bolster the Chelsea squad. The only issue more frightening than the expenditure is the prospect of decline if substantial sums are not spent.</p> <p>Financial fair play regulations should eventually check that impulse, but few doubted how Chelsea would conduct themselves this summer. Victory over Bayern Munich in the Champions League final came in a penalty shootout. It could just as easily have gone against them and the club might currently have been telling itself that the Europa League holds a subtle charm.</p> <p>Chelsea appreciated that the lineup needed an infusion of flair. So it was with that they handed over some \u00a332m to take Eden Hazard from Lille. His immediate impact made it look as if the economics of football might have a semblance of good sense and the same might be said of Oscar, the 20-year-old midfielder who cost \u00a325m from the Brazilian club Internacional.</p> <p>There are indeed all too many examples to remind us that footballers never really come with a warranty, no matter how much is spent. It is Andy Carroll who at present reminds managers that a hefty outlay puts their reputation and even job prospects at stake.</p> <p>Indeed, the \u00a335m that Liverpool handed over to Newcastle United for Carroll would have been a prominent issue when the decision was being taken to sack Kenny Dalglish. The new manager, Brendan Rodgers, has packed off the striker to West Ham on loan.</p> <p>Investing in the transfer market is bound to be excruciating on occasion. Footballers, as with any human being, can be disoriented when they swap one environment for another. People tend to forget just how Carroll flourished with Newcastle. The 2010-11 campaign showed then that he could act as rather more than a target man.</p> <p>The first half of that season, before the January switch to Anfield, had seen him find the net against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City. There was no cause to suppose that his success depended on bullying the weak. At the time, Dalglish had not appeared eccentric or foolish in buying such a player, even if the fee itself was large.</p> <p>Managers may find it a little easier to maintain perspective in the summer than they do in the throes of mid-season anxiety, but the pressure is still there to an extent. Roberto Mancini seemed to have an array of targets at Manchester City, ranging from the seasoned Maicon at Internazionale to the young Scott Sinclair, who has arrived from Swansea City.</p> <p>The cost hardly registers with the public when clubs of outlandish means enter the marketplace, but many managers are obliged to take care. Arsenal sell well and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is practised when explaining why he does not buy at those sort of prices. Nuri Sahin, of Real Madrid, eluded him and has gone on loan to Liverpool instead, but the Arsenal manager remarked that he already had a midfielder of that sort in Jack Wilshere.</p> <p>This, of course, rather ignored the fact that an ankle injury stopped him from playing last season and he has yet to show he is ready for a return to the intensity of the Premier League. Wenger appreciates that Arsenal still have to pay off the debt incurred in building the Emirates, although that sum is under \u00a3100m after standing at \u00a3318m in 2008.</p> <p>Many managers have to be careful in their spending and Sir Alex Ferguson comes into that category. He has splashed out on Robin van Persie, but there is the shrewdness of an individual whose means were extremely limited in the early days of his career. At \u00a317m, the price paid for Borussia Dortmund's Shinji Kagawa will be a coup if he proves any sort of successor to Paul Scholes.</p> <p>Clubs will also pay readily to acquire a sense of security. At a cost of \u00a39m, Jan Vertonghen might well provide some solidity at the core of the Tottenham Hotspur defence as the new manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, goes about his work. There are interesting projects everywhere and, for instance, Martin O'Neill's effort to get a reliable contribution out of Adam Johnson, following a \u00a310m transfer from Manchester City, should be intriguing.</p> <p>Mark Hughes's project is on a larger scale than most, his total of acquisitions for Queens Park Rangers in double figures. A 5-0 loss to Swansea implied that the assimilation process had barely begun, but at least there has since been a draw at Norwich City.</p> <p>Outcomes are always difficult to predict. As managers may often complain, footballers, regardless of the cost, are as unpredictable as the rest of the human race.</p>",
  "<p>The UK Border Agency's decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-visa-revoked?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">withdraw London Metropolitan University's licence to accept non-EU students</a> has meant the suspension of study and threat of deportation for 2,000 international students, and financial crisis for a university already struggling to stay afloat. The agency's justification is London Met's \"systemic failure\" to account for the immigration status of its international students. But why has the survival of a university, whose raison d'\u00eatre is to educate, come to depend on its ability to control the UK's borders?</p> <p>One <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/30/lmu-student-recruitment-teaching-learning?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">London Met lecturer has written anonymously claiming</a> of his institution that: \"This is not a university that is run well. The UK Border Agency basically says as much.\" Is this what higher education has come to? That people allow an agency that has nothing to do with education to judge whether or not a university is \"run well\". She/he hopes that the agency's decision will mean the elimination of those students whose English is not up to scratch. Rather than cutting them loose, the solution to students struggling with English skills, whether home or international, is to provide them with extra support \u2013 difficult of course in a climate of budget cuts, but not impossible, and my own university is testament to this.</p> <p>It is obscene that those students already in the UK at a well-established institution will be uprooted from their homes and have their legitimate expectation to complete their studies dashed.</p> <p>The agency's move has been criticised on a number of fronts, seen as part of a wider attack by the coalition government on education institutions already suffering the effects of hikes in tuition fees and cuts to public funding. A <a href=\"http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/amnesty-for-international-students-at-london-metropolit.html\" title=\"\">petition</a> calls for an amnesty for the thousands of international students whose studies have been terminated, and urges that they be allowed to complete their studies while \"the problems at London Met are addressed\". While an amnesty for these students is absolutely necessary, a fundamental perspective is missing from the debate: universities should never have been made to play the role of immigration and border control officials. The role of universities is to educate, not to police.</p> <p>The sponsorship system devised by the border agency permits universities to accept international students on to their courses on condition that they enforce immigration controls. According to the agency, the system is based on the principle that \"those who benefit most directly from migration \u2026 help to prevent the system being abused\". It seems fair to assume that the agency is alluding here to the universities reaping the economic benefits of international students through charging extortionate fees. But universities should not be in such a poorly funded condition that they have to economically exploit international students.</p> <p>Of course the true benefit brought by international students is their contribution to the creation of a multicultural environment which enriches the learning experience and expands the horizons of all on campus. But rather than welcome these students, the message from a government fixated on immigration control, spurred on by anti-immigration groups keen to blame migrants for society's ills, is to treat them as suspected scroungers or potential terrorists. Under-pressure university administrations insist lecturers police their classes to prevent those without a valid visa entering, monitor levels of \"radicalism\" among students, and take registers to record the attendance of international students even where attendance is not compulsory. Such discrimination in the classroom goes against the ethical principles and traditions of academia, sowing mistrust and corrupting the atmosphere within universities.</p> <p>How convenient then for the government that the debate over the revocation of London Met's sponsorship licence has skipped over the fundamental problem: that government policy treats international students as cash cows and turns universities and their staff into henchmen of its invidious immigration system.</p>",

  "<p>Many moons ago, megatrends guru <a href=\"http://www.naisbitt.com/\" title=\"\">John Naisbitt</a> analysed print media to get a sense of where the world was headed. In the dog days of August, in the spirit (but not style) of Naisbitt, we decided to buy every business magazine we could lay our hands on \u2013 tearing them apart as we hunted for evidence on whether coverage in key media sees us heading towards one of two scenarios: breakdown or breakthrough.</p> <p>Breakdown is the 100% negative scenario. A world in which early experiments and enthusiasm fade in the face of wider incomprehension and resistance to change. Our businesses, cities and economies overshoot ecological limits, bringing the planetary roof down on our heads.</p> <p>And then there is the breakthrough scenario, which increasingly shapes and informs our own agenda. This assumes that, with the usual ups and downs and ins and outs, the trajectory of our societies and economies is pointed toward a very different set of outcomes \u2013 in fields as disparate, but still intimately interlinked, as population growth, pandemics, poverty, pollution and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Cutting across both main scenarios, there are change-as-usual initiatives.</p> <p>These are often worth having, but fail to address the nature and scale of the challenges we now face. The assumption here, reinforced by the relative failure of this year's Rio+20 summit, is that political leaders, investors, and the global C-suite proceed at a dangerously relaxed, incremental pace. There are plenty of projects designed to boost efficiency and effectiveness, to satisfy and even exceed customer needs and wants, but the need for system change is largely ignored.</p> <p>So out we went, prowling through newsagents and grabbing armfuls of magazines as we travelled across Europe.</p> <p>We devoured business magazines such as Bloomberg Business Week, the Economist, Fast Company, Forbes, Fortune, the Grocer, the Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review, Money Week, the New Economy, Wired and World Finance.</p> <p>We also pored over mainstream newspapers such as El Pa\u00eds and Le Monde; news magazines such as New African, Newsweek, New Statesman and Time; policy journals and magazines such as Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy and New Internationalist; design magazines such as 3D World; and general interest magazines including American Scientist, Dazed &amp; Confused, Intelligent Life, Monocle, New Scientist, Rolling Stone, Surface and Wallpaper.</p> <p>A quick-and-dirty analysis showed a striking pattern, which won't come as news to anyone who thinks the media only report the bad stuff: themes linked to a range of breakdown scenarios dominated many of the publications.</p> <p>Typical stories focused on the civil war in Syria, self-immolations in Tibet, banking scandals in the UK, zero growth in the French economy, the worst year for forest fires in Spain (at a time when fire services are being cut back as part of the national austerity drive), Rolling Stone's <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\" title=\"\">astounding piece</a> by Bill McKibben on the \"terrifying new math\" of climate change, the coming pensions crunch as populations age, and online piracy. To name but a few.</p> <p>In contrast to the profusion of breakdown stories, change-as-usual solutions seemed to be significantly less well represented. No surprise, perhaps, given that things such as corporate social responsibility, sustainability reporting and stakeholder engagement have gone mainstream and so aren't particularly newsworthy. That said, the middle ground still shows signs of considerable innovation and creativity, with both articles and ads featuring eco-celebrities, including sustainability focused fashion designer <a href=\"http://www.eileenfisher.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Eileen Fisher</a>.</p> <p>Particularly striking was the sheer amount of advertising for electric vehicles: Nissan and its LEAF; Audi with its e-tron, \"the future of electric mobility;\" and the BMWi offering to place you in what its manufacturer calls \"the state of sustainability\". Just as in the early 80s every new car had to be a four-wheel drive, in 2012 it seems it has to be sustainable.</p> <p>And it was slightly weird, in parallel, to see the way the green waves have been spreading to companies in different parts of the world, particularly where they advertise in western media. Take Hyundai in the Week. \"Think everything isn't linked together? Think again,\" the company says, promoting its own branded form of eco-efficient mobility, <a href=\"http://www.hyundaiix20.co.uk/hyundai-blue-drive/\" title=\"\">Blue Drive</a>. \"Like ripples in a pond,\" the ad notes, \"everything we do affects the world around us. That's why Hyundai is dedicated to the development of sustainable, eco-friendly vehicles.\" The last line: \"Because together, we can turn the smallest ripple into a cleansing wave.\"</p> <p>Hmmm. That's likely to be a breakthrough only if you believe the answer to our access and mobility needs is a personal automobile, whereas a system-level breakthrough might involve urban design, public transit systems or, at the very least, novel car-sharing schemes. Fully in the breakthrough space, by contrast, is Fortune magazine with its <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/13/news/companies/patagonia-yvon-chouinard.fortune/index.html\" title=\"\">wildly positive story</a> on Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and the cooperative business movement (the New Internationalist).</p> <p>At a time when it is increasingly clear that we need to open out the focus from individual companies and their supply chains to wider market dynamics, and ultimately to the cultural context, it was interesting to see one of our favourite business magazines, Fast Company, spotlighting what it calls the <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/women-heroes/2012\" title=\"\">League of Extraordinary Women</a>, some of these innovators dealing with breakdown challenges, some active in change-as-usual settings (albeit with higher ambitions), and some explicitly aiming for breakthrough.</p> <p>We also found a fair amount of coverage of the growing power of civil society in countries such as Japan and China, the repercussions of the Pussy Riot trial in Russia, and the emergence of high-octane NGOs like the <a href=\"http://theblackfish.org/\" title=\"\">Black Fish Network</a>.</p> <p>But what to do if you want to breakthrough but are stuck in an incumbent business? Professor Bob Eccles and his colleagues give advice on how to create a sustainable company in the <a href=\"http://sloanreview.mit.edu/the-magazine/2012-summer/53415/how-to-become-a-sustainable-company/\" title=\"\">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>. The leaders of sustainable companies, they conclude, are different because they take a long-term view; have a clear direction in mind; are more willing to tolerate risk; and are more knowledgeable about sustainability themes.</p> <p>Overall, what struck us in the breakthrough zone was that, almost regardless of where we looked, positive coverage of innovation, enterprise and entrepreneurs has been going through the stratosphere. One of the most striking examples of the trend was Surface magazine's coverage of <a href=\"http://www.surfacemag.com/blog/fashion/6407-just-in-time-for-the-london-olympics-nike-takes-zero-waste-to-the-masses/\" title=\"\">Nike's zero waste strategy</a>. (When asked for current examples of breakthrough initiatives, we often point to the sportswear industry's <a href=\"http://www.roadmaptozero.com\" title=\"\">Roadmap to Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals</a>.)</p> <p>We have already covered a fair amount of ground with our Breakthrough Capitalism program, with a first progress <a href=\"http://www.roadmaptozero.com\" title=\"\">report now posted</a>, but as we move into the next phase one key objective will be to help boost the coverage of breakthrough innovation, entrepreneurship, finance and policy-making.</p> <p>There's an open invitation to join us for the next magazine-ripping session, sometime next year.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chairman of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

  "<h2>The skills deficit</h2> <p>Things sometimes make no sense. On one hand, companies are saying they are worried about a skills shortage that will hinder their move towards greater sustainability. They rightly point out that an economy producing 80% less carbon will look radically different and are uncertain as to where they will find people with the skills that will enable them to deliver against that ambition.</p> <p>On the other hand, one in five young people are out of work \u2013 the highest figure since records began. Many need support and training if they are to find work that is fulfilling and rewarding.</p> <p>A large number of those young people hope that this work will be in sustainability. A recent <a href=\"http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2011/sky_future_leaders\" title=\"\">Future Leaders Survey by Sky</a> discovered that 96% of respondents plan on being involved with sustainability in their careers. A <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalactionplan.org.uk%2Fsites%2Fgap%2Ffiles%2FGreenprint%2520to%25202020%2520-%2520Research%2520results%2520Summary.pdf&amp;ei=aZNAUJXbGcjX0QW0qoCoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNG728RHyVjEso0UJkWoDa_eep9Xkg&amp;sig2=CXCfTtJ9UpbCokA4xb7ZXA\" title=\"\">YouGov survey of 16-24-year-olds commissioned by Global Action Plan</a> found that 80% would like to see more environmental science and engineering taught in schools due to increasing demand for these skills.</p> <p>So clearly there seems to be a mismatch between the learning that young people are receiving through formal education, their aspirations and the skills that businesses will need in the future. Any chance of this changing soon seems remote. Embedding sustainability in the national curriculum looks like an ever-receding possibility and higher education establishments are painfully slow to embrace the challenge.</p> <h2>How companies are responding</h2> <p>Against this backdrop, some progressive companies are looking at how they can leverage the fact that sustainability may be a growth industry of the future to address the growing social problem of youth unemployment.</p> <p>One example of a business contributing to skills training is Accenture. The company's global corporate citizenship focus is <a href=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/company/citizenship/Pages/skills-succeed.aspx\" title=\"\">Skills to Succeed</a>, an initiative that by 2015 will equip 250,000 people around the world with the skills to get a job or build a business. Through its work in communities across the UK and around the world, skills training can make a lasting impact on the economic wellbeing of individuals and their communities. In particular, making sure young people have the right skills to build confidence and capabilities that will open doors to employment and independence is key.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.globalactionplan.org.uk/accenture-and-global-action-plan-help-young-people-gain-green-skills\" title=\"\">Global Action Plan is working with Accenture</a> to provide 1,300 unemployed young people with accredited training in sustainability and energy management. Many of the young people are a long way from being work-ready and the basic training provided is an essential part of the journey that will help them gain employment.</p> <p>However, young people are rightly cynical about training schemes that lead to qualifications which don't necessarily help them into work. They want concrete evidence that there is a light at the end of the training tunnel.</p> <p>With the Accenture-funded trainees, <a href=\"http://www.globalactionplan.org.uk/green-skills-young-unemployed\" title=\"\">30 young people will be given the opportunity to receive further training</a> to enable them to become domestic energy or Green Deal assessors.</p> <p>Another example is Camelot. As operator of the UK National Lottery, the company raises millions of pounds every year for good causes, but it realises that it can also benefit society through its Community Investment programme. The company is targeting this investment at tackling social inclusion issues in the communities in which it works. It recognises that youth unemployment is one of the most pressing issues at this time, with many young people facing a bleak future.</p> <p>Camelot is aiming to help the UK's future work force gain key training and experience and ultimately make them more economically viable. This reduces their vulnerability to social problems. In partnership with Global Action Plan, one of the new delivery partners of <a href=\"http://nationalcitizenservice.direct.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">National Citizen Service</a> (NCS), a flagship government initiative, it has helped 70 16- and 17-year-olds from some of the most deprived London boroughs take part in three weeks personal and social development training over the summer holidays. The training included a residential week at the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales \u2013 a long way removed from the inner London boroughs.</p> <p>As part of the NCS programme participants develop their own social action projects, in this case, community-based sustainability projects covering issues as varied as eco-fashion and sustainable food. For many, developing and delivering such a project was daunting so Camelot offered mentoring support and further training from their own employees. In reality these sessions proved equally enlightening for Camelot staff as they got first-hand experience of the challenges faced by the young people and their level of innovative creativity.</p> <p>Camelot is now offering one of the young people the chance to become employed in their CSR team, which will help to ensure that future activities will be informed by one of the people they are setting out to help.</p> <h2>A long-term solution?</h2> <p>Both Accenture and Camelot should be applauded for developing innovative schemes that are meeting significant social and environmental problems. Hopefully other companies will follow their lead. However, initiatives such as this should be the icing on the cake. More importantly, our educational institutions should wake up to the profound significance that hitting an 80% carbon reduction target will have on the lives of the young people they are teaching and be providing them with skills that will enable them to flourish in a very different-looking economy.</p> <p><em>Trewin Restorick is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.globalactionplan.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Global Action Plan </em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Michael Jackson revisionism gets a huge boost with Spike Lee's new film, a terrifically warm, affectionate and celebratory study of Jackson's 1987 album Bad. Lee wants to clear away the tabloid smoke and spite, and bring the focus back to Jackson's professionalism, his craftsmanship, his artistry and his pop genius; the movie defiantly insists that Jackson was and is superior to his detractors.</p> <p>Lee uses richly evocative clips and unseen archive material, including Jackson's stunning and mesmerically bizarre video demo of how he wanted the cartoon raisins representing him to behave for a TV ad. Lee doesn't try to pretend that he was not eccentric, but insists that Jackson's eccentricity isn't the point. He interviews the people who are influenced by Jackson now and those who were around him then \u2013 creatives, technicians, legal eagles \u2013 the massed Houston team that launched this heroic pop astronaut into space.</p> <p>Lee begins by looking at Jackson's earlier album, Thriller, which established his extraordinary global dominance. Interestingly, Bad came along at a time when Jackson might have been beginning to feel his star was actually, if only by a millimetre, beginning to wane. Prince was the new pop sensation and hip-hop was emerging. Moreover, he felt criticised on the issue of African-American solidarity and also for having allegedly failed to exert enough raunchy heterosexiness.</p> <p>Bad was going to change all that: a ferociously competitive counter-attack or rearguard action, the first album to be conceived on a stadium scale. He had in mind a bold new video, or \"short film\" as Jackson always high-mindedly called it, based on the true-life story of a black boy shot by a New York cop. Scorsese directed the film that showed Jackson as a shy student, confronting Wesley Snipes's tough guy, outfacing him with his dance moves and finally getting street respect: he's Bad. There is a very funny interview showing Scorsese and his editor Thelma Schoonmaker watching the film now, with a touch of bemusement. Obviously, he isn't convincing as a warrior, but the point is that Michael Jackson, that delicate pop aesthete, alchemises his vulnerability and naivete into pure strength. And it works: he really is Bad.</p> <p>His utterly distinctive dance style is related by Lee to a tradition encompassing Fred Astaire and Buster Keaton, and he makes a persuasive claim that he is a centrally important figure in that tradition. Unlike Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley, Jackson did not make conventional feature films, and so we don't have that as a visual resource, and of course the videos and live footage, startling and brilliant though they are, can't give us an extended view of what Jackson was like in ordinary, walking-and-talking real life. And his interviews were rare, and guarded.</p> <p>Spike Lee's emphasises instead what Jackson's achieved in the public sphere: in music and in dance, and his exuberant reverence for the lonely King of Pop is contagious. It's impossible to watch this film without a great big smile on your face.</p>",
  "<p>More light has been shed recently on a particularly hidden area of undercover policing. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/mark-kennedy\" title=\"\">Mark Kennedy</a> controversy helped to provide a little glimpse of this, but much remains unknown.</p> <p>During his seven years infiltrating the environmental movement, Kennedy spent quite a lot of time spying on, and disrupting, activists in other countries.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/13/undercover-policeman-admits-spying-danish-activists\" title=\"\">Channel Four documentary</a> on him called him 'the go-to cop for foreign governments who needed information about their own activists'.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/02/how-mark-kennedy-went-rogue\" title=\"\">He was deployed in 11 countries on 40 occasions</a>, according to one official report. These countries included Germany, Denmark and Iceland. In Denmark, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/13/undercover-policeman-admits-spying-danish-activists\" title=\"\">he says that he infiltrated a Danish community centre</a> that had housed progressive causes for more than a century, obtaining intelligence to help police storm it and close it down in violent raids.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jan/19/undercover-police-officer-mark-jacobs\" title=\"\">Mark Jacobs was</a> another of the undercover officers who appears to have <a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2011/01/472388.html\" title=\"\">engaged in frequent Euro-travel to</a> monitor campaigners.</p> <p>What has emerged is a highly secretive official apparatus among governments for organising and co-ordinating this cross-border espionage. There appears to be a network of clandestine bodies in which police and governments manage the infiltration and surveillance of political as well as criminal groups.</p> <p>We would of course be interested in any information on this subject.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/\" title=\"\">Statewatch</a>, which monitors civil liberties in Europe, has recently published <a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2012/aug/09eu-secret-police-networks.html\" title=\"\">this here</a>, noting :\"Information currently in the public domain makes up only a small piece of a global puzzle of police working groups and networks dealing with infiltration, intrusion and surveillance not just of criminal groups, but political activists\".</p> <p>One politician who has pursued this with some vigour is <a href=\"http://www.andrej-hunko.de/\" title=\"\">German MP Andrej Hunko</a>. He has recently published a detailed document collating information about these official networks, mainly from official answers in the German Parliament. <a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2012/aug/eu-secret-police-networks-pr.pdf\" title=\"\">It can be found here at the end of this document</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.andrej-hunko.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/1234-secret-police-networks-must-be-relentlessly-exposed\" title=\"\">Hunko said</a> :\"When police forces and intelligence services engage in international cooperation, parliamentary oversight is the loser. The increasing significance of undercover police networks is making this situation far more critical.\"</p> <p>He added that Kennedy's \"infiltration of European leftist movements exemplifies police cooperation conducted beyond the bounds of parliamentary oversight. It remains unclear under whose orders the undercover investigator was operating during the years of his activity.\"</p> <p>He added :\"The Icelandic police are stubbornly rejecting requests from the Minister of Justice to release full details of his activity into the public domain, claiming that disclosure would prejudice British security interests. Even though Members of the Icelandic Parliament have a right to ask questions on police matters, they are not being given any information.\"</p> <p>The British government has not disclosed much about these confidential networks either.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Watson, the fugitive head of international marine activism group Sea Shepherd who is wanted by the police on three continents, plans to avoid arrest by staying at sea as long as possible.</p> <p>In an exclusive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/31/paul-watson-clients-whales\" title=\"\">comment piece</a> for the Guardian, the Canadian-born environmentalist who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/26/paul-watson-skips-bail-germany\" title=\"\">skipped bail in Germany in July</a>, gives no clue to where he is except that he is in a \"safe haven\". He says he plans \"to return to his ships\".</p> <p>Sea Shepherd has a fleet of four ships, all of which are thought to be heading for Australia and the Antarctic ocean ahead of the Japanese whale hunting season that Sea Shepherd attempts to disrupt every year.</p> <p>Maritime law is complex but legal experts say that Watson is likely to be able to evade most police forces indefinitely if he remains in international waters.</p> <p>\"The question now is what should I do from the safe haven I currently occupy?\" says Watson. \"There is only one answer. I have no choice but to continue to serve my clients, the whales. I can do that far better at the helm of the Steve Irwin commanding the Sea Shepherd fleet \u2026 than I can defending myself from bogus charges by Japan.</p> <p>\"If I can return to my ships, I will. If not, my captains and their crews will return without me to once more defend the whales in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary.\"</p> <p>Watson disappeared after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/14/paul-watson-arrested-germany-sea-shepherd?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">being jailed in Germany</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/18/anti-whaling-activist-paul-watson\" title=\"\">later bailed</a> in the face of allegations by Costa Rica \u2013 strongly denied by Watson \u2013 that he endangered the lives of some of its shark finners back in 2002.</p> <p>Watson says that he strongly suspects Costa Rica is working with Japan to have him extradited to Japan on charges that he ordered a crew member to board a Japanese whaling ship. Japan has long declared him an eco-terrorist following annual skirmishes between its whaling fleet and Sea Shepherd in the Antarctic.</p> <p>In his article for the Guardian, Watson says he fled Germany after a tip-off by a source in the German Ministry of Justice that an extradition request by Japan to Germany to hand him over had been granted. \"I had no choice but to leave Germany. If not, I would now be in a cell in Japan.\"</p> <p>\"I have never suffered under any delusion that saving the whales in the Antarctic sanctuary would be easy, but the one thing I am certain of is that I and my passionate crew of international volunteers will never quit defending life in the seas from poachers no matter what consequences we must endure to do so,\" he writes.</p>",
  "<p>Each year for the last eight years, I have successfully led high-profile campaigns out of Australia to intervene against the shadowy operations of the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary.</p> <p>These have been extremely dangerous operations in the hostile waters off Antarctica, against a whaling fleet backed by one of the world's most economically powerful nations.</p> <p>During this time our ships and crew have been shot at, rammed, one of them sliced in two and destroyed by a Japanese security vessel. At the same time, our tactics have been strategically designed to not cause injury or property damage and to stay within the boundaries of the law.</p> <p>Most importantly, every Sea Shepherd action has been thoroughly documented for the Animal Planet show, Whale Wars. Although this provides us with the evidence to defend ourselves against bogus accusations, it has also been a source of embarrassment for the Japanese government.</p> <p>We have demonstrated that their \"research\" whaling is nothing more than a mask for commercial operations.</p> <p>The Japanese insist that their shady whaling operations are legal. Australia and many other nations disagree. My position is that they should not be killing whales in a whale sanctuary.</p> <p>Through cutting kill quotas by blocking their lethal operations, we have reduced kill numbers dramatically, saving more than 4,000 whales and costing the whalers their profits.</p> <p>Our strategy of blocking the whaling fleet has driven this commercial whaling operation into substantial debt. They have continued to operate only because of massive government subsidies.</p> <p>As a result, in September of 2011, the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said that this was no longer about whaling but about not surrendering to Sea Shepherd, and in October, the government allocated \u00a319m from the Tsunami relief fund to the Japanese Fishery Agency for the purpose of stopping Sea Shepherd interventions.</p> <p>They immediately filed a lawsuit in the United States seeking a preliminary injunction to stop our ships from returning to the Southern Ocean. The injunction failed and the most recent Sea Shepherd campaign prevented the whalers from taking 74% of their kill quota.</p> <p>Japan had made a deal with a former crewmember after he was arrested for boarding the Japanese registered Shonan Maru #2, the ship that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/06/sea-shepherd-adygil-japan-whalers\" title=\"\">destroyed our trimaran</a>. This man was taken back to Japan and received a suspended sentence for trespassing in return for accusing me of ordering him to board the ship. The Whale Wars episode where this happens clearly shows me advising him not to board the Japanese vessel.</p> <p>The Japanese captain refused to co-operate with the Australian and New Zealand investigation into the sinking of the Sea Shepherd vessel and suffered no consequences for destroying the $1.5m boat. Yet based on false accusations, Japan is demanding my arrest. Why?</p> <p>Because they have the influence to do so and we do not have the financial resources and political power to have the Japanese captain charged.</p> <p>On 8 December 2011, Costa Rican president, Laura Chinchilla, travelled to Japan and met with Noda. At around the same time, Costa Rica made a request to Interpol for my extradition for an incident in April 2002 when Sea Shepherd had stopped an illegal Costa Rican shark-finning operation in Guatemalan waters. We did so with permission of the Guatemalan government and without injuring any of the poachers.</p> <p>Interpol had dismissed that decade-belated request, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/14/paul-watson-arrested-germany-sea-shepherd\" title=\"\">Germany decided to detain me nonetheless</a>. I was then tipped off from a source in the German Ministry of Justice that Japan's request to Germany to hand me over had been granted. I had no choice but to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/26/paul-watson-skips-bail-germany\" title=\"\">leave Germany</a>.</p> <p>If not, I would now be in a cell in Japan.</p> <p>The question now is what should I do from the safe haven I currently occupy?</p> <p>There is only one answer. I have no choice but to continue to serve my clients, the whales. I can do that far better at the helm of the Steve Irwin commanding the Sea Shepherd fleet of four ships, aircraft and my intrepid crews than I can defending myself from bogus charges by Japan.</p> <p>If I can return to my ships, I will. If not, my captains and their crews will return without me to once more defend the whales in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary.</p> <p>I have never suffered under any delusion that saving the whales in the Antarctic sanctuary would be easy, but the one thing I am certain of is that I and my passionate crew of international volunteers will never quit defending life in the seas from poachers no matter what consequences we must endure to do so.</p> <p>\u2022 Captain Paul Watson is the founder and president of <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/\" title=\"\">Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</a>.</p>",

  "<p>A few years ago, the only \"halal\" signs one saw were on butchers' shops. But now halal is turning into a global brand \u2013 as highlighted in a BBC documentary proclaiming that \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01m0pq2/The_Future_Is_Halal/\" title=\"\">The Future is Halal</a>\".</p> <p>The Arabic word \"halal\" means simply, that which is permitted in Islam (the opposite being \"haram\", or what is forbidden), and until recently that definition meant little more than consuming meat slaughtered in a religiously compliant way, and avoiding pork and alcohol. Now there is an almost endless list of halal products. The hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23IslamicProducts\" title=\"\">#IslamicProducts</a> on Twitter recently satirised the increasing absurdity of some of these innovations.</p> <p>The most lucrative of these by far is Islamic finance, which seeks to eliminate usury from all transactions and which has been transformed from a niche product to one available on the high street in the UK.</p> <p>There is halal perfume, toothpaste, \"beer\" (it's awful), bacon (delicious), cosmetics as well as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19295861\" title=\"\">\"halal\" hotels and holiday resorts</a>. The definition of halal has become so broad, it seems to encompass everything that caters to Muslim sensibilities. There is even a World Halal Week that showcases such products.</p> <p>A growing Muslim diaspora in the west, and a rising middle class in Muslim countries constitute what is estimated to be a $2trillion market in halal goods and \"experiences\".</p> <p>This demand seems to be less a hardline religious fixation, and more a theme, a lifestyle, that Muslim consumers would prefer \u2013 one which embodies the spirit, as well as the technicalities of halal. When holidaying with my mother and three sisters, all who wear the hijab, I would be grateful (and certainly pay more) if a hotel or resort had female-only pools or spa facilities. The fact that businesses are beginning to provide for this is, at best, the epitome of non-discriminatory capitalism, catering to customer demand.</p> <p>The provision of halal products in this way is almost a secular phenomenon in its indifference to anything apart from consumers' lucre. At its worst, it is exploitative, coming up with products that make a tenuous link with the concept of halal \u2013 patronising customers in the way that some suppliers seek to create <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/BIC-For-Amber-Medium-Ballpoint/dp/B004FTGJUW/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top\" title=\"\">\"girly\" versions</a> of mainstream products.</p> <p>The line between satire and reality wears thin sometimes. In a mocking attempt to come up with new halal products on Twitter someone suggested <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2011feb17/status/240036173127483392/photo/1\" title=\"\">an Islamic car</a>, with a button that plays a prayer \u2013 only to realise that it already exists.</p> <p>But there is something comforting in the levelling, integrative power of profit. In Islamic finance conferences bearded sheikhs and white Harvard MBAs sit and work side by side. The University of Oxford hosted the first <a href=\"http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/documents/islamicstudies/Islamic_branding_and_marketing_forum_report.pdf\" title=\"\">Islamic branding and marketing forum</a> in 2010 where one of its keynote speakers said that \"growing commercial opportunities can bind Muslims and non-Muslims in a common humanity even though until now religion has long been considered taboo in mass marketing.\"</p> <p>This is increasingly evident in Ramadan marketing on Arab television for example, where the focus is now on selling, underpinned by a religious theme, but not on the holy month itself. According to a British advertising agency, the religious theme <a href=\"http://www.ogilvynoor.com/index.php/five-top-tips-engaging-muslim-consumers-ramadan/#.UDztIcFmScM\" title=\"\">shouldn't be pushed too far</a>, as it recommends that one \"avoid stereotypical imagery of prayer caps, rosaries, mosques, looking at crescents and so on\". Sort of like what happened to Christmas.</p> <p>And as quickly as western financial institutions caught on to the potential profitability of Islamic finance, western advertisers have taken the lead in Islamic branding, with one leading company declaring in its mission statement that \"in recent years global marketers have started to enthuse over the size of this prize and ruminate on the importance of cracking it \u2013 but we believe the challenge is in managing it knowledgeably, sensitively, and profitably for the long term\".</p> <p>In a way this is not dissimilar to how industries cater to other consumers with ethical or lifestyle criteria, to vegans or the pink dollar. A friend of mine has spent much money, effort and time avoiding any unethically produced sportswear or running shoes.</p> <p>But the halal market has its foundations in the spiritual. It is unsettling to hear professionals talk about the \"earnest Islamic consciousness\" and how best to make money out of it, using a concept that is in essence meant to guide Muslims to a good and wholesome life. And it is easy to cross the line between catering for a community and inadvertently ghettoising it.</p> <p>While I am grateful for London suppliers of halal bacon and sausage, I won't be spooked into buying halal Tupperware or teabags soon. Yorkshire Tea will do just fine.</p>",

The app enables you to browse apps, get recommendations and download them to the device, while also offering Amazon's daily free app deal.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive\">SkyDrive</a></h2> <p>Microsoft's SkyDrive cloud service has made its way onto Android. The app helps people access the files they've stored in their SkyDrive locker \u2013&#xa0;including opening them in other apps \u2013 upload photos and videos from their smartphones, and send links to those files to others.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=deltatre.c4.shell\">C4 Paralympics</a></h2> <p>As on iOS, Channel 4's official Paralympic Games app offers live text commentary, video highlights, schedules, results and news on smartphones, with added livestreaming video for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deltatre.c4\">the tablet version</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themodernink.hooha\">Hooha for App.net</a></h2> <p>US entrepreneur Dalton Caldwell sailed past his $500k crowdfunding goal to build a \"real-time social feed\" as a more-open alternative to Twitter, and the service is already up and running in alpha. Now a developer has made its first mobile app for Android. Hooha is equally \"raw alpha\" in its nature, helping users view their streams, mentions and global posts, while composing and replying.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magisto\">Magisto</a></h2> <p>Video-editing app Magisto has been a hit on iOS, and now it's available for Android too. The twist is that the actual video-editing process is automated: users upload footage from their phones and choose soundtracks, before Magisto's software handles the splicing part. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube sharing are all included.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floorpass.android\">CNN / Time Convention Floorpass</a></h2> <p>This roundup is a little late for the Republican convention, but CNN and Time's joint app was available beforehand \u2013 and is still good for the Democrats' event. The app offers news and analysis from CNN and Time's political journalists, while tying in Twitter, Foursquare and CNN's own iReport citizen journalism service.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oceanhouse_media.bookhcnothingeverhappens_app\">Nothing Ever Happens at the South Pole</a></h2> <p>Oceanhouse Media has released dozens of apps based on different Dr. Seuss books. This uses a different source: an unpublished 1960s book by Berenstain Bears authors Stan and Jan Berenstain about the South Pole. Aimed at children, it follows the journey of a penguin looking for icy excitement.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intro\">Intro</a></h2> <p>Intro is a social location app designed for business rather than personal use, helping people meet potential work contacts when in the same area. It also sims to match freelancers to projects that suit their skills, cutting out the recruitment agency middlemen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403351396\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346416816400/stereomood.jpg\" alt=\"Stereomood\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stereomood provides mood-based music playlists</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mutado.android.stereomood\">Stereomood</a></h2> <p>Stereomood made our iOS roundup this week thanks to its iPhone version being upgraded to iPad.

That pause really killed \u2013 too bad you can't put it on a bumper sticker. And that's the problem the Republican party faces writ small (very): they have no affirmative argument, no positive vision. To Obama's cajoling rhetoric, the best they can offer is only a smirking silence.</p> <p>They don't have a script, which brings us to Clint Eastwood. It was another synecdoche for how the GOP has lost its message. They are out-of-touch and winging it, groping for applause lines and settling for cliches. Who would have thought that asking Trump to speak would end up looking like playing it safe? </p> <p>Eastwood's performance was one part painful and two parts befuddling, rescued from a cringe-inducing memory only by the almost-immediate emergence of \"#eastwooding\" on Twitter. People scolding chairs is the new people shaming dogs.</p> <p>Obama even got in on the action, tweeting a faintly unbecoming but pleasantly cheeky photo of himself ensconced in a very-official-looking chair. \"This seat's taken,\" it read. Well, for the moment. Romney's speech previewed a line of argument that \u2013 if the Republicans can hew to it \u2013 is their best shot at wooing swing voters: Obama's not a bad guy, he's in over his head! Give <em>this guy</em> a shot.</p> <p>It's an honest message, at least, if not a very powerful one. There is something small about it, too, and that smallness somehow permeated Romney's address, right down to his disingenuous characterization of Bain Capital as a \"small company\" that \"helped\" other businesses. (With apologies to Ronald Reagan, the nine most terrifying words in the English language are \"I'm from Bain Capital and I'm here to help.\")</p> <p>That's the thing about Romney: he is so rich, his experience so alien to everyday Americans, he has to pretend to be normal and it never works. Though it's all relative; maybe having the old guy talk to a chair wasn't such a bad way to go, after all.</p> <p>The real loser of the night was probably Senator Marco Rubio, who gave a flawless delivery of another personal narrative that does Romney no good by comparison. He is smart, somewhat reasonable (he has kept the Tea Party at arm's distance despite their desire to embrace him), and his very existence proves that the Republican party is not hostage to its nativist fringe.</p> <p>But between Eastwood and Romney, he was just a short interlude of sanity. All things considered with this convention's last night, it might be just as well everyone forgets he was there.</p> <p><em>Ana Marie Cox is US political columnist for the Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Few expected they would hear something so heartfelt'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478841\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For long stretches, it looked like Clint Eastwood was going to be the one unmitigated disaster of the convention. His surprise appearance, rumored all week, was somewhat hard to explain just by itself: Romney had rarely sought out help from the relatively rare Hollywood Republicans, and although Eastwood had periodically discussed his Republican preferences, he had never done anything as high-profile as address a national convention before. Eastwood's \"Halftime in America\" ad for Chrysler during the Super Bowl was interpreted by many as a subtle argument in favor of President Obama, so perhaps Eastwood wanted to set the record straight or do penance.</p> <p>Instead, he rambled, scratched his head, spoke away from the microphone, and creeped up to the edge of disaster \u2013 before pulling back with one good line after another: \"the stupid idea of trying terrorists in downtown New York City\"; \"Politicians are employees of ours; and then, the gravelly \"When somebody does not do the job, you've got to let them go.\" If the GOP convention aimed to persuade waivering Obama voters that it's OK to vote for Romney this time, the old tough guy might have.</p> <p>Marco Rubio is consistently a great speaker, with a remarkable personal story, and so those who have seen him speak before may think it was par for the course for him. But those who haven't seen him before are probably asking this morning, \"Who's that guy? He's good! He gets what this country is about!\"</p> <p>And then, there was the nominee himself. For months \u2013 years, really \u2013 his fans have told us that Romney is quite personable, warm, and charming when the cameras are turned off and he's far from the crowds of campaign world. At most, Warm Humanized Mitt has been like Bigfoot: occasional glimpses here and there, secondhand accounts, little or no concrete evidence. Until last night.</p> <p>Suddenly, Thursday night, he's discussing his upbringing, and he mentions:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My mom and dad were married for 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist. [Applause] Because every day, dad gave mom a Rose, which he put on the bedside table. That is how she found that the day my father died. She went looking for him because, that morning, there was no rose.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney choked up a bit telling that story, and there were lumps in the throat of everyone watching. We've never seen anything remotely like that from Mitt Romney. Most Americans have never seen Mitt Romney speak anything so personal or heartfelt. It was like a different man.</p> <p>The policy sections were fine, but we know the best convention addresses are rarely about policy proposals; they're about sharing a vision and values. Everyone expected Romney would give a solid speech. But few, if any, expected they would hear something so heartfelt. It will be fascinating to see the reaction in the coming days and weeks.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'There just wasn't much there, there'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478842\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there was one area of apparent consensus among the journalists assembled in Tampa for the Republican National Convention, it was that Mitt Romney's acceptance speech was the single most important moment of the proceedings. With unfavorable ratings above 50%, and little sense among voters about what a Romney presidency would portend, his remarks on Thursday night were the best opportunity for Romney to change the narrative of the presidential campaign and cast his candidacy in a new and more positive light.</p> <p>That didn't happen. </p> <p>It's not that Romney gave a bad speech; it's that it was a remarkably unmemorable one. It offered more platitudes and bromides rather than lift or vision. Part of the problem is that Romney is not a good public speaker. He gives off an air of smarminess when he speaks and, like another \"robotic\" politician from 12 years ago, exudes the aroma of insincerity.</p> <p>Of course, it doesn't help when he has such unmemorable material from which to work. In fact, it's likely that by the time you are reading this, the one thing everyone will be talking about from Thursday night was Clint Eastwood's bizarre and rambling interlude, with an empty chair serving as a stand-in for Barack Obama.</p> <p>Considering how unpopular Romney is, it was imperative for his acceptance speech to offer a more intimate or absorbing view of him, not as a politician, but as a person. The first two-thirds of the speech sought to do just that, with some middling success. There was, for example, a charming story about the love shared between his parents, George and Lenore. Oddly, however, Romney's only tenure in public service \u2013 as governor of Massachusetts \u2013 went virtually unmentioned. Instead, it was all about his family life, his time at Bain Capital and, interestingly, his faith.</p> <p>But Romney's speechwriters, who were in rather poor form throughout the convention, forget the essential speechwriting trick of showing rather than the telling. They did the opposite, which made the \"humanizing\" section of the speech far less than it could have been. Then again, it might just be that Mitt Romney doesn't have a very interesting personal story, because very little of what he said on Thursday was terribly compelling. So, maybe it's not all the speechwriters' fault.</p> <p>But that section was Gettysburg-esque in comparison to the rest of Romney's remarks. For a guy running against his opponent's economic performance, one would imagine that Romney would take some time to talk his policy agenda for fixing the economy and creating jobs. But one would be wrong. Romney's economic plan, which revolved around an underwhelming set of policy ideas that would do little to spur job creation (trade agreements, school choice, cutting the deficit, boosting small business and energy independence) was remarkably threadbare. There wasn't one single idea for spurring the economy, a la Ronald Reagan's call for a massive tax cut in his 1980 acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. I counted around 250 words.</p> <p>Foreign policy was even worse: 200 or so words of false attacks against Obama and virtually nothing on what would be the guiding foreign policy principles of a Romney administration. There just wasn't much there, there.</p> <p>In the end, Romney appears to be more interested in critiquing Obama than he is offering voters a sense of where he wants to take the country. In the process he has opened the door for Obama, at his convention next week, to fill the policy vacuum left by Romney's hollow set of remarks. While not necessarily a disaster, it's hard to escape the notion that Romney's speech, like so much of his campaign, was simply a missed opportunity.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Humanizing Romney was the central task'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478843\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The overarching theme of the Republican National Convention tonight: I am a Mitt, not a machine. Humanizing Romney was the central task of the Tampa gathering.</p> <p>So, Thursday, we heard from people who have benefited from Romney's acts of private charity. People whose lives have been touched by his friendship and generosity. This was followed by testimonials from people involved in his successful business ventures, like Staples and Bain, reminding the audience that the former CEO didn't just lay people off. He hired people and created jobs, too.</p> <p>Then Romney himself gave a speech that was focused more on himself than on policy or political issues. He talked movingly about his parents. His wife. His early career. His respect for women and the fact that Ann Romney held a more important job than he did. It was a bit transparent at times that Romney was striving to close the gender gap, or reassure the voter who wants to vote against Barack Obama but isn't quite sure about the Republican nominee.</p> <p>But then, so what if it was transparent? Those were the things Romney needed to do. A majority of the country on some level agrees with Romney's basic critique of Obama: that the economic recovery is too weak, that the jobs are too few, that the president has over-promised and under-delivered. There are voters who were excited about an Obama presidency who now think the orator was greater than the executive.</p> <p>What many of these voters aren't sure about, however, is whether Romney will make things better. They don't know if he is in touch their problems or interests. Obama is the president who hasn't improved their economic condition; Romney is the businessman who fired them. Romney needs to resolve that basic problem in order to win, or he will end up like the last Massachusetts politician on a major party ticket: competitive against a president the country is ready to part with, but not a plausible enough alternative to close the deal.</p> <p>These voters were the target audience of Romney's acceptance speech and all of tonight's programming. Marco Rubio's introduction was designed to energize the conservative base without offending those people. There was a bit of a detour with Clint Eastwood. I liked Eastwood's speech. It was funny, original, and ironic. But I can't say how it will play with television viewers. Some might find it bizarre.</p> <p>Did Romney knock it out of the park? By no means. Much of his speech was workmanlike. He also seemingly left the door open to another war in the Middle East in a foreign policy section the Obama campaign should attack, rather than spending time looking for racially charged dog-whistles. </p> <p>Romney tried to do what he needed to do. It remains to be seen whether he convinced swing voters he was more Mitt than machine.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation</em></p>",

  "<p>Japan is a safe haven for global investors. So much so that the yen has soared in value.</p> <p>Government pride that the country is loved by currency traders is offset by the resulting high value of the yen. Exports are already being hit.</p> <p>On a visit to London this week, Japan's top currency official said the time may have come to intervene.</p> <p>Takehiko Nakao, vice finance minister for international affairs, said in a speech in London: \"Exports have been influenced by supply chain changes and problems in Europe, some advanced economies and also in China. And we are also suffering from a very appreciated yen ... If needed we will take very decisive action in the market, that is our stance.\"</p> <p>Nakao is upset that the euro, which once challenged the yen and dollar as a safe haven, is now considered a joke. He wants the European Central Bank to make good on a pledge to buy Spanish and Italian sovereign debt to reassure global markets that it will protect all 17 members of the eurozone</p> <p>Reuters reported that Tokyo spent a record \u00a58tn (\u00a364bn) in unilateral intervention in the currency market last autumn when the dollar hit a record low of \u00a575.31, and another \u00a51tn later in that year on undeclared forays.</p> <p>The yen has risen almost a third since 2007, Nakao said. The dollar has lost around 7.5% against the yen in the last five months alone.</p> <p>Exports of Japanese manufactured goods are already expensive compared with Chinese and Korean equivalents. A high yen compounds the problem. One of Kyocera's solar panels can set back an environmentally conscious consumer twice as much as a Chinese rival. It will have 25 years of quality control tests behind it and a longer guarantee, but the up-front cost can be the difference between a sale and no sale.</p> <p>One response by ministers has been to subsidise local purchases. Solar panels are a case in point. With nuclear out of favour, the government has embarked on a huge solar panel installation programme. It's a fantastic plan from an environmental point of view, and probably helps Kyocera's profits, but needs to be paid for.</p> <p>The Japanese have proved reluctant to agree to rises in taxes since the 1990 property crash and have only just conceded to a rise in VAT from 5% to 8%. A lack of tax revenue to fund investment has forced the government to run up higher debts. Japan's debt to GDP ratio is the highest in the developed world at more than 200%. Luckily for the government it has an implicit, unwritten agreement with Japanese families, which is that all the money they don't pay in taxes must be invested in government bonds. Thereby government spending is not financed by tax revenues but from IOUs to Japanese investors.</p> <p>But this scheme is running out of steam. The ageing population is drawing more from its pensions and savings than it is squirrelling away. Therefore the capacity of Japanese households to buy bonds is diminishing.</p> <p>Nakao says the answer is monetary intervention in the form of currency selling to drive down the price. But yet again we are listening to an official reaching for a monetary policy solution when there are more fundamental reasons for the high value of the yen.</p> <p>They need to think of another way to organise the economy than via an export drive that recycles the profits into state spending via government bond buying.</p>",
  "<p>For generations of Lego users, the idea of building Mia's Puppy House would have been anathema. But the toymaker's new girl-friendly range has proved a hit with customers while drawing accusations of gender stereotyping from campaigners.</p> <p>The world-famous plastic brick maker said net profit rose 35% to 2bn kroner (\u00a3213m) in the first six months of 2012, from 1.48bn kroner for the same period last year. Sales rose 24% to Kr9.1bn, spurred by the success of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/01/lego-profits-rise-pink\" title=\"\">Lego Friends line</a>, which was launched in January in an attempt to expand the company's appeal beyond boys. It has been a runaway hit, selling twice as many sets as expected.</p> <p>\"It has been amazing to experience the enthusiastic welcome that consumers have given the new range,\" said the Lego chief executive, J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp. \"Sales have been quite astonishing.\"</p> <p>The debut of Lego Friends, featuring a more prominent use of pink than your typical Lego fan would be used to, drew criticism that it would reinforce gender stereotypes. As well as the usual trucks, policemen and rugged houses, the line now includes Stephanie's cool convertible in distinctive pink and purple, and Mia's Puppy House, accessorised with flowers and full pet grooming kit.</p> <p>Pink Stinks, a UK campaign group that raises concerns over gender stereotyping of children, said Lego was perpetuating a narrow and limited set of ideas. Abi Moore, co-founder of Pink Stinks, said: \"It's not surprising that profits are up, but they probably are for toy makers who are gender-stereotyping everything in sight.\" She added: \"We want toys that offer all sorts of opportunities to all children. We think that cupcakes, parties and having everything revolve around leisure is just tiresome and heavily stereotyped.</p> <p>The loudest protest against the range came from the US, where the Spark movement against the sexualisation of girls and young women organised a petition with more than 50,000 signatures calling on Lego to change its marketing strategy. Eating disorder specialists have also criticised the line, which has slim figurines called Stephanie, Andrea and Olivia who represent a significant change to Lego's typical square-set characters.</p> <p>However, Lego's results indicated that the company had got its product design and marketing right, having drawn up the new line amid requests from parents and girls for more realistic and detailed sets with brighter colours and role playing opportunities.</p> <p>Lego said Lego ranges had been popular with girls in the past but the company has struggled to match its success with boys. The Friends range was the product of research with 3,000 girls, Lego said. \"Girls like construction toys but they just want it to be relevant to them.\"</p> <p>Girls who didn't find Lego relevant before seem to have found relevance in Lego Friends.\"</p> <p>Lego said a weakening toy market had not damaged the privately-owned business, with its share of the global toy market growing by one percentage point to more than 8%. European sales rose by 10%, Lego said, with the US climbing 23% and Asia increasing \"at an even steeper rate\".</p> <p>The company expects to hire an extra 1,000 employees this year \u2013 a 10% boost to its workforce \u2013 as it meets growing demand, including increased production of the Friends line.

And yet, with the announcement from the UK Border Agency that London Metropolitan University had its licence to sponsor international students revoked, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-met-university-removal-from-uk\" title=\"\">thousands of young people</a> have this week come to see a very different side to our country.</p> <p>The consequences of this announcement are extremely significant. More than 2,000 international students must now find an alternative course with an alternative provider, or face having to leave the UK. Understandably, this news is terrifying for all those concerned.</p> <p>During a radio debate following the news, Damian Green, the immigration minister, criticised me for using over-emotive language. But I'm afraid it <em>is</em> a very emotive issue \u2013 and our need to support those affected cannot prevent us from criticising this decision and the way it has been handled in the strongest terms: it is ill-judged, badly timed and poorly executed. It cannot be right that international students who came to study in the UK in good faith now find themselves in this position, weeks before the start of the academic year. They should be allowed to continue their studies, as any other student would fairly expect.</p> <p>The consequences will be widely felt. International students from across the country have been expressing concerns as to whether they are indeed welcome to study in the UK for some time now \u2013 a sentiment that has developed since David Cameron announced his commitment to reduce immigration into the UK from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands in the runup to the 2010 general election.</p> <p>Seeing international students as an easy target, successive government reforms have made international students feel unwelcome \u2013 from huge delays for in-country visa applications, to ever-rising visa application fees, and the scrapping of the post study work visa. The impact of such rhetoric is already being keenly felt \u2013 a recent National Union of Students (NUS) survey of more than 900 international students found that 40% of students would not recommend studying in the UK to a friend.</p> <p>Indeed, ONS figures of migration released on Thursday show that while immigration into the UK has fallen <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19420168\" title=\"\">by 36,000 this year, student visas have fallen by 75,000</a> \u2013 a drop of 21%. The news surrounding London Met's licence cannot fail to compound this.</p> <p>International students contribute a great deal to our country \u2013 they both establish and reflect our higher education sector's status as \"world class\", bringing new knowledge, ideas and perspectives from which UK students greatly benefit. They provide meaningful links to other countries and cultures, and undertake huge amounts of volunteering and community work. Even in the narrowest terms, at a time in which the government has imposed so much instability on the sector, international students represent huge investment into higher education. We cannot take this for granted: while our education system retains an excellent reputation as a world leader, the way in which students are treated while here cannot fail to make it a less attractive option.</p> <p>A home affairs select committee report on the work of the UK Border Agency earlier this year stated that:</p> <blockquote> \"The prime minister's aim to reduce migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands' cannot be achieved without drastically reducing the number of people who come to study in Britain. It is likely that this would damage a strong sector of our economy and also the cultural diversity of our universities.\" </blockquote> <p>This is only becoming more apparent, most particularly at a time when our higher education sector is undergoing rapid, confused and misguided changes on all fronts. We certainly can't afford to be damaging this aspect of the university sector too.</p> <p>Damian Green can put a halt to this process by announcing that international students at London Met can finish their courses there \u2013 this is only right. The Home Office should then announce an inquiry into the process leading to this decision and the way it has been communicated. The apparent leaking of the news in the Sunday Times last weekend spread tremendous panic, and the lack of information available at the time made this far worse than it needed to be. This made a bad situation far worse.</p> <p>In the meantime, the NUS will be working as part of a taskforce \u2013 together with Universities UK, HEFCE, UKBA, London Metropolitan University and others \u2013 to help the students affected. Many are already unsure of whether they can stay in the UK at all, and we need to work together to ensure that they are fully informed and supported.</p> <p>As the Paralympics continue over the next two weeks, I hope that members of the government can reflect on the pride so many of us feel at playing host to incredible athletes from across the world. We should feel the same about the best and brightest international students who choose to study here. They are an asset to this country, and we need to better appreciate the tremendous benefits they bring.</p>",
  "<p>In front of the blackboard in a classroom in Nabari village, northern Ghana, tightly packed rows of dishevelled wooden benches give a sense of the number of primary school children crammed into this room, obediently copying the dictation by rote. They are surrounded by filthy walls and a weather-beaten corrugated ceiling.</p> <p>\"There are many pupils but only three classrooms, so they have to pair classes,\" says Memuna Sandow, district assembly woman for the towns of Wulugu, Silinga and Nabari in the West Mamprusi region of northern Ghana. \"The quality of teaching is very poor \u2013 teachers who are sent here from other places do not want to stay.\"</p> <p>\"There is very low school enrollment,\" Sandow adds. \"As well as all these problems, not all the parents can afford uniform. The children have to walk 6km to fetch water in the evenings; sometimes they are so tired they don't go to school the next day.\"</p> <p>The barriers to education highlight the complex development challenges in this rural part of Ghana's northern savannah. The area's extreme poverty led to it being handpicked as the site of the new Millennium Village Project (MVP), the integrated approach to rural development spearheaded by Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University's Earth Institute.</p> <p>The production of oil in southern Ghana has helped make its economy one of the fastest growing in the world, accelerating poverty reduction there. But the number of people living in poverty in the north has increased \u2013 by an estimated 1 million over the past 20 years. The majority of Ghana's 6 million people living below the poverty line are now in the north.</p> <p>The MVP, launched this week by Ghana's new president John Dramani Mahama and UK international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, aims to address this gap by creating a millennium villages \"cluster\" in an area that cuts across two of the north's poorest regions, West Mamprusi and Builsa. The scheme will target 34 communities with a total population of approximately 27,000 people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395904878\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/8/30/1346326990440/MDG--Maize-farmers-in-Nab-001.jpg\" alt=\"MDG : Maize farmers in Nabari\" width=\"140\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maize farmers in Nabari.

It is the poorest part of the country, the furthest away from infrastructure, the furthest away from the growth areas of the economy.\"</p> <p>\"This region has a number of issues,\" said David Sunbo, MVP team leader. \"There is a more than 30km journey to access healthcare, education levels are very low, and people run out of food for almost half of the year. You can drive 60km through the whole cluster without seeing any vehicles because the state of the roads is so bad.\"</p> <p>The new MVP has $18.1m (\u00a311.5m) funding from the UK's Department for International Development (DfID). The money will be provided over five years, the first time the department has offered financial support for the project, and equates to roughly $90 a person being spent annually on the ground. The remaining spending \u2013 an estimated $60 a person annually \u2013 is from other sources, including the government of Ghana, NGOs and the international community.</p> <p>\"We are trying to make clear, more than anyone has tried to be in the past, what the cost of providing primary services to lift people out of poverty really is,\" said Sachs. \"At the moment we think it is $150 per person per year, which is really a very small amount.\"</p> <p>Sachs has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/oct/19/millennium-villages-project-proper-evaluation\" title=\"\">come under fire recently</a> after critics found serious flaws in the MVP's evaluation methods and argued results were overstated or impossible to verify. In May, medical journal the Lancet was <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960824-1/fulltext\" title=\"\">forced to withdraw sections of its assessment of child survival rates</a> following criticism it overstated outcomes for child mortality. Paul Pronyk, director of monitoring and evaluation at Columbia University's Centre for Global Health and Economic Development, left the project.</p> <p>The new MVP will, for the first time, be independently evaluated. \"We are proceeding cautiously \u2013 the proof is in the pudding,\" says Mitchell. Evaluation of the project, which has conducted baseline surveys of the 34 communities within the site, and 68 control communities selected for their similarity to the project sites, has been commissioned from <a href=\"http://www.itad.com/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Itad</a>, a UK-based development consultancy.</p> <p>Part of the emphasis on evaluation is to help project organisers achieve a proven model for development that can be scaled up to encompass whole regions and even countries. But in Nabari there was scepticism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395904879\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/8/30/1346327060014/MDG--Jeremiah-Imoro-and-h-001.jpg\" alt=\"MDG : Jeremiah Imoro and his neighbours\" width=\"140\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremiah Imoro and his neighbours.

Since my father died, I support my mother and my seven siblings, and my own wife and three children. The food I grow is not enough and there is none left to sell for cash that we need to buy things. We have to go to the forest to chop wood and sell charcoal instead.</p> <p>\"What I need is more income. If I could buy more fertiliser, pay for a tractor for ploughing, and grow more expensive crops like beans, then things would be better for me and my family.\"</p> <p>But organisers say Imoro is exactly the kind of farmer who will benefit from the project. \"We are taking a business approach to agriculture so that we are not continuously dependent on external support,\" said Sunbo. \"We are giving farmers loans to pay for ploughing, fertiliser and seeds \u2013 they will pay it back and then the amount can be given back to them the next year. We also have in place a plan to expand the facilities for irrigation.\"</p> <p>Mastering the business development needs of farmers is something Sachs admits the MVPs have struggled with, and although other projects will last 10 years, the new MVP will last only five. \"We have to speed up our work on business development,\" says Sachs. \"In other sites, it took three years to work on food production and agriculture. Here we want to move faster, bringing in important help to agriculture sooner.\"</p> <p>Many of the challenges in West Mamprusi relate to infrastructure, and the need for comprehensive irrigation, roads and electricity, things the organisers say they must rely on the government to provide.</p> <p>The project site is not connected to the national grid and, except for a tiny scattering of solar panels, has no electricity. Population growth and a lack of family planning are major issues in West Mamprusi, straining already limited food supplies and making education unaffordable.</p> <p>The MVP has modest aims to increase contraception use among married women, from 8% to 35%. Other targets are to increase the number of children sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets to 80%, halve the under-five mortality rate, and ensure 90% of children finish primary school, in line with the millennium development goals.</p> <p>Sachs is hopeful the project will show these goals can be accomplished through relatively small per capita spending. \"These are very hard, very poor places,\" he says. \"The budget is not very large, and we are trying to make a small amount of money go a long way.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 31 August 2012.

If Heathrow is supposed to be just a 'hub' where people can change, use it for that and remove all none-connecting flights to free up slots.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17940602\">falco1978</a></strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Expansion of Heathrow would be very damaging to a large part of London's quality of life. The requirement of planes to Heathrow to land into a pre-dominant westerley wind and Heathrows location to the west of London means that a high number of planes have to low-fly over London to land. This isn't just about South West London but both North East and South East. I can imagine non-Londoners don't care but it's idiotic to have this noise-disruption over the most densely populated area of the country.<br>Whilst it may be the most expensive option the long-term best solution is for the Thames Estuary location where most noise occurs over the sea. Having this linked to London via high speed trains and Europe with the chunnel would make it accessible and as green as would be possible.<br>Why everyone has suddenly decided we're being constrained by airport capacity is beyond me... who exactly is it effecting? if it means there is a constraint on needless ecologically-damaging flying then so be it!</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17941069\">poddys</a></strong> comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Geographically speaking, a new airport east or northeast of London would just make it harder still for people west of London to get there. Living in Southampton I already discount Stanstead when looking for flights because of the long journey times to get there.<br>Logically, I would have thought that a new large airport somewhere around Newbury would (a) take the traffic pressure off London and (b) make the airport far more accessible for people from the South, Southwest, The Midlands and South Wales. You have the M4 running east/west from there and the A34 running north/south.<br>Building a humongous airport from scratch there, with a view to it replacing Heathrow in the future makes sense to me. Of course nobody is going to want one of the largest airports in the world on their doorstep, but starting from scratch this ought to give airport designers an opportunity to allow for the best design for terminals, parking, and access to and from the airport.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17941097\">richardofbirmingham</a></strong> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A wider strategic approach than a londoncentric one is needed. Trade with the developing world requires a reinvigoration of the manufacturing heartlands of the north and midlands. London will continue to be the prime tourist destination of choice and financial services is likely to remain a major earner but a rebalancing is crucial if we are to continue to prosper. This implies a shift in infrastructure investment away from the south east and London, in particular. Expansion of Birmingham International Airport combined with the direct rail link into the high speed continental system which will connect the midlands and, later, the north, is a better choice. A rail stop off facility in London will meet any capacity issue especially, as many will no longer need to travel to Heathrow from other areas.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Ghana's returnees</h2> <p>Fellow returnees provided fascinating insights in response to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/26/ghana-returnees-afua-hirsch-africa\">Afua Hirsch's piece on her own experience and the trend among Ghanaians to return to Ghana to work and live</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17910850\">huggahoddie</a></strong> posts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Afua you have written my own story.

As a white Brit married to a Ugandan lady with South Africa as home, my family and I have navigated similar issues to you but in a country that is still recovering from the institutionalised racism and oppression of apartheid. I recognise, however, your nuanced portrait of the complexities of African countries. I usually work in three or four other southern African countries for short periods of up to three weeks at a time every year and, while there are obviously similarities, there are also great differences. Zimbabwe is as different from South Africa as the UK is from France!<br>I think that the most important issue for Africa is however one that you didn't mention and that is the rural development. Africa is the continent that has the most under-utilised land and natural resources and the rest of the world is already getting hold of these reseources very rapidly! The greatest differences throughout Africa are between vibrant and rapidly growing cities and rural areas, still often deeply isolated, where subsistence agriculture often dominates and where poverty is at its worst.<br>Transition from communal to freehold land tenure systems is not the panacea for development that many, including the World Bank, seem to think it is. It is however vital that mixed land tenure systems are developed that both encourage inward investment for commercial agriculture while safeguarding land rights and access for the poor. The great issue of the next half century as African rural areas open up to the outside world, will be to ensure that rural development is equitable and benefits the poor.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17911503\">Shamboz</a></strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Good article but my experience is slightly different.

  "<p>The thing that still blows my mind about the internet is that through all the dramatic changes over the last two or three decades, it remains a mostly open public commons that everyone can use. There are many land ownership battles happening all around it, but it has so far withstood challenges to its shape, size, governance and its role in all aspects of our lives.</p> <p>Will that always be the case? Or are too many special interests with unbalanced power breaking down the core principles that made it our space \u2013 a shared space owned by nobody and available to everybody?</p> <p>It used to be that corporate interests were aligned with public interests on the internet. Many early pioneers thrived because they recognised how to create and earn value across the network, via the connection between things, the edges (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory\" title=\"\">read more on Graph Theory</a>). They succeeded by developing services that offered unfettered and easy access to something useful, often embracing some sort of sharing model for partners powered by revenue models built on network effects.</p> <p>These innovators were dependent on open and public participation and a highly distributed network adhering to common standards such as HTTP and HTML. The public and private interests were aligned.</p> <p>However, hypertext was designed for connecting text, not for connecting people. The standards designed for communication, such as SMTP and later XMPP were fine, but no standard for connecting people to other people achieved global adoption.</p> <p>Even backing from the web's founder for a standard called FOAF (<a href=\"http://www.foaf-project.org/\" title=\"\">The Friend of a Friend project</a>) and a Social Network Users' Bill of Rights backed by <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/michael-arringtons-revenge-11032011.html\" title=\"\">Michael Arrington</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble\" title=\"\">Robert Scoble</a> failed to lift the movement for standards in social connections.</p> <p>Without a standard the entrepreneurs got busy coming up with solutions and, eventually, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/aug/28/young-entrepreneurs-build-better-future\" title=\"\">Facebook and Twitter were born</a>. Like their predecessors, they recognised how to create and earn value in the connections between things \u2013 in this case, a network of people, a privately owned social graph.</p> <p>But the social graph they created is not an open, owner-less, public commons. Facebook is interested in Facebook's existence and has no interest in FOAF or XMPP. Industry standards are to be ignored at Facebook (and Apple, Microsoft and sometimes Google) unless they help to acquire customers or to generate PR.</p> <p>Governance is held privately in these spaces. They consult with their customers, but they write their own privacy policies and are held accountable to nobody but public opinion and antiquated legal frameworks around the world.</p> <p>Now, it's a very appealing idea to think about an open and public alternative to the dominant social networks. Many have tried, including <a href=\"http://status.net/\" title=\"\">StatusNet</a> and <a href=\"https://joindiaspora.com/\" title=\"\">Diaspora</a>. And more challengers are on the way.</p> <p>But there are harder problems to solve here that I think matter more than that temporary band-aid. We need to know why the industry failed to adopt a global standard for social networking. Will we go through this again as a market forms inevitably around a digital network of real-world things? Will it repeat again when we learn how to connect raw data?</p> <p>Can the benefits (and therefore the incentives) of ensuring contributions are owned and controlled by a platform's contributors in perpetuity be more commercially viable and legally sensible? Are there ways to support those benefits globally?</p> <p>In what ways can those who are adversely affected by centralised control of social activity hold those forces to account? Where is the balance of power coming from, and how can it be amplified to be an equal force?</p> <p>Much like the founders of the US Constitution, there were some very clever folks who codified open access to this public space we call the internet in ways that effectively future-proofed it. They structured it to reward individual contributions that also benefit the wider community. Instead of pen and paper, the internet's founders used technology standards to accomplish this goal.</p> <p>While it seems very doable to build a successful and lasting digital business that embraces these ideals, the temptation of money and power, the unrelenting competitive pressures and weak incentives to collaborate will steer many good intentions in bad directions over time.</p> <p>I don't think Facebook was ever motivated to support an open public commons, so it's no surprise when they threaten such a thing. But Twitter somehow seemed different. At the moment, it seems from outside Twitter HQ that the company is being crushed by the weight of these pressures, and so is making some bad choices over small issues that will have a big impact over time.</p> <p>It's not what Facebook and Twitter do that really matters, though. The greater concern, in my opinion, is that the types of people who originally created this global network for the rest of us to enjoy aren't being heard or, worse, not getting involved at all anymore.</p> <p>I'm not suggesting we need more powerful bureaucratic standards bodies to slow things down. Arguably, these increasingly powerful platforms are already crushing competition and squeezing out great innovations. We don't need more of that. Stifling innovation always has disastrous effects.</p> <p>What I'm suggesting is that more people will benefit in more ways over a longer period of time if someone can solve this broader organisational problem \u2013 the need to codify open access, shared governance, and other future-proofing tactics for public spaces in whatever shape they take.</p> <p>Social networking is threatening the open public network today. Something else will threaten it tomorrow. We need to work out what can be done today to fuel and secure an ongoing and healthy co-dependency between our public spaces and commercial interests.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>All manner of artists have done well out of Web 2.0. There are countless examples, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/aug/11/bo-burnham-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">comedian Bo Burnham</a> to <a href=\"http://www.pomplamoose.com/\" title=\"\">indie duo Pomplamoose</a>, of undiscovered creatives coming into prominence through canny use of online platforms. Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/justin-bieber\" title=\"\">some singing Canadian kid called Justin</a>.</p> <p>Broadly speaking though, theatre makers haven't benefited in the same way. Social networks and self-publishing might have expanded the promotional possibilities for live work, but, unlike sketches and songs, that work itself doesn't translate neatly into digital forms. Where it has, in the cases of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/apr/10/david-sabel-digital-national-theatre\" title=\"\">NT Live's screenings</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/02/bradley-manning-play-live-streamed\" title=\"\">livestreamed performances</a> by National Theatre Wales, the process has required significant resources and expertise, neither of which can be readily mustered by emerging independents.</p> <p>It's an issue of which David Jubb, co-artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre (<a href=\"http://www.bac.org.uk/\" title=\"\">BAC</a>), is acutely aware: \"Obviously there are great things like NT Live, but for my money, theatre is not exploring the full creative potential of what digital engagement might be.\" However, in a characteristically forward-thinking move, BAC is hoping to change that.</p> <p>Today sees the launch of a radical new digital initiative called <a href=\"http://scratchr.net/\" title=\"\">Scratchr</a>. It is very much an extension of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2009/sep/15/work-in-progress-theatre-scratch\" title=\"\">BAC's scratch methodology</a>, whereby artists expose work-in-progress to audiences at various points in the development process and build on the feedback.</p> <p>Scratch began in 2000, dreamt up by Jubb and then artistic director Tom Morris, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2009/feb/24/tom-morris-bristol-old-vic-regional-theatre\" title=\"\">now of Bristol Old Vic</a>. An audience of 40, mostly friends of the artists involved, watched the first scratch night. Now, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/feb/24/theatre1\" title=\"\">though not without its critics</a>, scratch is used all over the world, from the Sydney Opera House to the RSC. At the BAC itself, there's now a regular and willing audience, eager for some creative involvement by proxy, and the formal development ladder has given way to a looser, more accommodating system. \"We've consciously made it a lot more flexible because a lot of work goes one step back, two steps forward,\" says Jubb.</p> <p>Together with his co-director David Micklem, Jubb started considering the possibility of a digital equivalent 18 months ago. They never intended to replicate the existing model online, but hoped to extend its possibilities, knowing, as Jubb puts it, \"that it would change, that it couldn't remain the same.\"</p> <p>\"One of the earliest realisations was that live streaming might be one of the least important aspects,\" says Jubb, who felt the shoestring that scratch inevitably necessitates would make a \"crap\" viewing experience of little benefit to either party.</p> <p>That decision saw Scratchr shift into the realm of social network. BAC dropped its initial developers, a live-streaming company, to pair instead with Carl Morris and Tom Beardshaw of <a href=\"http://nativehq.com/\" title=\"\">NativeHQ</a>, the company behind digital elements of National Theatre Wales' productions, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/apr/24/the-passion-port-talbot-review\" title=\"\">The Passion of Port Talbot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/apr/19/radicalisation-of-bradley-manning-review\" title=\"\">The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning</a>.</p> <p>The site aims to use existing online tools (YouTube, Twitter, comment boxes) \"to enable people with creative ideas to come together to share and develop them.\" To do so, says Beardshaw, who has a background in anthropology, requires some sort of incentive: \"Reciprocity is often at the heart of social interaction, so there has to be some kind of motivation or incentive for anybody to get involved and put effort into thinking about somebody else's ideas.\"</p> <p>As such, NativeHQ proposed a new element to scratch called an 'Itch', which, says Jubb, \"is pre-scratch, just an idea, maybe for a show or a radio play or a story that you can share at that inceptive stage and see if anyone wants to scratch it with you.\"</p> <p>Eventually, anyone will be able start an itch, posting it onto the site to see what feedback comes, thus fostering a community of sorts. The aim is to attract other artists interested in collaborating or producers capable of turning the itch into an actual scratch. Scratches are then documented online through a series of digital assets \u2013 videos, <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/\" title=\"\">audioboos</a>, images etc \u2013 with audience members (and other artists and producers) able to provide feedback and further ideas en route.</p> <p>On one level, Jubb believes this allows BAC to \"uncover idea and talent that it might otherwise take us years to find.\" More importantly, though, it makes scratch more than a snapshot seen mid-process, encompassing the whole process, from start to finish. \"One of the exciting things about it is that it demystifies the theatre-making process,\" Jubb added. \"Audience members can track a piece of work or an artist, enter into dialogue with those artists and come to understand how things get put together.\"</p> <p>Of course, there are concerns, not least the potential for trolling \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/04/works-in-progress-pulse-sampled\" title=\"\">presenting unfinished work is a delicate activity</a>. Done live, an unspoken social contract exists between audience and artist. Online, that could easily get lost or willfully obliterated, leaving artists vulnerable. Jubb recognises the need \"to develop a culture of behaviour\" in order to carry those \"conventions into an online space.\" Accordingly, rather than launching as a finished product with a bang, Scratchr will start softly and evolve \u2013 \"a scratch of a scratch,\" Jubb calls it. Beardshaw says there's no other way: \"When you're developing social software, you need a community to be playing with it, trying to break it.\"</p> <p>For Jubb, however, that's part of the excitement: \"Anything decent on the internet gets adopted and adapted and appropriated for different purposes. It's almost bound to happen with this.\"</p> <p>Not only will this improve the site, it also restores the flexibility of scratch that might otherwise be curtailed by the reliance on a fixed set of digital assets that won't suit every process or artist. \"This isn't going to be for everyone,\" Jubb admits. \"We're not going to force every artist at BAC to use Scratchr and loads of artists won't want to go anywhere near it. That's totally fine. It's just another tool. If it became an alternative [to live scratches in the building], it would be a disaster.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, Jubb hopes that the digital version might have an impact comparable to the initial scratch process. Not that he's counting his chickens: \"It might go absolutely nowhere or it might become a global creative tool for sharing ideas. The reality will probably be somewhere in between.\"</p> <p><em>Matt Trueman is a theatre critic and journalist \u2013 read his </em><a href=\"http://carouseloffantasies.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Carousel of Fantasies blog</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/matttrueman\" title=\"\"><em>@mattrueman</em></a></p> <p><em>Find out more at </em><a href=\"http://scratchr.net/\" title=\"\"><em>Scratchr</em></a><em> or via </em><a href=\"http://www.bac.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Battersea Arts Centre</em></a><em> \u2013 follow BAC on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/battersea_arts\" title=\"\"><em>@battersea_arts</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>After a torrid few days, mining shares are edging higher again, giving the overall market a lift.</p> <p>Worries about a global economic slowdown, particularly in China, have led to falling metal prices, with iron ore especially weak.

Glencore/Xstrata is the cheapest major on a merged basis and has no exposure to plummeting iron ore, standalone Glencore is by far the cheapest and has the best free cash flow metrics and earnings momentum. <br> We retain our buy recommendation on Glencore and hold on Xstrata, and while we see limited downside to Xstrata on a break we estimate 25% outperformance in Glencore. </blockquote> <p>The revival in mining shares has helped lift the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> 16.52 points higher to 5735.97.</p> <p>Among the fallers, <strong>WPP</strong> has lost another 10p to 808.5p following Thursday's cut in its annual growth forecast as clients in the US and western Europe became more cautious about their advertising spending. Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We move to hold from buy as we see limited near-term catalysts, but will revisit when the third and fourth quarters become clearer. Outlook reduction is a disappointment but not a disaster, in our view, and fundamental attractions remain, i.e. international/emerging exposure. Shares may drift for now, and we believe it would be interesting to look to buy on any general market setback. </blockquote>",
  "<p>My father, David Lewis, who has died from pancreatic cancer aged 73, was a paediatrician whose dedication to the care of children in mid-Wales was matched only by his tireless pursuit of countless diverse passions, including sheep husbandry, ceramics, sailing (he did an Atlantic crossing), wild swimming, foraging for mushrooms and renewable energy. He was an enthusiast, who was as comfortable wielding a chainsaw on his farm as he was tending to ill children.</p> <p>A handful of doctors who also practised homeopathy, he integrated it into his holistic approach to paediatrics. He was a strong advocate of ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis) as a genuine illness, at a time when the medical establishment could be dismissive, and established one of the UK's first clinics dedicated to treatment of the condition. Even in retirement he continued to serve his patients, campaigning to retain the rural health services in mid-Wales that he had been instrumental in forging.</p> <p>David was born at Dinas Cross in Pembrokeshire. After the outbreak of the second world war, the family joined his father, a university lecturer, in Rangoon, travelling for six days by Sunderland flying boat, with overnight stops in Marseille, Naples, Alexandria, Basra and Karachi. David's earliest memories were of expat life in Burma, where the family lived until the Japanese invasion forced them to flee to Kotagiri, India.</p> <p>His postwar childhood was spent in Pembrokeshire, Radnorshire and London. David studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and St Thomas' hospital medical school, London, where he qualified in 1962, a year after he had met Clarissa, daughter of John and Myfanwy Piper. They married in 1965.</p> <p>In 1976, he was appointed the first consultant paediatrician at Aberystwyth hospital. He and Clarissa bought Alltfadog, a smallholding which became a focus for his enthusiasm. He breathed new life into the long-neglected farm, which became populated by sheep, pig, geese, ducks and chickens. He helped the local farmers and in turn was accepted into the farming community, although they found his behaviour unfathomable at times.</p> <p>In 2009, while David and Clarissa were skiing, Alltfadog was almost razed to the ground by a ferocious fire; it was the farmers in the valley who risked their lives to rescue the contents and who joined in the celebrations following the rebuild. David's wind turbine stands as a moving monument to his commitment to preserve the environment he had created.</p> <p>David is survived by Clarissa, me and my sister Emily, and five grandchildren. His first son, Leo, was born and died in 1967.</p>",
  "<p>The debate over how social landlords should use the government's green deal to improve the energy efficiency of their housing stock and save tenants money has been rumbling along for months. It is almost a year since I used this blog to argue that the deal represented a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/sep/23/editors-blog-green-deal?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">golden opportunity for housing associations</a>, placing them at the heart of the whole community and opening new doors for the future.</p> <p>In September 2011 I wrote: \"The green deal has so far barely managed its own carbon output, already producing a forest of discussion papers but little by the way of concrete action.\" There has been little action in the 12 months that followed. Why are housing associations so reluctant to make a decision about their role in the green deal?</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/eco/landlords-in-fix-over-green-deal/6523475.article\" title=\"\">survey carried out by Inside Housing</a> magazine has found that, even at this late stage, nine of the 17 largest landlords have made no firm plans about how to handle the deal. Just two of that 17 have said they would grant permission for tenants to undertake their own green deal works. Nine landlords had ruled out allowing tenants to commission the work themselves; five remain undecided.</p> <p>Meanwhile only two social landlords \u2013 Gentoo and London &amp; Quadrant \u2013 used the survey to confirm they have made plans to become a green deal provider. Three others plan to partner with private sector providers (though no further details were revealed) and the remaining nine have no firm arrangements in place, though the launch date is now just over a month away.</p> <p>From 1 October 2012, households will be able to apply for a government loan to fund energy efficiency works on their homes, with the cost of these works recouped through savings in future energy bills.</p> <p>This level of indecision will prove costly, not just for social landlords but also for the vulnerable and poor tenants they house. By refusing to commit themselves to an admittedly untested but potentially transformational retrofit programme, social landlords have passively handed private sector providers a lucrative gift at just the time when they need the financial boost themselves.</p> <p>By failing to act quickly while also refusing tenants consent to take on the burden of work themselves, they risk trapping households in a poverty spiral as they face rising energy costs as benefits and other state support is cut.</p> <p>The fundamental missed opportunity is one that could re-write the future of the social housing sector. As I argued last year, retrofit is a major project for homeowners. Many householders will need the reassurance of a respected, public sector partner before they agree to have this type of work undertaken.</p> <p>As a local green deal provider for all tenures, housing associations could have become local catalysts for change. By brokering work across all tenures, achieving the economies of scale necessary to make the deal worthwhile, they could have positioned themselves at the heart of communities. Success in this effort would have led to longer term engagement with businesses and residents, sending future project work their way and changing attitudes where hostility towards social housing remains.</p> <p>The failure to put solid green deal plans in place is a symptom of the housing sector's disease of detail. Without every last piece of government guidance in place, many landlords have decided to sit back and wait. In the meantime, private providers have stepped into the breach. This \"golden opportunity\" may have already slipped by.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",

In the proposed TV show, Foley is now a senior policeman in his home city and will appear only occasionally. His son will be the central character.</p> <p>\"What I'm trying to do with Beverly Hills Cop now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel is the chief of police in Detroit,\" Murphy, 51, told Rolling Stone last year. \"I'd do the pilot, show up here and there.\"</p> <p>Vulture says the show is being pitched as an hour-long police procedural with strong comic elements. There's no word yet on whether series regular Judge Reinhold, last seen on the big screen in 2009 straight-to-video effort <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1080926/\" title=\"\">Dr Dolittle: Million Dollar Mutts</a>, will also be cameoing as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW83NHon3uk\" title=\"\">mild-mannered LA detective William \"Billy\" Rosewood</a>, or whether the famous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dASqLXiuomY\" title=\"\">Harold Faltermeyer Axel F theme</a> will once again be heard ringing through Rodeo Drive.</p> <p>Murphy starred in three Beverly Hills Cop films between 1984 and 1994, with Tony Scott and John Landis following Brest in the director's chair. To date, the films have made more than $735m at the global box office. A fourth movie was reportedly in development in 2008 but came off the rails somewhat after proposed director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/jun/04/pleasesaveusfrombeverlyhi\" title=\"\">Brett Ratner suggested it would eschew the original films' edgy style for a more kid-orientated approach</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Coming to this country as a refugee after escaping the Kosovo war in 1999, I never believed that I would be given the chance to meet those who made the decisions that have, in essence, changed my life.</p> <p>From a young age, through learning about the history of Kosovo and it's fight for independence, I've been taught how important it is to have positive relations between countries. This is what has fuelled my desire to study international relations at university and embark on a career in politics \u2013 an area that has interested me since the age of 12.</p> <p>I'm currently studying A Levels in government and politics, modern history, English language and law at Cardinal Newman College, in Preston.</p> <p>Having embraced my passion for politics, and my desire to enter the political work field, my politics teacher informed me about the Whitehall internship, which he believed would help my future prospects. When I found out about it my initial reaction was to find out more and apply.</p> <p>The aim of the internship, set up by the <a href=\"http://www.socialmobility.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Mobility Foundation</a>, is to promote social mobility and increase civil service diversity by targeting under-represented groups. It's an aim which is supported by Baroness Warsi, minister without portfolio, who showed her enthusiasm for the internship at our opening ceremony. Head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake, who fully supports this scheme and who I got to meet, has also spoken up about how important it is for the civil service to be diverse.</p> <p>From numerous applicants, 60 year 12 students were chosen to participate in the scheme. All of us were split across the different government departments in Whitehall. I was allocated to the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) where I worked in the office of Peter Schofield, director general of neighbourhoods. The department has had heavy focus in the media in recent weeks <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/may/25/mary-portas-pilot-wolverhampton-award\" title=\"\">due to the Portas pilot scheme</a>, tackling council tax fraud as well as looking how economic growth can be increased via the regeneration of cities.</p> <p>During my time at DCLG I went to a variety of meetings, shadowing both directors and director generals who were discussing how to tackle the issue of economic growth. I was also given the chance to shadow Andrew Stunnell, parliamentary under secretary of state, at a meeting and then attend a question and answer session where I was able to find out more about minister's workloads and the type of jobs they have to complete day to day.</p> <p>Having attended these meetings and met such influential people, I gained an insiders knowledge of what it was like to work for the civil service and the pressures placed upon civil servants. Furthermore, I was also able to shadow members of DCLG's legal team and also meet litigation lawyers at the Treasury's solicitors department as well visit the supreme court. The people that I communicated with have stimulated me to widen my horizons and aim high. They were all immensely encouraging and helpful, and were always willing to answer any questions that I had.</p> <p>Being in the environment that, in the future, I would like to work in was astounding. I was able to learn more about the civil service and the different career options within it. All the information that I obtained was enormously beneficial and helped me come to the decision that I would like to become a fast streamer in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office once I have graduated.</p> <p>The experience has been overwhelming, inspiring and definitely enriching and I would recommend everyone, especially those interested in politics, to apply.</p> <p><em>Endrita Salihu is 17 and studying for her A Levels at Cardinal Newman College in Preston.

  "<p>The Tate's last exhibition of pre-Raphaelite art, held in a now distant 1984, was a rather dully chronological affair. According to one critic, the treatment \"seemed to symbolise a newly conservative reading of the pre-Raphaelites\". Greenery-yallery to Laura Ashley. A press photograph shows Margaret Thatcher at the opening alongside <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hughes-april-love-n02476\" title=\"\">Arthur Hughes's <em>April Love</em></a>. With 250 exhibits this was a catch-all survey. I remember emerging from it reeling with exhaustion. It succeeded in what one might have thought would be impossible. It managed to make the pre-Raphaelites bland.</p> <p>The current exhibition will be altogether different: leaner, more thematic, more politically charged. Women will be better represented. (Not difficult, considering that only two paintings by one woman, Elizabeth Siddal, were included in 1984.) Alongside pre-Raphaelite paintings and drawings will be sculpture, photography and prize examples of pre-Raphaelite furniture and textiles, emphasising the wide reach of a movement that was fiercely revolutionary in its aims.</p> <p>So what exactly was the <a href=\"http://www.pre-raphaelitesociety.org/index.htm\" title=\"\">pre-Raphaelite brotherhood</a>? Forget the bodice-ripping TV drama <em>Desperate Romantics</em>, which belittled the pre-Raphaelites as sexual desperadoes. These were ardent, ambitious and serious artists and poets. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais were the leaders of the movement formed in 1848. The pre-Raphaelite brotherhood embodied protest. William Morris was later to describe it as a \"really audacious attempt\" to reject the prevailing academic forms of art in favour of truth to nature. It was an audacity that applied to literature as much as to painting and the decorative arts.</p> <p>They called themselves pre-Raphaelites defiantly, taking up the purist values of pre-renaissance art of the period immediately before Raphael, drawing on the past to make their own mid 19th-century artistic revolution. We need to remember these were still very young men. Holman Hunt was 21, Rossetti only 20, Millais just 19. They formed a cohesive in-group, shutting out the unbelievers. Their dazzling manifesto on the true meaning of art proved terribly obscure to both the critics and the public.</p> <p>They were clever and sardonic. Their irreverence still makes them seem curiously modern. Alison Smith, co-curator of the Tate exhibition, is surely right in seeing the pre-Raphaelites as the first modern art movement and in subtitling her show \"Victorian Avant-Garde\". They were radical in their ways of looking, viewing their subjects with an intense psychological acumen. They were radical, too, in their techniques of painting. That pre-Raphaelite super-realism was achieved through meticulous attention to detail. The artists preferred painting outside the studio, the strange and often shocking candour of their vision exaggerated by the effects of natural light.</p> <p>The brotherhood was wonderfully wilful and obsessive. In the middle 1850s Holman Hunt spent two years working in the Holy Land. The weirdest and most controversial painting he returned with was <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/pre-raphaelites/scapegoat/\" title=\"\"><em>The Scapegoat</em></a>. The background had been painted in situ on the shores of the Dead Sea, site of the city of abominations, Sodom, while the goat itself was posed back in Jerusalem, standing in a tray of salt crystals and authentic Dead Sea mud. Hunt's complex symbolism bemused and angered people. If we can compare 1850s PRBs and 1990s YBAs (and in terms of shock value we definitely can) then <em>The Scapegoat</em> finds its obvious parallel in Damien Hirst's shark.</p> <p>PRBs were avant-garde in undermining the expected. Millais's painting <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-christ-in-the-house-of-his-parents-the-carpenters-shop-n03584\" title=\"\"><em>Christ in the House of His Parents</em></a> was seen as sacrilegious on account of its extreme verisimilitude and quirkiness. The conventional saccharine quality of Victorian religious art was absent. Millais's Christ child, shown with a symbolic bleeding palm, was described by Charles Dickens as \"a hideous, wry-necked, blubbering, red-haired boy in a nightgown\" who appeared to have received a poke playing in an adjacent gutter, while his kneeling mother \"would stand out from the rest of the company as a monster in the vilest cabaret in France or in the lowest gin-shop in England\".</p> <p>The pre-Raphaelite father figure Ford Madox Brown was indignantly attacked for <a href=\"http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1956P9\" title=\"\"><em>The Pretty Baa-Lambs</em></a>, an unsentimentalised plein air painting of his raw-red-cheeked wife and little daughter, derided by one critic as \"a facetious experiment\". Brown had broken the rules of domestic guardedness. The pre-Raphaelite artists were not afraid to tackle such problematic topics as poor law legislation, prostitution or the prevailing sexual double standards. They were pioneers in the way that they embedded moral meaning within the visual message. What was startlingly unusual was their sheer conviction that art could alter society itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395471187\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346240020136/Edward-Burne-Jones-008.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Burne-Jones. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edward Burne-Jones was a neurotic teenager in Birmingham when the brotherhood was formed. William Morris was \u2013 unhappily \u2013 at boarding school at Marlborough. But in the late 1850s, when they both arrived in London, they were absorbed into pre-Raphaelite circles as prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Rossetti. It was with this second generation of pre-Raphaelites that the movement reached its true maturity. Why has this not been recognised before?</p> <p>One reason is the long-prevailing snobbery among art historians and curators in giving higher status to pictures than to objects. Previous pre-Raphaelite shows have focused entirely on paintings and drawings in spite of the fact that one of the main planks of pre-Raphaelite reform was a call for unity of all the arts. The young reformers argued that architecture, furniture, wallpaper and textiles, illustrated books should stand in equal status with \"travelling pictures\", as Burne-Jones rudely termed them. These ideas were later to be widely influential on the arts and crafts movement and indeed the bauhaus, as the recent exhibition at the Barbican so brilliantly showed.</p> <p>Pre-Raphaelite politics have also been evaded. In previous surveys the political ferocity that fuelled these angry young men of mid-Victorian Britain has been considered far beyond the remit of curatorial politesse. In 1996, on the centenary of Morris's death, when the V&amp;A held a massive Morris exhibition, his socialist activities were crammed apologetically into a small corner. And yet it would be argued by those who know their Morris that politics were the very essence of the man.</p> <p>The new exhibition promises for the first time to give serious attention to the politics of art and the shimmering contradictions of a movement that combined the love of history, mythology and the classics with scientific study of natural phenomena and scathing contempt for the contemporary scene. These contradictions meet most spectacularly in the work of Burne-Jones, whose reputation, once so dire that in 1942 the Tate was able to buy <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burne-jones-love-and-the-pilgrim-n05381\" title=\"\"><em>Love and the Pilgrim</em></a> for \u00a342, is now on something of a roll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395471188\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346239573136/William-Morriss-four-post-008.jpg\" alt=\"William Morris's four-poster bed\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Morris's bed, with embroidery by Jane and May Morris.

Every Burne-Jones myth painting bears its own stark message, based on his bitter experience of growing up in Birmingham: the squalor caused by reckless industrial expansion, the absence of beauty in the vast majority of human lives.</p> <p>Morris too was mad on myths. While he was still at Oxford, he signed up for the Arthurian way of life, inspired by reading Southey's translation of Malory's <em>Le Morte d'Arthur</em>. He even commissioned his own Arthurian-style helmet from a local Oxford smith. Burne-Jones describes how Morris, always a cartoonable figure, got locked into it, hollering and swearing from inside. When Morris married, he built his own house, <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/redhouse/\" title=\"\">Red House at Bexleyheath</a> in Kent, as a red-brick Camelot, turreted and magical. You'll see in the exhibition the extraordinary <em>Prioress's Tale</em> wardrobe painted by Burne-Jones as a wedding present for Morris and his wife. This stood in their bedroom in the building which Rossetti described rightly as \"more a poem than a house\".</p> <p>Red House became a pre-Raphaelite powerhouse, headquarters of Morris's vociferous and marvellous \"campaign against the age\". Finding nothing in the shops that he could bear to live with, Morris brought in his brother artists to decorate Red House, working together to design and make furnishings in an early example of community arts. The style Morris espoused was the handmade, the vernacular. \"What business have we with art at all unless all can share it?\" he asked with his straightforward, almost childlike sense of fairness. The exhibition shows us some beautiful examples of Morris's designs for wallpapers and fabrics, which drew on natural motifs of birds and flowers and countryside, an aesthetic that appealed to people of all classes and indeed all cultures. He saw the point of pattern as a binder together of people of any nationality.</p> <p>What Morris loathed was waste and&#xa0;clutter, the cynical pretentiousness of 19th-century factory-made products. \"I have never been in any rich man's house,\" Morris said, \"which would not look the better for having a bonfire made outside it of nine-tenths of all that it held.\" A view that still holds good?</p> <p>Tate Britain has enlisted Mrs Morris as the exhibition's poster girl. How could it do otherwise, when Janey Morris, as depicted by Rossetti in <a href=\"http://www.manchestergalleries.org/the-collections/search-the-collection/display.php?EMUSESSID=0377d371bc4bd86c046f8295207617d5&amp;irn=163\" title=\"\"><em>Astarte Syriaca</em></a>, has come to personify the pre-Raphaelite femme fatale? The seductive gaze and bee-sting lips are in fact a bit misleading. The reality of Janey was more tentative, more practical. She liked a flirtation, certainly: after Rossetti came Wilfrid Scawen Blunt. But as a mother she was careful and responsible, as well as a skilled embroideress, a talent she passed on to her younger daughter, May. Morris, though hurt, was generously tolerant towards his wife's emotional excursions, believing that no one is another person's keeper. Janey and May together stitched the hangings for Morris's fantastical four-poster bed for Kelmscott Manor, another of the highlights of the exhibition.</p> <p>The pre-Raphaelite world saw a merging of the classes with a foretaste of the daring social flexibility we were later to experience in 1960s London. Janey Morris was an Oxford ostler's daughter. Ford Madox Brown's wife, Emma, had been the illiterate daughter of a farmer. Holman Hunt discovered his inamorata Annie Miller working as a barmaid in a pub in Chelsea and paid for her deportment and elocution lessons. Rossetti met the flamboyant Fanny Cornforth in the Strand, where she was chass\u00e9ing along cracking walnuts with her teeth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395471189\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346239739977/Mouse-by-Rosa-Brett-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mouse by Rosa Brett\" width=\"460\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Mouse</em> by Rosa Brett, c1860. Photograph: Private collection</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside the obvious excitements of sexual adventure lay chivalric attitudes of rescue and reform. The romantic image of the woman as co-worker was potent. Rossetti gave practical encouragement to Lizzie Siddal's serious ambitions as an artist. The ideal of the skilled woman in the workshop was to be a feature of arts and crafts communities from William Morris on. Recent feminist scholarship reveals how far the brotherhood was a hitherto-neglected pre-Raphaelite sisterhood as well.</p> <p>Among the many treats in the exhibition are paintings by Rosa Brett, elder sister of the better-known pre-Raphaelite landscape artist John Brett, and photographs by Julia Margaret Cameron, whose technical skills and poetic bravura in the composition of her pictures took her to the heights of pre-Raphaelite art. The exhibition gives us the rare chance to compare <a href=\"http://lizziesiddal.com/portal/elizabeth-siddal-and-tennyson/\" title=\"\">Lizzie Siddal's gawky, tender pen and ink drawing</a> <em>The Lady of Shalott</em> with <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/britannia/saxonadvent/hunt.html\" title=\"\">Holman Hunt's</a> much larger, higher-voltage, more hysterical oil painting of this favourite Victorian subject. This pre-Raphaelite masterpiece, lent by the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hertford, Connecticut, has not been seen in this country since it went on show in Bournemouth as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations in 1951.</p> <p>What makes this exhibition so important and so timely is the chance it gives us to see the hidden depths of a movement in which the artists' quasi-religious searching after new artistic standards was inextricably linked to contemporary intellectual debates and practical ideals of social reform. Look at Ford Madox Brown, represented here by his great panorama <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Brown_work.jpg/220px-Brown_work.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Madox_Brown&amp;h=155&amp;w=220&amp;sz=15&amp;tbnid=8zP8OQMRhB2JBM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=128&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dford%2Bmadox%2Bbrown%2Bwork%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&amp;zoom=1&amp;q=ford+madox+brown+work&amp;usg=__bY5jlloPvg-L5JS9FjDgxk2OSOM=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8_Q9UJDuL4bJ0QXyh4CgAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ9QEwBA&amp;dur=1284\" title=\"\"><em>Work</em></a>, which raises what were then stridently controversial issues on the relative value of the thinkers and the workers, the labouring classes and the employers. Brown was also the artist with the practical energy to open soup kitchens for the starving and a labour exchange for the unemployed in Manchester.</p> <p>Look again at gay pre-Raphaelite Simeon Solomon, the Jewish artist viewed by Burne-Jones as their \"rising genius\", whose promising career came to an end in 1873 when he was arrested in a public lavatory and charged with \"attempting to commit sodomy\". Tate Britain exhibits two of his works, a revealing self-portrait drawing and the beautiful androgynous oil painting <a href=\"http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1961P52\" title=\"\"><em>Bacchus</em></a>. At last we start to glimpse this lost pre-Raphaelite's potential significance as early undercover homosexual artist and interpreter of Jewish identity.</p> <p>But the absolute star of the show is Morris. A whole section, Earthly Paradise, charts what now seems his inevitable progression from the relative backwater of the artist-craftsman to the dangerous exposure of the political activist. As William Gaunt put it: \"His early attachment to King Arthur had led him irresistibly to Karl Marx.\" Here we see the ultimate example of pre-Raphaelite radicalism in action as Morris, in the 1880s, enters the mel\u00e9e of socialist revolutionary politics, finally exasperated by his role in \"ministering to the swinish luxury of the rich\".</p> <p>Here are Morris's \"<a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1894/chants.htm\" title=\"\">Chants for Socialists</a>\", rousing revolutionary choruses composed by the man who had once been the favourite poet of the bourgeoisie. Here is a fiercely argued, crudely printed pamphlet on \"<a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1890/monopoly.htm\" title=\"\">Monopoly; or How Labour is Robbed</a>\". And here is his widely influential novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fairytales/9780199539192/news-from-nowhere\" title=\"\"><em>News from Nowhere</em></a>, a vision of the future beyond the revolution, in which government buildings have been turned into a dung house and a classless, beautifully dressed and happily productive form of society has emerged. This was a book read avidly in Russia in the years before the Soviet revolution.</p> <p>All in all, this has been quite a year for William Morris. First the opening of the restored and redesigned <a href=\"http://www.wmgallery.org.uk/\" title=\"\">William Morris Gallery</a> in Walthamstow, the house where Morris spent his teenage years, and now his emergence as the noblest and most interesting of pre-Raphaelites. His ideas were precursors of our present-day concern for protecting the environment. He regarded beauty as everybody's birthright. His generous magnitude of vision, and his hatred of commercial greed and political chicanery, connects the pre-Raphaelite era to our own.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/extra/2012/aug/28/extra-pre-raphs-offer1\">Guardian Extra members are invited to a talk and private tour of the Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde exhibition at Tate Britain on 5 November.

They distinguish between growing crops with rainwater stored in the soil (known as \"green water\"), and water drawn from rivers, dams or underground sources (\"blue water\") which is mostly used for irrigation.</p> <p>\"The world is not land scarce,\" says <a href=\"http://lwrg.org/about-us/articles/Tony_Allans_Bio.html\" title=\"\">Tony Allen</a>, head of the London water research group at King's. \"But it is short of land with water.\"</p> <p>Africa is an appropriate destination for responsible inward investment as there are green water resources that produce only very low crop and livestock yields. \"[But] the vast majority of investors use blue water. It is a tough truth but if you irrigate with blue water, then you will run out because it is always over-allocated. Irrigation is the first thing that people reach for. But what you need is investment that does not affect blue water.\"</p> <p>Instead, say researchers, governments do not understand \u2013 or choose not to understand \u2013 that green water has far more potential than blue water to increase crop productivity. They also believe using blue water is a potential solution for climate change when it in fact magnifies drought and conflict.</p> <p>Moreover, says Keulertz, in today's economic climate, many governments would rather encourage investment by foreign corporations than develop the potential of their own small-scale farmers: \"If the same [irrigation] methods as in Latin America and Asia are applied to sub-Saharan Africa by investment in blue water irrigation schemes \u2026 it will lead to investment failures.\"</p> <p>The frenzy since 2008 for land with blue water available is now adding to pressure on governments of countries along the Nile, Niger and other African rivers to build more dams to provide more irrigation water for developers, with little or no consideration for the massive ecological and social effects this will have.</p> <p>\"Africa could avoid the mistakes of over-allocating its blue water resources by learning from the US, Australia, India and China. These economies are all taking decades to remedy the over-allocation of blue water,\" says Allen.</p> <p>So far, says Keulertz, very little investment has been made in green water farming, even though there are good examples showing it can work. Instead, the confirmed farm developments in Ethiopia and elsewhere expect to use many billions of gallons a year of blue water to grow crops.</p> <p>More research needs to be done into how much blue water the confirmed new farms in Ethiopia and elsewhere will use, but there is growing certainty that they could severely hurt other users, both nearby and downstream in other countries.</p> <p>\"Investment in highly mechanised, irrigation-based capital intensive agriculture can significantly increase yields but it can ignore the environment and local populations,\" says Holger Hoff, a researcher at the Stockholm environment institute.</p> <p>Her analysis of the potential water consequences of foreign direct investment in Ethiopia and the Upper Blue Nile show that the new farms, depending on what they grow, will increase plant water demand by as much as 87%, which would translate into a reduction of flow in some rivers of up to 19%. Flows in the Upper Blue Nile could drop by up to 5%, potentially severely affecting downstream users in Egypt, she says.</p> <p>\"Investors are largely ignorant of the role of water management,\" says Keulertz. \"The expectation is higher production, achieved by the mechanisms that led to past green revolutions in Asia and Latin America where blue water resources were abundant.</p> <p>\"In Asia, the limits of blue water resources have been fully tested. Scientists have repeatedly warned of not using blue water irrigation schemes with the necessary caution. Depletion or pollution of one part of the basin affects users a great distance away. The overuse of water in a contested basin such as the Nile can also increase the risk of conflict.\"</p>",
  "<p>Social business was a term first coined by <a href=\"http://www.muhammadyunus.org/\" title=\"\">Muhammad Yunus</a> to describe cause-driven businesses whose success is measured by their social rather than financial impact. As a concept, it has been increasingly embraced by a range of socially driven organisations looking to establish their purpose.</p> <p>Social businesses differ from social enterprises in that they are genuinely self-sufficient and do not rely on grants and philanthropy to deliver social impact. Despite the rise of social business however, many still question whether an organisation can successfully deliver both financial and social returns.</p> <p>The social business of today has evolved from being solely based on the cause, to being profit driven as well. Such businesses are recognising that to be sustainable in today's world, they need to deliver effectively and efficiently. Having a social mission matters little to service users and customers if the end product does not meet their exacting standards.</p> <p>This philosophy is evident in many leading social sector organisations, including <a href=\"http://www.catch-22.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Catch22</a>, a 200-year-old national charity that supports young people and vulnerable adults in transforming their lives, and the <a href=\"http://www.leyf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">London Early Years Foundation</a> (LEYF), a London wide social enterprise that works to ensure that children have the best start in life.</p> <p>These businesses, though successful and leaders in their own field, continue to undergo transformation to ensure that quality services are underlined by sustainable and effective business structures. For LEYF, this has meant developing a sustainable business model that is no longer reliant upon grants and local authority subsidies.</p> <p>Catch22 has made clear their business credentials with the recent launch of a new corporate strategy and the realignment of services along business delivery lines.</p> <h2><strong>Motivations for adopting a social business model</strong></h2> <p>It is clear that these changes within both organisations have been motivated by several factors. Both acknowledge that it is no longer viable to rely on grants and government funding going forward.</p> <p>June O'Sullivan, chief executive of LEYF, states that \"charity is too finite a model for business with no sense of sustainability \u2026 due in part to limiting opportunities for new business and growth.\"</p> <p>O'Sullivan sees the transformation of LEYF into a social business as necessary if the nursery is to have a wider social impact and create a new way of providing childcare to society.</p> <p>O'Sullivan and Chris Wright, Catch22's chief executive, make clear that their organisations have always operated as businesses in their own right, regardless of legal structures, with an emphasis on both financial and social gains.</p> <p>Wright emphasises that managing a charity with a \u00a350m annual turnover and 1,200 employees requires, like any other business, requires sound investment, financial management and many tough decisions. By making clear to stakeholders its business credibility, Chris Wright hopes to attract new partnerships and investment to enable Catch22 to demonstrate that they can deliver services more effectively than current providers.</p> <p>Catch22 recently partnered with Serco in HMS Doncaster to deliver a payment by results contract aimed at reducing reoffending by 5%, which is just one example of the way in which they are seizing new opportunities to compete for business.</p> <p>LEYF has similarly been able to take advantage of opportunities available to them through their partnership and subsequent investment from <a href=\"http://www.socialbusinesstrust.org/\" title=\"\">The Social Business Trust</a>, as they look to maximise the social impact they are having across London.</p> <h2><strong>Challenges of transformation</strong></h2> <p>Transforming a long established charity into a social business doesn't come without its complexities however. One of these is the extra hurdles that social businesses sometimes face. For example, O'Sullivan suggests that it can be harder for social businesses to gain the support and finance they need to grow and develop, especially in the current economic environment. Wright also notes that there is some uncertainty about the reception that social businesses will receive from competitors and potential customers.</p> <p>Both Wright and O'Sullivan highlight mindset obstacles within the organisation and acknowledge the need for cultural change. Wright points out that many people choose to work in organisations like Catch22 because they want to \"do good\" and believe that doing good is incompatible with doing well financially. This mindset means that organisations undergoing business transformation need to invest significant resources to bring staff along the transformational journey.</p> <p>Another challenge facing social businesses as they look to grow is how to provide clear measurement and a narrative of their impact. This is an area that both LEYF and Catch22 have invested in.</p> <p>O'Sullivan feels that LEYF is now able to effectively demonstrate their social and economic impact. However, Wright notes that overall social businesses continue to find it difficult to measure and attribute impact due in part to the lack of a widely accepted way of doing it.</p> <p>Despite the challenges it is clear that, for many organisations, correctly managing the balance between financial and social returns, and shifting towards a social business, is paramount if these organisations are going to successfully operate in today's world. In the words of O'Sullivan: becoming a social business is not only essential but a duty if we are to have greater impact.</p> <p><em>David Bartram and Melanie Yap are 2012 </em><a href=\"http://www.onpurpose.uk.com/\" title=\"\"><em>On Purpose</em></a><em> Associates.
