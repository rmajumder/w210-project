  "<p>It's not every day, or even every few decades, that a scientist tears up the dominant interpretation of Darwin's theory of evolution, but two years ago that's what the eminent biologist Edward Wilson and two of his Harvard colleagues did. In <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7310/full/nature09205.html\" title=\"\">a controversial paper</a> that made the cover of the journal Nature, they dismissed the widely accepted, half-century-old theory of \"kin selection\" and proposed a different explanation of the advanced social behaviour of insects to take its place \u2013 a&#xa0;revamped version of something that had long ago been dismissed by most biologists. (We'll look at the details of both theories in a moment.)</p> <p>The result was uproar. Almost 150 other scientists signed letters rejecting their findings and calling on others to do the same. Wilson refused to back down, and a few weeks ago published a book-length version of his argument, The Social Conquest of Earth.</p> <p>The fuse of his opponents was lit once again. This time it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jun/24/battle-of-the-professors\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins who exploded</a>. In a review in Prospect magazine titled The Descent of Edward&#xa0;Wilson, Dawkins accused Wilson of \"wanton arrogance\" and recommended potential readers to throw the book aside \"with great force\".</p> <p>Was Dawkins right? Is Wilson a once-great researcher who has taken a wrong turn? Has his deep concern for the environment, and desperation for a solution, made him susceptible to the idea that human co-operation is the key to our domination of the planet \u2013 which is what his theory proposes \u2013 and unable to recognise us for the selfish competitors we truly are?</p> <p>In a long conversation from his office&#xa0;at Harvard, where he is emeritus professor at the <a href=\"http://www.mcz.harvard.edu/Departments/Entomology/wilson_e_o.html\" title=\"\">Museum of Comparative Zoology</a>, Wilson, though clearly annoyed and more than happy to hit back at his detractors, sounds as though he is enjoying himself.</p> <p>\"I'm now too old to be dragged down by false modesty,\" he says with the hint of a southern drawl. \"Are we going to win the day? Of course. The mathematics in our paper has not been seriously challenged, and that's what the fuss is about. It has thrown defenders of kin selection into disarray. It&#xa0;also has to do with people very naturally defending the territories they&#xa0;have established to teach and do&#xa0;research on.\"</p> <p>I ask whether the dispute has upset him. Now 83, Wilson must surely feel he&#xa0;is in the final phase of a long career. Would he not have preferred to bow out to the sound of cheers?</p> <p>He says not. \"I am invigorated because I think this debate moves the study of social behaviour into the same league as&#xa0;similar controversies in the rest of science. There have been great disputes in every field. Remember string theory? Remember the early days of DNA?\"</p> <p>\"Would you like to talk about Dawkins?\" he continues \u2013 and when I&#xa0;say yes, he laughs. \"I hesitate to do this&#xa0;because he's such a popular guy, but&#xa0;Dawkins is not a scientist. He's a writer on science and he hasn't participated in research directly or published in peer-reviewed journals for a long time. In other words, there is no Wilson-versus-Dawkins controversy: it's&#xa0;Wilson versus \u2026 well, I could give you a goodly list of other scientists doing peer-reviewed research.\"</p> <p>That Dawkins is not engaged in research does not, of course, make him wrong about evolution. But&#xa0;I&#xa0;decide to call Andrew Bourke, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of East Anglia, to get another view. Bourke offers a robust defence of kin selection, or inclusive fitness, and questions whether humans are a \"eusocial\" species (the technical term for displaying altruistic behaviour) like ants&#xa0;and termites at all.</p> <p>I end the conversation firmly convinced that, as far as his peers are concerned, Wilson is a very long&#xa0;way from winning the day.</p> <p>Before he made the leap to what he&#xa0;called \"sociobiology\" in his breakthrough book of 1975, and began writing&#xa0;about people, Wilson was an insect scientist. An only child who grew up in rural Alabama and whose parents separated when he was in primary school, he avoided loneliness by taking a close interest in the natural world. He says he \"wandered off\" from the Baptist faith he was brought up in, much as Darwin gave up his Christian faith, but with far less angst, and began reading about evolution as a teenager.</p> <p>Although his reputation today is based on his writings about human evolution and biodiversity, which he first championed 20 years ago, it was in the field of entomology that he made arguably his greatest discovery: pheromones, now talked about in women's magazines as the secret of sexual attraction, but then utterly unknown.</p> <p>It was in a Harvard lab in the early 1960s that the young biologist had his epiphany surrounded by a captive colony of fire ants. Wilson thought they were communicating via chemicals, while others thought their messages were mechanical, more like simple taps. So he began dissecting them, looking for&#xa0;the source of the odour trail in miniature glands.</p> <p>\"I tried one after another and nothing, nothing, and finally I came to a tiny gland called Dufour, named after the guy that discovered it,\" he explains. \"It&#xa0;was sitting there like a pituitary or something and I teased it out and laid the trail and hey! A large part of the colony came pouring out, all excited, and they went wherever I led them.</p> <p>\"I found I could talk to these ants. I&#xa0;could write my name on a sheet of paper next to the nest and they would follow it, so I did that just for fun. I said, 'This is really something! Maybe ants do&#xa0;have a chemical code and maybe if you can get the right one, you can do amazing things.'</p> <p>\"So I guess that was one of my best moments. I guess that's the only night I&#xa0;couldn't sleep. I'm glad I told you that&#xa0;story because it's just a wonderful adventure and lots of fun to be a&#xa0;scientist.\"</p> <p>Nearly 50 years later, and still married to the wife he met in the Harvard admissions office, Wilson continues to have lots of fun. He is already planning another, more personal book, Letters to a Young Scientist, and recently returned from a field trip to Mozambique, where he is helping philanthropist Greg Carr rebuild the <a href=\"http://gorongosa.net/en/page/restoration/restoration-project\" title=\"\">Gorongosa national park</a>. There he was delivered by helicopter to a mountain rainforest that has never before been studied by entomologists, while at the edge of the park, in a series of deep gorges, is yet more untouched rainforest. \"It is literally a lost world, a&#xa0;thrilling experience.\"</p> <p>But for all his enthusiasm for fieldwork \u2013 those who know him describe a distinctive, head-down gait, the result of decades of scanning the ground for insects \u2013 biology alone has never satisfied Wilson. Synthesis has always been his thing. He worked in biogeography, invented the term sociobiology, and in 1998 wrote a book called <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Consilience.html?id=oM4bVo5dkZIC&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge</a> \u2013 which was more or less a theory of everything.</p> <p>This vast range has won him huge admiration, with novelist Ian McEwan among many high-profile fans. But he has also been a divisive figure, most famously in the 1970s, when he was physically attacked at Harvard after it was claimed that his&#xa0;ideas echoed the racist&#xa0;and misogynist claims of Nazi&#xa0;eugenicists.</p> <p>His new book takes in language and&#xa0;the arts in its bold attempt to demonstrate that generosity, as mandated by group selection, is humanity's secret ingredient \u2013 and continually warring in each one of us with our more selfish instincts.</p> <p>\"Individual selection is responsible for much of what we call sin, while group selection is responsible for the greater part of virtue,\" he writes in one&#xa0;of the book's bluntest passages. \"Together they have created the conflict&#xa0;between the poorer and better angels of&#xa0;our nature.\"</p> <p>Critics have attacked this dramatically simplified version of the human condition. But the fiercest argument is about evolution itself. Put simply, the theory of kin selection developed by WD (\"Bill\") Hamilton in the 1960s and championed by Wilson at the time says that insects such as ants evolved to become altruists because co-operating with their kin helped individuals promote their own genes. It doesn't matter if you give up the opportunity to reproduce yourself, goes the theory, so long as close relatives spread your genes instead.</p> <p>Wilson (and his collaborators Martin&#xa0;Nowak and Corina Tarnita) proposed instead a theory of \"multilevel&#xa0;selection\", whose name makes it sound more complicated than it is. In fact, there are two levels: ordinary, individual-level natural selection, whereby individuals strive to reproduce their own genes, and \"group selection\", an idea long ago dumped by biologists but now brought back to life.</p> <p>Group selection begins when a colony of creatures develops a behaviour that gives it a competitive advantage over other groups. Initially, this could be down to a random genetic mutation. So,&#xa0;instead of leaving the family nest, young ants or bees stick around to help. As Wilson describes it, this is the first step on the path to the highly ordered society, with its rigid division of labour, that has made the social insects, along with humans, the most successful species on earth.</p> <p>\"The key event is building a defended nest or campsite,\" he says \u2013 giving a whole new meaning to the communal spirit of group camping trips, and especially the ritual of cooking around the campfire, to which Wilson accords massive evolutionary significance. \"But it's still very uncertain and we have&#xa0;a huge amount of research to do in&#xa0;order to be completely sure. Just one&#xa0;mutation would prevent young individuals from leaving the nest, so&#xa0;genetic studies&#xa0;are badly needed, and&#xa0;in some groups [of insects] those are now under&#xa0;way. We wait to see the&#xa0;results.\"</p> <p>But Wilson was not content to wait for the data. A gifted writer and winner of a Pulitzer prize, with more than 20 books, including a memoir and best-selling novel, Anthill, under his belt (Margaret Atwood called it an \"Iliad of the ants\"), he has always been an ambitious communicator, as well as a scientist. In one striking passage in The Social Conquest of Earth, he describes humanity as a \"Star Wars civilisation with stone-age emotions, medieval institutions and god-like technology. We thrash about. We are terribly confused by the mere fact of our existence, and a danger to ourselves and to the rest of life.\"</p> <p>Wilson believes his latest formulation of evolutionary theory offers us a way out of this mess. \"I think we have the qualities to come through and staunch the haemorrhage of species extinction,\" he says. \"I just think people are capable of being a lot better than they have been. Why would you risk your life to save the life of a stranger? Why would you give up one of your kidneys? We really are a wonderful species, and I&#xa0;think if we can understand who we really are, then we can reach a much better world, and a much better arrangement than we have now.\" And&#xa0;about this, we must all surely hope&#xa0;that Edward Wilson is right.</p> <p><em>The Social Conquest of Earth by EO Wilson is published by WW Norton.

  "<p>It all seems so long ago. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> was a&#xa0;senator from Illinois running for the White House. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sven-goran-eriksson\" title=\"\">Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson</a> was the manager of mid-table Manchester City. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/jul/28/booksforchildrenandteenagers.jkjoannekathleenrowling\" title=\"\">Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows</a>, the seventh and last in the series, was published. That was the world in the summer of 2007 as the UK entered a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis\" title=\"\">financial and economic crisis</a> from which it has yet to recover.</p> <p>Famine has followed feast. In the years leading up to the crash, the banks took bigger and bigger bets and consumers borrowed against the rising value of their homes. Growth averaged 3% a&#xa0;year&#xa0;between 2001 and 2007 \u2013 a time of leveraged buyouts, of private equity deals, and of an anything-goes culture in the City.</p> <p>The years since have seen the biggest fall in output since the second world war, a short-lived and modest recovery, and a relapse. The double-dip recession Britain has been enduring since last autumn is only the second since modern records began and, unless things improve, it will take until 2014 or 2015 for the economy to get back to where it was before the recession started in early 2008.</p> <p>There is little expectation that they will. Britain's economic weaknesses \u2013 too much reliance on debt-driven growth, too big a&#xa0;financial sector, too narrow an industrial base \u2013 were papered over during the good years but have subsequently been exposed as banks have turned&#xa0;off the credit tap and consumers have been either unwilling or unable to borrow.</p> <p>The worst of the crisis came in the 19-month period between the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 and the G20 summit held in London in April 2009. Gordon Brown's Labour government part-nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, and allowed public borrowing to rise in the hope that tax cuts and spending on the infrastructure would put a floor under the economy. The Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.5%, the lowest in its history, and cranked up the electronic printing presses.</p> <p>To little real effect. In 2009, the economy contracted and by the time the coalition government came to power in May 2010, the budget deficit had risen to the highest it had ever&#xa0;been in peacetime. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a>, the new&#xa0;chancellor, said it was time for the government to do what businesses and consumers had been doing: tighten its belt.</p> <p>Osborne's plan was that the economy would become less dependent on consumer spending and the state for its growth. Instead, low interest rates, a weak pound and action to tackle the deficit would encourage companies to invest and export. Things have not gone according to plan. Consumers, hurt by high inflation, have been reluctant to spend and Whitehall cutbacks have started to bite. But the debt crisis in the eurozone, coupled with a sluggish global economy, have made exporting difficult, while businesses have mothballed investment projects until growth starts to recover. All four of the elements that make up growth \u2013 consumer spending, government spending, investment and exports \u2013 are struggling, which is why the economy is going nowhere fast. George Osborne has been insistent that there is no plan B. But should there be? And if so, what should it look like? Here, seven leading economists give him their ideas. <strong><em>Larry Elliott</em></strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josephstiglitz\" title=\"\">Joseph Stiglitz</a><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394788508\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345103194892/Joseph-Stiglitz-001.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Stiglitz\" width=\"120\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Stiglitz Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><em>Dear George</em></strong><br> The good news is, you're not part of the euro. So my first piece of advice would be, don't join! And second, call off the mad austerity. No large economy has ever recovered from a downturn as a result of austerity. It is a&#xa0;certain recipe for exacerbating the recession and inflicting unnecessary pain on the economy.</p> <p>Any additional spending should address the longer term problems \u2013 inequality and industrial restructuring \u2013 and target the most needy in society who, because of the downturn, are suffering the most. A more progressive tax structure \u2013 higher taxes at the top, lower taxes at the bottom \u2013 would stimulate the economy. Taxing the excessive speculation that goes on in the financial sector would also be a good thing.</p> <p>There's a basic economic principle called the&#xa0;balance budget multiplier. If the government simultaneously raises taxes and raises spending, by the same amount, it stimulates the economy and creates jobs. Instead, both the US and the UK have embarked on a&#xa0;policy of austerity, but at least Obama realised he needed a larger stimulus and has been pushing for it. The Conservatives have taken the other stance, and it hasn't worked out.</p> <p><em>Joseph Stiglitz is Professor of Economics at Columbia University and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846146930\" title=\"\"><em>The Price Of Inequality</em></a><em> (Allen Lane).</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paul-krugman\" title=\"\">Paul Krugman</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394788509\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345102732979/Paul-Krugman-001.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Krugman\" width=\"120\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Krugman.London.By David Levene.29/5/12 Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><em>Dear George</em></strong><br> The answer is: start over. The UK is basically the same as the US. You've got a private sector that got too far into debt, everyone's trying to pay it down at the same time, and the government needs to be going in the other direction, not adding to that. Undo that austerity. You can currently borrow at real rates that are essentially zero, so this is a good time to be increasing public investment.</p> <p>The UK is fairly unique, it having gratuitously chosen to pursue austerity. The eurozone countries have little alternative, but Cameron really didn't have to do this. So my message to you is: do the opposite of what you've been doing for the last two years. The credit ratings don't matter at all, so this argument about austerity keeping Britain's triple A rating doesn't make sense. This is a&#xa0;time for the UK government to be borrowing and spending. Boost the economy and give the private sector time to de-leverage. By all means lock in austerity for the medium to long run, but not now. If everyone tries to slash spending at the same time, that's a&#xa0;recipe for what you've got: a depressed economy.</p> <p><em>Paul Krugman is</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Professor of Economics at Princeton University and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780393088779\" title=\"\"><em>End This Depression Now!</em></a><em> (WW Norton).</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vicky-pryce\" title=\"\">Vicky Pryce</a><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394788510\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345102775950/Vicky-Pryce-001.jpg\" alt=\"Vicky Pryce\" width=\"120\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Economist Vicky Pryce for the Saturday Interview. .Photo by Linda Nylind. 29/9/2011.

Instead of taking a&#xa0;year to recover, as after a typical recession, full recovery after a financial crisis can easily take another decade or more. There is no shortage of polemicists who argue that the UK should run even larger deficits in view of today's extraordinarily low short-term interest rates. This is classic short-term thinking.</p> <p>All the advanced countries, including the UK, could probably benefit from having higher inflation for a few years. This would help facilitate downward adjustment in the real (inflation adjusted) value of wages and houses, and also achieve a modest deleveraging of public- and private-sector debt. But the best way to deal with a long-term problem is through long-term growth-enhancing structural reforms. For example, revitalising Britain's infrastructure. Along with improving primary and secondary education, the UK would do well to ask what bottlenecks might be preventing faster growth in technology and biotech firms surrounding the&#xa0;UK's world-class university systems. Most&#xa0;British banks are currently forced to pay a premium for funds, which is in turn affecting lending rates to businesses, so more aggressive recapitalisation of the banking system to promote&#xa0;greater competition might help ease lending conditions, and promote investment.</p> <p>There is no quick <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics\" title=\"\">Keynesian</a> fix.

Like&#xa0;throwing away the engine to trim a car, you have offset the lack of revenue recovery by slashing capital spending.

This is because, just as an individual can finance his spending either from his income or via his credit card, a nation spends from either its income or the increase in its debt level. Rising debt reduces unemployment, while falling debt increases it \u2013 but of course this is a fool's path to prosperity, because debt can't forever rise faster than income.</p> <p>You have inherited an economy that has followed that fool's path, and is now deleveraging \u2013 and may do so for decades. In this environment, reducing public debt by running a government surplus accelerates the downturn. But the contrary policy \u2013 of simply running government deficits \u2013 isn't ideal either. You also need to reduce the private debt directly, by what is best described as \"Quantitative Easing for the Public\". This would give money to the public via their bank accounts, on the condition that those in debt must pay it down, while those without debt&#xa0;would get a cash injection. Debt would be directly reduced, benefiting everyone \u2013 except the banks, whose incomes would fall. That surely&#xa0;sounds like radical advice, but without a&#xa0;direct reduction in private debt, Britain faces as&#xa0;many lost decades as Japan has already endured \u2013 and without its export surplus to cushion the blow.</p> <p><em>Steve Keen is Professor of Economics and Finance at the University of Western Sydney, and author of&#xa0;</em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781848139923\" title=\"\"><em>Debunking Economics</em></a><em> (Zed Books).</em></p> <p>\u2022 Inset images: Murdo Macleod; David Levene; Linda Nylind; Getty Images (2); James Croucher</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the \u00a39,000 tuition fee refugees. The number of British students applying to Dublin's <a href=\"http://www.tcd.ie/\" title=\"\">Trinity College</a> has jumped by 20% to nearly 2,000 this year. At <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/\" title=\"\">University College Dublin</a> (UCD), applications from students with British A-levels have surged 37% from 800 to around 1,100. The University of Groningen in the Netherlands, where many courses are taught entirely in English, has seen the number of applicants from Britain quadruple in the last two years alone.</p> <p>British 18-year-olds are fleeing the prospect of a \u00a350,000 bill for studying at home \u2013 and finding they can save as much as \u00a325,000 over three years by studying abroad as well as enjoying a life-changing experience.</p> <p>In Denmark, tuition fees for students from within the EU are zero. In the Netherlands, they are around \u20ac1,700 a year (\u00a31,330), and it's even possible to access Dutch state grants worth around \u20ac500 (\u00a3390) a month (see page 5). Irish institutions such as Trinity and UCD, ranked among the top universities in Europe, charge just \u20ac2,250 a year (\u00a31,760) to EU citizens.</p> <p>It has also emerged that a significant number of UK students have applied to universities in the EU as an \"insurance\" against failing to achieve the grades they want and having to go through clearing. Many British \"Russell group\" universities now demand A-level scores of AAB and above, while similarly-ranked Dutch universities accept lower grades \u2013 though they are much tougher (almost brutal, say some) about weeding out underperforming students in their first term.</p> <p>\"It's not exactly a flood of students fleeing the new tuition fees in Britain, but we are seeing much more interest,\" says Mark Huntington, who runs <a href=\"http://astarfuture.co.uk/\" title=\"\">astarfuture.co.uk</a>, which has since 2006 offered a free advisory service to British students and parents considering higher education opportunities abroad. There are now more than 1,200 degree courses in Europe (not including Ireland) taught entirely in English, while in the Netherlands alone 20 universities are teaching in English.</p> <p>\"The overall cost of a three-year course in Holland, taking in tuition fees, accommodation and living costs, will be around \u00a324,000 compared with the \u00a350,000 or so it now costs in the UK,\" says Huntington. But, as he warns on his website, \"we don't believe you should go abroad just to save money and there are lots of other reasons why studying abroad is a good idea.</p> <p>\"It is also worth bearing in mind that even though a degree abroad may be significantly cheaper than an equivalent qualification in the UK, you will possibly have to pay out more up front than if you were to study at home.\"</p> <p>Not being able to speak a word of Dutch, Danish or Flemish does not seem to be a problem. \"You could survive the whole way through a course in Holland without learning a word of Dutch,\" says Huntington. \"I wouldn't recommend it, but it is possible.\"</p> <p>Hania Thurlow, 18, from Norwich, left for <a href=\"http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/\" title=\"\">Maastricht University</a> yesterday a day after learning she had got A*AB in her A-levels. She initially planned to go to the University of Exeter, anticipating three A grades, but was deterred by the costs.</p> <p>\"The fees really put me off,\" she said. \"I know you can take out loans and don't have to repay them straight away, but it's still a huge debt. Accommodation costs are lower too. In Maastricht I will pay \u20ac375 (\u00a3293) rent a month for a room, but Exeter wanted \u00a3125 a week (\u00a3540/month). Even travel is cheaper \u2013 I can fly home from Eindhoven for around \u00a330 on Ryanair, less than the cost of going to Manchester.\"</p> <p>She is aware of the tougher first year students face in the Netherlands compared to Britain, but is unfazed: \"The first year is supposed to be quite difficult. But I'm going to university to study hard anyway.\" She has also already lined up part-time employment (arranged through the university) as a babysitter for Dutch families, and will be starting lessons in Dutch when she arrives. She says one other student from her school in Norwich is already at Maastricht, and another has applied.</p> <p>Christian Garrard from Canterbury, who is about to start his fourth year studying law at the <a href=\"http://www.rug.nl/corporate/index?lang=en/\" title=\"\">University of Groningen</a> says: \"It's the best decision I have ever made. I had a Dutch girlfriend and if it wasn't for her I would probably have thought, no way. It was only really daunting until I got here. As an international student you live in an international house, mostly with other foreign students who all speak English, while Groningen is almost becoming a bilingual university. I've thrived on it, though maybe if you're more of a home-bird it's not for you.\"</p> <p>Garrard worked part-time, which also enabled him to access Dutch grants, meaning that after two years he had no debts at all: \"I was even saving money at one point.\"</p> <p>But it is the Republic of Ireland which is seeing the biggest surge in British students beating the tuition fee hikes. For many 18-year-olds it is far less daunting than going to a non-English speaking country and many arrive with family connections in the country. The major barrier is academic entry requirements. \"The grade requirements can be almost ridiculously high,\" warns Huntington. The Irish equivalent of A-levels is the Leaving Cert, which covers six subjects. Unless a British student has studied four A-levels and gained good grades, they may find it difficult to obtain enough points to qualify for an Irish university.</p> <p>Prices in Dublin, once one of Europe's most expensive cities, is another issue, though the cost of living has fallen in recent years. UCD says rent for on-campus rooms are \u20ac486 a month (\u00a3380), while living off campus nearby in Rathmines would be about \u20ac450 (\u00a3352). The universities of Cork, Limerick and Galway all charge similar tuition fees but with lower living costs.</p> <p>Most of the \"bargain\" tuition fees are in EU countries, but some students are heading further afield. The University of Nottingham has set up campuses in<a href=\"http://www.nottingham.edu.my/index.aspx\" title=\"\"> Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Ningbo, China</a> (south of Shanghai), where students graduate with a UK degree. At \u00a37,100, fees at the Kuala Lumpur campus are not far short of the cost of studying at Nottingham, and most students are from Malaysia, but a number are now coming from Britain, many having gained scholarships. Without scholarships (and no access to student grants) the financial equation is much less attractive, though living costs are a fraction of the UK. In Ningbo, student accommodation is \u00a3100 <em>a year</em>. Nottingham was first to pioneer campuses abroad, and others are following: <a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/malaysia/about/uorm-about.aspx\" title=\"\">Reading University</a> is opening a Malaysian campus in 2015 while <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/xjtlu/\" title=\"\">Liverpool</a> is partnering with a university in Shanghai.</p> <p>Emerging universities in Asia, keen to recruit European students, are also offering highly attractive scholarship programmes to students with decent A-level grades. Ben Poulter, 18, from Brentwood County High, a state school in Essex, will be packing his bags in a few weeks' time to head to Singapore, where he will begin a four-year course in business at <a href=\"http://www.spjain.org/\" title=\"\">SP Jain Global School of Management</a>. His second year will be in Dubai, followed by two years in Sydney, Australia. And the $18,000 annual tuition fees will be sliced to zero as it's entirely paid for by the scholarship.</p> <p>\"SP Jain came to our school and gave a presentation to year 12 and year 13 [lower and upper sixth],\" he says. \"I applied and they offered me a scholarship almost immediately after the interview so long as I got AAB at A-level. I'm really excited. It's a little bit daunting, but an incredible opportunity.\"</p> <p>Poulter was lucky; his school encouraged students to consider opportunities abroad. But Gerard Spencer, founder of <a href=\"http://www.europeducation.org.uk\" title=\"\">europeducation.org.uk</a>, which provides information on studying in Europe for students and parents, says: \"Unfortunately, most British schools don't talk about options outside the UK for higher education. Admissions to European universities for September 2012 are now closed. But postponing the decision for a year and starting in a European university in 2013 would be a unique and life-changing decision.\"</p> <h2>Reality restricts the overseas options</h2> <p>British students have a huge range of options for studying abroad, but the reality \u2013 if you want to keep costs low and can only speak English \u2013 is that Ireland and the Netherlands are head and shoulders above the rest. We've highlighted a few other choices \u2013 Denmark and Norway in particular, as they do not charge tuition fees. We excluded France and Germany because they have few courses taught in English (apart from a few specialist private universities). The US and Australia, with pricey tuition fees, only come into the picture because they offer numerous scholarships.</p> <h2><strong>Republic of Ireland</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395590193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345205110023/Republic-of-Ireland-flag-001.jpg\" alt=\"Republic of Ireland flag\" width=\"220\" height=\"152\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republic of Ireland flag Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tuition fee</strong> \u20ac2,250 (\u00a31,760) student contribution for 2012/2013, expected to rise to \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,955) next year. Students also pay \"capitation\" fees at institutions such as University College Dublin (\u20ac183/\u00a3143) to cover facilities such as its 50m pool. Private universities charge around \u20ac5,000 (\u00a33,900) a year.</p> <p><strong>What's available</strong> Seven universities, 14 institutes of technology and a number of private universities. Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin are ranked in the world's top 200 universities.</p> <p><strong>Entry requirements</strong> Tough. Based on points score in the Irish Leaving Certificate (six subjects, maximum 600 points for six As). A British A grade is worth 135 points, so students will need four good A-levels to obtain a place a leading university. Irish universities do not make conditional offers. No one receives an offer from an Irish university until they have received their grades.</p> <p><strong>Grants/Scholarships</strong> No Irish state grants for UK students. Individual universities have limited scholarships/exhibitions for top students.</p> <p><strong>Accommodation</strong> Not cheap. As an example, University College Dublin this year charges \u20ac486 (\u00a3380) per month.</p> <p><strong>Living costs </strong>High, especially in Dublin, where the price level is similar to London or higher. Part-time earning opportunities more limited than in the past; the Irish unemployment rate is 14.8% compared with 8.1% in the UK.</p> <h2><strong>Netherlands</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395590194\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345205132268/Netherlands-flag-001.jpg\" alt=\"Netherlands flag\" width=\"220\" height=\"151\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netherlands flag Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tuition fee</strong> \u20ac1,771 (\u00a31,385) for most courses.

Groningen and Maastricht are the most popular among British applicants. Groningen, founded in 1614 and one of the Netherlands' oldest universities, currently offers nine undergraduate programmes in English but will raise that to 19 in 2013.</p> <p><strong>Entry requirements</strong> A general rule is that a GCSE in three subjects with marks ranging from A*-C, plus a GCE (A-level) with three subjects at advanced level (six different subjects in total) is comparable to a Dutch VWO diploma and thus admissible for a programme in a Dutch university.</p> <p><strong>Grants/Scholarships</strong> British students can access Dutch student finance on exactly the same basis as local students. So long as you find part-time work of at least 32 hours a month and pay Dutch national insurance, you qualify for a grant of \u20ac266 (\u00a3208) a month, plus you can apply for a means-tested additional grant of up to \u20ac242 (\u00a3189) a month. Students can also borrow up to \u20ac285 (\u00a3223) a month if they have been awarded the full means-tested grant.</p> <p><strong>Accommodation</strong> Expensive in Amsterdam. Don't expect en-suite bathrooms. Rents outside the capital are typically \u20ac200-\u20ac400 (\u00a3150-\u00a3300) a month.</p> <p><strong>Living costs </strong>Approximately the same as London and the south-east of England, but higher than the north of England.

  "<p><strong>We have lived in a house since 1979 that is next to a river and therefore in a flood plain. It has never been known to flood (the previous owner had been resident since 1945). When we arrived, we insured with General Accident (GA), which was taken over by Aviva. </strong></p> <p><strong>In 1992, we had a claim for subsidence, and the stabilisation project was completed and certificated by a qualified structural engineer and our claim was settled by GA. We understood at that time that we would be tied to GA for buildings insurance purposes for the following 10 years because of this claim. </strong></p> <p><strong>However, we have found it impossible to obtain cover from any other company and it appears to be a monopoly situation. The result is that, while our annual premium for buildings and contents insurance was \u00a31,529.98 in June 2011, this year it has risen to \u00a32,696.12. We have had to pay this amount but feel \"trapped\" and wish to know where we stand for the future and what our options are. </strong><em>CK, Wern, Shropshire</em></p> <p>An almost \u00a31,200 year-on-year increase in your insurance premium seems enormous, particularly when you have not claimed for 20 years and your area has not been flooded.</p> <p>Although you thought the premium might be linked to your previous subsidence claim this is, in fact, irrelevant. Aviva says the reason that there has been such a hike is that the previous premium did not fully represent the flood risk the property presents. It says your property is in the highest risk category for flood, being 15 metres from a river that, if it were to flood, is predicted to do so in the direction of your house.</p> <p>Insurance companies have been updating their flood-risk models in recent years and have been increasing premiums hugely in some areas due to perceived risk. Many are effectively trying to price high-risk customers off their books. It sounds like you have been a victim of this.</p> <p>We put you in touch with the National Flood Forum (floodforum.org.uk, 01299 403055), a charity set up to help people in your situation. It offers advice on what people in flood-risk areas can do \u2013 for example, in your case possibly obtaining an Environment Agency report on the flood risk in your area to see if this backs Aviva's assertion. It also searches around for lower premiums for flood-risk households. It gave you the number for a broker, Insurance Choice (insurancechoice.co.uk, 0843 22 70 106), which quoted you a premium of \u00a3855.90, a saving of \u00a31,840.22 on the Aviva quote.

  "<p>Toryboy and I don't agree on much, especially when it comes to parenting. (\"I just want him to&#xa0;be happy,\" says Toryboy. I see happiness as I was taught to see it \u2013 a desirable by-product of working hard at school, following instructions from all forms of authority and&#xa0;never thinking for myself, but&#xa0;immoral if pursued as a goal in itself. This&#xa0;creates some conflict, which&#xa0;is a&#xa0;shame, as I&#xa0;am&#xa0;clearly right.) But&#xa0;we agree on one thing.&#xa0;We are&#xa0;going to hide&#xa0;the&#xa0;internet from our child.</p> <p>This is partly because of its ability to reveal the grimmer side of humanity, of course, but it is also because we are aware that technology has now left us so far behind that we will never catch up. We can't work the new car seat, never mind download an app or upload a photo. \"And why should we?\" cried Toryboy, puce with fury late one night after yet another futile attempt at coaxing a thingy that promises to read the barcodes of all the books in your home (and keep a meticulous record of them all in what we both still vaguely imagine to be literal, usually manila, tiny files and folders) out of the ether and on to his phone. \"I'm old enough to remember taking empty pop bottles back to the shop for pennies, for God's sake! I'm old enough to remember the&#xa0;word 'pop'!\"</p> <p>By the time our son is old enough to use the computer, we won't be able to help him. Thus, in the time-honoured tradition of all good parents, we have decided it is better to circumscribe his activities and curtail his life chances than to risk revealing our weakness. The whole point of having a child is so that there is at least one person in the world who believes, for a few short years \u2013 or 38 and counting in my mother's case \u2013 in your absolute omnipotence.</p> <p>At the same time, I&#xa0;also feel that we are genuinely \u2013 if incidentally \u2013 doing the right thing by him. In my heart of hearts, I believe that the internet is... well, I'm not quite sure what the word is, but something between a miracle and a&#xa0;mirage. Unreal. Temporary. A fabulous but fleeting gift. Something to be enjoyed but not relied upon, like a crazy uncle or exotic godmother. That's on a good day. On bleaker ones, I become convinced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/timbernerslee\" title=\"\">Tim Berners-Lee</a> is the beach-head landing party for some alien race that has invented the perfect way of deskilling the global population and rendering them powerless against attack.

  "<p>Many of us walk through our front garden every day, in all seasons, and yet, apart from perhaps jazzing up the front door with some marguerites in pots (replaced by cyclamens in winter), we often don't make the most of this precious bit of green space. It's surprisingly easy to let it become a place where bins and car or bikes stand in full view, where junk lies around waiting to be taken to the dump, and where you haven't yet got round to doing something about the dusty shrubs inherited when you bought the house.</p> <p>Here are three good reasons to give the front some tlc. First, by the addition of some thoughtful planting and screening, you \u2013 and your visitors \u2013 will have the pleasure of a verdant journey, with a background of buzzing insects or calling birds, to the front door. Second, <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/firstimpressions\" title=\"\">a well-tended front can add value to your property and maybe even clinch a sale</a> and encourage your neighbours to green up theirs, too. And, third, you can make a&#xa0;significant improvement to the local environment and especially the issue of flooding by rethinking the amount and type of paving you have, and by introducing a generous covering of plants.</p> <p>A recent survey for the <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk/Gardening/Sustainable-gardening/Urban-greening\" title=\"\">RHS</a> showed that although those surveyed were generally environmentally aware (more than half had compost bins, wildlife areas and water butts), only one in 10 realised that planted gardens can help prevent flooding, and one in five had 75% or more of their front garden paved over. A&#xa0;survey on parking, published last month by the <a href=\"http://www.racfoundation.org/media-centre/spaced-out-press-release\" title=\"\">RAC</a>, found that 7m front gardens are concreted over (car ownership has risen from 2m to 28.5m since 1950). Paving can increase the amount of rainwater that runs off by as much as 50%, overloading storm drains and causing floods; soil and plants, on the other hand, slow down the runoff, eventually returning the water to the water table. Plants, especially trees, help to cool the atmosphere and filter polluted air. They also provide places for wildlife to feed and live.</p> <p>Since 2009, any front garden bigger than 5 sq m has to have planning permission to be paved. But even if your garden's smaller, it's important to think minimal hard landscaping \u2013 a path to the front door, somewhere to park the car \u2013 and to make sure it's permeable. The simplest and cheapest surface is gravel but there's a whole range of products, from brick pavers with in-built spacers to matrix pavers that contain an aggregate such as resin-bonded gravel (for advice and options see <a href=\"http://pavingexpert.com/\" title=\"\">pavingexpert.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/wps/portal/portalhome/unauthenticatedhome/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjtxBnJydDRwMLbzdLA09nSw_zsKBAIwN3U_1wkA6zeHMXS4gKd29TRwNPI0s3b2e_AGMDAwOIvAEO4Gig7-eRn5uqX5CdneboqKgIAGUwqho!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\" title=\"\">planningportal.gov.uk</a>). To avoid the car park look, designer Charlotte Rowe suggests breaking up surfaces such as resin-bonded gravel with lines of setts interplanted with low plants such as thyme. \"I use a pale shade, which gives a softer look, rather than the orangey shade you often see.\" Kent-based designer and lecturer Peter Bonney has used sleepers for the wheel tracks, with planted shingle, Derek Jarman-style, in between.</p> <p>Fronts throw up some particular challenges. Here are some tips:</p> <p><strong>Soil</strong> Often compacted, dry and dusty. Add plenty of organic matter before you start (50-litre bags of <a href=\"http://www.diy.com/nav/garden/garden-care-watering/growing/composts___fertilisers/-specificproducttype-fertilisers/Verve-Soil-Conditioner-50L-11907568\" title=\"\">B&amp;Q organic soil improver</a>, \u00a35.98; 900-litre load, from \u00a355, from <a href=\"http://www.compostdirect.com/\" title=\"\">compostdirect.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Shade</strong> If the front is shady, stick to plants that thrive in shade and offer an interesting mix of foliage shapes and shades, such as camellias, box, hart's tongue ferns, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/11268.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Brunnera</em> 'Jack Frost'</a>, epimediums and sarcococca (for more suggestions, see the <a href=\"http://rhs.org.uk\" title=\"\">RHS plant selector</a>), and don't bother with grass.</p> <p><strong>Clutter</strong> Screen the bins and bikes, either with off-the-peg willow or wooden screens or boxes, or slimline sheds (<a href=\"http://frontyardcompany.co.uk/\" title=\"\">frontyardcompany.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.totalgardens.co.uk/\" title=\"\">totalgardens.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://greenfingers.com/\" title=\"\">greenfingers.com</a>). Alternatively make your own wooden shelter and top it with a living roof (for living roof ideas see <a href=\"http://livingroofs.org/\" title=\"\">livingroofs.org</a>). Paint the wood a neutral colour or a shade that matches the front door.</p> <p><strong>No soil</strong> In tiny urban fronts that are concreted over, it's still possible to plant up the space by using pots. Use the biggest ones you can afford \u2013 the heavier they are, the more difficult they are to steal \u2013 which will provide better growing conditions and allow you to include one or two showy plants in your display. Plant some climbers too, including edibles such as beans and climbing nasturtiums. If you have room for window boxes, choose the largest ones you can fit.</p> <p><strong>Focal point</strong> In a small front garden, it's more peaceful to have one focal point, which could be water, a&#xa0;piece of furniture or simply a large, shapely terracotta pot (unplanted). Framing the front door with a&#xa0;pair of&#xa0;pots containing a clipped evergreen (such as bay, box or the underused honeysuckle <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/501.shtml\" title=\"\">Lonicera nitida</a>) sharpens up the entrance to the house. Feed in summer, and keep free of weeds.</p> <p><strong>Trees </strong>These<strong> </strong>will give scale, screening and a habitat for a variety of wildlife. In a small garden you may have room for only one. Choose&#xa0;a variety that will give interest during at least two seasons \u2013 crab apples and <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=116\" title=\"\"><em>Amelanchier lamarckii</em></a> both work well \u2013 and for fronts of every size check out a&#xa0;tree's eventual height and width before planting. Don't site trees where they might block light from ground-floor rooms.</p> <p><strong>All-year interest</strong> Include evergreens and clipped plants for structure through the winter months. Put in scented plants such as winter-flowering sarcococca and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/257.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Daphne odora</em></a> close to the path, which you will appreciate every time you pass.

  "<p>Malls often appear in fiction as the mise-en-scene for random violence, abducted children and zombie attacks. But in this collection of fiction, non-fiction, analysis, anecdote, reportage and collage, by forensically looking at the real world of malls, Ewan Morrison orchestrates a far more subtle and satisfying book, full of dashed hopes and moments of bravery, blighted lives and small triumphs.</p> <p>In the stories, Morrison's fascination with the distortions of love and the erotic under capitalism is matched by a resistance to making the characters mere exemplars of a sociological thesis. The strangely touching little back stories humanise the evocation of a place that is like everywhere else, and&#xa0;which insists the characters there are like everyone else. These range from the woman who knows from her call-centre job to which demographic category she belongs, to the weekend dad who isn't allowed to take his children to fast-food shops but somehow knows the entire menu, to the wife-to-be whose final fling is structured around brands and what they might mean, or fail to mean.</p> <p>A book so replete with the contemporary, where M&amp;S and Gap and Starbucks and Build-A-Bear are not just companies but exist as internal realities, runs the risk of seeming merely faddish. Morrison manages instead to evoke them as flawed archetypes, lost gods in a pantheon of deranged choice.</p> <p>The sections of reportage are, by comparison, less about pathos and more about the people behind the brands: car-park attendants, cleaners, security staff. If the consumers are bemused, the workers here are constantly surprised.</p> <p>The non-fiction is the most disturbing. The mall was initially conceived as a modern agora: in Richard Williams's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/art/9781134467426/the-anxious-city-british-urbanism-in-the-late-th-century\" title=\"\"><em>The Anxious City</em></a> there is a lovely image of Milton Keynes as it was intended to be, with an icon of Jimi Hendrix towering over the free-flowing new urbanites. To place that vision against, for example, online hints about how to&#xa0;create anarchy in the mall, reveals how complex responses to the mall actually are.</p> <p>This is also a quirkily nostalgic book, since the mall is dying. Online shoppers don't drift or derive or dwam around: they point and click. <em>Tales From The Mall</em> is an elegy as much as it is a philippic.</p> <p>Morrison is easily the most interesting Scottish writer of his generation. His book is global in purpose and local in detail; and when Scots is used, it is as part of a wider debate about how language infiltrates, subjugates and eludes. It is disappointing that the publishers \u2013 who promise an enhanced ebook soon \u2013 have been so lax and parsimonious in production: the cramped margins, headers, clipart cover and bizarrely large page numbers&#xa0;make this look less professional than it deserves.</p> <p>That said, the snippets of the enhanced version <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPwwyYr27JI\" title=\"\">on YouTube</a> show a great deal of promise. They are not illustrations that accompany the text, but aesthetic objects in their own right, often diverging from the printed \"source\". They are a kind of rebuke to the idea of recycling to maximise monetisation. The use, for example, of pictogram people conveys, in a way the text eschews, the levelling, depersonalising nature of the mall's endeavours; the music creates an eerie somnambulism far from the text's sometimes hectic registers.</p> <p>\u2022 Stuart Kelly's <em>The Book of Lost Books</em> is published by Polygon.</p>",
  "<p>We're all aware of the term \"busman's holiday\". But how many of us have actually been on one? (I discount those with the surname Bussman.) Well I can now say that I have. I'm a radio presenter, and recently went to stay at <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrustcottages.co.uk/cottage/wireless-cottage-011102/\" title=\"The Wireless Cottage, Cornwall\">Wireless Cottage</a> in Cornwall.</p> <p>The cottage is one of a pair of chalet-style buildings perched on the cliffs near Lizard Point in south-west Cornwall. One is a holiday cottage; the other was used for experiments by radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi early in the 20th century. The latter has now been restored and turned into a museum. Short of a week sleeping on Dave Lee Travis's couch, this could be the ultimate radio-geek getaway.</p> <p>Having negotiated a couple of days away from my family, I was looking forward to a quiet break alone in one of my favourite counties \u2026 until I checked the information from the National Trust, which portentously informed me: \"Access to the cottage is via an uneven track (about half a mile in length) and along a field.\"</p> <p>There was more: \"The foghorn, which is half a mile away, sounds every 30&#xa0;seconds day and night when there is reduced visibility.\" My panicked townie mind flickered with scenes from the films Misery, The Shining and Scott of the Antarctic. I packed my wireless internet dongle and prayed for adequate 3G coverage before loading the car with survival food, a wind-up radio and a shotgun. Yes I may be exaggerating a tad, but to fully enjoy this unique and magical residence, it was important to switch off totally from \"city\" mode.</p> <p>As I drove up the final dirt track to the turning for the cottage, all mobile phone signal disappeared. Oh the irony! Here of all places, I thought, where Marconi set us on the path towards global telecommunications, I am completely incommunicado!</p> <p>\"What if I have a seizure? What if I accidentally slash an artery while prising a pie from a dish? I'll die.\"</p> <p>Yet after the initial bodyshock of pure uninterrupted solitude, the sensation started to become pleasant, addictive even.</p> <p>When I said the cottage was \"on a cliff\", I meant literally. To the left is a path down to the original coastal radio station and the tiny but charming village of Lizard; to the right is a path down past the imposing and beautiful working lighthouse, which continues eventually to the national full stop that is Land's End. As far as the eye can see (as long as the foghorn isn't sounding) your senses are assailed by beautiful, dramatic seascapes.</p> <p>After a spume-flecked yomp around the coastline, returning to this cosy cottage is like returning to the womb. I was there in February yet the cottage was warm and inviting, with beautiful period furniture evoking those days a century or so ago when Marconi became the first person to bridge the Atlantic by wireless. (Many scientists believed the curvature of the earth would prevent wireless waves, travelling in straight lines, from spanning the Atlantic. Marconi set out to prove this was not the case, choosing this site and one in Massachusetts.)</p> <p>The cons today are very mod, with a nice little kitchen, TV and radio (thanks Guglielmo) to remind you that there is an outside world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-402070225\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/16/1345129390950/Marconi-Wireless-radio-001.jpg\" alt=\"Marconi Wireless radio\" width=\"460\" height=\"388\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Marconi wireless radio at the Marconi Centre in Cornwall. Photograph: E.O. Hopp /Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: E.O. Hopp /Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next door, the Marconi museum is an impressive outbuilding that punches way above its weight, representing a pivotal moment in history that heralded a new era of mass communication, instantly shrinking the world while broadening our view of it. The National Trust has preserved much of the equipment on which Marconi made test transatlantic transmissions, and there are many impressive photos of him and his men perching on cliff edges securing massive antennas with guy ropes in high winds. To think he went through all that just so I could mutter smut into the ear of Britain between The Smiths and Sam and Dave \u2026</p> <p>Thankfully the peninsula was fogless when I was there, so the deafening and relentless honk of the foghorn was absent (a relief seeing as I get enough of that at home courtesy of my youngest child). But no matter how tight you pull the curtains, the pulse of the nearby lighthouse is always visible. To add to the filmic atmosphere, you have the crash and swell of the waves beneath. This may make it sound like the least relaxing of destinations, but the sounds and rhythms become a hypnotic lullaby. Close your eyes and you could be an ancient mariner in his cabin \u2013 though without the seasickness, scurvy, rats, amputations and violent premature death.</p> <p>Such is the majesty of the immediate surroundings that it is quite tempting to remain cloistered in the craggy magnificence \u2013 but that would be a mistake. There is so much to see just a few minutes' drive away, like the caves of Kynance Cove, and the otherworldly seaside village of Cadgwith. To see woodsmoke spiralling from within the fishermen's cottages and higgledy-piggledy houses that crowd the coastline, yet not set eyes on another human, is like travelling back to an age before combustion engines, computing, deadlines, and Britain's Got Talent.</p> <p>Another few minutes up the A3083 and you're in Helston, one of Cornwall's oldest towns, bustling with sightseers, pasty emporiums and ancient drinking establishments, such as the gorgeous brew pub The Blue Anchor. Helston is home to no fewer than seven barber's shops, including the superbly named Keith Richards Gents Hairdressers. Though I am almost certain Keith would get a free short back and sides if he ever popped in, apparently they are still waiting. If it's a pasty, a pint or a preppy buzzcut you want, Helston is clearly the place for you.</p> <p>After 24 hours of oneness at the Wireless Cottages, Helston seemed like New York did to Bob Dylan when he first arrived from Minnesota \u2013 impossibly kinetic and crowded. I was relieved to return to my windswept temporary home on the edge of the kingdom, where I could watch for ships in distress and invading Celtic heathens. As it turned out, none arrived, so I watched the Brits on TV instead, and had a pasty.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Accommodation was provided by National Trust Holiday Cottages </em><a href=\"http://www.nationaltrustcottages.co.uk/cottage/wireless-cottage-011102/\" title=\"\"><em>(nationaltrustcottages.co.uk/cottage/wireless-cottage-011102</em></a><em>).

I'm all for the birds</a>, 13 August) sweepingly accuses the nation's 3 million anglers of having \"fat bums\" and wanting to eliminate all other wildlife in rivers. Angling is a pastime that is enjoyed by people of all shapes and sizes from age 3 to 103. It also generates \u00a33.5bn for the UK economy and is beneficial for health and wellbeing, including those recovering from breast cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>Anglers have probably done more than anyone to restore wildlife in rivers by investing in projects to restore damaged habitats, reporting pollution and contributing \u00a325m each year in rod licences to the Environment Agency. It's true the Angling Trust is campaigning to reduce the red tape in getting a licence to control cormorants, which are damaging fish stocks on many rivers, but we do not want to rid our waterways of these birds. We are also campaigning and taking civil legal action to improve flows, water quality and habitat for the benefit of all aquatic wildlife.

No velodrome, stadium or swimming pool needs building. Around two-thirds of the population are overweight and need more exercise. That's a lot of people to get out walking. And if more incentive is needed, the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow is just round the corner. <br><strong>Dave Morris</strong><br><em>Director, </em><a href=\"http://www.ramblers.org.uk/scotland\" title=\"\"><em>Ramblers Scotland</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympics Committee, invited young athletes to Rio in four years. Why not old athletes, too? Much of the \u00a32bn cost of our proposed social care cap could be avoided if older people treated serious physical exercise like food and drink ie a vital part of their daily routine. But the Olympics, the most influential global force for motivating sporting activity, gives no encouragement to older people to take part. There are no medals for veterans or super vets, in contrast to many sporting events in this country at least.</p> <p>There have been Youth Olympic Games since 2010, so why not games for the 60+, 70+ and 80+ age groups?

It would be just as easy to choose inspirational role models such as Vincent Kompany, Scott Parker and Shay Given. The Olympics capture our imagination once every four years. Only football can do so on a weekly basis and on a global scale. For sheer drama and emotion, Aguero's goal on the last day of the season stands comparison with any sporting occasion.

I remember Robbie Fowler doing exactly that at Highbury and have seen the same at other games, albeit not that often.

Yes, there are many instances of disgusting behaviour by footballers, but there are also many gold medallists who owe their success to drug taking and cheating.<br><strong>Simon Stone</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I can only agree with Geoffrey Wheatcroft. Many must view the return of the so-called beautiful game with dismay following the warmth and stimulus of the Olympics. Association football at the professional level barely qualifies as a sport; it is a poorly managed business that fleeces spectators and overpays players. Is it too much to hope that, having had the opportunity to cover so many sports at the highest level, the Guardian might in future devote less than the usual 50% of its sports coverage to football, and more to the so-called minor sports? How about a general limit of 25% of coverage to be given to football?</p> <p>I'm not optimistic, though.

  "<p>\"Nobody likes a poor girl,\" wrote Helen Gurley Brown in the 1962 classic Sex and the Single Girl. \"She is just a drag. It does take money to be successfully single \u2013 for clothes, an apartment, vacations, entertainment \u2026 to create an aura of seductive elegance about you, so no one will ever&#xa0;be able to feel sorry for you.\" The author, editor and original \"Cosmo girl\" died this week at the grand old age of 90, and perhaps I do her something of a disservice by cherry-picking this particular quote, but to me those words still&#xa0;embody the&#xa0;values of Cosmopolitan, the magazine she transformed into a global&#xa0;brand.</p> <p>Among the wealth of tributes to Gurley Brown, one commentator noted (drawing heavily on the inevitable Mad Men reference), that she wrote for the Joans of this world \u2013 the girls languishing in offices at the bottom of the career ladder \u2013 but she herself was very much a Peggy: a woman who had found a way out of poverty and made it to the top of her profession. She aimed to transform these Joans into Cosmo girls \u2013 the sexually liberated single \"girls\" (and they are always girls) who have been Cosmopolitan's bread and butter for the past 60 years. The legacy that Gurley Brown put into place \u2013 at a time where unmarried women, while not quite burned as witches, were viewed with heavy suspicion \u2013 cannot be denied. The Gloria Steinems and the Betty Friedans of the women's movement may have been dismissive of her agenda, but poor&#xa0;girls needed sexually liberating, too \u2013 this was feminism for secretaries. Feminism was a middle-class endeavour back then (arguably it still is), and Cosmo ensured that the average American woman could have a slice of the pie.</p> <p>Gurley Brown sold women an aspirational lifestyle, in which they could be economically independent while remaining fatally attractive. The hypothetical reader at the centre of the magazine's ethos, the Cosmo girl, is sexy, elegant, ambitious, and (perhaps most importantly) solvent. It is for that reason that I read Sex and the Single Girl entirely in Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly voice \u2013 the quintessential single girl who took $50 for the powder room and, like Gurley Brown, peppered her turns of phrase with snippets of French \u2013 \"Quel rat!\" In terms of heroines, I always preferred Sally Jay Gorce, the pink-haired protagonist from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/26/dud-avocado-elaine-dundy-rereading\" title=\"\">Elaine Dundy's 1958 novel The Dud Avocado</a>, who runs around Paris getting into scrapes, sleeping around and making a bit of an arse of herself. Sally Jay is most definitely not a Cosmo girl.</p> <p>The twin values that underpin this mythical creature \u2013 money and sexual prowess \u2013 are still touted by the magazine today, in that it remains very much about pleasing your man and buying lots of stuff. For those of us who thought that this cult of the single girl had come to a head with Sex &amp; the City's rampantly consumerist Carrie Bradshaw, reading the magazine can be a humbling experience. As a 25-year-old freelance journalist, I am in no position to be buying a \u00a3400 pair of shoes, let alone renting my own apartment, and I'm one of the lucky ones. Yet Cosmopolitan was once progressive, especially in the late 1970s. While it still focused on catching and keeping your man, the magazine advised readers to \"write a letter to the Times\" or \"become involved in local politics\" in order to impress him. Gurley Brown even advised women to carry around a copy of Das Kapital, albeit as a way of prompting conversation with \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 an eligible man. Can you imagine Cosmopolitan suggesting such a thing now?</p> <p>There wasn't a pair of crotchless panties in sight then. Saying that, flicking through an old issue, I was pretty alarmed to find an article by a male journalist under the heading, \"Why are women such sluts?\" On closer examination, it emerged that he was using the old meaning of the word (as in slattern) \u2013 something my mum, who once called me a slut for having a messy bedroom, would have understood.</p> <p>I digress. While Cosmo played a part in the women's movement, I tend to see its feminist period as a brief hiccup in what has otherwise been a longstanding agenda of sexual objectification (and try saying that on a first date). Gurley Brown once famously said: \"If you're not a sexual object, then you're in trouble.\" Nice. I, for one, would like to announce myself as permanently on the naughty step in that case. But it's less the \"tinsel feminism\" touted by Cosmo that bothers me (and I must confess that I stole the phrase from an acquaintance, who described it as \"the same old shit but sparklier\"), than the whole tedious, outdated notion of the Cosmo girl. Who is she? And why is it that she never gets her skirt tucked into her knickers? She's not on the dole, or living in the provinces. She may, like Gorce, have shocking pink hair, but only because Nicki Minaj did it first. This mythical woman, this \"fun, fearless female\" with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise\" title=\"\">Kegels</a> that can open a man's beer bottle while simultaneously bringing him to orgasm, all the while maintaining \"model girl skin\" and swinging an It bag from her delicate wrist \u2026 well, that woman is a stranger to me.</p> <p>Perhaps I move in the wrong social circles. The women of my acquaintance are anything but Cosmo girls. They're fun, obviously, otherwise they wouldn't be my friends, but they're anything but fearless. Many of them are very, very frightened. They're scared that, by graduating at the wrong time, they've missed out on the career that they wanted. They're worried that they will never be able to pay back their student loans or their overdrafts, or that they're ugly, or fat, or worthless. They're scared that their benefits will be taken away, or that they'll never move out of their parents' house. Some have struggled with eating disorders, depression or severe anxiety. Many have regular panic attacks. All worry about their appearance: that they're the wrong size, that their hair isn't long enough, their teeth aren't white enough, and their stomachs aren't flat enough. While many of them are secretaries, they feel anything but liberated.</p> <p>\"Nearly every glamorous, wealthy, successful career woman started out as some kind of schlepp,\" wrote Gurley Brown in Sex and the Single Girl. She also coined the phrase \"mouseburger\", meaning a drab, timid or unexceptional woman, and somewhat poignantly included her younger self in that definition. So here we are: the schlepps and the mouseburgers, yet there's scant room at the top, and, in the words of Golightly: suddenly we're afraid. We may not be as glamorous or as elegant as her, but we certainly have what she termed the \"<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20mean%20reds\" title=\"\">mean reds</a>\".</p> <p>The audience that Cosmo purports to have (and which, lest we forget, it sells to advertisers) is comprised of financially independent women in their 20s and 30s. Women with spending power, who are able to buy into the Cosmo girl myth, the legs and the lipstick. Assuming that one day, perhaps in our 30s, my friends and I achieve the giddy heights of career success, I know that not one of us will be reading Cosmo. The reason? We've already read it. The fact that the magazine is read by teenage girls is cheerfully ignored by publisher Hearst and its advertisers, but ask any 15-year-old where they get their sex advice, and I'd put money on them saying Cosmo. The Cosmo girl is me a decade ago, wondering where I should put my hands. Me, with my \u00a312-a-month pocket money and the freckly face of a woman-child, reading about 69ing on the school bus. (I'll allow the ambiguity in that phrase to stand \u2013 in terms of the school I was at, oral sex on the bus was not inconceivable.)</p> <p>While I am grateful to Helen Gurley Brown and Cosmopolitan for the sex education with which they provided me, I do worry about the messages today's teenage Cosmo girls are receiving. Being told that you're gorgeous as you are at the same time as being shown how to lose 10lb is confusing for anyone, let alone for a girl negotiating the traumas of puberty. Being sold the notion that feminism is tantamount to being able to&#xa0;give exceptional head is even more mind-boggling. In 1962, when the idea of&#xa0;the sexually and financially independent single girl was born, women were crying out for liberation, but now the model has become cloaked in consumerism, in mixed, contradictory messages. The single girl has been dressed in hold-ups and red polyester underwear. Cosmo has taken Gurley Brown's original archetype and run with it, despite the fact that it is now hopelessly outdated.</p> <p>Of the many tributes that have been paid to Gurley Brown and her legacy in the past week, the one that resonated most was made by the actor and writer Lena Dunham. \"RIP Helen Gurley Brown, you beautiful enigma,\" it read. \"Confused but wholehearted love from mouseburgers &amp; feminists everywhere.\" Confused is what we are. Because while we're told that we should be living this glamorous, single-girl lifestyle, at the same time, we know that \"nobody likes a poor girl\". After all, who does? Certainly not Cosmo and its advertisers.</p>",
  "<p>From one old-media institution challenged by the digital revolution to another. That would seem to be Arthur Sulzberger's primary purpose in hiring soon-to-be-ex-BBC director general Mark Thompson as his president and CEO.</p> <p>And on the face of it you can see why that looks sensible \u2013 inspired even. The BBC has transitioned extraordinarily well, so far, into the digital age. It has the most successful suite of digital channels covering news, children's programming, arts and culture and youth of any of its commercial broadcasting rivals. In terms of online content and online access to its traditional radio and TV programming \u2013 via the user-friendly BBC iPlayer catch-up service \u2013 the BBC is the UK market leader. What's more, the venerable institution's underlying values \u2013 fairness, quality, impartiality \u2013 have not just been maintained but enhanced in the process. Insofar as Thompson is the man who's done it \u2013 or at least played a pretty significant part in it \u2013 you can see why the venerable but struggling Gray Lady might want a slice of the Thompson action.</p> <p>So what's he like? Well I first bumped into him back in 1982 when I was a (very) humble researcher on a BBC evening news magazine show called Nationwide. Thompson was a BBC general trainee \u2013 one of a select sort of Brahmin class of usually Oxbridge graduates \u2013 who were tutored, mentored and, if it worked out, groomed for higher things.</p> <p>Even back in 1982 I can remember people identifying Thompson as a prospective director general. Since then he has worked all over the BBC as a producer and executive rising up the ranks virtually unobstructed. Unlike some others however (those of whom it might be said they had \"risen without trace\") Thompson tended to distinguish himself. In an organisation as committed to internal gossip as the BBC, it is perhaps surprising that the only story of him putting his foot in it, so to speak, that's ever really made headlines was the one where as new editor of the BBC's then-flagship Nine O'Clock News, he bit a junior producer's arm (apparently while reading his horoscope). All in jest it, was said. For what its worth, he's also a devout Roman Catholic, although he doesn't wear his faith on his sleeve. By reputation, he's also an outstanding cook.</p> <p>But back to the story. In short he's smart and sociable but an unapologetic intellectual and above all a big strategic thinker with a very sharp eye for both small and big \"P\" politics. He also has extraordinarily thick skin, in public at least. Running the BBC \u2013 which because it is publicly financed through a licence fee is subject to more or less continual political comment and scrutiny, and because it is the biggest player in UK broadcasting by some distance of continual interest to competitors \u2013 is one of the toughest and most demanding jobs in British public life. Thompson has handled it with confidence, conviction and, sometimes, ruthlessness.</p> <p>Of course there is a potential downside to having such a big brain: you can start believing you're always right. Some senior colleagues have found him hard to deal with. Not always a team player they say, prone to stubbornness on occasion and with a tendency sometimes to compromise and 'fix' things in the short term thus storing up long-term trouble for the future. Thompson fell out with the previous chairman of the BBC Trust (the corporation's governing body) partly because Thompson was convinced he knew better than his boss.</p> <p>Following the BBC's triumphant coverage of the London 2012 Olympics, Thompson leaves the BBC on a high note. He loves the United States \u2013 his wife is American and one of his children is already at college in the US with another due to follow shortly. So for him a big job at the NYT might look like a rather timely dream come true. But it wont be easy. For a start broadcasting \u2013 and not just the BBC \u2013 has weathered the digital storm much better than the press. The problems faced by papers appear far more intractable than anything Thompson had to deal with at the BBC. And being digitally innovative might be thought of a quite a bit easier when you have \u00a33.6bn of guaranteed income and no requirement to make any form of commercial return.</p> <p>There is the rub. He has the intellect, the personality and a digital track record to die for, but newspapers are not TV and, critically, Thompson has never had to work in a stressed commercial environment. So best wish him luck \u2013 he might well need it.</p>",
  "<p>You are the president of a large country with a growing economy, intent on keeping your name up there in the lights. You pride yourself on your popularity, your sense of history, and the fact that you personify the destiny of your country (or so you keep telling yourself). A&#xa0;criminal court sentences three young women, two of them mothers, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-two-years\" title=\"\">two years in prison</a> for staging a 40-second punk feminist stunt inside your country's official church and the world's social network sites go mad. Two years of gulag for Vladimir Putin's enemies, they scream. Demonstrations erupt on the streets outside your embassies. Ageing celebs queue patiently to condemn you. There is even someone offering knitting patterns for Pussy Riot's balaclavas. The punk feminist band becomes a global brand before it even releases its first album and you a pariah so sullen that not even botox conceals your scowls. Mr Putin did not so much shoot himself in the foot on Friday, as fire a Kalashnikov into his size 8s.</p> <p>Pussy Riot must have offended many Russian Orthodox believers by screaming lyrics such as \"Shit, shit, the Lord's shit\" behind the iconotasis of the Church of Christ the Saviour. An opinion poll released by the independent Levada research group found that only 6% of Russians polled sympathised with the women and 51% felt either indifference, irritation or hostility. Similar umbrage would have been taken inside St Paul's or the Vatican. And those who doubt that may well wonder what tension would have been caused by a flash-mob invading a mosque at Friday prayers.</p> <p>How many museums around the world would have looked the other way as a number of couples \u2013 including a heavily pregnant Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, one of the three convicted on Friday \u2013 were filmed having sex to illustrate how Muscovites were being screwed by their government? The British Museum? The&#xa0;Louvre? The Metropolitan? The wish to punish anarchists is not Russian alone.</p> <p>But the wish to crush political dissent, in this way and at this time, is Mr Putin's alone. Pussy Riot had two points to make, both of them valid: that the Orthodox Church provides intellectual and religious cover for Mr Putin's increasingly messianic political brand; and that this man is driving Russia straight up a cul de sac. The&#xa0;agent of stability is becoming the obstacle to change. The omens are not good. Mr Putin has no policies to offer a generation that has been politically awakened. He is not ready for dialogue with any part of country, and he is all about reinforcing central control. He has lost his grip on his popular image so he is forced back on an essentially conservative base. The&#xa0;result is that in his third term as president, Mr Putin has a real problem re-establishing himself as a leader for Russia as a whole.</p> <p>The Pussy Riot trial will not be the last. Criminal prosecutions will become the weapon of choice against political activists like the anti-corruption blogger Aleksei Navalny, journalists who face stiffer penalties for libel, websites, or foreign-funded NGOs. Of course the world reaction is selective and partial. Would that Sergei Magnitsky, the lawyer whose corruption investigation led to his death in prison, have produced the same reaction as the Pussy Riot verdict. That does not change the verdict that all Mr Putin has to offer the next demonstration, called for September, is a bigger stick.</p> <p>It need not be this way. Mr Putin still has time to climb out of the hole he has dug himself into. He could call early parliamentary elections, because it was the rigged Duma elections last year that triggered the current crisis. He could let a popularly elected prime minister run the country. He could retreat from the political frontline, and still fashion a role for himself as father of the nation. To continue as he is doing, as the only and increasingly unsteady hand on Russia's tiller, spells disaster.</p>",
  "<p>Answering journalists in London, Vladimir Putin promised the members of Pussy Riot soft punishment and formally he wasn't lying: the prosecution asked for three years in prison and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-two-years\" title=\"\">court gave them just two</a>. But such a \"soft\" sentence seems like an even more cynical mockery. Judge Marina Syrova read the text of her decision for nearly three hours, and from the look on her face it was obvious that she would give anything if no one could see her at that moment.</p> <p>The Russian justice system has a rather rich tradition of issuing knowingly unjust verdicts (it's worth remembering not just oligarch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/mikhail-khodorkovsky-jail-term\" title=\"\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> but also, for example, activists from the National Bolshevik opposition party, who have got three to five years' jail for nonviolent protests), but this sentence stands out even so. Never before has a Russian court handed down its decision based on medieval church councils, the internal order of the church and medical diagnoses worthy of becoming aphorisms. This is not a joke: in the verdict it is said that the defendants \"suffered from mixed personality disorder displayed by their active position in life\".</p> <p>On first glance it might seem that this story has become a catastrophe for Putin's image. Rallies in support of Pussy Riot took place in many countries around the world and, in listing the main stars of global show business, from Madonna and Stephen Fry to Paul McCartney and Bj\u00f6rk, it's almost easier to name those who haven't come out in support of the Russian punk group. But Putin's life doesn't depend on Madonna's statements, and the image of Russia as a European Iran, where courts make theological decisions, is even useful for Putin, who can now say to the west: look, this is a wild, religious country that can only be ruled by authoritarian methods.</p> <p>The reconstruction of the political space in Russia began almost right after the mass protests in December of last year demanding honest elections. Putin didn't start flirting with the \"creative class\", where most of the protesters came from, but instead devoted his whole pre-electoral campaign on creating the maximum amount of mutual hatred between the \"creative class\" and the \"simple people\", who, if you believe the propaganda, support Putin. The Pussy Riot case takes this hatred to a new level, adding to it a religious component. If you're against Putin that means you're against the Orthodox church. You can sneer at this formulation all you want, but it makes Putin's power more stable. The hatred being cultivated in Russian society will become a source of legitimacy for Putin.</p> <p>Thanks to the trial against Pussy Riot, the main theme of discussion in Russian society became the role of the Orthodox church in the life of the country, and there are much fewer opponents of Orthodoxy among Russians than opponents of Putin. Showing an unjust, inquisitorial trial, which, with a sinking heart, the whole world is watching, stole the attention of Russian society from the violence against the opposition. We are expecting the arrest of the popular opposition activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jan/15/alexei-navalny-profile-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">Alexei Navalny</a>, against whom a criminal case has been opened. It's also possible that one of the few opposition deputies in the Russian parliament, Gennady Gudkov, might be arrested.</p> <p>There are currently 12 rank and file members of the last big anti-Putin protest threatened with jail sentences for clashes with police. Seen against the trial against Pussy Riot, these repressions will look quite natural. In this sense, the political significance of the trial against the punk musicians is a lot more serious than the story of performing the anti-Putin song in Moscow's main church itself.</p> <p>And judge Marina Syrova, tired from a difficult trial, will probably go on holiday and, as Russian officials do, will go relax somewhere in Europe. Maybe in Italy, maybe in Spain. In this sense, Russia, if you can consider it an Orthodox Iran, is very strange: Putinist officials can't imagine their lives without the west. Their kids, money, property, holidays and shopping are there. And as long as the possibility to leave Russia exists, no Madonna will scare them.</p>",
  "<p>It was called Treasure Island in honour of Robert Louis Stevenson's pirate classic, but the artificial island off San Francisco bay has nothing but trouble buried in its soil: radioactive contamination left by the US navy.</p> <p>Internal documents and emails from the navy and public health officials reveal that the contamination, a legacy of ships exposed to atomic blasts and radiation training during the cold war, is more widespread than previously thought.</p> <p>The navy reportedly bungled a clean-up, leaving topsoil with 400 times the Environmental Protection Agency's human exposure limits.</p> <p>The revelations have alarmed some of the island's 2,800 residents and cast a shadow over plans to start building high-rise apartments for 20,000 more people next year.</p> <p>The documents were <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/environment/story/radiation-history-treasure-island-more/\">disclosed by the Bay Citizen</a>, a nonprofit news organisation covering the bay area. \"The large volume of radiological contaminated material, high number of radioactive commodities [individual items or sources], and high levels of radioactive contamination \u2026 have raised concerns ... regarding the nature and extent of the radiological contamination present at Treasure Island,\" Stephen Woods, an environmental clean-up manager for the public health department, wrote in a 2011 email.</p> <p>A burgeoning file of radiation discoveries, Woods said, undermined the navy's continued use of a 2006 report as a basis for claims that some parcels were clear of radiation and ready for housing development.</p> <p>The navy and a separate state regulatory agency, the Department of Toxic Substances Control, said California's public health officials were wrong and that there was no health risk.</p> <p>Treasure Island, spanning 535 acres, was created by the federal government from landfill in 1937. It was named in honour of Louis Stevenson's book because he lived in San Francisco from 1879 to 1880. It hosted the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition before being handed to the navy.</p> <p>The island used the base to repair and salvage vessels exposed to atomic blasts during the 1940s and 1950s. Cannon sights contained radioactive glow-in-the-dark material. A training ship, the USS Pandemonium, was intentionally doused in radiation so sailors could practise scrubbing it. The navy had a radiological \"counting room\" to test personnel and equipment for contamination.</p> <p>In 1993 the navy agreed to hand the island back to the city for $105m, a deal which required inspection and approval from state health officials.</p> <p>Naval operations ended there in 1997 and in a 2006 report the navy gave a clean bill of health to affected sites, saying 170 acres were suitable to transfer to San Francisco, paving the way for ambitious plans to create a new neighbourhood.</p> <p>The island found a new lease of life as a set for films including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Flubber, Patch Adams, Bicentennial Man and The Caine Mutiny. Some visual effects from The Matrix were also filmed there.</p> <p>However in recent reports and emails state health officials faulted the navy's 2006 report. They noted that contractors removed 16,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil, some with radiation levels 400 times the EPA's human exposure limits. Residents on the island are required to grow plants in above-ground pots to avoid soil-borne chemicals.</p> <p>Emily Rapaport, president of Good Neighbors of Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island, who has lived on the island for a decade, said residents were not fully informed about contamination. \"They should have been more open and upfront, because there would have been people who would have chosen not to live here,\" she told the Bay Citizen.</p> <p>In a May memo to the Department of Toxic Substances Control Woods, the state environmental cleanup manager, accused the navy of rushing its evaluation of Treasure Island's radioactive legacy.</p> <p>It had delayed releasing sample data to state health inspectors and failed to test for radioactive soil at sites where it had found toxic chemical waste, he wrote. As of May, he noted, contractors had transported 1,000 truckloads of radioactive waste off the island with more still in the ground.</p> <p>The Department of Toxic Substances Control, however, said there was no risk to health, a version echoed by the navy's environmental cleanup co-ordinator, James Sullivan, who said concerns were exaggerated and inconsistent with the navy's commitment to safety.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2012.

  "<p>\"Who will buy this wonderful morning? Such a sky you never did see! Who will tie it up with a ribbon and put it in a box for me?\" The answer, <a href=\"http://artists.letssingit.com/oliver-lyrics-who-will-buy-rxlxq6l\" title=\"\">dear Oliver</a>, is no one. At least, I hope not. Wonderful mornings are not to be possessed. They&#xa0;are not to be had. To own a wonderful morning would be to destroy it. That is part of the quality that makes them wonderful.</p> <p>Recently <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/r4sf\" title=\"\">on BBC Radio 4's Stephanomics programme</a>, the economist Patrick Minford, argued we ought to extend markets to cover air. Shocking, I know. Take a deep breath. It's still free. But given the omnivorous desire of some economists to subsume absolutely everything within their purview, maybe we can't take that for granted. If&#xa0;people can sell you expensive bottled water that dropped freely from the sky, one day they'll be flogging you air like in Sesame Street: \"I got something you need and I can sell it to you real cheap, it's real important,\" says Bert to Ernie. He goes on to sell him a whole bottle of air for a nickel. And Ernie thinks he has a bargain.</p> <p>The argument for this madness is as follows: the trouble with markets as currently conceived is that they don't show up the full costs of industry upon the environment. So what is needed is to extend markets to cover the commons: trees, rivers, air, and so on. Anything scarce needs to be subject to a price mechanism so that limited resources can be managed by preference and choice. In other words, the trouble with capitalism is that we don't have enough of it. Sure, if big companies are using the environment as a free dustbin they ought to pay for it.</p> <p>The question is how. The right way is through taxation. But for others, following the Nobel prize-winning economist Ronald Coase, it is by privatising the commons, thus creating a market in so-called externalities.</p> <p>Fortunately, this argument isn't going anywhere politically. Most of us instinctively get that the commons cannot be owned by any one person or corporation. That why we call them commons. \"Property is theft,\" said Proudhon. Some things are simply and rightly unownable. But I want to extend this: property is also death. For some things are killed by ownership. Consider how love can too easily include an element of the desire to possess. Yet to posses another is to destroy their otherness, which in turn destroys the very thing being loved. You can't tie others up with a ribbon and put them in a box.</p> <p>And here I quickly come over all religious. The point is that God can never be collapsed into human desire or quantification \u2013 thus never bought, sold or intellectually had. Being a believer is not to be in possession of one big theory of everything but rather to accept an existential version of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem \u2013 that not everything can be gobbled up in one sort of explanation \u2013 scientific, economic or indeed religious. There is always a remainder. God is beyond commodification. Most important things are: the people we love, the beautiful morning.</p> <p>Which is why the Hebrew scriptures are constantly worried by idolatry and the Marxists by reification. Both are dangerous processes through which we turn the things we love into objects of ownership and control. Thus we kill&#xa0;them.</p> <p>All this is really a circuitous reflection on what is a stonkingly beautiful day. Some things are just there and are wonderful. Oliver is right to want to sing about them. But they cannot be owned. The market is big enough already.</p>",
  "<p>Judge Marina Syrova's tone remained soft and monotonous throughout the three hours it took her to read the state's case against the three Pussy Riot members. But her message was steely and unyielding. \"What they did was offensive to believers,\" Syrova said. \"It was a crude violation of&#xa0;the social order.\"</p> <p>From time to time, Syrova's words were punctuated by tinny clinks from the women's handcuffs as they crossed and uncrossed their arms. Sitting inside the glass cage they had occupied for nearly two weeks, they met the verdict \u2013 guilty \u2013 and the sentence \u2013 two years \u2013 with defiance.</p> <p>The verdict against Maria Alyokhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova has been seen as much more than a ruling on three women who stood up to Vladimir Putin. It is also seen as an indication of the direction Putin's government will take, a sign of the fate in store for Russia.</p> <p>\"What Putin wants, Putin gets,\" said an angry Pyotr Verzilov, Tolokonnikova's husband, outside the court. \"That is the only thing to say.\"</p> <p>The three women are the most high-profile figures to face the wrath of a man who returned to the Kremlin this year amid a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/12/russia-protests-against-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">wave of protests</a>.</p> <p>In the front row of the public gallery was Alexey Navalny, the opposition movement's de facto leader. He has also been charged and faces 10 years in prison. What he saw on Friday could be a warning of what is to come.</p> <p>Around 40 people crammed into the shabby courtroom, as dozens of journalists were left stranded outside, blocked from entering by burly police. More police and special forces troops were in the courtroom. Two of the latter, in full gear and black berets, stood in front of the judge, who had requested state protection after reporting threats against her. A rottweiler lay on the floor of the courtroom. A German shepherd stood guard outside.</p> <p>Syrova repeated witness testimonies that the three women had offended Orthodox believers by wearing bright clothes inside a church, by \"making sharp aggressive movements\", and by wearing their trademark balaclavas. She also read the words to the anti-Putin punk prayer they performed in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Inside their cage, the women laughed as she quoted the lyrics: \"Shit, shit, holy shit!\"</p> <p>As Syrova argued against their feminism, saying that the Russian constitution \"protected the rights of men and women equally\", they laughed again.</p> <p>When protesters gathered outside the courthouse performed the band's new single, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-release-new-single-video?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Putin Lights Up the Fires</a>, and the music faintly entered the courtroom, Tolokonnikova smiled widely, raising her clasped hands in victory.</p> <p>Outside, hundreds of Muscovites, many wearing Pussy Riot T-shirts, some in balaclavas, had gathered near the court. Supporters of the government and church were fewer; many took to social networks instead. Eduard Bagirov, a prominent writer who campaigned for Putin earlier this year, wrote on Twitter: \"Not one normal Russian person would ever support the 'acts' of these cunts. Note that only emigrants, fags and kikes&#xa0;support them.\"</p> <p>The case against Pussy Riot has ruptured any pretence of decorum in the growing split between those who align themselves with Putin's government and those who oppose it.</p> <p>\"Pussy Riot's act inside the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour is not the stupidity of young girls, but part of the global conspiracy against Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church,\" Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected analyst, wrote in a widely circulated editorial on Friday. \"According to this version [of events], Putin isn't obliged to just punish three idiots in a fatherly way, but also protect Russia from this conspiracy with all possible severity.\"</p> <p>The band was formed in response to Putin's decision to come back to the presidency. What began as a radical fringe movement has brought tens of thousands of people on to the streets to protest against what they saw as the death knell of Russia's brief experiment with democracy. The government's response to them has pushed them into the mainstream. Maya Trapeznikova, a 25-year-old protester outside the court, said: \"I came here because they are going to jail for doing what we have all wanted to do in the depths of our souls.\" Of the protest movement, she said: \"We're trying to remain peaceful. But many are reaching their limits and waiting for the order to go to battle.\"</p> <p>On Friday morning, balaclavas had appeared on some of Moscow's most prominent monuments \u2013 on the writer and national hero Alexander Pushkin, and on a sculpture of scientist Mikhail Lomonosov in front of the university, as well as a statue of a Kazakh poet that became the centre of a brief anti-Putin occupy movement in the spring.</p> <p>A day before the verdict, Tolokonnikova wrote in a letter from the detention centre where they have been held since their arrest in March: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/16/pussy-riot-putin-russia-court-verdict\" title=\"\">Whatever the verdict for Pussy Riot, we and you have already won</a>. Because we have learned to be angry and speak politically.\"</p> <p>Navalny led the courtroom in shouts of \"Shame!\" after the sentence was read. Speeding down the stairs to greet the scrum of journalists outside, he said that Putin had personally ordered the sentence. \"This shows that he's scared of them,\" he said. \"And it shows what our justice system is.\"</p> <p>Hundreds of protesters remained as the women were driven away to begin their sentence. Dozens were arrested. Fresh protests are planned for Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>Britons are among \"the worst idlers\" in the world preferring a \"lie-in to hard work\", according to group of rising stars of the Tory party, who have advocated a tough set of work reforms in a new book.</p> <p>According to leaked extracts from the book, Britannia Unchained \u2013 Global Growth and Prosperity, five Tory MPs from the \"class of 2010\" call for a culture of \"graft, risk and effort\" to propel Britain into the \"superleague\" of nations.</p> <p>The book contains a blueprint of radical reforms. The MPs \u2013 Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss \u2013 say: \"Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor.\"</p> <p>The MPs claim the UK workforce should model itself on the workers of South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, rather those in European nations \u2013 or watch living standards fall away.</p> <p>The Evening Standard reports the authors as saying: \"Britain will never be as big as China or Brazil, but we can look forward to a new generation, ready to get to work. If we are to take advantage of these opportunities, we must get on the side of the responsible, the hard working and the brave. We must stop bailing out the reckless, avoiding all risk, and rewarding laziness.\"</p> <p>The 184-page book will be published shortly before the Conservatives' autumn conference. In it, the five rehearse well-worn Tory themes about how the welfare state has sapped the strength and vigour of the British economy. \"We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor,\" they say in the book.</p> <p>Kwarteng told the Standard: \"We need to look beyond Europe for economic success. We should be starting now. There is no reason why we can't be pushing ahead with a lot of this. [London mayor] Boris [Johnson] when he talks about big infrastructure projects, deregulation and cutting taxes, is absolutely on the money.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There is definitely a new right, which is much more international in its focus. The old Tory right are a busted flush.\"</p> <p>The Guardian contacted all five MPs on Friday. Only Raab responded but declined to comment, saying the Standard had \"broken the book's embargo\".</p> <p>Labour attacked the claims by the Tory backbenchers \u2013 and called on David Cameron to distance himself from their views. Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said: \"First they blame British businesses for their economic failures and now they blame the people who work within them, showing how out of touch the Tory party has become.</p> <p>\"Arguing that working Britons are 'the worst idlers in the world' is deeply insulting. People who work hard, play by the rules and pay their taxes shouldn't have to put up with Tory MPs calling them lazy \u2013 especially when prices are rising faster than their wages, their tax credits are being cut and Britain is in a double-dip recession made in Downing Street.\"</p> <p>The controversial comments come days after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/15/boris-johnson-pm-pussyfooting-london-airport?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Johnson urged the prime minister to stop \"pussyfooting around\"</a> over plans to build another London airport and reduce the strain on Heathrow.</p>",
  "<p>Senior Whitehall officials from 10 government departments and agencies attended exclusive \"training courses\" laid on by Shell over two days at its London headquarters, according to documents released by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) following a freedom of information request.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc-foi/decc-corporate-information/221-121133-training-courses-provided-by-energy-compan.zip\" title=\"\">The documents</a> show that in June this year and last, \"30-40 mid- to senior-level civil servants\" attended the two-day \"Shell energy course for Whitehall\", laid on at the energy giant's expense at its UK head office on London's South Bank.</p> <p>In responding to the FOI request, Decc said the course was designed to give civil servants an \"understanding of the energy industry in the UK and internationally\". It added: \"The production of and markets for energy in a carbon constrained world were the main themes [of the course]. The programme is an opportunity for Decc staff to hear the views of Shell on the oil and gas industry, meet colleagues and counterparts from other government departments and exchange views on the industry and Shell's activities.\"</p> <p>Decc confirmed that 12 of its civil servants attended this year's event and that Shell is the only company or organisation providing such \"training\" to its officials.</p> <p>The event on 19 and 20 June included presentations such as \"Government and Industry: Working Together\" by Shell's head of UK government relations, and \"Transparency, Human Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility\" by the company's NGO and stakeholder relations manager.</p> <p>The revelation has angered environmental campaigners who say it exposes the extent of privileged access afforded to Shell across Whitehall, as well as raising questions about the degree of lobbying exercised by the energy industry.</p> <p>Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/green-companies-treasury-meetings-energy\" title=\"\">Guardian reported</a> that ministers at the Treasury have held meetings with representatives from energy-intensive sectors seven times more often than with green sector representatives since the coalition government was formed. Over the same period, Treasury ministers met Shell on 12 occasions, including at least three one-on-one lunches and dinners. George Osborne, the chancellor, has not met a single green sector representative.</p> <p>Jim Footner, head of Greenpeace's climate and energy campaign, said: \"These documents show that one of the world's most environmentally damaging companies has shocking levels of access to some of the government's top mandarins.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Morning everyone. Yesterday, Geoffrey Boycott said on Test Match Special, was a lovely day's Test cricket, not a great one but a nice one. Nice one. It certainly ebbed and flowed, rumbled along for spells before sparking and England had their share of good fortune with the dismissals of Petersen and Kallis, and their share of Jimmy Anderson bowling jaffas which marginally beat the bat. That fiftysomething partnership between Philander and Duminy put South Africa almost equal in the spoils I would say and there have been a <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=fow_score;partnership_wicketmin1=5;partnership_wicketval1=partnership_wicket;qualmax1=400;qualmin1=50;qualval1=fow_score;spanmin1=15+Mar+2000;spanval1=span;team=3;template=results;type=fow;view=innings\">fair few 50+ ones from the Saffers' lower order</a> over the past 12 years. There has been quite a lot of analysis devoted to Stuart Broad's lack of ratpower throughout this series, though there were signs at Headingley that he was getting back towards one of his hot streaks, signs that were absent yesterday as he focused on swing. He did get some but it tended to come floaty and early, from the hand, rather than the late stuff that Anderson effects. Finn's ball to bag Amla was a peach and, though he has that wicket-taking knack, needs more vim in this session. <br><strong><br>A special guest will ring the bell for the start of play at Lord's today</strong>. It's still not Piers Morgan. It's not Russell Brand on top of a No13 bus \"singing\" Hey Bulldog. It's Olympic gold medallist shooter Peter Wilson, who took to the gun when his schoolboy cricket career was ended by injury.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Lord's jinx:</strong> Cricinfo's S Rajesh has been <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/577703.html\">looking at the failure of certain batsmen at Lord's</a>, inspired by Jacques Kallis's dismissal. It's an interesting list (third table on the page) \u2013 Javed Miandad averaged 12.50, Ricky Ponting 18.16, Brian Lara 21.00 and Sachin Tendulkar 21.67. They can't have been overawed so what is it, (odd umpiring decisions apart). The slope?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>88th over: South Africa 262-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 21)</strong> Two balls left in Steve Finn's over. England have their huddle. There was a lot of conspicuous low-fiving and buttock-tapping among them yesterday, the body language analysts in their medicine show style with the obvious judgment that they are trying to emphasise how united they are as a team. Message to KP!. Finn's last two balls are short of a length and seen out by Steyn.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>89th over: South Africa 263-7 (Philander 47, Steyn 21)</strong> Duncan Bonnett asks for a weather report. Overcast and humid now, Duncan, spirit of 76 cloudless sky and sunshine this afternoon. Anderson takes this end, Philander deflecting it off his pads for a single. Jimmy greets his great mate Steyn with a bouncer, that flies over the top of his helmet badge then has him fending the next one off his shoulder that cracks into his left glove, trapping it on the handle. He shakes it and tells the physio who had already uncapped his spray to do one and stay off the field. Anderson calls up a short leg and slides two across, a la Finn, for the keeper's leg-side catch but Steyn misses them both.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>90th over: South Africa 268-7 (Philander 48, Steyn 25)</strong> \"Morning Bagchi, morning everybody,\" writes Josh Robinson in traditional style. \"I didn't see a great deal of yesterday's play, concentrating as I was on <strike> emailing Smy </strike> the demands of my job, but is it possible that the England players' conduct was not so much trying to emphasise how united they are as a team as reflecting a greater sense of unity? Or did they look as if they were trying too hard to make a point?\" It did look calculated to me, and Shaun Pollock was giggling away on TMS with his scenario of how they would have reacted had KP made the sort of stops that elicited ar$e taps for Jonny Bairstow. Broad takes over from Finn, Philander takes one after a short delay while Steyn had his ring finger sprayed. Big swing from Broad, hooping away to second slip. Steyn watches one go by then has a big drive at the next that flies between third slip and gully for four.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>91st over: South Africa 270-7 (Philander 49, Steyn 26)</strong> Anderson is trying to tempt Big Vern into an expansive drive to get to 50 with his first two balls then a shorter one, arrowing into him, which he knocks down to midwicket for a single. Steyn then tips and runs into the covers. \"You continue to mention Piers Morgan in your preamble. Can I remind you of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue's redefinition of common words in The Uxbridge English Dictionary: Countryside (n) : Killing Piers Morgan.\" Stephen Fry, I believe. I also liked Jihad - the cry of a fundamentalist cowboy.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Steyn c Swann b Broad 26</strong> Broad pitches up outside off stump, a hint of away swing and Steyn can't resist a drive, nicking off to second slip where Swann pouches it thigh high.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>92nd over: South Africa 271-8 (Philander 49, Morkel 1)</strong> Broad's pace is between 78 and 82 mph, throttling back and laying the trap for the tailenders on the drive. It worked well for Steyn, who tried to be a good citizen then couldn't help himself. Morkel's single off the last ball puts him on strike for Anderson.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>93rd over: South Africa 275-8 (Philander 49, Morkel 5)</strong> Morkel cuts a ball angled across him and plays it like a bona fide batsman, smearing it into the ground and through third man for four. The sado-masochism of Duncan Haskell might be the other way round judging by his dispatch from the tub: \"It feels like this series has readdressed the pleasure/ pain balance that so many of us associate with English cricket. With four days still to play out it's impossible to know what feeling we'll be left with and that's what makes it so exciting. I'm glad it's like this, I first need to suffer to be able to enjoy the thrill - like when I have a bath and leave the hot tap dripping molten tears on to my big toe, that searing pain makes the comfort the rest of my body is experiencing all the more gratifying. Have I shared too much?\" Frankly, yes. Anderson bangs it into Morkel, getting him up on his toes but he rides the bounce and plays it competently down to drop in front of gully.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>94th over: South Africa 276-8 (Philander 50, Morkel 5)</strong> Philander brings up his 50 by hooking to long leg for a single. Broad now has Morkel to have a dart at for four balls, and with the batsman's lack of footwork aims to pin him lbw with inswingers. He clips the pads twice but both are headed down the leg side.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>95th over: South Africa 281-8 (Philander 55, Morkel 5)</strong> Philander, by contrast with Morkel, is positively Gene Kelly, stepping across and forward to a half volley and spanking Anderson through mid-off for four. Anderson nips the next one into him but he blocks it with bat and pad then has a blacksmith's heave, missing the overpitched delivery outside off, and almost hits himself on the top of his helmet with his bat. A real \"wahay\" shot, provoking laughter from Mike Atherton and some of the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>96th over: South Africa 281-8 (Philander 57, Morkel 9)</strong> More short stuff from Broad smacks into Morkel's glove in front of his chin. \"As we prepare for my son Noah's first days at our local primary,\" asks my friend Peter Lovell. \"I was wondering whether your readers have an opinion on how many state school England batsmen there might be between now and his own England debut in 2030?\" Let's get burrowing and extrapolating.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>97th over: South Africa 292-8 (Philander 58, Morkel 13)</strong> Morkel heaves, connects and takes four off Anderson through the gap between gully and third slip that leaves Jimmy gurning . It's obviously a deliberate strategy to target Morkel and Steyn with some sternum rattlers to then set them up for the edge when they pitch up. The last ball of the Anderson's over was a case in point, bowled from round the wicket and swinging in but Morkel stops his drive mid swing and digs it out.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>98th over: South Africa 295-8 (Philander 59, Morkel 15)</strong> Swann with his George Orwell haircut comes on and bowls a pair of beauties to Morkel, drifting in and spinning away that the left-hander tries to play on the back foot and almost becomes unstuck. \"As Claire Rayner no longer answers questions (Ouija enthusiasts excepted),\" writes Phil Withall. \"I was wondering if you could help. My natural default setting is to \"pray for rain\" obviously this is not going to maintain the number 1 spot for England. Should I now start praying for Fifa to take over cricket's ranking system thus elevating the England side back to the top?\" Lies, damn lies and Fifa's rankings. I once spent a day working out how it worked (for a piece), tried to apply the figures and came up with a different permutation entirely. Common sense was the least consideration.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>99th over: South Africa 298-8 (Philander 59, Morkel 18)</strong> Anderson has to be due some luck. He has bowled at least five unplayables this morning, all \"wasted on thee\", and has taken to sarcastically clapping when the batsman connects with the next. \"Has your bat got a hole in it grandad?\" Angus Fraser once asked Geoff Boycott during one such similar spell. \"If you're so good, bowl at stoomps\" was Geoff's cleaned up response.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>100th over: South Africa 301-8 (Philander 59, Morkel 21)</strong> Morkel brings up the 300 off Swann with a shovel drive. \"I hate it when England do this,\" writes Steven Pye. \"They draw us in by taking early wickets, and then comes the inevitable lower order resistance. You'd think I would be used to it by now. This match is already reminding me of yet another <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64041.html\">South Africa recovery at Headingley in 2003</a>.\" Zondeki and Kirsten. Aagh. Thanks for reminding me. That's when I went grey.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Morkel c Prior b Finn 25</strong> Excellent catch by Prior, his fifth of the innings, as the ball flew off the bottom of Morkel's bat when he was trying to boom a cut shot over the top of slips.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>101st over: South Africa 309-9 (Philander 61, Tahir 2)</strong> Morkel took four with a tickle down the legside when Finn came back into the attack but succumbed to a buffet long hop. He's got the knack. \"I have never got this use of 'oo' as a 'Northern Vernacular',\" writes Phil Tyrer. \"To me, if you write 'stoomps' as per the Boycott quote, that sounds wrong, like hoop or loom \u2026 Surely 'stumps' is correct, unless you're trying not to be a Landahner, and saying 'stamps'.\" I was copying Simon Hughes's transcription from A Lot of Hard Yakka. He's from Ealing, Geoffrey's from Fitzwilliam.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Philander st Prior b Swann 61</strong> Glorious flight from Swann, lured Philander down the track. He went down on one knee to drive but the ball dipped perfectly, beat the bat and Prior whipped off the stumps with Philander three feet short. <strong>South Africa all out for 309</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Some inter-innings emails:</strong> \"All hands?\" writes Tony George. \"Glad you mentioned Zondeki. Always makes me smile as it can't be only me that think he had possibly the greatest nickname ever?\" Josh \"I hate you Henry Higgins\" Robinson points out: \"Phil Tyrer needs to realise that it's not stoomps as in hoop or loom, but stoomps as in look, as opposed to Luke, unless you're from Merseyside.\" Anyway. Here come Strauss and Cook.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 1-0 (Strauss 1, Cook 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Morkel takes the new ball from the Nursery End and Strauss tickles him round the corner to get off the mark first ball. Morkel follows up with beautiful ball jagging away from Cook. He's bowling from the wrong end to the left-handers, says Sir Beef. Tim \"Col Pickering\" Sanders has more on the north-south divide: \"Writing 'stoomps' for 'stumps' is a handy way for southerners to represent the pronounciation of \"u\" anywhere north of (roughly) Leamington Spa (I read in Stuart Maconie's book Pies and Prejudice that this is geographically where the change in vowel pronounciation happens). It sort of works because of the way that both southerners and Yorkshire folk pronounce words like 'book' and 'look'. Lancastrians confuse things by their consistency in pronouncing the 'oo' in 'book' and 'look' the same as in 'moon' and 'soon'. That makes 'stoomps' sound pretty silly.\" There you go.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 14-0 (Strauss 8, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Strauss makes hay off the first ball of Philander's over, clipping him up the hill off his pads for four then driving him uppishly with a hint of slice through cover for three. Good, confident start from Strauss this. Several of you have pointed out that we haven't mentioned the follow-on target. We're not going to be so English today but perhaps I ought to as Philander gets Cook to edge, thankfully down through second slip's legs for four then takes two more with a genuine pushed drive. The sun's out.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 16-0 (Strauss 10, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> South Africa have a man in catching behind square at about two o'clock, six yards from the bat and Strauss duly plays one down to him. The heavy roller has done its job, Morkel pitching short and Strauss ducking and swaying out of the way but if he'd stood up it would have been nipple high. Morkel fell over in his follow-through, having trouble with the slope and afraid of a warning for running on the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 16-0 (Strauss 10, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Philander's line is all over the place, squirting a couple across Cook towards first slip that he went for but couldn't reach. \"At the start of this innings, I am watching the Saffer opening bowlers limber up, and it just feels like the series long personal battles that should develop are not going to mature,\" writes Hugh Maguire. \"It's like eating a young cheese, a nice texture, but no flavour to linger on and yearn for again. It's not as if we've not waited in anticipation for this series for long enough for a tasty match-up.\" I was sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through Rogue Herries by Hugh Walpole, and I suddenly came over all peckish.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 21-0 (Strauss 15, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Strauss plays a fine shot off Morkel's second ball, leaning forward and clipping him through midwicket for four off the front foot but Morkel responds with another diamond, pitching on the ideal length and fizzing away from the left-hander's bat. That was Andersonesque. Speaking of which, Rupert in Cape Town writes: \"Any mention of Anderson bad luck needs to be tempered with Steyn's scant fortunes on the last day of the Newlands test between these sides. I was fortunate enough to be there seeing Dale eviscerate Collingwood for what seemed to be hours on end.\" Yes, what a spell to Collingwood and Onions, too, I think. This isn't of that standard, a pretty loose opening from Philander and Morkel.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 23-0 (Strauss 15, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Philander continues with his over-the wicket line across Strauss but after the roller his slips are perhaps two steps too deep. He bowls four in the perfect spot then drifts on to leg stump and Strauss takes a couple of leg-byes off his thigh pad.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 24-0 (Strauss 15, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Edward Matkin takes up the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KBuQHHKx0\">cheese shop challenge</a>. Now Morkel has hit his straps, getting some inswing and movement away off the pitch, Cook edging on to his front pad, killing both the chance of lbw and the ball on its flight through to the slips. \"I've no light to shed on the whys and wherefores, \" writes Rachael Jack, \"But I was living out in Pakistan during the 2007 T20 World Cup when Bumble developed a mini fan club with the sisters in the place I was staying purely based on his pronunciation of loonch.\" Bumble needs no whys and wherefores.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 24-0 (Strauss 16, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Michael Holding suggests that Morne Morkel has Strauss fever. He goes wild at the sight of him and becomes too aggressive, losing control. He points out that Morkel has taken his wicket seven times but feels Steyn should take the new ball.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 28-0 (Strauss 19, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Graeme Smith ponders using DRS when Morkel clips Strauss's thigh pad on its way through to De Villiers but decides against it. \"Luck plays its part in cricket as it does in life, but bowlers who are described as unlucky usually haven't bowled enough balls at the stumps,\" opines Gary Naylor. \"Not the least of Swanny's advantages over Monty, is that Swanny is at the stumps most of the time \u2013 as is Steyn, but not Philander (wide) nor Morkel (high).\" Good over from Morkel until the last ball, which is overpitched and turned by Strauss off his toes. They started haphazardly Philander and Morkel but have found their control and targeted Strauss's ribs and his outside edge in the past four overs.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 29-0 (Strauss 20, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Steyn takes over from Philander, for one over before lunch. Strauss plays his second with soft hands, steering the ball off the face of the bat to bounce in front of slip. Steyn seems to be carrying a knee injury, doing a one-leg jig after jarring it in his followthrough when Strauss pulls him round the corner for a single to long leg.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Strauss b Morkel 20</strong> Another pearl to follow the early dross from Morkel, pitched on off or an inch outside and cut back in through the gate to knock over off and middle. Bon appetit, Andrew Strauss.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Lunch: </strong> South Africa took a while to warm up but the last five overs contained several snorters and jaggers. Strauss looked increasingly uncomfortable. <strong>England lunch on 29-1</strong>, 280 behind. I'm off for some food but I'll leave you with this rant from Ben Sponviken:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having just read your over 88 description of contrived English body language I'm going to allow myself a rant. The tyrannical rule of sports psychologists must be ended. This spurious discipline should be limited to two simple goals: encouraging mental disintegration in your opponent and preventing mental disintegration in your own team. Postive 'body language' results from good cricket. It does not produce good cricket. Anyone who thinks, for example, that Warne was the intended audience of all that behind the stumps encouragement from Healy et al is an idiot. It all happens to make the batsman believe he's facing spin bowling that is so good he can't even appreciate it. KP should be out there today and no amount of ar$e patting is going to produce an innings of the sort of quality he was capable of. Strauss should have stared down the team and the media with simple maxim that he may be a ba$tard, but he's our ba$tard. Sorry.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Lunchtime correspondence</strong>: \"A key gift in life is knowing when to make one's exit, \" writes James Debens. \"I hope the three-year eulogising of Strauss has given him the perspicacity to realise that he's a drag on the team he obviously loves. Do right by England, chum, and do one.\" It's another nothing score, James, but the fundamental difference between him, Vaughan, Hussain and Atherton is that I don't think he feels he's come to an end, the pressures of captaincy have not ultimately overwhelmed him and I think the selectors, coach and players want him to stay, which is what he wants. I think they'll give him the tour to India, hoping for a renaissance like Hussain's v Sri Lanka in 2000-01. </p> <p>\"Time for some dreamy minded, lunchtime nostalgia,\" notes Elliott Carr-Barnlsey. \"Looking at that scorecard from 2003, its nice to see the names Trescothick and Vaughan at the top of the order. Such different approaches but always capable of running amok. The leaden footed square clump of Banger's, and the most smooth cover drive from Vaughan. The best exponent of his generation. Looked like it'd been crafted by Ang Lee and rubbed over with baby oil.\" Wet dreamy minded? </p> <p>David White addresses the issue of luck in more concise fashion than Ed Smith: \"Interesting points about bowlers' luck. Seems to me that over the longer term it's less about luck and more about how they bowl. Andrew Flintoff didn't get nearly as many wickets over his career as he might have had he pitched the ball a foot further up the track. For all his potential, I would say the same applies to Stuart Broad. All to often he's 'bowling beautifully' without getting wickets. I seem to recall Beefy bowled some absolute trash at times but at least he was always trying something and the variation brought about batsman errors \u2013 maybe Finn's coming into the same category.\" Botham made the point himself, saying when Finn bagged Morkel, \"sometimes there's nothing more dangerous than a wide long hop\".</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 29-1 (Trott 0, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Two balls left in Morkel's over after a lunch for the players of cauliflower soup, barbecue pork, beef stir fry or sweet and sour red snapper, according to the menu. Trott takes guard after Morkel took Strauss's wicket for the eighth time. Big knock this for Trott, who watches the two balls sail past off stump.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 34-1 (Trott 4, Cook 7) South Africa 309 </strong> Steyn resumes and immediately brings the first delivery back into Cook while the second holds its line towards the keeper. Cook lets both of them go past. Interesting comparison on Sky between the dismissals of Amla and Strauss, both pinned on the crease by lifters then groping with only a half-step forward and missing when it's pitched up. Trott's off the mark with his favourite shot, punched off his hip for four and would hsve had a second with his on-drive but for Morkel's chain-sawed Sequoia dive at mid-on.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 34-1 (Trott 4, Cook 7) South Africa 309 </strong> Philander replaces Morkel up the hill and shouts for leg-before. Looks way too high, they don't review and they wouldn't have overturned the umpire as it would have stayed umpire's call, just clipping the bails. Philander is trying for lbw, with Cook's tendency to reach around his front pad to push inswingers to midwicket. Twice he gets him reaching but his line is too wide so Cook lets it hit the pad instead. \"Dreamy minded, lunchtime nostalgia sounds to me like a better caption for your main picture,\" writes Dave Espley. O captain! Your fearful trip is done?</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Review: Trott lbw Steyn - given not out. Smith reviews. </strong></p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Trott lbw Steyn 8</strong> It took them an age to decide to review it and, though Trott looks Kallis-like with incredulity to be given out, he looked plumb, the ball hitting middle and leg.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 39-2 (Bell 1, Cook 7) South Africa 309 </strong> Trott picks up another four with a perfectly sweet cover drive. Steyn gets the radge on and tries to bounce him but Trott sways inside the line and the ball balloons through to De Villiers. He pitches the next one up and traps Trott with a hint of inswing. Trott was convinced it was missing leg, bowling as he is from the Pavilion End and angling down the hill but it would have clipped leg stump. Trott's head was too far over to off-stump to be sure it was missing I think. In comes Bell at No4 for the first time in three years and gets off the mark with a single through the leg-side ring.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 39-2 (Bell 1, Cook 7) South Africa 309 </strong> Dread words though they are, South Africa will be trilling about \"plans\" and \"areas\" after play with their so far successful variations of lines for each batsman. \"So,\" writes Hannah Marsh. \"Not mentioning the follow on score \u2026 how do we feel about that now? I'm going tomorrow and am beginning to feel sick with nerves.\" Ask me after the fall of the next wicket, Hannah. Maiden from Philander.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Cook c Kallis b Steyn 7</strong> Right, that follow on score is 110. Jesus, this is bad. Cook chased a wide one, like Morkel did this morning and Smith yesterday and got a thick edge to the cordon, Kallis this time at second slip.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 39-3 (Bell 1, Taylor 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Taylor comes in with his cycling helmet. The replay shows what a fine catch that was by Kallis, moving across Petersen at third slip to take it hip-high to his left while not looking at the ball. \"I had a free \u00a35 bet this morning on Andrew Strauss top scoring in this innings,\" writes Steve Pye. \"Nice to see the English batsman keeping my hopes alive!\". Steyn gives Taylor three bouncers in a row to say \"How do, Tich?\" then snakes the last across him towards first slip that Taylor leaves. Wicket maiden.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 39-3 (Bell 1, Taylor 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Bell shows the full face to the first three of Philander's deliveries, tries again to the fourth as it arcs past his edge. This is agonising, watching them exceute their plans for each batsman like Sirens luring them to doom. \"So \u2026 I'm asking again,\" says Hannah Marsh. \"How do we feel about that follow on score? I'm not feeling too confident now!\" I don't know, Hannah, but South Africa recovered from 54-4. I can't see England getting much past 200 but I think they will avoid the follow on.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 49-3 (Bell 1, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> But then again \u2026 Taylor gets off the mark with a swipe outside off that flies over slips for four but that was a very anxious stroke to one targeting his body again. Steyn goes a bit bananas screaming for lbw for an inswinger that was missing leg by five feet and then Taylor plays an excellent forcing shot on the up and on his toes through the covers for four.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 50-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong>Bell brings the 50 up with a decent stopped drive. Ranil Dissanayake speaks for many of you, apart from the end, most of you prefer something that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_(Blackadder)\">sounds almost exactly like luck</a>: \"Never you fret! England might be three down for fifty-odd, facing the best bowler in the world with his tail up, but their team spirit <em>couldn't be better</em>...

C'mon The Ronster.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 51-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> Kallis takes over from Philander and starts with a slow whanger that is called wide, deservedly so.

Taylor is untroubled.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 52-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> Steyn goes off the field after his spell and Morkel has his first dart from the Pavilion End. \"Is this the shortest England partnership ever?\" asks Richard Green.

Single for Bell.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 52-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> Another maiden, this time from Kallis, neither unduly threatening Bell nor giving him any room to push it off the front foot.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>WICKET!!

The Yorkshireman sways out of the way of one, ducks the other and almost periscopes the next but gets his hands out of the line and anyway it's a no-ball.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 56-4 (Bell 3, Bairstow 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Bell leaves one that cuts back and whacks him straight in the Babybel. Yikes. Sara \"Finns for Finn\" Torvalds says: \"I've no idea if Bell/Taylor are the shortest pair, but I've been wondering who the shortest world-class wicketkeeper is. You'd think Sachin didn't really have to think about keeping (even though he's obviously missing a stumping in his otherwise reasonable carreer), but perhaps I'm wrong in thinking long arms are a requirement?\" Parthiv Patel is about 5ft 2in but I don't know if he still keeps wicket. Kallis claims another maiden. He's doing the smothering role today, back of a length, heavy ball, arrowed into the body.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 56-4 (Bell 3, Bairstow 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Morkel's up into the 90s having got a sniff of Bairstow and heard the name Kemar Roach being bandies about by the infield. This is the duffing up phase for Bairstow, then they'll play nice with one outside off and expect him to succumb with the physical threat off. And he does have a swish at a wider one. Welcome to your doctoral viva, Mr Bairstow. Your examiner today is Mr Morkel, aiming things at your head.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 64-4 (Bell 10, Bairstow 1) South Africa 309 </strong> Runs for bell with three from a steer through midwicket.

Come on. This partnership is what makes Test cricket great. One batsman trying to demolish doubts about his character and technique, the other who's been down that track more times than you can remember, working like hell against brilliant bowlers to put this poor start right. They might not get there. In fact they probably won't. But it's special to watch.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 76-4 (Bell 14, Bairstow 9) South Africa 309 </strong> Philander returns and Bell smears two to deep point. Bell's feet are moving well now. \"Having just read Pete Lovell's response in over 26, claiming his son to be a midget, I am baffled,\" writes Peter Withey. \"Since his original message read \"As we prepare for my son Noah's first days at our local primary,\" I sort of assumed the child was aged around five. It is therefore understandable if he is still quite short. Despair not, namesake Lovell, children grow! Or does he have some sort of time machine allowing him to ascertain that in 2030 his son will still be the same size?\" Well, indeed.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>SA Review Bell lbw Tahir?

Simon Taufel gives him not out and his decision is upheld but Bell's difficulty in reading Tahir does not bode well. \"Rob, it is indeed special to watch,\" writes Oliver Smiddy. \"But which would you rather see \u2013 a rookie, clad head-to-toe in protection, scratching about for runs and being worked over by Morkel and co; or a man who's made runs than any other player in the England team, and who, as recently as the last Test, absolutely flayed the South African attack with one of the best centuries in recent memory?\" Oh, KP, all the way if it hadn't been for those text messages. Everything else could and should have been discounted but they were dumb and, I believe, merited him being dropped. Two leg-byes off the last ball.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 78-4 (Bell 14, Bairstow 9) South Africa 309 </strong> Maiden from Philander, watched and left patiently by Bairstow. \"No idea if this email even gets sent, so poor is my internet connection here at Lake Skadar in Montenegro (f5? Ha! Press that and you might lose the whole feed!),\" writes Ben Heywood. \"But I'd give poor little Boucher-be-sledged Tatenda Taibu at least a podium place on your titchy wicketkeepers list.

I reckon Smyth's going to have 38 or so after tea till ale o'clock. Philander gets mid-off shining the ball for an age. Bairstow moves ahead of his partner by playing it off his hip and scampering two to square leg. \"To answer Oliver Smiddy's completely objective and non-leading question,\" writes Johs Robinson. \"The person I would like to see is the person that the captain, selectors, and (particularly) Andy Flower consider most likely to contribute to the best possible overall team performance over the course of the match.\"</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 91-4 (Bell 19, Bairstow 17) South Africa 309 </strong> Tahir is exasperated and stifles a scream when Bell misreads his googly and gets away with a thick edge when he'd taken two steps down the track to drive.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 91-4 (Bell 20, Bairstow 17) South Africa 309 </strong> Dale Steyn returns for Philander. Michael Holding pinpoints Jonny Bairstow's chest guard and thinks it's given him the confidence to wear the ball when they target him. Botham notes that the real change for Bairstow is that he's watched every ball which he didn't do v West Indies. \"Is KP from Pudsey rather than Pietermaritzburg?\" posits Ian Burch. \"I only ask as this sort of back-stabbing and bickering was the norm every season at Yorkshire where there would be some kind of bitter dispute between the players (past and present), skipper, cricket committee and the members. Most of it usually centred around Sir Geoffrey and I expect that KP will follow his lead and appear on a chat show with a sympathetic host in a few weeks time to give his side of the story.\" On CNN, Ian? Bell faces five of the over, Bairstow the last, ducking beneath Steyn's rather telegraphed bouncer.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 92-4 (Bell 20, Bairstow 17) South Africa 309 </strong> If you can medal and podium, can you maiden? Yes? Tahir maidens.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 94-4 (Bell 20, Bairstow 19) South Africa 309 </strong> Last over before tea and the return of Smyth. Steyn digs it in again at Bairstow which he knocks on to his hip via the splice. Next ball is another short one that Bairstow ducks then clips the third off his pads for two to long leg. Graeme Smith is doing the equivalent of repeating everything someone says to you in a squeaky voice - think Windsor Davies in It Ain't Half Hot Mum \u2013 by mimicking Bairstow's stance and shots and chatting very loudly about his technique. But he sees out the over and the session.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>Tea</strong></p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>Tense, nervous headache?</strong> Well you'd better turn the bloody cricket off then, hadn't you? The next two-and-a-half hours are going to be seriously tense. England aren't a million miles from the brink, 94 for four in reply to South Africa's 309, but they are still in this game. This match is starting to vaguely resemble the final two matches of the series between these sides in 1998, a lowish-scoring dogfight in which every run is hard earned and the initiative is like a hot potato. By the end of a long evening session (36 overs) we should have a slightly better idea who is likely to win the match, the series and the world No1 rankings.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 94-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 20, Bairstow 19)</strong> The excellent Morne Morkel starts the evening session, immediately getting the ball up and around Ian Bell's fragrant armpits. A maiden. Bell played watchfully before tea, as he has all series: he has 20 from 83 balls now, and <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/9062.html?class=1;orderby=batting_strike_rate;orderbyad=reverse;template=results;type=batting;view=series\">his series strike rate of 24 is comfortably the lowest of his Test career.</a></p> <p> \"Although not an international, can I get in a tribute to my club wicketkeeper, B<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/uabhanu\">hanu Upadhyayula</a>?\" says Ben Mimmack. \"He stands barely higher than the stumps but is a demon when standing up to the medium pacers. He's also good for fielding discipline - any throw from the field that comes in more than a couple of feet over the stumps is pretty much guaranteed overthrows.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 97-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 21, Bairstow 21)</strong> Steyn comes around the wicket to Bairstow, with a short leg, a fine leg slip and a plan as old as the hills. Bairstow takes on the short ball, pulling round the corner for a single, and then pushes another later in the over off a relatively full delivery. It's vital that England see off this burst from Steyn.</p> <p>\"'Scuse gratuitous pedantry (yeah, ok, as if my emails ever contain anything else), but I think most of us already have a very good idea indeed of 'who is likely to win the match, the series and the world No1 rankings',\" says Josh Robinson. \"This being cricket, it's just possible that by the end of the session we'll have a different idea, but at this point South Africa are clear favourites.\" You say that, but the chaps on Sky reckon these are perfect batting conditions. Us innate optimists certainly aren't writing this game off.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 101-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 21, Bairstow 25)</strong> I didn't see the afternoon session but it seems Bairstow showed plenty of ticker in the face of the inevitable assault. He's getting it from both ends here, although Morkel's attack is less explicit than Steyn. He is over the wicket and bowling just back of a length rather than banging it in. Bairstow defends a few and then pulls thrillingly over square leg for four.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 107-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 26, Bairstow 26)</strong> England get an overthrow in bizarre circumstances. Bell drove to extra cover, at which point AB de Villiers, thinking the ball was effectively dead, set off after a pigeon that was lurking on the off side. The fielder didn't realise and threw the ball to the keeper's end and England stole a run. That was wonderfully absurd. If England win this match by one wicket the pigeon will surely merit an MBE. Bell gets a lovely boundary later in the over with a crisp square drive off Steyn. That brings up a vital, cool-headed fifty partnership from 113 balls.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 109-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 26, Bairstow 28)</strong> With the ball not doing much for the seamers, Imran Tahir comes into the attack. Bairstow shows good judgement to leave a delivery just outside off stump and then scampers back for two after a cut to deep point.</p> <p>\"Enough of all this modern cricket,\" says Brough Cooper. \"Tomorrow I face the considerable talents (and even more considerable girth) of Martin McCague on the cricket field. He no longer bothers with trundling in to bowl, content to open the batting and attempt to launch every ball into the surrounding countryside. Would you like an autograph?\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpBzMVduF8\">Will you ask him if he does adverts?</a></p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 113-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 30, Bairstow 28)</strong> Bell follows an outswinger from Steyn, steering it short of and then through the slips for four. England will probably feel Steyn has one more over after this and will be desperate to see him off. This is the sort of situation in which Steyn so often reminds us why he has no peer. Bell defends the remainder of the over. This is <em>terrific</em> stuff.</p> <p>\"Evening Rob, evening everybody,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"I feel your pain given the 34789583 overs still left to bowl today, but this has the makings of a session of <em>real cricket</em>. With so much slap and wallop around there's something beautiful and old-fashioned about a 2.5 run-an-over battle between willow and leather. It's so very 1993. I think we're doing the right thing here. There's still so much time left, and batting out today with none or possibly one down will mean we're still in this game tomorrow if we're close to 200 at the end. We've got a long tail, and this sort of gritty survival could be the making of Jonny Bairstow. The lad's got talent, and he'll have few sterner tests than this in his first few England games. Where's Atherton where you need him? He must be LOVING this in the commentary box.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 113-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 30, Bairstow 28)</strong> Tahir. Bairstow. Maiden. Deal with it. \"I enjoyed a lot of those Olympic sports, even warming to the handball and I've been known to watch that game that starts its Premier League tomorrow, but there's nothing quite like hard-edged Test cricket is there?\" says Gary Naylor. \"How did they get this game so right, so long ago?\"</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 114-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 31, Bairstow 28)</strong> Bell starts to poke at an outswinger from Steyn and then pulls it back away at the last minute. Steyn is steaming in with his usual hard-faced intent, and almost every ball is demanding a stroke from Bell or Bairstow.</p> <p>\"This is a great match, TMS is almost unbearably tense,\" says Martin Sinclair. \"However, they've played well these two. The ball should be getting old now, so the short stuff should become less threatening, you would hope for BellStow's sake at least. Do you think reverse swing will come into play and at what point?\" It'll definitely be after 62.4 overs. Not a ball before, not a ball after. End of, fact, etcetera. Er, I have no idea. You'd think it might reverse in these conditions \u2013 it's very hot \u2013 although ultimately nobody knows anything.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 121-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 38, Bairstow 28)</strong> Bell plays an inventive stroke, lapping Tahir very fine for a couple. He charges the next ball, driving it in the air and wide of mid off for four. It was a bit closer to the man than he would have intended but not within catching range. </p> <p>\"Can Bell save the day, please?\" dearJims Eva Broer. \"After seeing him bat at the Oval on the fifth day of the first Test in this series I developed a little crush on him and crushes need feeding otherwise they just peter out.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 121-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 38, Bairstow 28)</strong> The good news for England is that Dale Steyn has been taken out of the attack. The bad news is that <strike> we're all doomed </strike> Morne Morkel is going to replace him. He'll do so with a new ball, the umpires having changed it between overs. His first delivery is a preposterous snorter, a vicious lifter that Bell did superbly to glove short of the slips. A maiden.</p> <p>\"Completely off topic, but my favorite ever charity cricket match was a World XI vs Norfolk Select side,\" says Steven Blowers. \"The World side had the not inconsiderable talent of Ian Bishop opening the bowling against Wayne Larkins. To me as a 12 year old it looked like he was starting his run up from the boundary. I watched in awe as 6ft 5ins of West Indian fast bowler tormented the batsmen. Needless to say after a few 90mph deliveries he was asked to take it down a notch because the Norfolk openers were having difficulty seeing the ball. Perhaps Strauss and Cook could ask Steyn to dial it down a bit as well?\" '<a href=\"www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVZIUwtGP1U#t=0m20s\">Yeah alright Dale, turn it in</a>.'</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 133-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 38, Bairstow 41)</strong> Top stuff from Bairstow, who belts Tahir for three boundaries in four balls: a slightly ugly drag to midwicket, a crisp clip to the same area and then a beautiful flick wide of mid on. He has 41 from 74 balls and has played extremely well under intense pressure on both a personal and team level.</p> <p>\"Is it too early,\" begins Jamie Jermain, \"to start talking about Ronald's inevitable career defining, no-one else made a century this innings, look who's batting at 4 now, Smyth had my back all along hundred?\" Editor's note: Jamie Jermain's full address and phone number will be available upon request as soon as Ian Bell is dismissed for 41.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 137-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 40, Bairstow 42)</strong> Bairstow has an absent-minded, angled-batted waft at Morkel, meeting only with fresh air. A single brings Bell on strike and he receives another brutish lifter that he can only steer fortuitously over the slips for two. There was an element of control, in that he realised he was in trouble and so twisted the bat for an uppercut, but there was a bigger element of fortune.</p> <p>\"Steve Finn mentioned it was lush and green yesterday so that means there will be no reverse,\" says Peter Lovell. \"It needs to dry to create an abrasive pitch to scuff the ball to create reverse swing. It might have reversed back in March but not now.\"</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>51st over: England 140-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 42, Bairstow 43)</strong> Tahir lures Bairstow towards the flame and turns one past the outside edge. Bell paddles a couple later in the over. This is such a good contest; cricket for grown-ups. You'd say South Africa are probably still on top, but not by much at all. </p> <p>\"Please, please Rob, stop publishing things about Bell,\" writes Clare Davies. \"Let's all just keep very quiet and then perhaps Fate won't know what we're all hoping. You know what usually happens so stop it, stop it now!\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>52nd over: England 142-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 42, Bairstow 44)</strong> I'd give Kallis a short spell here. It'd be just like him to snare another sucker at a crucial time and then cackle contentedly while everyone celebrates around him. Bell tries to uppercut Morkel, but it's too short and bounces over his attempted stroke. Then Morkel bowls a no-ball. Every run is a precious thing. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_England_in_1998\">More and more this feels like Trent Bridge and Headingley 1998</a>. </p> <p>\"Splendid game, and I say that as a South African supporter,\" says Richard Mansell. \"It's a tough, hard-fought match, as it should be, and it could go either way. I don't agree with the writer who said that SA were going to win \u2013 it's anybody's. I do think there'll be a result, though, with some much more still to play. That said, I think on balance (or perhaps on paper) SA are the stronger team without the novice batsmen, but I could well be proved wrong.\"</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>53rd over: England 145-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 43, Bairstow 46)</strong> \"So much drama in the England team lately that I wonder if anyone has noticed Trott not making any runs,\" says Dan Minford. \"How long before he feels a bit of pressure?\" It'll be a while yet. As you say, England have much bigger problems than Jonathan Trott, even though <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/47623.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=reverse_cumulative\">he does average only 32 from his last 15 Tests</a>.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>54th over: England 154-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 43, Bairstow 55)</strong> Bairstow snicks Morkel low through the slips for four to reach a thoroughly admirable half-century, his first in Tests. A number of the England balcony are on their feet and, as Peter Lovell points out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/234648073014476803\">a gentleman called Piers may just have shut his mouth</a>. For a couple of seconds. When you consider the context of Bairstow's innings \u2013 his struggles against the West Indies, the man he's replacing, coming in at 56 for four against a magnificent attack in a decider for the world No1 ranking \u2013 this has been a wonderful performance. He's got ticker and talent, which is a decent starting point for a young batsman. Three more through midwicket brings up the hundred partnership.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>55th over: England 161-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 47, Bairstow 58)</strong> Kallis is on, an excellent move by Graeme Smith. If one of these two batsmen slice a filthy wide half-volley to slip I may well weep forever more. Bairstow times three more off the thigh through midwicket; on Sky, Nasser Hussain tells us he has made 30 from his last 23 balls. Bell has been more circumspect but he takes advantage of one of those wide Kallis specials, squirting it square for four.</p> <p>\"It's nice that Graeme Smith reads the OBO and all,\" says Alistair Halton, \"but if Kallis snags one we're coming for you.\" Let's do it. The OBO Fight Club.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>56th over: England 161-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 47, Bairstow 58)</strong> A double bowling change, with Philander replacing Morkel. He starts well wide of off stump to Bairstow, who leaves a few and then almost drags an attempted pull onto his stumps. There are 18 overs remaining in the day. <a href=\"http://www.skysports.com/video/inline/0,,12607_7999204,00.html\">In other news, here's that pigeon business from earlier</a>.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>57th over: England 165-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 51, Bairstow 58)</strong> Bell chases another wide one from Kallis and is beaten, but a delightful back cut for four next ball takes him to a mature and classy half-century from 133 balls. He's playing beautifully. </p> <p>\"God help me for continuing to entertain him,\" says Tom Hooper, \"but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/236495675754422273\">today's award for most sycophantic tweet goes to you-know-who</a>, especially in light of the one you linked to as Jonny got his 50.\"</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>58th over: England 166-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 51, Bairstow 59)</strong> Philander is generally bowling a fifth-stump line to Bairstow, attempting to bore him out. This next hour is buttock-clenchingly important; the difference between an overnight 220 for four and 200 for six is definitely 20 runs and two wickets. Honk! Honk with me now.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>59th over: England 168-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 52, Bairstow 60)</strong> Kallis keeps dangling the ball outside Bell's outside off stump. He's like a bloody femme fatale, albeit one with special hair, just waiting to snare another patsy.</p> <p>\"55th over,\" says Matt Dony. \"Hmmm. Smyth. Clearly a pampered public school lad, and soft southern middle-class journo to boot. If it comes to it, my money's on Alistair 'Knuckles' Halton.\" If you can survive the mean streets of, er, Sittingbourne, a fist-flaunting Guardian reader is nothing to worry about. Let's do this. Let's have a row.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>60th over: England 173-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 53, Bairstow 64)</strong> The game has gone quiet, the result of South Africa's off theory. They will happily do this for the next half hour or so, or until they get a wicket, at which point Steyn and Morkel will be summoned again to raise hell. That line is fine for Philander provided the length is good, but when he drops short Bairstow cuts confidently for four.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>61st over: England 178-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 58, Bairstow 64)</strong> Tahir replaces Kallis. His first ball is a touch too short and flicked brilliantly through midwicket for four by Bell. These are vital runs; England can't just bat time, because the new ball is due after 80 overs and it's far from inconceivable that they will be cleaned up with it, depending on how many wickets have fallen when it's taken. For England, this is the time to cash in. </p> <p>\"Isn't this the Test that England's much-vaunted lower order need to come to the party?\" says Chris Goater. \"Much was made of the superiority of our tail vs the Saffers, but there's not been much evidence so far. Broad in particular has been a disappointment. With SA's Nos7 and 8 making 61 each, Broad and Swann will need to work hard. Is Finn any good with a bat?\" He can clout a ball, but he's below Anderson, which tells a story. As does his first-class average: 6.86.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 178-5 (Bell c Petersen b Philander 58)</strong> Ian Bell has gone! Another twist in this marvellous Test match. The fifth-stump line has worked for Philander. Bell was beaten twice in the course of an excellent over, and then went for a drive at a fuller delivery that moved away just enough to take the edge. It flew low to a wide slip position, wher Alviro Petersen took a beautifully unobtrusive catch at ankle height. Bell swishes his bat and shakes his head in frustration. He had worked desperately hard for those 58 runs.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>62nd over: England 178-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 64, Prior 0)</strong> There are twelve overs are remaining in the day. There might be a temptation for England to play for the close now, but I suspect Prior in particular will attack.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>63rd over: England 181-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 65, Prior 2)</strong> Tahir continues for now \u2013 there is bound to be one last burst from Steyn pretty soon \u2013 and is worked for a single by Bairstow. Prior then gets off the mark with two to deep point. England's running has been very good in this session. There are 11 overs remaining today.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>64th over: England 183-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 67, Prior 2)</strong> \"The first rule of OBO Fight Club,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Never, ever, ever, EVER start to hope.\" As Brad Pitt said in the film, how much can you know about yourself if you've never endured an England batting collapse?</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>65th over: England 187-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 67, Prior 6)</strong> Morne Morkel replaces Imran Tahir. His first ball is short, wide and dismissed through extra cover for four. A fuller delivery beats the edge later in the over. Ebb and flow, the match in miniature. \"Noble of Bell to sacrifice his wicket to Philander to prevent a rumble,\" says Alistair Halton. \"I'd just got my handbag restrapped, too.\"</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>66th over: England 187-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 67, Prior 6)</strong> There are nine overs remaining in theory, although play can't go on beyond 6.30pm. Time, then, for one final burst from Dale Steyn. There are final bursts and final bursts. What kind is this to be? Bairstow almost induces a coronary by dragging a drive back onto his pads, and then does induce one by offering no stroke to an inswinger that <em>just</em> bounces over the stumps. A maiden.</p> <p>\"If witnessing an England batting collapse led to self-knowledge,\" says Peter McLeod, \"I'm pretty sure I would have achieved full enlightenment by now.\"</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>67th over: England 193-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 67, Prior 12)</strong> This is an excellent battle between Prior and Morkel. A play and miss is followed by a withering square drive for four and a work off the hip for two. </p> <p>\"If Finn really wants to keep his place, he'll learn how to bat properly,\" writes John Starbuck. \"Stuart Broad began as a batsman so it shows one can change, and Anderson learned enough to become something other than a total rabbit. He must have had plenty of experience by now so what might he do if properly coached? Get Sir Geoffrey to have a word or two.\"</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>68th over: England 198-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 68, Prior 16)</strong> I wonder how tired Bairstow is mentally. After that dodgy leave in the previous over he started dancing around at the crease, trying to sharpen his focus. The best way to play Dale Steyn, of course, is from the other end, and Bairstow takes a single off the third ball. Prior, who is continuing to attack, misses an extravagant flash at a wider delivery. A steer through the slips next ball brings him his third boundary. Prior has 16 from 22 balls. He doesn't really do backward steps, does he.</p> <p>\"Hmmm, Smith's got a shortish point and a very deep gully in now for Prior, says SB Tang. \"I suspect he's employing the same plan Stephen Fleming used to famous effect against Damien Martyn \u2014 pack his favourite scoring area in the gully/point region with fielders, bowl wide of off stump and dare him to cut and square drive.\"</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>69th over: England 198-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 68, Prior 16)</strong> Bairstow is playing for the close now. He has scored one from his last 19 deliveries and focuses exclusively on defence in that maiden from Morkel.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>70th over: England 201-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 70, Prior 17)</strong> Bairstow is almost completely becalmed now. That's understandable so near to the close after a mentally exhausting day, although such an approach is always a little scary for those of a partisan nature. The ball slips out of Steyn's hand during his bowling action. Bairstow considers belting it for four and decides he probably wouldn't like an angry Dale Steyn. He does clip the next ball for a couple to take England past 200.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>71st over: England 204-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 72, Prior 18)</strong> Kallis is going to bowl a solitary over before the close. He scares the hell out of me with the ball, and he so nearly draws an edge from Bairstow, beaten as he drives absent-mindedly outside off. Bairstow walks away to square leg to sharpen his focus, stopping just short of slapping himself about the coupon. He'll sleep well tonight.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>72nd over: England 208-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 72, Prior 22)</strong> Dale Steyn will bowl the last over of the day. He has a big shout for LBW when Prior whips around a full delivery. Kumar Dharmasena says not out and South Africa rightly decide not to review. It was going down leg. Prior is beaten next ball, fishing where a man should never fish. This is brilliant from Steyn, who must be absolutely shattered yet is storming in like it's 11.02am. He tries for the killer yorker next ball; it's too straight and Prior flicks it fine for four. The following delivery goes past the edge again. A stunning over to end an outstanding day's play. God bless Test cricket. England trail by 101 runs, and both sides will sleep pretty soundly: England because they have recovered from 58 for four, South Africa because the new ball is due in eight overs' time. The man of the day was Jonny Bairstow, who made a lovely 72 not out under all sorts of personal and team pressure. Thanks for your emails; see you tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>The development of a museum dedicated to the life and works Nikola Tesla has moved one step closer after an online campaign raised more than $500,000 in 48 hours.</p> <p>The fundraising effort, called \"<a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/teslamuseum?c=home\">Let's build a goddamn Tesla museum</a>\", was devised by web comic The Oatmeal on behalf of the <a href=\"http://www.teslasciencecenter.org\">Tesla Science Center</a>.</p> <p>It is hoping is hoping to raise $850,000 from its appeal on the money-raising website Indiegogo.</p> <p>The money would allow for the redevelopment of Tesla's Wardenclyffe laboratory in Shoreham, New York, where the cult scientist intended to develop a tower that would provide free wireless electricity across the world.</p> <p>The proposed $850,000 would be matched by funding from the state of New York, reaching the $1.6m asking price for the site with something to spare and putting the Wardenclyffe \"into the right hands so it can eventually be renovated into something fitting for one of the greatest inventors of our time\", <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/blog/tesla_museum\">according to Oatmeal's Matthew Inman</a>. </p> <p>Inman got involved after an appeal from the Tesla Science Center charity, which hopes to develop a science and technology museum at the Shoreham site.</p> <p>Today Tesla is credited with the development of alternating current supply systems and neon lighting, among other pioneering projects. But he was notoriously bad with finances and died penniless in 1943.</p> <p>Born in Serbia in 1856, Tesla went to university in Graz, Austria. He went on to work as chief electrician for a Hungarian telephone company before moving to Paris. In 1884 he moved to New York and began to work for Thomas Edison.</p> <p>After setting up his own company in New York, Tesla bought the 200-acre Wardencylffe site in 1901, establishing a laboratory and tower from which he planned to send electricity wirelessly across the globe. Unfortunately Tesla was never able to fully test his theories, with creditors reclaiming the site in 1903 after the scientist failed to pay money he owed them.</p> <p>In 1917 the 187ft tower at the site, which Tesla had intended to use to fire electricity across the Atlantic, was demolished, and the site lay vacant until it was purchased by Peerless Photo Company in 1939. Over the decades the site fell into disrepair as polluted water was repeatedly dumped into pits at the site. A cleanup operation that has cost the present owner, Belgium-based imaging corporation <a href=\"http://www.agfa.com/co/global/en/internet/main/\">Agfa</a>, tens of millions of dollars. The cleanup ended in March this year, and the site has been listed for sale at $1.6m.</p> <p>\"They just want to sell it and be done with it,\" said John O'Hara from Corporate Realty Services, which is handling the sale on behalf of Agfa.</p> <p>\"It's been, let's say, a pain in the neck for them. It's been vandalised, broken into, there's a lot of stuff going on with maintaining it. It's costing them money to have it.\"</p> <p>O'Hara said Agfa had been asked to donate it but were keen \"to get something out of it\" after having to clean up the pollution caused by Peerless Photo Company, which Agfa took over in the 1970s.</p> <p>There has been a \"lot of interest from Tesla enthusiasts throughout the world\" since the property was listed, O'Hara said, but also from a local developer looking to build apartments on the site, and there has been talk of a retail complex.</p> <p>It was interest from other parties that caused the urgency in creating the fundraising campaign, with the Tesla Science Center warning ahead of the Indiegogo campaign that it needed the funds \"in the next six weeks\". Thanks to the generosity of, at the time of writing, more than 11,500 donors on Indiegogo, it looks like the money will be raised in significantly less time than that.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>10am: Welcome to the county cricket live blog for the latest round of Championship action. Our writers will be here with all the day's play shortly. Richard Rae will be at Yorkshire v Derbyshire at Headingley and Scott Oliver is at Trent Bridge for Nottinghamshire v Durham.</p> <p>In the meantime catch up on the reports of yeaterday's play: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/16/graham-onions-nine-wickets-durham\">read Scott's report of Graham Onions's stunning day on T here</a>, and read Richard's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/17/anthony-mcgrath-yorkshire-derbyshire\">report from Headingley here</a>.</p> <p>And here's Paul Weaver's piece on Jiang Shuyao, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/17/jiang-shuyao-cleethorpes-cricket-china\">the Chinese cricketer crossing boundaries in Cleethorpes</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>11.26am: Remarkably, given last night's appalling forecast, <em>Richard Rae</em> has just watched the covers being removed at Headingley. Even more amazingly, the Yorkshire players are warming-up. It's still grey and damp, of course, but such is the improved drainage at the ground, any sort of dry spell will lead to play starting within half an hour or so \u2013 so an 11am start, or reasonably soon thereafter, is on the cards. The updated forecast is for heavy rain starting around 2pm, but given how much it has already changed, who knows:not the Met Office, apparently.</p> <p>If we do start the Yorkshire bowlers will have their tails up after Tim Bresnan, having been released by England - it sounds so much nicer than dropped or left out \u2013 dismissed Derbyshire captain Wayne Madsen leg before with the last ball of the yesterday's play. As Yorkshire proved in reaching 400-5, however, the wicket is playing pretty well, despite the fact Anthony McGrath, who scored a century, reckons it has more grass on it than any wicket he's seen at Headingley for years. It appears to be the sort of track on which once you've got the measure of it, there are runs to be made \u2013 but if you're not careful, wickets can fall in bundles. As Yorkshire proved in losing their last five wickets for nine runs in 15 balls. They were slogging, and slogging badly, but even so.</p> <p>One thing seems certain \u2013 Derbyshire, clear at the top of Division Two, will surely have no interest whatsoever in setting up a game. Yorkshire will have to bowl them out twice to win this match. A potentially fascinating session lies ahead of us - weather permitting.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>11.28am: Good morning from Trent Bridge where, despite the presence of leaden skies and much morning drizzle, the busy presence of the ground staff suggests that there will be a prompt resumption, writes <em>Scott Oliver</em>. Lovers of pathetic fallacy* (yer TS Eliots, yer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquezes) will no doubt suggest that the foreboding autumnal skies are apt to capture the day that Nottinghamshire's season came to an end at the hands of Graham Onions.</p> <p>Those burrowing around in the bottom of Pandora 's Box, meanwhile, will suggest that the Cricketing Gods are providing a last-chance saloon session for Notts to prevent ther Championship campaign from flatlining once and for all. If Durham make north of 200, you would suspect that there is no way back. Messrs Phillips, Fletcher, Carter and Franks - it is over to you.</p> <p>* One may be pathetic, one may be prone to fallacy, but that doesn't mean you are fond of their combination</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>12.44pm: Aside from a three-over burst of anger and frustration (and all the other emotions Brian from Spaced used to depict in his work) from gesticulating Notts fielders, the cricket at Trent Bridge this morning has progressed fairly serenely, which suits only one side. Stoneman has again looked impressive and has 74 out of Durham's 115 for 1, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>.<br> The source of Notts' ire was a couple of loud, consecutive appeals against Keaton Jennings that were rejected by umpire Steve Gale, who the fielding team clearly feel owes them a couple, maybe three, from yesterday. Mullaney got a stinker (height), Franks had a rough'un (pitched outside leg), Hales's might also have been going down. I asked Mr Onions last night whether he felt they were all out and, pre-empting an answer, qualified it with \"\u2026even though it will say so in tomorrow's paper\", failing to realise that I could have in fact written that they were dubious. \"Well, there you go\", he answered, unable to prevent the hint of a grin appearing. Walking round from pavilion to press box when the grousing on the field and grumbling in the stands were at its brief zenith, Mick Newell had a spectator (a real one, not Nev) say: \"Need some new umpires aaht there, Mick\". Newell deadpanned: \"Well, there's enough in the crowd\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>1.08pm: In response to reader demand, click <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/13629853\">here</a> to find a list of links to today's county commentaries on the BBC</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>1.49pm: It's been Yorkshire, Ryan Sidebottom and Andrew Hodd's morning at Headingley, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. </p> <p>In his first innings as Yorkshire wicketkeeper, Hodd took three outstanding catches off Sidebottom's bowling. The first required him to dive to his right and take the ball low and one-handed off Usman Khawaja for 3: the other two to his left, two handed in front of first slip to dismiss Matt Lineker for 14 and Dan Redfern for 3. </p> <p>That left Derbyshire on 42-4, but since then Wes Durston and Ross Whiteley have put on 50, with Durston fastening on to a series of loose deliveries from Steven Patterson. Durston hit eight boundaries in reaching his 50 in the over before lunch, off 66 balls. Derbyshire 98-4 at the break.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>3.26pm: It was nice to finally get some food in the belly \u2013 fish, chips and mushy peas, if it's of any interest \u2013 as your correspondent has felt a little bleary-eyed today after burning the candle at both ends in a couple of Nottingham's hostelries these last two nights, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>.<br> On Wednesday I partook of a Big Lebowski quiz, annexing myself to a team comprising four members of a band called Awesome Sex (\"a sort of \u2013 ugh \u2013 techno-pop\", I presume, but didn't ask) which has recently splintered from Hot Japanese Girl. Nice to see new fourpieces using SEO when choosing their names these days... Anyway, there were many White Russians imbibed, although mixed with a little too much ice for Awesome Sex's taste ('Jackie' did not make \"a helluva Caucasian\"). It was just a pity that Rob Smyth wasn't in town, for <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/15/the-spin-england-west-indies-1991\">his Spin </a>this week contained, as an epigraph, one of the more gratuitous Lebowski references you'll ever see. In the spirit of such gratuitousness, then, if anyone happens to be an aficionado of the movie and has some free time when it starts raining shortly (gloom here that Scyld would be contractually obliged to describe as \"Stygian\"), I once posed the question: <a href=\"http://reversesweeper.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/what-can-big-lebowski-teach-us-about_4519.html \">What can The Big Lebowski teach us about cricket?</a> It's <em>just a game</em>, man.<br> Last night, I popped in to see An Audience with Carl Froch, the Nottingham-born \"three-time world super-middleweight champion\" interviewed by 5Live's Darren Fletcher, before posing kerchingingly for photos with his fans (they cost \u00a310 each). Overall impression was of an articulate, magnanimous, down-to-earth figure who spoke with good humour about his life in and out of the ring and the three-fight plan he has to bring his career to a close, culminating in an open-air affair at Forest's City Ground, \"my Vegas, my Madison Square Garden\". One thing he has never done is duck an opponent (not literally, of course), unlike a couple of the British \"silver-spoon jobs\" who went soft with multi-fight TV contracts behind them, and he said that if he were forced to fight any of the Benn-Eubank-Collins 'Golden Era' triumvirate, he would probably chose the former, as \"he probably would have walked on to me shots\".  In the time it has taken me to type out that paragraph, the players have been forced off by a steady drizzle.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>3.28pm: And the long forecast rain has finally arrived at Headingley, where <em>Richard Rae </em>is joining the players - figuratively speaking - in taking an early tea. </p> <p>The groundstaff are busy covering the entire square, suggesting they think that might it for the day - and they're almost certainly right. In the 58 overs played thus far, Derbyshire have moved on to 163-5, with the only wicket falling after lunch that of Wesley Durston for a splendid 84 made from 115 balls: he pushed forward at an Azeem Rafiq delivery that squeezed through bat and pad and on to the stumps. </p> <p>Rafiq has bowled well, certainly better than all the other Yorkshire bowlers with the exception of Ryan Sidebottom, who swung the ball at a decent lick from the Rugby Stand End this morning. 'Sid' was well backed up by the catching of Andrew Hodd, who took three fine catches behind the stumps. Tim Bresnan has been particularly disappointing, not making the batsmen play enough. Watched by England selector James Whittaker, he looked like he was trying to bowl too fast. </p> <p>I can't help feeling Yorkshire have let a real opportunity slip by here. Two or three more wickets and they could have come back tomorrow with a real chance of enforcing an innings victory.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>5.46pm: Down in Nottingham doing twelfth man duties for Durham for the first two-and-a-half days was Michael Richardson, the reserve wicket-keeper and son of former South African Test gloveman Dave, now the ICC's CEO, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>.<br> Richardson <em>fils</em> knows the city very well, having studied Finance, Accounting and Management for three years at the University of Nottingham, during which time he played two seasons a mile or so along the river, south-west of Trent Bridge, for the wonderfully named Notts Unity Casuals CC \u2013 the place at which Notts' director of cricket, Mick Newell, played all his club cricket, from the junior ranks right up until he finished in 2002. <br> \"I was told that if I had any ambition to play for Nottinghamshire, I should go and play for them,\" Richardson recalls, possibly victim of one of the oldest sales lines in English league cricket. Newell claims never to have seen Richardson bat at Unity (\"busy\", he reckons) but did once share a beer down there with Richardson Snr. Mind you, the presence of his father used to make Michael \"a little nervous, for some reason\". Also at Unity for Richardson's first season was adopted Son of Notts, Darren Bicknell \u2013 Surrey-born, of course, but still up here playing for Caythorpe in the Nottinghamshire Premier League as well as Cambridgeshire in the Minor Counties Championship, and still scoring runs in that slow-motion-yet-never-rushed manner of his. Richardson says that he learned much from \"Denzil\", a batsman who fell just 69 shy of 20,000 first-class runs: \"He always used to have a quick strike-rate, but not really liking for shots. Because he was such a good timer of the ball, he didn't really look to manufacture anything. He just batted within his means and made the bowlers come to him\". There in the second season was livewire Pakistani Test keeper Adnan Akmal, \"a lovely chap, actually, who took the gloves from me\", just as he later would his own brother, Kamran. Richardson now spends his winters working for Durham's main shirt sponsor, Brewin Dolphin, the year-round residency helping him in his quest to gain a UK passport (at present, he plays as an EU passport holder, courtesy of his half-German mother, that he cannot pass on). The work also ties in with his degree as he keeps half an eye on his post-cricketing life, where he may also follow his father's footsteps. But for now, aged 25, he wants to develop his game further and add to his nine first-class appearances.

  "<p>Having the means to buy clothes has historically been a symbol of status and it still remains one area of people's lives where income differences and social status area readily perceivable.</p> <p>An office worker in the Victorian era, whether in <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/wages2.html\" title=\"\">London</a>, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u282hWa0d1QC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=wages+cotton+mills+yorkshire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rM8rgyPxpk&amp;sig=NYmE4LvRVJOOR8ld6_Td7zX_KHY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0tanT66dMMHb8QPSwa34BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=wages%20cotton%20mills%20yorkshire&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Yorkshire</a> or <a href=\"http://oldrecipebook.com/1800s-livingcost.shtml\" title=\"\">New York</a>, would spend equal amounts on clothing and rent each year, and households would be able to survive on a single income. In contrast, labourer families would struggle to have sufficient food on the table with a single salary. Only by combining the wife's and children's salaries would there be enough food and perhaps some clothes, if not shoes, for the family.</p> <p>These specifics of the past are very different to the present, where <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/publication?p_product_code=KS-DY-09-001\" title=\"\">the average EU household</a> spends only 5.7% of income on clothing and footwear. In the US, where <a href=\"http://mjperry.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/spending-on-clothing-and-footwear-falls.html\" title=\"\">in 2009 citizens bought</a> $326bn of clothing, people spend as little as 2.98% of their income on clothes. This is down from 4.78% in 1988 and 9% in 1950, confirming a trend that has been apparent since <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/1077727X8901700301/abstract\" title=\"\">before the second world war</a>.</p> <p>This goes hand in hand with a fall in price-per-item. In other words, we can buy the same, or even larger, amount of clothing, but spend substantially less. The <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/publication?p_product_code=KS-DY-09-001\" title=\"\">EU-27 consumer statistical survey</a> shows that since 1996 overall clothing prices have, on average, declined \u2013 despite an inflation of around 2.2% \u2013 which would normally result in a price increase. In the UK, garment prices fell by an average of 10% between 2003 and 2007, and in 2006 people bought a third more clothes than in 2002. While the 2007 recession left the total sales volume in the UK clothing retail market largely unaffected, the retail price of clothing deteriorated drastically.</p> <p>Outsourcing to low-cost overseas locations, often lacking governmental enforcement of minimum health and safety standards, accounts for an important aspect of the retail price decreases in apparel. Since the 1974 Multi Fibre Agreement, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unido.org%2Ffileadmin%2Fuser_media%2FPublications%2FPub_free%2FGlobalization_changed_global_dynamics_of_clothing_and_textile_value_chains_and_impact_on_subSaharan_Africa.pdf&amp;ei=LbunT-qpJOqd0AX0upz4Aw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2BlQ1a5ss4t-Xi-zOxzua7cf8XA\" title=\"\">an ever increasing percentage</a> of clothing is produced in low-cost countries and imported back into western consuming nations.</p> <p>But, possibly even of more importance, the fast fashion \"race to the bottom\" is also accompanied by lower product quality standards. In 2006, the average life span of a garment in London was three years. However, Primark in Oxford Street did not open until 2007, and it is safe to speculate that the life span may now be even shorter.</p> <p>In 2008, about 80% of all donated clothing was in good enough condition to either be reused as secondhand clothing, baled goods to developing countries, or sold to rag sorters. In 2011 this percentage had fallen to between 60 to 70%. In the same period, the total amount of clothing donated for recycling decreased by about 20%, while the total amount of clothing discarded remained stable or grew.</p> <p>Contemporary fashion consumption patterns, hence, have a direct correlation with lower garment quality. A well finished pair of jeans for example, requires a certain amount of labour, and therefore time, to sew. Making more items in a shorter period of time can only mean one thing: less time per item, and therefore more mistakes and imperfections with the result being that the product will fall apart quicker.</p> <p>In combination with the prospects of impending <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/cotton-farming-fashion-fuel-food-shortages\" title=\"\">raw material</a>, <a href=\"http://environmentalgeographies.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/water-the-real-fashion-victim/\" title=\"\">water shortages</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/business/global/17textile.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">rising salaries</a> in principle manufacturing destinations such as China, it is plausible that changes in sourcing and manufacturing patterns are imminent, and will affect brands of all types and price levels.</p> <p>An indicator of this is <a href=\"http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/299207/chinese-garment-manufacturers-plan-relocate-here-due-labor-advantage\" title=\"\">Chinese</a> and <a href=\"http://www.just-style.com/news/garment-plants-relocating-to-bangladesh_id111608.aspx\" title=\"\">Pakistani</a> manufacturers relocating their whole production to destinations such as the Philippines and Bangladesh in order to maintain their price competitiveness which is primarily based on low cost man power.</p> <p>The rise in costs of upstream manufacturing will affect consumers in the west, and could trigger the first clothing price increase in nearly a century. The question is not if this will happen, but when.</p> <p>For many consumers price acts as an <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-31041343/cornells-heffetz-price-trumps-quality-perception-in-purchasing-decisions/\" title=\"\">indicator of quality</a> with a higher price suggesting better quality. As a consequence of rising manufacturing costs, the price of fast fashion will go up, leaving consumers with the expectation that quality will also improve accordingly.</p> <p>Beyond quality however, higher prices are prone to more scrutiny by the consumers overall. Low environmental and social standards may be just about acceptable for low quality and low price products, but not for something of a supposedly higher standard, as <a href=\"http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/12/gucci-faces-sweatshop-claims-in-china/\" title=\"\">luxury brands such as Gucci</a> have experienced.</p> <p>All costs accounted for, producing geographically closer to home suddenly becomes financially more attractive. This increases the ability to exercise tighter control over product manufacturing and at the high end of the apparel and foot wear market this is already happening.</p> <p>It goes without saying that this comes with challenges. First, textile manufacturing skills and qualified production units have largely disappeared over the past 30 years, and resuscitating or rebuilding such skill is a painstaking, slow, expensive and difficult process. Producing closer to home also means that long forgotten about legal and social issues related to textile manufacturing \u2013 such as waste, environmental impact, fair wages and labour conditions \u2013 will demand a local solutions.</p> <p>Fast fashion has democratised style over past decades, specifically in the west. This is a contribution that cannot be ignored. Historically, buying clothes was in essence and for the vast majority of people, equivalent to spending on something practical to cover up ones' nudity, and survive under given climatic conditions. Dressing up in order to look good was an exclusive privilege of the better off. Fast fashion changed the rules of this game fundamentally.</p> <p>The social gap these days is not any more between those that can, or cannot, afford to look stylish, but rather between those that can, or not, afford to look \"classily\" fashionable . For a fashion business and brand, this means that quality in production as well as design will increasingly be considered a basic prerequisite.</p> <p><em>Dr Pamela Ravasio is an independent researcher, journalist and consultant specialising in sustainable fashion businesses processes</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Success stories are thin on the ground in Spain these days but Inditex, the retail clothing giant that includes Zara, appears immune to the slings and arrows of misfortune. Last week its founder, Amancio Ortega, was named by Bloomberg as the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/ortega-passes-buffett-as-world-s-third-richest-person-video-.html\" title=\"\">third richest man</a> in the world, with a personal fortune of \u20ac37.5bn (\u00a329.4bn). The company, the world's biggest clothing retailer, has tripled its stock market value over the past three years with profits up 30% on 2011 for the first quarter of this year.</p> <p>Even in Spain, where consumer spending has nosedived as a result of spending cuts and mass unemployment, Inditex has increased sales by a modest 1%, while competitors such as Mango saw profits fall by 38.5% in 2011, despite increased worldwide sales.</p> <p>The extraordinary thing about Inditex being a global leader is not just that it's Spanish, but that it's a success story that began and remains headquartered in Galicia in Spain's wild, windswept north-west. It is one of Spain's poorest regions and has always had high emigration. At election time politicians have to go on the stump in Buenos Aires and Mexico City, because expats account for as much as 30% of the vote in some Galician constituencies. In short, Galicia is not a place you establish a global empire, but that's what Ortega has done.</p> <p>Galicians are famously enigmatic and, although he was raised in Le\u00f3n and moved to Galicia as a teenager, Ortega is an enigma, the personification of the reclusive billionaire. He never gives interviews and is rarely photographed. Pablo Isla, the chief executive appointed mid-crisis in 2011 when Ortega stepped down, doesn't give interviews either.</p> <p>The key to business success in Spain, where many of the most successful companies are family concerns, is often to be <em>de buena familia</em> but Ortega's origins are of the humblest. His mother was a maid and his father worked on the railways. He started work as a delivery boy in a textile firm and learnt the business from the ground up. He got the idea that good quality clothes should be made affordable to ordinary people and this led to him founding Zara in 1975 with his first wife.</p> <p>\"Ortega has been in the right place several times,\" says Jos\u00e9 Luis Nueno of IESE Business School. \"When he started out he was competing against small players with poor distribution in a country that was just discovering fashion.\"</p> <p>Now Zara has 1,659 branches worldwide and accounts for nearly 70% of Inditex's income. Ortega retained a 59% stake when Inditex went public in 2001. Few people would class Ortega as being in the same groundbreaking mould as Sergei Brin or Mark Zuckerberg, but his company has revolutionised the fashion business every bit much as Google and Facebook have revolutionised communications.</p> <p>\"Other companies copy the fast fashion model but only for 10% or 20% of their operation,\" says Nueno. \"For the rest, they stick to the old seasonal collection model. For Inditex it's a combination of design, logistics and store management that makes it possible to do it on the scale they do.\"</p> <p>Zara can get a new design made up and distributed in a week, and it launches about 12,000 new designs every year. To get this in perspective, when Marks &amp; Spencer hit the skids at the beginning of this century, its turnaround time for a new design was close to a year. At Zara, there is no warehousing and reorders are rare, which is one reason the company never advertises: by the time you get to the shop the garment in the ad will have sold out.</p> <p>Secondly, the customer is king. Imaginative use of IT and turning its shop assistants into market researchers means Zara has real-time information about what is selling and where. If customers say they like it in blue but would prefer it in purple, within a week it will be there in purple. This rapid response is made possible partly by keeping most of its production in Europe, largely in Spain, unlike others who have put all their eggs in the Chinese basket.</p> <p>\"Proximity has become very affordable,\" said Nueno. Labour in China is becoming more expensive, as is transport. Inditex is developing integrated operations in Turkey, north Africa and Portugal, areas where the textile industry had been wiped out by competition from China.</p> <p>But the company isn't just alert to its customers' fashion whims. It uses renewable energy sources at its main plant in Arteixo in Galicia and when it discovered a supplier in Brazil was sub-contracting to sweat shops, its response was as firm as it was quick.</p> <p>Then there's the Armancio Ortega Foundation, managed by Marta, daughter of his second wife and heir to the family fortune.</p> <p>While Spain's Galician prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has slashed spending on schools, Ortega's foundation has just dished out \u20ac11m to create 750 nursery school places in Galicia. Jobs, social responsibility and huge profits \u2013 what's not to like?</p>",
  "<p>Resident Evil is back. No, I mean <em>really</em> back. While Resident Evil 4 changed the old recipe in a brutal yet considered way, the fifth title seemed to mangle the whole franchise into a sub-standard sun-burned shooter. Resident Evil 6, however, wants to have its slice of undead gore cake and eat it. </p> <p>The game's interesting structure follows three sets of characters on three very different quests through a zombie-infected world. There's Chris Redfield breaking out the blast-'em-up action in China, while Jake Muller, son of Resi antagonist Albert Wesker goes on the run in Eastern Europe in a sort of action adventure romp. And then there's Leon Kennedy, back in the US and facing his own infected outbreak in the traditional Resident Evil form. Having played a section of his story, it seems Capcom has truly rediscovered the essence of the survival horror genre. </p> <p>In this section Leon and his partner Helena must escape from a college campus where a zombifying gas has infected just about the entire student body. As soon as the demo begins it's clear this is classic Resident Evil fare. We're in a dingy cellar room, poorly lit and filled with rubbish. Leon's footsteps echo loudly and every once in a while a strange noise makes him flinch and look around. Was it a cry? A growl? We don't know, but our view of the room is restricted and the tension cranks up.</p> <p>So up the creaking steps Leon goes, out into a corridor, littered with more trash and smeared with blood. We're back, at least in terms of dense atmosphere and crushing inevitability, to the mansion in Resident Evil 1. And I might be over-reading it, but I'm sure the way that Leon slowly pushes each huge wooden door open is a reference to the old loading screens between locations in the first title. </p> <p>Leon makes his way gingerly into a tiered lecture theatre \u2013 bathed in shadow and seemingly deserted. Then, suddenly and subtly, a drink can rolls down the steps onto the central floor. Immediately from the gloom, a zombie rises, then another. It's game on. Leon has a handgun, as does Helena, but \u2013 guess what \u2013 ammo is in very short supply. The one concession to modern tastes is the melee element: while in the first Resi titles taking on a zombie in hand-to-hand combat was always a nightmarishly risky endeavour, Kennedy is a high-kicking hard guy, who can knock the undead down then quickly stamp on their fetid faces. There are also short QTE sequences, allowing more devestating and visually impressive attacks.</p> <p>As an AI character, Helena tends to hang back prefering to avoid and shoot, rather than wade in with blows. It's a good idea, meaning that she never puts herself into unncessarily risky situations.</p> <p>As monsters are disptached, Leon picks up skill points, which can be used throughout the game to upgrade characters and weapons. Rooms also contain herbs and bullets, as well as useful pieces of information. Leon and Helena don't talk much, but they trade theories as they move. In the background a discordant organ soundtrack plays, or there's silence punctuated only by breathing sounds. </p> <p>Cleverly, although it's a 3D environment with a dynamic camera, there's still an angular, expressionistic feel to each room, like the weird fixed camera angles in the first Resi titles. Often objects or shadows restrict your view, or you'll catch glimpses of movement through doorways \u2013 Capcom has remembered how to be subtle and artful; how to use the tricks of Hitchcock and Romero to hint at terror while restricting our ability to properly see or deal with it. At times when groups of zombies come in, I often get stuck trying to turn Leon between the undead aggressors, and far from being a flaw, it once again takes me back to the tension and vulnerabiity of Resident Evil 1 and 2.</p> <p>Outside, the campus is crawling with the undead \u2013 we need to open a security gate but the key is in a staff house and when we go in, zombies suddenly mount an attack on the building crawling in through the windows in a reference to the classic stand-off scene in Resident Evil 4. It's bloody, nerve-wracking stuff, and when we finally grab the key, it's all bout navigating through the darkened landscape to get to that gate and to freedom. </p> <p>From here, there's a great denoument. Leon and Helena dive into a police car and screech away, heading for a cathedral, until another zombie attack sends the car spinning off the road. This is how Resi has always worked \u2013 slowly but surely building the atmopshere to firestorms of destructive action. I can't wait to see the end-of-level monsters in this one. </p> <p>Best of all, I love the way this level plays with the memories and expectations of longtime Resi fans. It's not only those door-opening sequences; there are also sections that comment on how the first games made you run through the same sections time and time again; only here, new zombies awaken to make the return trip more dangerous. It also looks as though zombie dogs will be back, no doubt smashing through windows and giving us all heart failure once again. Everything is both familiar and new. It is marvelous fun. </p> <p>It will be fascinating to see how all this fits together. Apparently each of the three sections is its own adventure, though the stories interconnect. They're all around ten hours long, and finishing them unlocks an extra Ada Wong story, which itself is another ten hours. On top of this, there are multiplayer modes, as well as a new social layer, RE.Net, which compares player stats and achievements, and lets you unlock extra costumes and other goodies. </p> <p>I played Leon's quest in single-player, and it'll be fascinating to see if the old skool fear is retained with a co-op partner. It's the same thing people are worrying about with Dead Space 3, though here it feels like co-operating is subservient to the main motivation \u2013 trying to get out, trying not to be eaten, trying not to be scared. Resident Evil has always been about the terror of transmogrification and decay \u2013 it was at its best when it did this in a mannered, manipulative way. Leon's story is hitting those same old nerves, those same fear points. We are residents of evil once again.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Resident Evil 6 will be released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in October</em></p>",
  "<p>The Chinese are on the verge of leapfrogging the Germans and Americans to become the nation whose tourists spend the most money overseas, as the idea of foreign travel captures the imagination of millions of newly affluent citizens in the world's most populous country.</p> <p>The World Tourism Organisation predicts that the number of overseas trips made by Chinese people will surge from 70m last year to 100m by the end of the decade, from just 5m 15 years ago.</p> <p>Though they spend on average less than their western counterparts, the number of travellers means the total is high \u2013 and rising. China's travellers overseas <a href=\"http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf\" title=\"\">spent $54bn (\u00a335bn) in 2010 and $72bn last year</a>, compared with $84bn ($78bn in 2010) for Germans and $79bn ($75bn in 2010) for the US. Officials say the first five months of 2012 saw a 20% increase in Chinese tourists leaving the country.</p> <p>The vast majority of Chinese citizens still holiday at home, if they are lucky enough to afford a trip at all. For those who venture further afield, the top destinations are Hong Kong and Macau \u2013 both part of China, but ruled under separate systems. Many of those journeys are little more than day trips to shops or casinos.</p> <p>But thanks to the expanding middle class, a surge of Chinese tourists has helped to fill hotel beds and cash tills from South Africa to Italy. The luxury stores of Paris are well-staffed with Mandarin speakers, while hotels in London are learning to offer congee (rice porridge) as well as croissants for breakfast and quilts instead of blankets. Selfridges and Harrods started taking China's Union Pay bank card last year.</p> <p>The popular destinations are becoming more varied. Jiang Yiyi, a researcher at the Chinese tourism academy, says people are increasingly keen to take beach or activity holidays rather than simply traipsing round tourist sites.</p> <p>\"In the past, travel packages like 11 European countries in 13 days were very popular, because Chinese tourists cared a lot about the number of countries they could visit,\" said Wang Yali, marketing manager at China Travel Service (CTS). \"Nowadays, they pay more attention to comfort and additional activities. They hope they have enough time to enjoy the sites. They tend to choose 10 days in Greece, or in the UK, France and Switzerland.\"</p> <p>While Chinese tourists do more shopping than others \u2013 partly because of the sky-high luxury taxes at home \u2013 scenery and culture are bigger draws, Wang said.</p> <p>There are also peculiarly Chinese must-sees. Montargis, a small town around 60 miles south of Paris, is a popular stop because key leaders such as Deng Xiaoping lived there in the 1920s. In Cambridge, tourists flock to King's College not for its celebrated chapel but to see a willow by the river, immortalised in one of the best-known modern Chinese poems, Xu Zhimo's On Leaving Cambridge.</p> <p>Overall, Asian, Australian and European destinations still top the list; officially, the UK is more popular than France and Germany, though figures are skewed because while Schengen European visas allow people to visit several countries within Europe (but not the UK) on a single visa, they will only be registered at their point of arrival.</p> <p>But these days, Israel, Tahiti and the Maldives are appearing on itineraries too. CTS has begun chartering flights to the Seychelles for the first time.</p> <p>Destinations are keen to woo Chinese travellers. While official statistics suggest the average Chinese tourist spends $1,000 a trip \u2013 reflecting the fact that many are taking short hops to Hong Kong or Macau \u2013 Jiang said that research for the China tourism academy showed that some spend 100,000 yuan (\u00a310,000) on shopping alone. According to Global Blue, a shopping tourism company, 20% of all tax-free shopping is by Chinese customers.</p> <p>\"Most of our readers aren't travelling to take photos or go to tourist sites, but to experience a different lifestyle. For them, the destination is not the most important thing; the question is how to travel,\" said Li Ying, a senior associate editor at National Geographic Traveller. \"When I wrote a travel feature about London, I advised them on how to live like a Londoner, go to local pubs and experience the local culture.\"</p> <p>China's economic development has not only allowed people to travel, it has also encouraged them to do so, as priorities have changed. For a small but growing number of young people, personal satisfaction and exploration are becoming as important as wealth and security.</p> <p>\"The most important thing is being happy,\" said a Beijing-based IT worker, Bao Chao, who said he and his wife had not looked back since giving up high-flying careers. Last year they took the unusual step of blowing most of the family savings on a three-month, 12,000-mile trip across China with their baby daughter.</p> <p>The 29-year-old's account of the journey caused a stir online, with thousands of users praising him as an inspiration \u2013 or castigating his irresponsibility in spending their nest egg on travel, taking such a long break and touring with such a small child.</p> <p>\"We just wanted to have a family trip and spend time together. I am sure many rich Chinese families could have had an even better holiday, but they do not have time to do it. We made time,\" he said. \"When we have enough money, we'd like to go on a road trip in the US or Europe.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Cecily Huang</em></p>",
  "<p>Earlier this week we asked for your stories about the most unusual locations in which you've seen musicians perform. Here are some of our favourites. If you've attended any strangely located concerts, let us know in the thread below.</p> <h2>Bringing Woodstock to Warwick</h2> <p>It must have been in the late summer of 1969 when Warwick's own<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/c7b4135b-d12b-429b-b7ff-2584177536f6\"> Edgar Broughton Band</a> responded to the local council's obdurate refusal to let them organise a second Woodstock in <a href=\"http://www.stnicholaspark.co.uk/\">St Nicholas Park</a> \u2013 it seemed a perfectly reasonable idea at the time \u2013 by driving a mobile gig on the back of a Bedford lorry through Warwick on market day. </p> <p>The refreshing strains of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce-v2EyG52Y\">Out Demons Out</a> and a motley audience of hippies, greasers (the nearest Warwick could get to Hells Angels), students and the dispossessed surprised the Saturday crowds and the traders.</p> <p>Revolution was in the air \u2013 it was the nearest Warwick ever came to it \u2013 but, sadly, it was never quite delivered. It was fun though!</p> <p><em>Jim Sweetman</em></p> <h2>Freezing in the belly of a ship</h2> <p>Back in January I saw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/258787d8-07e4-4ad8-9c5a-89b3908796b0\">Darren Hayman</a> perform his wonderfully melancholic and witty album <a href=\"http://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/the-ships-piano\">The Ship's Piano</a>, on a genuine ship's piano, in the belly of an refurbished lightship docked at Gillingham Pier.</p> <p>The unexpectedly cold evening, and an unheated hold, forced Hayman to play the entire gig without removing his hat, scarf, overcoat and fingerless gloves.</p> <p>The huddled and transfixed audience, who had climbed down a near-vertical ladder to be there, provided an eerie smoke machine effect with our collective breath.</p> <p>The bar was a canteen table wedged between functioning engine control cabinets that tempted the queue with glowing buttons labelled \"start\" and \"abort\". It was almost impossible to hold the cold beer cans in the freezing chill down there.</p> <p>If you went up onto the top deck, you could put your ear to any hole and hear his amazing voice piped from below like it belong to a trapped ghost.</p> <p>It was one of the strangest, most beautiful and unforgettable gigs I've ever been to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=547504233/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=547504233/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/the-ships-piano\">The Ship's Piano by Darren Hayman</a></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/the-ships-piano\">Reading on mobile? Listen to The Ship's Piano on Bandcamp</a></p> <p><em>John Sutherland</em></p> <h2>Car park noise cannons</h2> <p>The strangest place I've ever seen a gig has to be a car park in East London. This was sometime in the early 90s, when the Disobey club was making a name for itself with a string of interesting one-off events. </p> <p>The only way of finding out the location for this one was to call a recorded information line. That done, I made my way to the car park and waited what seemed like an age for the gig to start. It consisted of someone driving <a href=\"http://kulchermulcher.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/sonic-warfare/\">Jimmy Cauty's armoured vehicle</a> (it may even have been Cauty himself, we were never told) round and round in circles while the Finnish electronic trio <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Sonic\">Panasonic</a> (as they were then called, prior to a lawsuit from the electronics giant) issued wave after wave of pulverizing noise from speakers attached to the vehicle.</p> <p>Indeed, we never found out whether Panasonic themselves were in the armoured vehicle either. It hardly seemed to matter.</p> <p><em>Richard Rees Jones</em></p> <h2>An 'obscure centre of extreme unhappiness'</h2> <p>Leonard Cohen in 1970 and his band doing a warm-up gig for their Isle of Wight festival appearance.</p> <p>Not a small club, as one might have expected, but in the shabby hall of an old-school asylum outside London.</p> <p>I'd been a huge fan of Cohen since the first album and, while on a personal journey to investigate madness, worked as a student nurse in the asylum.</p> <p>The news that he was to play a concert in this obscure centre of extreme unhappiness, where I was working, was frankly unbelievable to me.<br>When I'd recovered from the shock, I did fear that the author of the undeniably bleak vision of those first two albums might not be a perfect fit for the environment he was to play in.</p> <p>I need not have worried.</p> <p>Cohen was not \"me big star, you listen and shut up\" \u2013 he took one look at the unpromising distracted audience, none of whom had a clue of his status and launched into an impromptu hoe-down style of set with himself as the caller.</p> <p>I can't say that he took all of the 200 or so attendees out of their mental prisons but a significant number got into in it in a big way. He brought some joy into a place of intense misery. I was profoundly moved by his willingness to subsume his ego and his courage in choosing to play such a difficult gig.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17696719\">Heliconius</a></em></p>",
  "<p>In the neighbourhood over the fence from Italy's \u2013 and Europe's \u2013 biggest steelworks, Francesco Mastrocinque is poking his toe into the layer of black and red powder that covers every pavement and counting his friends who have died of cancer and respiratory illnesses.</p> <p>\"It's about one a month, but people round here try not to think about it,\" said the shopkeeper, as he looked up at the chimney towering over Taranto's Tamburi quarter \u2013 a dark, dusty corner of Puglia where residents are now forbidden by law from touching the soil.</p> <p>The Ilva steelworks, owned by Italy's Riva family, employs 12,000 and breathes life into the depressed local economy, but has long been accused of killing off local people by belching into the air a mix of minerals, metals and carcinogenic dioxins \u2013 8.8% of the total dioxins emitted in Europe, according to a 2005 study. More recent government figures put the cancer death rate in the area at 15% above the national average and lung cancer deaths at 30% higher. Prosecutors say emissions have killed 400 people in 13 years.</p> <p>So few were surprised when a magistrate this month ordered the shutdown of the most polluting furnaces, described Ilva as \"an environmental disaster\" and placed members of the Riva family under house arrest, claiming they were \"perfectly aware\" of what they were dumping on Taranto. A former employee was also put under investigation for allegedly paying off a government inspector to tone down a report.</p> <p>But what happened next was less expected. Unions went on strike to protest against the magistrate's decision, blocking roads with banners. \"Dioxin levels have been reduced and emissions can be cut further with new technology, without stopping production,\" said Rocco Palombella, secretary general of the UILM union. He has worked alongside the 1,300C furnaces at Ilva for 36 years without, he says, falling ill.</p> <p>The government then backed the unions, with the environment minister, Corrado Clini, saying it would take eight months for the furnaces to cool down, during which time Chinese competition would reap rewards. Bizarrely, Italy's health minister warned that losing your job was detrimental to your health.</p> <p>Clini, who met local leaders in Taranto on Friday, promised cash to clean up Ilva. He also said health studies do not reflect emission cuts already made. \"Clini is lying about this since the magistrate's report is based on studies concluded this year,\" said Angelo Bonelli, leader of the Green party in Italy. \"We know that mothers in Taranto today have three times the allowed level of dioxins in their milk.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394880419\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/17/1345221963775/Taranto-Italy-locator-001.png\" alt=\"Taranto, Italy locator\" width=\"220\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taranto, Italy locator Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a region known for baroque towns like Lecce and traditional Trullo cottages tucked into olive groves, Taranto is the exception. Its skyline is dominated by smoking chimneys and its old town is a half abandoned collection of bricked up and crumbling palazzi.</p> <p>Farmers were put out of business when grazing was banned within 20km (12.4 miles) of Ilva and almost 3,000 livestock with excessive dioxin levels were slaughtered. Mussel cultivation, for which Taranto is renowned, is struggling after beds were moved away from the steelworks.</p> <p>\"There isn't a family in Tamburi without a sick or dead member thanks to Ilva,\" said Rosella Balestra, a local activist. \"People ignored it for a long time but now, when I talk to them, tears often come. Slowly, a wall of self denial is coming down.\"</p> <p>Despite initial suspicion among mothers, Balestra began warning children playing in the piazzas not to touch flower beds after she discovered the council had done little to publicise its ban on contact with the polluted soil.</p> <p>Pollution is part of local life. Every day residents sweep their balconies clean of the red mineral dust blowing in from Ilva's mountainous deposits and the black soot from its chimneys, which regularly clog storm drains.</p> <p>\"The magistrates launched their inquiry here when politicians failed to do their duty, and now the politicians are attacking the magistrates for doing theirs,\" said Balestra.</p> <p>According to Patrizio Mazza, a doctor, the dust is killing young and old. \"I first noticed the increase when I treated a 10-year-old boy five years ago with throat cancer,\" he said. \"It is no good reducing emissions now because any new emissions at all simply top up the saturated earth and water. The furnaces must be shut down.\"</p> <p>A growing protest movement, which mounted a 2,000-strong march in Taranto on Friday, has found a champion in Cataldo Ranieri, a 42-year-old Ilva employee who initially backed management against the magistrates, blocking a road in protest in July. \"A man came up to me that day and said, 'My wife needs to get through to do her chemotherapy.' That changed my life.\"</p> <p>Mazza said rates of tumours among Ilva staff who were campaigning to keep the plant open was 10 times higher than the national average. \"Workers there just wanted to think about their work, not illness,\" said Vincenzo Pignatelli, 60, who worked near the furnaces for 29 years and survived leukaemia after retiring in 2002. \"Four colleagues in my group of about 100 died of leukaemia and I would see so many former colleagues during my trips to hospital it was like a works reunion.\"</p> <p>Bonelli shrugged off the government's view that the local \u2013 and national \u2013 economy would suffer if Ilva closed its most polluting furnaces, saying: \"Bilbao and Pittsburgh managed it thanks to investment, why not Taranto?\"</p> <p>In Tamburi, Francesco Mastrocinque watched as children kicked a football around on a dusty patch of earth, flouting the ban.</p> <p>\"The red mineral powder glitters in the gutters, but the black soot feels like fine sand when it gets into your mouth,\" he said. \"Ilva have paid for improvements in the neighbourhood, like putting fountains in the cemetery, but they didn't clean the tombstones, which are slowly turning black and red.\"</p>",
  "<p>The complicated and contentious issue of burying nuclear waste in Cumbria is heading for a milestone on 11 October when the three local councils which have expressed an interest meet to debate further involvement.</p> <p>A useful waymarker has now been published in full, based on the views of some 2,300 people and organisations whose submissions, while often very different and sometimes in direct conflict, have led to changes and hesitations, albeit not altering the general approach of cautiously making headway.</p> <p>The document was summarised on 19 July and you can read a precis of that <a href=\"http://www.westcumbriamrws.org.uk/news_more.asp?news_id=47\">here.</a> The full report has now gone up online and that is available<a href=\"http://www.westcumbriamrws.org.uk/documents/306-The_Partnership%27s_Final_Report_August_2012.pdf\"> here</a>. It is the work of the <a href=\"http://www.westcumbriamrws.org.uk/\">West Cumbria Managing Radioactive Waste Safely Partnership </a>which is made up of the councils - <a href=\"http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/\">Cumbria county</a> and<a href=\"http://www.allerdale.gov.uk\"> Allerdale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.copeland.gov.uk/\">Copeland</a> districts \u2013 and other groups including the National Farmers Union, the Lake District national park authority and representatives of all the parish councils potentially involved.</p> <p>Not surprisingly for someone whose colleagues have spent three years on the review, the chair of the partnership Coun Elaine Woodburn, Labour leader of Copeland since 2003, asks people to spend time reading and thinking about the full report. Events are also likely to move at a pace appropriate to a project which has a timeline so lengthy that all manner of unexpected developments could have an effect; the <a href=\"http://www.nda.gov.uk/\">Nuclear Decommissioning Authority</a> which is overseeing research into the pros and cons of burial, spoke last year of high level waste and spent fuels being buried 1000 metres deep from 2075 and spent fuel from as yet unbuilt nuclear reactors from 2130.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394854330\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345182818648/Woodburn.jpg\" alt=\"elaine woodburn\" width=\"140\" height=\"168\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coun Elaine Woodburn.

In simple terms, the long-standing debate in the area over balancing the risks of nuclear power with its economic benefits continues over this latest issue.</p> <p>More than a third of employed people in Copeland and ten percent of those in Allerdale work at Sellafield nuclear power complex.</p> <p>There is a mass of opinion and information already online, including an <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/Cumbria%20Managing%20Radioactive%20Waste%20Presentation%20220512.pdf\">Ipsos Mori poll </a>in May which found 53 percent of local people in favour of continuing geological research and 33 percent against, and the website of <a href=\"http://www.corecumbria.co.uk/\">Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment</a>.

  "<p>As far as sponsorship deals go you can file this one under the \"never saw that coming\" category. <a href=\"http://www.safc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Home/0,,10281,00.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Sunderland AFC</strong> football club</a> has struck a global deal with the <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/sailing/news/story?id=6300891\" title=\"\">South Korean America's Cup</a> sailing team. While the synergies between a sailing event being held in San Francisco later this month and a football team based in the north-east of England should be patently obvious, Monkey will explain further. According to the Black Cats' marketing chief Mike Farnan, who having worked at Manchester United is aiming to work a bit of global brand magic for his latest club, it is a \"cross-continental\" win-win with both sporting outfits \"successful challenger brands\". Sunderland AFC will appear on the side of the Team Korea boat, where it will be beamed to sailing (and Sunderland) fans around the world, while Team Korea will get \"messaging within the Stadium of Light throughout the football season\". Who said cats and water don't mix?</p>",
  "<p>Compared with what's going on in other people's courts, Britain's domestic judicial problems, our ghoulish fascination with the 50-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/17/moors-murderer-ian-brady-arrest\" title=\"\">Moors murders</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-asylum-uk-ecuador\" title=\"\">Julian Assange's extradition fight</a>, are relatively small beer. Across the former Soviet bloc and into nominally communist China we are witnessing dramatic battles to separate justice from politics.</p> <p>That fight is never over as disparate supporters of the WikiLeaks founder and countless other self-styled politicals have insisted down the years, sometimes rightly. Tony Blair felt persecuted by the Metropolitan police even in Downing Street, and this month Standard Chartered bank felt ill-used by what it sees as quasi-political regulatory threats in New York.</p> <p>But the principle that judges should be independent \u2013 \"as long as they behave themselves\" \u2013 was entrenched in English statute law as long ago as 1702. \"Be ye ever so mighty, the law is above you\", as someone put it a few years later. That precept should protect Assange from the wrath of the White House, though it has mostly failed over Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>The rules are not so secure in China or Russia; shaky, too, in not-so-different cases which mingle politics and the courtroom in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine \u2013 all former Soviet satellites and neighbours, three of them EU members, all struggling to establish proper boundaries or (it depends who's talking) to undermine them.</p> <p>They command fewer headlines than Gu Kailai, confessed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/09/gu-kailai-murder-trial-neil-heywood\" title=\"\">murderer</a> of Neil Heywood in a Chinese hotel room, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/16/pussy-riot-putin-russia-court-verdict\" title=\"\">Moscow's punk band trio</a>, but are hugely important to their citizens, who question whether we can rely on the law to protect us from the powerful?</p> <p>Is it a gloomy no-win situation? Of course not. Greater transparency is always painful and can mislead people into thinking things are getting worse, because crimes or scandals are being exposed when previously they were covered up.</p> <p>So the glamorous Pussy Riot defenders are surely wrong historically when they say their trial for anti-Putin \"hooliganism\" in a cathedral is a Stalinist show trial. Under Stalin most such trials took place in secrecy, unbeknown to foreign correspondents working a few streets away, imperious to criticism or rebuttal.</p> <p>Pussy Riot are on much stronger ground when they assert that \u2013 despite today's inevitable guilty verdict \u2013 they have beaten the politically manipulated judicial machine by the force of their arguments and their personalities.</p> <p>\"Now the whole world sees that the criminal case against us has been fabricated,\" they asserted in court. It has all happened in public \u2013 too hard to hide in the wired world of today \u2013 and a host of global rock royalty whom Vladimir Putin cannot harm is on their side. It might be prudent for Madonna and Macca to check their tea for polonium, all the same, because Russia seems to be slipping back into lawless ways which will do it no good.</p> <p>Is China inching slowly in the opposite direction? Whatever has been going on in the closed-but-not-quite-secret Hefei intermediate people's court in China these past few weeks \u2013 the trial of disgraced politician Bo Xilai's wife for murder \u2013 it is all but impossible to establish at this time and distance what the real story is. In terms of the facts of the case and its wider meaning for the political direction of China there is only speculation. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/17/gu-kailai-verdict-monday\" title=\"\">official verdict</a> is expected next week.</p> <p>Was the Harrow-educated expat and middleman facilitator, Heywood, a greedy blackmailer, who threatened Gu's only son (he had earlier helped get him into Harrow) when a lucrative business deal went wrong, as the official narrative states. Or was he someone disposed of because he threatened to expose high-level corruption? Would the case have come to court at all \u2013 the British embassy did not over-exert itself after Heywood was found dead of a \"heart attack\" \u2013 had not Wang Lijun, the local police chief, taken Assange-style refuge in a US consulate, claiming his life was at risk as a whistleblower?</p> <p>And is the decision to prosecute Gu in this high-profile way simply a byproduct of high politics and the urgent need to kill off the challenge to the Beijing leadership of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Xilai\" title=\"\">Mr Gu, aka Bo Xilai</a>, the ambitious mega-city boss in Chongqing and Mao-era revivalist, who had been using populist policies (curbing mafia gangs and promoting equality) to advance his claims for promotion to the politburo's standing committee?</p> <p>Bo's name has not been mentioned in court, but it is corruption charges he faces, not promotion, if it suits the party to press home its advantage. A handful of Maoist supporters are reported to have been demonstrating outside the court (do they have public school leftists in China now?), which may tell us more about the authorities' wish to have their notoriously opaque legal system look \" normal\" to outsiders than anything else. British diplomats, but no reporters, have been allowed in.</p> <p>So the Chinese trial is more akin to the running dramas in Ukraine \u2013 where jailed former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, faces fresh charges of corruption and even complicity in murder \u2013 and in Romania's standoff between the conservative president, ex-oil-tanker captain, Traian Basescu, and the young (39) prime minister, Victor Ponta, a Blair-ish moderniser in a country where that label is not a stigma.</p> <p>As in Hungary, where the reforming prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has frightened a lot of voters with his sweeping constitutional reforms (Paul Krugman calls it an \"<a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/hungarys-constitutional-revolution/\" title=\"\">authoritarian slide</a>\" in the New York Times) since 2010, and neighbouring Bulgaria, where there is a crisis of authority in the court system, the EU has leverage here because all three are members, though not of the single currency zone.</p> <p>Each case is different. Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party won a 68% mandate from voters in 2010 and used to make what were widely seen as extreme changes to the system, most notably by rigging the constitutional court, packing its membership, making it harder to bring cases and excluding a host of legislation from its remit. When we consider that reform of the eurozone will stand or fall on the ruling \u2013 is it legal? \u2013 of the German constitutional court the comparison is painful. Media control and rigged elections are also on the Hungarian menu.</p> <p>In Bulgaria a judge was dismissed for <a href=\"http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=141237\" title=\"\">unreasonable delays in court proceedings</a>, though actually for criticising the supreme court and the interior minister, critics say. The EU is on the case here too. But all this takes place at a time when the credit-fuelled boom years are over (sounds familiar?) and the former eastern bloc states are under pressure \u2013 also from the EU \u2013 to retrench economically and get their budgets under control.</p> <p>Times are hard and feelings run high. So in Romania, still under the shadow of the brutal and stupid Ceausescu regime, which ended in a hail of bullets in 1989, the standoff between Basescu and Ponta is also about a pro-austerity president whose party lost power after cuts in 2009 and a pro-growth social democrat who says the president should be politically neutral.</p> <p>The EU has been pressing for reform on Romania's notoriously corrupt politics since long before the country was allowed to join Nato in 2004 and the EU in 2007. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/29/romanians-unlikely-impeach-president-traian-basescu\" title=\"\">referendum to depose Basescu</a> was overwhelmingly carried by austerity-weary voters in July, but the supreme court has to rule on 31 August whether the necessary 50% of the electorate took part to validate it.</p> <p>Basescu's supporters say he is a genuine reformer who has backed the national anti-corruption department, which is why so many of the political elite want him out. The former prime minister Adrian Nastase, Ponta's mentor, has been jailed for corruption. In London this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/victor-ponta-romania-president-impeachment\" title=\"\">Ponta told the Guardian's Julian Borger</a> the worst was over and the pair might yet \"cohabit\" if Basescu behaves.</p> <p>Tricky, isn't it? In countries which for the most part lack settled traditions of respect for courts and constitutions, both sides stand accused of manipulating the system for political gain. It is a huge distraction from urgent economic tasks and threatens to deepen voter disillusion. Even in seemingly all-powerful Beijing, party bosses know ordinary Chinese are angry with elite corruption and the frailty of its justice.</p> <p>But the outside world knows more about these proceedings than we would have done in past times. That's progress. Our legal battles nearer home show there is no room to be smug \u2013 but also that we are luckier than we sometimes remember to remember. The rule of law is the anchor for most of what we have.</p>",

Lonmin, the world's third biggest platinum producer, was forced to suspend production at the mine, about 60 miles north-west of Johannesburg, after what it called an illegal strike escalated into an alleged turf war between rival unions.</p> <p>His voice shaking with anger, the union leader Joseph Mathunjwa on Thursday accused the Lonmin management of colluding with a rival union to orchestrate what he described as a massacre. Mathunjwa, president of the militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), told the eNews channel: \"We have to send condolences to those families whose members were brutally murdered by a lack of co-operation from management. We have done our bit. If the management had changed their commitment, surely lives could have been saved.\"</p> <p>Zuma, speaking on Thursday, condemned the killings but made no reference to the handling of the situation by the police. \"We are shocked and dismayed at this senseless violence,\" he said. \"We believe there is enough space in our democratic order for any dispute to be resolved through dialogue without any breaches of the law or violence.\"</p> <p>The opposition called for an independent investigation. Helen Zille, leader of the Democratic Alliance, said: \"We call on union leaders, the police and everyone else involved to immediately work towards a de-escalation of the conflict. All action must be taken to avoid further bloodshed.</p> <p>\"An urgent independent investigation is required to determine exactly what happened; and who is responsible for this massacre. The families of everyone involved, and indeed the nation, deserve to know how and why this bloodshed occurred.\"</p> <p>Roger Phillimore, the chairman of Lonmin, said: \"The South African police service have been in charge of public order and safety on the ground since the violence between competing labour factions erupted over the weekend, claiming the lives of eight of our employees and two police officers.</p> <p>\"It goes without saying that we deeply regret the further loss of life in what is clearly a public order rather than labour relations-associated matter.\"</p> <p>The violence reportedly flared when police laying out barricades of barbed wire were outflanked by some of an estimated 3,000 miners massed on a rocky outcrop near the mine. Witnesses claimed that some of the miners were armed with pistols and fired first, while also charging the police with machetes and sticks.</p> <p>The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said: \"According to a Sapa [South African Press Association] report, police tried to disperse striking workers gathered on top of a hill, wielding pangas and chanting war songs. It ended in a three-minute shootout between the two groups, after police fired teargas and then used a water cannon to disperse the strikers, who retaliated by firing live ammunition at the police.\"</p> <p>The protests began last week when workers demanded a pay increase to 12,500 rand (\u00a3976) a month. The action turned deadly when the AMCU clashed with South Africa's dominant National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).</p> <p>The NUM rejected the charge of collusion with mine bosses. Spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said: \"We are not surprised by his allegation \u2026 It is not true. Everyone can see through these lies.\"</p> <p>Seshoka blamed the AMCU \u2013 which has been poaching NUM members in platinum mines \u2013 for instigating the bloodshed. \"These people said today they want to die on the hilltop. They said they will bring their children to die there. That is why we say the ringleaders must be arrested.\"</p> <p>There has been growing frustration with the governing African National Congress and its mainstream union allies for moving too slowly to deliver wage increases and public services. Radical and militant voices are making gains in some areas.</p> <p>Patrick Craven, the national spokesman for Cosatu, which is aligned with the ANC, said it would \"convene an urgent meeting of the unions' leaderships to discuss what is emerging as a co-ordinated political strategy to use intimidation and violence, manipulated by disgruntled former union leaders, in a concerted drive to create breakaway 'unions' and divide and weaken the trade union movement\".</p> <p>He added: \"Cosatu calls upon all workers to remain vigilant but calm in the face of the most serious challenge to workers' unity and strength for many years.\"</p> <p>South Africa is home to four-fifths of the world's known platinum reserves but has been hit by union militancy and a sharp drop in the price of the precious metal this year. At least three people were killed in fighting in January that led to a six-week closure of the world's biggest platinum mine, run by Impala Platinum. Such incidents are seen as tarnishing South Africa's reputation among investors.</p> <p>This week's violence has forced Lonmin to freeze production at all its South African operations, which account for 12% of global platinum output. The company's London-listed shares fell more than 7% on Thursday. A spokesman at Lonmin's head office in London confirmed strikers had been served with an ultimatum to return to work on Thursday or face dismissal, but denied that might inflame the situation.</p> <p>\"The mine cannot operate without the rock drill operators,\" he said. \"The company tried every avenue it could to negotiate a settlement and we were left with no option.\"</p>",

To them the city is the centre of the universe, the \"capital of the world\" and the Times stands at its heart, soaring above the midtown roil. The Grey Lady, which seems a particularly inappropriate moniker for a rather masculine organisation. For an outsider to be allowed into the upper echelons of the establishment has caused some consternation and some relief. For the outsider to come from what <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-15/is-mark-thompson-what-the-nyt-needs-now\" title=\"\">the US media persistently and incorrectly describes as a \"government-funded broadcaster\"</a> has provoked more than a hint of incredulity.</p> <p>Thompson's job, at the New York Times, to put it bluntly, is to find the right strategy and revenue to serve a grandiose digital global vision for a newspaper organisation which is melting, iceberg-like, under his feet.</p> <p>In fairness the Times is evaporating at a slower rate than many competitors, it has $850m cash in the bank, but the figures speak for themselves. From profits of $300m a year a decade ago, the Times recorded losses of $40m last year. It has seen new revenue, reportedly about $100m, from a clever digital subscription plan, but also declines in digital advertising, when the general trend in the market has been upwards.</p> <p>Overall revenues of $2.3bn are down by almost $1 bn on a decade ago. Its journalism and digital implementation of new technologies is among the best in the world, but good journalism is no longer a guarantee of a solid future. Another 10 years like that will see the Times effectively out of business.</p> <p>The clear mismatch in the Times needs and Thompson's skills is in the area of revenue generation and investor management. His predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/dec/16/new-york-times-janet-robinson-step-down?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Janet Robinson</a>, might not have had the universal admiration of the editorial floor, but was generally acknowledged as being highly skilled when it came to dealing with both advertisers and the Sulzberger-Ochs family who own the Times. Madison Avenue and Wall Street (or indeed round the corner in midtown where most investment banks now operate) are not friendly places for news executives at the moment, and Thompson will need quick feet and thick skin to deal with them.</p> <p>On the plus side, one of the stumbling blocks for the Times in finding a chief executive has been appealing to commercial managers and former chief executives from Silicon Valley who will accept an eccentric reporting structure. The chief executive does not have the direct report of the editor, Jill Abramson, who instead reports to Arthur Sulzberger, the publisher and owner. The CEO therefore must operate in a strange triangulated relationship.</p> <p>Thompson's experience of working between BBC governors/trustees, licence fee payers and government is a better preparation for this than it might first appear. Abramson, the editor, might initially feel unease at a senior news journalist landing in her territory, but again, the BBC is a good training for letting department heads get on with their jobs.</p> <p>Seen as a British media intellectual, with an American wife and with two children now at university in the US, Thompson stands a better chance than many of being absorbed into the elitist culture of the New York Times. What he might not be prepared for is the soaring building full of smart people who all look to him to provide answers and vision. Answers on new revenue, vision on extending the Times into a multiplatform digital operation. This is a story which many think has no happy ending, and a task which is certainly greater than one person.</p>",
  "<p>Local authorities are increasingly interested in the potential for investments in energy efficiency and demand reduction to provide significant savings in energy costs, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and wider economic and social benefits. A number have started to take action at scale on the low carbon agenda; examples include Birmingham City Council's intention to <a href=\"http://www.hvnplus.co.uk/news/birmingham-council-plans-13bn-of-green-deal-work/8616969.article\" title=\"\">refurbish 200,000 properties by 2026</a> and Leeds City Region's commissioning of an assessment of the costs and benefits of taking action on climate change.</p> <p>As yet, however, investments in low carbon cities fall short of their theoretical potential. A key reason for this is the scale of capital required. For example, for Leeds to finance all of its available investments in energy demand reduction, billions of pounds would be required - a level that dwarfs the amounts of investment being proposed by initiatives like the Green Deal.</p> <p>At the same time, institutional investors (pension funds, investment managers, insurance companies) are increasingly interested in infrastructure investment opportunities and have identified energy efficiency and low-carbon infrastructure as potentially attractive areas.</p> <p>Given the interest from local authorities in making these investments, and the interest from private sources of capital to provide the funds, what is needed to make this happen? Discussions with both sectors reveal a number of common themes:</p> <p><strong>Build portfolios that satisfy investor's demands on risks and returns</strong></p> <p>In terms of the financial characteristics of a project, institutional investors look for different rates of return depending on how risky they perceive a particular investment to be. Whether a project is deemed high risk requiring returns of 10-15%, or low-risk where the level of acceptable return will be significantly lower, it is possible to build portfolios of opportunities that will satisfy investor's demands on risks and returns.</p> <p><strong>Balancing reductions with investment returns</strong></p> <p>Although low carbon investment opportunities can offer high rates of return, by only focusing on the best options from a financial perspective, investor's choices can mean that projects that offer the most potential to increase energy efficiency or reduce greenhouse gas emissions become less investable. It is therefore important that attention is paid to the mix of investments contained within a portfolio to ensure that the level of savings or reductions achieved is maximised.</p> <p><strong>Develop a project pipeline</strong></p> <p>In terms of the availability of projects, investors expect a pipeline of opportunities. This is because they do not want to see their capital sitting idle when it could be invested elsewhere. Actions local authorities can take to address this problem include putting some of their own assets into the mix or mandating energy saving or low carbon technologies. Irrespective of the approach taken, the development of a large scale project pipeline needs to occur in parallel to the development of financing models and the raising of finance.</p> <p><strong>Pilot projects play a key role</strong></p> <p>In terms of how investor's perceive the financial characteristics of low carbon investments, pilot projects play a key role in providing evidence to address concerns, especially in relation to projects that are subject to significant technical and policy risks.</p> <p>The central conclusion is that local authorities and the private sector need to understand the other's views on finance-related risk. Local authorities must engage with investors to understand what sort of investment vehicles they are interested in, the returns they would expect, the level of risk that is acceptable and the role local authorities can play in addressing their concerns. Investors need to engage with local authorities to understand the real risks associated with investments and the actions that can be taken to mitigate these risks.</p> <p>Finally, there is a potentially interesting role for local authority pension funds, many of whom already have significant investments in infrastructure. While they are unlikely to invest in projects within their own region, they may, for example, be able to invest in a UK-wide low-carbon cities bond. These funds could be the catalyst to making low carbon cities a reality.</p> <p><em>This article is based on a report </em><a href=\"http://www.lowcarbonfutures.org/assets/media/Funding%20Low%20Carbon%20Cities%20v6.pdf\" title=\"\"><em>Funding Low Carbon Cities: Mapping the Risks and Opportunities</em></a><em> published by the Centre for Low Carbon Futures and the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy.</em></p> <p><em>Dr Rory Sullivan is a senior research fellow at the University of Leeds and strategic adviser, Ethix SRI Advisers. </em></p> <p><em>Andy Gouldson is director of the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the University of Leeds, and he sits on the Expert Advisory Panel for Social Sciences for DECC and DEFRA. </em></p> <p><em>Philip Webber is a visiting professor at the University of Leeds and a non-executive Director of Yorkshire Energy Services CIC.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Playing SimCity used to be rather an isolating endeavour, enjoyed alone in vast stints of town planning and disaster management. But the idea of fans beavering away alone on their virtual cityscapes is an unattractive one in our socially connected era. EA wants to bring us together. So like Need For Speed and Battlefield before it, the latest incarnation of the game is getting a social layer \u2013 and it does sound rather intriguing. </p> <p>At its pre-Gamescom press briefing on Tueday evening, EA announced SimCity World, a whole suite of online connectivity features. While building their own towns, players will get to check a City Log showing the progress of any friends also playing the game. A news feed on the menu screen shows when pals have, say, founded a new region or perhaps completed a major building project, and all of these messages are interactive, so you can compare the progress made by friends with your own ambitions.</p> <p>On top of this, there will be regular challenges for the whole SimCity community. Some are collaborative, inviting players to work together to create one million jhobs in their respective games within a set period of time. Other tasks are competitive, with players challanged to get their own cities to one million inhabitants before all the others. </p> <p>Most intriguingly though, all cities will be linked via a global financial exchange which will see prices of key in-game resources like oil and food fluctuate with real demand. So if everyone in SimCity is building oil refineries, then demand drops and the price goes down. The ramifications will be profound, forcing players to think as part of a world market rather than as an isolated city state. It's fascinating stuff. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zD0nyi0S27Y?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zD0nyi0S27Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It will also be interesting to see how this affects the game's concept of regions, in which friends can connect with several other cities online, forming an interdependent co-operative. Cities within regions can share workers, power and other resources, as well as work on major group projects, like creating airports, which help the local economies. While SimCity used to be great at teaching us about how individual cities operate and flourish, it looks like the newest version of the game will show us how all urban centres around the world actually co-exist together in symbiosis. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the game looks lovely. A short hands-on session at Gamescom showed off the beautiful, slightly stylised visuals, the camera seamlessly swooping in and out on the action with simple mouse moves and button presses. Every where you look there are visual representations of how the city is fairing, from smiling faces hovering over houses, to crowds protesting outside city hall. The new GlassBox simulation engine also makes it easy to open up data layers. After I built a sewage plant, for example, the effectiveness of my new system is shown via images of poo flowing down the city streets. Lovely. </p> <p>Having the ability to zoom in right to street level and see the individual sims going about their business is a real treat. Using the building tools is as intuitive as ever, with the ability to add curved roads possibly leading to more imaginative designs \u2013 though I struggled at times getting my gridded and curved roads to meet neatly. I'm sure I'll get a heck of a lot more practise.</p> <p>The announcement of a Mac version, available via Origin, is good news \u2013 except for those gamers who remain skeptical about, and resiliant to, EA's alternative to third-party digital game services like Steam. But really, the key thing here is that SimCity has been re-thought for a more connected generation without junking any of its old depth or charm. Our demo ends with a massive meteor storm, blasting chunks out of my carefully structure residental zones and commercial areas. Although respectful of the past, Maxis, like SimCity itself, isn't afraid of dramatic change.<br><em><br>SimCity is out in February 2013 on PC and Mac.</em></p>",
  "<p>Below the jump, I mention the books that I received recently in the mail. These are the books that I may review in more depth later, either here or in print somewhere in the world. </p> <p> </p> <p>When I get new books, I like to share them with people. Unfortunately, you are all so far away, so I cannot host a book party in my crib where you can look over these books, so I'll do the next best thing. I'll host a book party on my blog each Friday of the week when books arrive by giving you my quick \"first impression\" of them along with relevant links so you can get a copy of the book if you wish. </p> <h2>Books that arrived this week:</h2> <p> Physiological Adaptations for Breeding in Birds by Tony D. Williams [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691139821\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691139822/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007BOK00S/livithescieli-21/\">kindle</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691139822/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007BOK00S/livingthescie-20/\">kindle</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Physiological Adaptations for Breeding in Birds is the most current and comprehensive account of research on avian reproduction. It develops two unique themes: the consideration of female avian reproductive physiology and ecology, and an emphasis on individual variation in life-history traits. Tony Williams investigates the physiological, metabolic, energetic, and hormonal mechanisms that underpin individual variation in the key female-specific reproductive traits and the trade-offs between these traits that determine variation in fitness.<br>The core of the book deals with the avian reproductive cycle, from seasonal gonadal development, through egg laying and incubation, to chick rearing. Reproduction is considered in the context of the annual cycle and through an individual's entire life history. The book focuses on timing of breeding, clutch size, egg size and egg quality, and parental care. It also provides a primer on female reproductive physiology and considers trade-offs and carryover effects between reproduction and other life-history stages. In each chapter, Williams describes individual variation in the trait of interest and the evolutionary context for trait variation. He argues that there is only a rudimentary, and in some cases nonexistent, understanding of the physiological mechanisms that underpin individual variation in the major reproductive life-history traits, and that research efforts should refocus on these key unresolved problems by incorporating detailed physiological studies into existing long-term population studies, generating a new synthesis of physiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology.<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> The topic of this book was the topic of my dissertation, so when I saw it, I was determined to get my hands on it as soon as possible. But my friends at PUP are looking out for me: the book arrived a few days ago without me having to email them, pleading for a copy of this title. And what a delight it is! This is such a beautiful book: each chapter presents and reviews research data in easy-to-read language and -- my favourite feature -- each chapter ends by asking a series of future research questions. Seriously; how wonderful is that? Birders and serious aviculturists will learn much from this book, but I think that ornithologists and especially grad students and postdocs will be inspired by this lovely book. But its appeal doesn't end there: even my statistician spouse, who studies climate change, is determined to wrest this book from me. </p> <p> How to Build a Habitable Planet: The Story of Earth from the Big Bang to Humankind (Revised and Expanded Edition) by Charles H. Langmuir and Wally Broecker [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691140063\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691140065/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691140065/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Since its first publication more than twenty-five years ago, How to Build a Habitable Planet has established a legendary reputation as an accessible yet scientifically impeccable introduction to the origin and evolution of Earth, from the Big Bang through the rise of human civilization. This classic account of how our habitable planet was assembled from the stuff of stars introduced readers to planetary, Earth, and climate science by way of a fascinating narrative. Now this great book has been made even better. Harvard geochemist Charles Langmuir has worked closely with the original author, Wally Broecker, one of the world's leading Earth scientists, to revise and expand the book for a new generation of readers for whom active planetary stewardship is becoming imperative.<br>Interweaving physics, astronomy, chemistry, geology, and biology, this sweeping account tells Earth's complete story, from the synthesis of chemical elements in stars, to the formation of the Solar System, to the evolution of a habitable climate on Earth, to the origin of life and humankind. The book also addresses the search for other habitable worlds in the Milky Way and contemplates whether Earth will remain habitable as our influence on global climate grows. It concludes by considering the ways in which humankind can sustain Earth's habitability and perhaps even participate in further planetary evolution.<br>Like no other book, How to Build a Habitable Planet provides an understanding of Earth in its broadest context, as well as a greater appreciation of its possibly rare ability to sustain life over geologic time.<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> This book is a monster. More than 700 pages long, it has 21 chapters that deal with a variety of important topics from the Big Bang, the formation of organic and inorganic molecules, formation of the Earth, plate tectonics, the coevolution of life and our planet, weather and climate change, the rise of humans and the question of habitability in the universe. This book is a very complete and thorough reference work, where individual chapters can provide an excellent working background for those who want to learn the fundamentals associated with a particular topic before launching into a more in-depth study of some aspect of that field. It's filled with data, diagrammes and photographs, it has a glossary and index, and each chapter has a list of useful supplementary readings. </p> <p> Higgs: The invention and discovery of the 'God Particle' by Jim Baggott [Oxford University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199603499/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008L0EF2U/livithescieli-21/\">kindle</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199603499/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008L0EF2U/livingthescie-20/\">kindle</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> The hunt for the Higgs particle has involved the biggest, most expensive experiment ever. So exactly what is this particle? Why does it matter so much? What does it tell us about the Universe? Has the discovery announced on 4 July 2012 finished the search? And was finding it really worth all the effort? The short answer is yes. The Higgs field is proposed as the way in which particles gain mass -- a fundamental property of matter. It's the strongest indicator yet that the Standard Model of physics really does reflect the basic building blocks of our Universe. Little wonder the hunt and discovery of this new particle has produced such intense media interest. Here, Jim Baggott explains the science behind the discovery, looking at how the concept of a Higgs field was invented, how the vast experiment was carried out, and its implications on our understanding of all mass in the Universe. The book was written over the eighteen months of the CERN Large Hadron Collider experiment, with its final chapter rounded off on the day of the announcement 'that a particle consistent with the standard model Higgs boson has been discovered.'<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> This is the uncorrected proofs of a book that is not scheduled to be released until (probably) September 2012, so it really isn't fair to say much about my impression of this book. However, the grand theme of this book is an exploration of the Higgs Boson -- its recent discovery and the evidence that we discovered it, how this particle's existence was predicted and what are the implications of this discovery. Several chapters have already been formally reviewed by the media and more reviews of this book -- from the uncorrected proofs -- are appearing every day. Written by a former university physics lecturer who now is a freelance science writer, this timely book promises to be interesting and educational. </p> <p> Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America by Martin Gilens [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691153971\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691153973/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008AU9LZM/livithescieli-21/\">kindle</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691153973/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008AU9LZM/livingthescie-20/\">kindle</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Can a country be a democracy if its government only responds to the preferences of the rich? In an ideal democracy, all citizens should have equal influence on government policy -- but as this book demonstrates, America's policymakers respond almost exclusively to the preferences of the economically advantaged. Affluence and Influence definitively explores how political inequality in the United States has evolved over the last several decades and how this growing disparity has been shaped by interest groups, parties, and elections.<br>With sharp analysis and an impressive range of data, Martin Gilens looks at thousands of proposed policy changes, and the degree of support for each among poor, middle-class, and affluent Americans. His findings are staggering: when preferences of low- or middle-income Americans diverge from those of the affluent, there is virtually no relationship between policy outcomes and the desires of less advantaged groups. In contrast, affluent Americans' preferences exhibit a substantial relationship with policy outcomes whether their preferences are shared by lower-income groups or not. Gilens shows that representational inequality is spread widely across different policy domains and time periods. Yet Gilens also shows that under specific circumstances the preferences of the middle class and, to a lesser extent, the poor, do seem to matter. In particular, impending elections -- especially presidential elections -- and an even partisan division in Congress mitigate representational inequality and boost responsiveness to the preferences of the broader public.<br>At a time when economic and political inequality in the United States only continues to rise, Affluence and Influence raises important questions about whether American democracy is truly responding to the needs of all its citizens.<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> Anyone who follows me on twitter knows that my experience of America is of a nation out of balance, of a country where the wealthy achieve their goals by exploiting and trampling the poor and working class. This leaves most Americans' experiences far removed from the bold delusion of the \"American dream\". This book asks the important question, \"is American democracy truly responding to everyone's needs?\" by examining what Americans want their government to do and what it actually does do. This compelling book is guaranteed to inspire jumping up-and-down outrage. </p> <p> Through the Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West, 350-550 AD by Peter Brown [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691152905\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115290X/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115290X/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Jesus taught his followers that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. Yet by the time of the fall of Rome, the church was becoming rich beyond measure. Through the Eye of a Needle is a sweeping intellectual and social history of the vexing problem of wealth in Christianity in the waning days of the Roman Empire, written by the world's foremost scholar of late antiquity.<br>Peter Brown examines the rise of the church through the lens of money and the challenges it posed to an institution that espoused the virtue of poverty and called avarice the root of all evil. Drawing on the writings of major Christian thinkers such as Augustine, Ambrose, and Jerome, Brown examines the controversies and changing attitudes toward money caused by the influx of new wealth into church coffers, and describes the spectacular acts of divestment by rich donors and their growing influence in an empire beset with crisis. He shows how the use of wealth for the care of the poor competed with older forms of philanthropy deeply rooted in the Roman world, and sheds light on the ordinary people who gave away their money in hopes of treasure in heaven.<br>Through the Eye of a Needle challenges the widely held notion that Christianity's growing wealth sapped Rome of its ability to resist the barbarian invasions, and offers a fresh perspective on the social history of the church in late antiquity.<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> One of the subject areas that I read extensively about is the world's religions, particularly their histories and philosophies. I opened this book randomly to read chapter 4, \"Wealth in the Christian Church\" and found this chapter to be carefully written, heavily referenced and meticulously researched. This book describes the growing relationship between wealth and christianity, and whether this had any impact upon the fall of the Roman Empire. At more than 800 pages long, this book will certainly inspire readers to sink their teeth deeply into this topic. </p> <p>What book(s) are you reading? How far are you along in the book?

In the search for an answer, I did not expect a repressive and inquisition-like reaction.\"</p> <p>Their lawyers called the court hearings worse than a Soviet-era show trial, although the consequences are likely to be less grave.</p> <p>In a move widely seen as a signal to the court, Vladimir Putin said last week he thought the women should not be judged \"too severely\".</p> <p>Pussy Riot formed as an anonymous feminist punk collective in October 2010, in the weeks after Putin's declaration that he would return to the presidency after four years as prime minister. He had stepped down because the constitution did not allow more than two consecutive terms as president. His formal return, although expected, sent a wave of anger through segments of Russian society. Some began to refer to him as Tsar; others used the word \"authoritarian\".</p> <p>The women of Pussy Riot, students and graduates of some of Moscow's most prestigious schools, were among that number.</p> <p>\"A lot of us couldn't sleep after this announcement,\" a member of the band, who identified herself as Tyurya, told the Guardian during a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/02/pussy-riot-protest-russia\" title=\"\">rare interview</a> early this year. \"We felt such anger because of this rudeness, this arrogance towards citizens. So we decided, damn it, we need to do something.\"</p> <p>They looked at their influences \u2013 the Riot grrrl movement, punk rock, feminist thinkers such as Judith Butler and philosophers including Michel Foucault \u2013 and the form of protest became clear. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, along with her husband, Pyotr Verzilov, was a longtime member of Voina, a radical art collective that shot to global notoriety after holding a protest orgy in a Moscow museum and painting a massive phallus on a drawbridge across from the headquarters of the FSB security services in St Petersburg.</p> <p>\"Art is politics,\" said Tolokonnikova when asked in January if Pussy Riot considered themselves protesters or artists. \"We couldn't imagine ourselves without one or the other. We don't understand how an artist can think about society but say he's apolitical.\"</p> <p>They began gathering at the flat Yekaterina Samutsevich shared with her 73-year-old father, Stanislav, who attended every court hearing and was called to testify for the prosecution during the case against he daughter, whom he affectionately calls Katya. \"At the end of last year, the girls began to gather at our home \u2013 they put some dresses together, drew something, talked,\" he told the court. \"Katya didn't tell me what they were up to. I had no idea what it would lead to.\"</p> <p>What it led to was the most radical form of protest Russia has seen since demonstrators began taking to the streets in December to decry Putin's leadership. Pussy Riot carried out lightning punk performances around Moscow, shouting and stomping often until they were dragged away by police. Raw guitar was added to video clips later, creating a multimedia message that spread across the internet. Most shocking was their look \u2013 brightly coloured dresses and stockings accompanied by menacing balaclavas to ensure anonymity.</p> <p>\"Our anonymity and visual look aren't common for female bands,\" Tyurya told the Guardian. \"Even though we wear dresses, we make \"unfeminine\" movements. It's a multilevel way of breaking with traditional feminine behaviour.\"</p> <p>They began by performing in the metro, still considered a strategic site under Russian law, and were once detained but quickly released.</p> <p>Then came performances on posh Moscow streets and the roofs of city buses. When opposition leader <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2012/jan/15/alexei-navalny-profile-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">Alexei Navalny</a> was arrested at Russia's first big protest on 5 December and sentenced to 15 days in jail, they performed outside his cell. Their notoriety was sealed in January when eight members of the band took to a platform on Red Square calling for \"revolt in Russia\" and that \"Putin has pissed himself\" with fear.</p> <p>On 21 February four members of the band walked into the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, a gaudy building built after the Soviet collapse that hosts Russia's senior officials on major holidays. They thought they were highlighting the church's increasingly close relationship with the state and what they saw as campaigning for Putin by Patriarch Kirill, its leader.</p> <p>\"Our goal was to bring attention to Father Kirill's public statements that the Orthodox must vote for Putin,\" Alyokhina told the court.</p> <p>Video of the stunt went viral and launched a passionate discussion about the church's collaboration with Putin. State-run media decried the performance. Two weeks later, the women were arrested.</p> <p>\"I thought the church loved its children,\" Alyokhina's statement read. \"It turns out the church only loves those children who believe in Putin.\"</p> <p>All eyes were on the trial as the prosecution and its witnesses argued that the women were doing the devil's work, that their bright clothes were an insult to prayer, that they were motivated by a deep hatred of all Orthodox Christians rather than by anger at the Putin regime. Church representatives argued the trial was the work of God.</p> <p>Repeatedly denied the right to call witnesses, to make objections and, sometimes, even to speak, the defence also through protocol out the window and resorted to shouts and insults. It descended into a kangaroo court.</p> <p>Meanwhile the attention of global artists began to build, from Franz Ferdinand to Stephen Fry to Madonna. Pussy Riot chapters were launched throughout the world, imitation performances, balaclavas and all, carried out everywhere from Paris to Helsinki. All this for a band that has yet to release an album.</p> <p>\"For all the radicalism of their actions, Pussy Riot are basically a pop crossover,\" said Michael Idov, the editor of Russian GQ. \"They are a brilliant brand \u2013 they have a very compelling story and easily reproducible look and, let's face it, a great band name.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Royal Tandoori</h2> <p>There is plenty of proper cooking going on at the Royal. Dishes are fresh, its curries properly differentiated, flavours are distinct and full-bodied.

  "<p>The inaugural Rugby Championship starts on Saturday with the organisers trumpeting that the tournament is, outside the World Cup, the ultimate test in rugby.</p> <p>A recent report into the sport's finances showed how the game in the north was far more lucrative than that in the south: bigger sponsorship and television deals and larger crowds. The Six Nations can claim to be the oldest and most popular annual tournament in the world but the southern hemisphere is laying claim to the quality title.</p> <p>\"The Rugby Championship is an annual contest between the best-of-the-best in world rugby,\" said Greg Peters, the Sanzar chief executive, pointing out that the four participants are ranked first, second, fourth and seventh in the world. \"It involves nations who have won six of the seven World Cups, while Argentina will offer a new dimension, playing an exciting and different brand of rugby to the other three teams.\"</p> <p>Different to New Zealand and Australia but the Pumas share with South Africa a penchant for more traditional aspects of the game: the rolling maul remains a thing of beauty in Tucum\u00e1n and beyond; their heroes are rough hewn rather than sculpted.</p> <p>Their first match is, fittingly, against South Africa in Cape Town on Saturday afternoon, a few hours after the battle between Australia and New Zealand in Sydney. The pace of the second is unlikely to threaten that of the first and of the old Tri-Nations teams, South Africa were the least impressive in their summer series against Six Nations opposition.</p> <p>They were under a new coach, Heyneke Meyer, and they did have injury problems, but the functional way Morne Steyn operates at outside-half leaves Bryan Habana an extra for the most part. In contrast, New Zealand and Australia play with width and the manner in which the All Blacks destroyed Ireland in the opening half of the third Test was exhilarating.</p> <p>Meyer was this week ruminating on how back rows will look in the future. Never mind the influence of Richie McCaw, David Pocock, Thierry Dusautoir and Sam Warburton for the four countries who reached the semi-finals in last year's World Cup, the former Leicester director of rugby, who is without the injured flanker Heinrich Brussow, believes the days of teams operating with a fetcher are reaching their end.</p> <p>\"The game has got a lot quicker so you need more athletic players,\" he said. \"It has become so because there is not as much competing on the ground and you need more than one guy in that area. If you look at the stats, most of the hookers have been the ball-stealers because usually the guy comes blind and the hooker is defending there.</p> <p>\"I think it will be interesting to see how they referee the breakdown because suddenly even New Zealand are \u2026 I won't say moving away but there are not a lot of specialist open-side flankers there. If you look at their top sides even the Chiefs didn't really have a specialist open-side. I have always believed in having a specialist there but it depends how they are going to referee it.\"</p> <p>Meyer's view is all the more interesting because one of the reasons South Africa's defence of the World Cup ended in Wellington at the quarter-final stage was that they were unable to combat \u2013 Brussow was injured 20 minutes in \u2013 Pocock at the breakdown.</p> <p>They accused the referee Bryce Lawrence of allowing Pocock's continual infringing but South Africa lost a match they should have won because of their own failings rather than the official's. Australia, like New Zealand, have far more in the way of creative ability, and while Australia were outplayed by Wales for long periods in this summer's three-Test series, they kept their composure and shape and came up with winning scores.</p> <p>The All Blacks will start as favourites, and not just because they are the World Cup holders. They won 10 of the 16 Tri-Nations titles and they were the only one of the competing sides to finish the series in credit: 50 victories in 72 matches compared with Australia's 29 and South Africa's 28.</p> <p>They have lost experience in the second row with Brad Thorn and Ali Williams no longer in the squad and their back-up half-backs are raw but as long as McCaw and Dan Carter remain fit, they will be the most likely winners.</p> <p>It will be a significant eight weeks for the Australia coach Robbie Deans. Victory over his native New Zealand on Saturday would relieve some of the pressure on him: his contract ends after next summer's series against the Lions, but while he has options behind, he is short at forward and has had to persuade the 36-year-old second row Nathan Sharpe to postpone his retirement.</p> <p>Three of Argentina's first four matches are away and they face a test of endurance with a squad of less depth than the others. One feature of the tournament is that no venue will host more than one match: the Pumas will host matches at Mendoza, La Plata and Rosario.</p> <p>The Rugby Championship will be played in three series of two rounds, like the group stage of the Heineken Cup except with a week's break after each of the first two batches. It will extend into October, stretching the season to nearly nine months with tours to Europe to follow. It will not be long before calls for a global season grow.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/signup/thebreakdown\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/signup/thebreakdown\">Click here to sign up to the Breakdown</a></p>",

After three minutes of gunfire, bodies littered the ground in pools of blood. The South African police ministry said more than 30 striking miners had been killed.</p> <p>Newspaper reporter Poloko Tau <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taupoloko\" title=\"\">tweeted from the scene</a>: \"Auto guns creacking [sic] and cocked like 100 at a time, scary \u2026 warzone down here, 1st shot fired \u2026 journalist running, diving and hiding amid shots, water canon spewing water at the strikers \u2026 my contact has just been shot dead \u2026\"</p> <p>The deaths came after a week of turmoil at the Marikana mine that had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/south-africa-lonmin-platinum-mine-clashes\" title=\"\">already seen 10 people killed</a>, including two police officers and two security guards. Lonmin, the world's third biggest platinum producer, was forced to suspend production at the mine, about 60 miles north-west of Johannesburg, after what it called an illegal strike escalated into an alleged turf war between rival unions.</p> <p>His voice shaking with anger, the union leader Joseph Mathunjwa accused the Lonmin management of colluding with a rival union to orchestrate what he described as a massacre. Mathunjwa, president of the militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), told the eNews channel: \"We have to send condolences to those families whose members were brutally murdered by a lack of co-operation from management. We have done our bit. If the management had changed their commitment, surely lives could have been saved.\"</p> <p>South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, condemned the killings but made no reference to the handling of the situation by the police. \"We are shocked and dismayed at this senseless violence,\" he said. \"We believe there is enough space in our democratic order for any dispute to be resolved through dialogue without any breaches of the law or violence.</p> <p>\"We call upon the labour movement and business to work with government to arrest the situation before it deteriorates any further. I have instructed law enforcement agencies to do everything possible to bring the situation under control and to bring the perpetrators of violence to book.\" Zuma added: \"We extend our deepest condolences to the families of all who have lost their lives since the beginning of this violent action.\"</p> <p>The opposition called for an independent investigation. Helen Zille, leader of the Democratic Alliance, said: \"We call on union leaders, the police and everyone else involved to immediately work towards a de-escalation of the conflict. All action must be taken to avoid further bloodshed.</p> <p>\"An urgent independent investigation is required to determine exactly what happened; and who is responsible for this massacre. The families of everyone involved, and indeed the nation, deserve to know how and why this bloodshed occurred.\"</p> <p>Roger Phillimore, the chairman of Lonmin, said: \"We are treating the developments around police operations this afternoon with the utmost seriousness. The South African police service have been in charge of public order and safety on the ground since the violence between competing labour factions erupted over the weekend, claiming the lives of eight of our employees and two police officers.</p> <p>\"It goes without saying that we deeply regret the further loss of life in what is clearly a public order rather than labour relations associated matter.\"</p> <p>The violence reportedly flared when police laying out barricades of barbed wire were outflanked by some of an estimated 3,000 miners massed on a rocky outcrop near the mine. Witnesses claimed that some of the miners were armed with pistols and fired first, while also charging the police with machetes and sticks.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cosatu.org.za\" title=\"\">Congress of South African Trade Unions</a> (Cosatu) said: \"According to a Sapa report, police tried to disperse striking workers gathered on top of a hill, wielding pangas and chanting war songs. It ended in a three-minute shootout between the two groups, after police fired teargas and then used a water cannon to disperse the strikers, who retaliated by firing live ammunition at the police.\"</p> <p>The protests began last week when workers demanded a pay increase to 12,500 rand (\u00a3976) a month. The action turned deadly when the AMCU clashed with South Africa's dominant National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).</p> <p>The NUM rejected the charge of collusion with mine bosses. Spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said: \"We are not surprised by his allegation \u2026 It is not true. Everyone can see through these lies.\"</p> <p>Seshoka blamed the AMCU \u2013 which has been poaching NUM members in platinum mines \u2013 for instigating the bloodshed. \"These people said today they want to die on the hilltop. They said they will bring their children to die there. That is why we say the ringleaders must be arrested.\"</p> <p>There has been growing frustration with the governing African National Congress and its mainstream union allies for moving too slowly to deliver wage increases and public services. Radical and militant voices are making gains in some areas.</p> <p>Patrick Craven, the national spokesman for Cosatu, which is aligned to the ANC, said it would \"convene an urgent meeting of the unions' leaderships to discuss what is emerging as a co-ordinated political strategy to use intimidation and violence, manipulated by disgruntled former union leaders, in a concerted drive to create breakaway 'unions' and divide and weaken the trade union movement\".</p> <p>He added: \"Cosatu calls upon all workers to remain vigilant but calm in the face of the most serious challenge to workers' unity and strength for many years.\"</p> <p>South Africa is home to four-fifths of the world's known platinum reserves but has been hit by union militancy and a sharp drop in the price of the precious metal this year. At least three people were killed in fighting in January that led to a six-week closure of the world's biggest platinum mine, run by Impala Platinum. Such incidents are seen as tarnishing South Africa's reputation among investors.</p> <p>This week's violence has forced Lonmin to freeze production at all its South African operations, which account for 12% of global platinum output. The company's London-listed shares fell more than 7% on Thursday. A spokesman at Lonmin's head office in London confirmed strikers had been served with an ultimatum to return to work on Thursday or face dismissal, but denied that might inflame&#xa0;the&#xa0;situation.</p> <p>\"The mine cannot operate without the rock drill operators,\" he said. \"The company tried every avenue it could to negotiate a settlement and we were left with no option.\"</p>",
  "<p>It has been a terrible summer for bees. The wettest April and June <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18678659\" title=\"\">on record </a>with little respite in May meant bees were unable to get out and forage on the fruit trees and copious amount of plants and flowers in bloom at that time of year. So serious was the situation, that the National Bee Unit <a href=\"https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/beebase/public/News/news.cfm#127\" title=\"\">issued two high-level alerts</a> warning beekeepers to feed their bee colonies a sugar water solution to prevent them from starving to death.</p> <p>The sun has finally come out in some parts of the UK in recent weeks allowing the bees to collect protein-rich pollen and sweet nectar. In London, the lime trees at the beginning of July provided a much-needed nectar flow and the bees have been industriously transforming most of it into honey, but this late surge can't make up for the months when the production line was out of action.</p> <p>As such, there is expected to be little British honey this year. The <a href=\"http://www.bbka.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Beekeepers Association</a> annual honey survey won't be published until the autumn when its 20,000-odd members have had time to harvest all their stores, but my hunch is that yields could be half as much as last year. Hives that can be expected to produce 40lbs of honey a year on average, could yield nearer 20lbs in 2012. So it seems an unfortunate time to set up a social enterprise focused on honey extraction. But on Thursday, the <a href=\"http://www.bee-collective.co.uk/The_Bee-Collective/Home.html\" title=\"\">Bee Collective</a> launched in central London to provide a honey-processing service to urban beekeepers. The collective has created a \"honey house\" in Victoria where it can extract, jar and label tonnes of honey from different beekeepers all over the capital.</p> <p>Beekeeping in London has reached <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/aug/07/urban-beekeeping\" title=\"\">unprecedented levels</a> in the past five years. Beekeepers' associations report membership more than doubling and it is thought there could be as many as 5,000 beekeepers within the M25, each with an average of three hives. But harvesting and extracting honey from the honey comb can be a laborious, sticky and expensive process. The Bee Collective says it aims to take the effort out of extraction. In return it wants a small amount of honey as payment. It will sell this honey and use the profits to invest in what it says is its core business: promoting bee habitats in London. Clever, eh. Using honey as a vehicle to improve the habitats of the creatures who produce the honey. By habitats it means forage, and in particular planting bee-friendly flowers and trees on green roofs and in squares and public gardens in central London where the density of hives is growing at the greatest speed and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/16/boris-capital-bee-beekeepers-criticise\" title=\"\">concerns have been raised</a> about whether there is enough food for honeybees.</p> <p>Caroline Birchall, founder of the Bee Collective, works at Natural England on landscape ecology in the capital. She says there is a huge amount of green infrastructure such as green roofs and rain gardens, which enable water to be absorbed rather than run off, that is being put in place to combat climate change and which could be made more suitable for bees and other pollinators.</p> <p>The Bee Collective is sponsored by Victoria business improvement district (Bid) which states it is \"passionate about improving the quality of the local environment for local business employees, residents and visitors to the area\". This summer, it funded beekeeper training and bee hives on buildings along Victoria Street, including Westminster Cathedral, and is developing a tree planting strategy and green infrastructure projects. One of the Bid business members, John Lewis, is developing a rain garden at ground level that the Bee Collective hopes to advise on making bee-friendly.</p> <p>The Bee Collective is also working with the Mayor's <a href=\"http://www.capitalgrowth.org/bees/\" title=\"\">Capital Bee Campaign</a> which in 2011 trained 51 communities around the capital to become beekeepers and has advised the Collective on the honey services that new beekeepers require.</p> <p>Birchall admits there may not be much honey to kickstart the collective, but she says it's important to stress that her social enterprise is not about the quantity of honey, it is about beekeepers coming together to help improve bee forage.</p> <p>Since most beekeepers these days haven't taken up the pastime for the honey \u2013 instead <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/oct/29/urban-beekeeping\" title=\"\">reasons</a> range from reconnecting with nature to saving the bees \u2013 I'm sure they'd be only too happy to part with a small offering to help their bees have more food in the future. And with a high demand for local honey by far outstripping supply this year, the Bee Collective should be able to charge a premium for its wares boosting profits for its bee habitat programme. So maybe it's not such a bad time after all.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.bwpi.manchester.ac.uk/resources/Working-Papers/bwpi-wp-17112.pdf\" title=\"\">paper summarising the academic literature on the role of NGOs</a> in development and poverty reduction has sparked a <a href=\"http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/?p=11330#comments\" title=\"\">lively debate on From Poverty to Power</a>, a blog written and edited by Oxfam's Duncan Green.</p> <p>The gist of the June paper by the Brooks World Poverty Institute, University of Manchester, by Nicola Banks and David Hulme, is that NGOs have lost their way. Having started out as grassroots-led development bodies \u2013 \"heroic organisations\" that offered the potential for innovative agendas \u2013 NGOs turned into bureaucratic, depoliticised creatures that respond more to the dictates of donors than the people whose interests they claim to represent.</p> <p>\"Greater acknowledgment and concerns emerging from their closer proximity to donors and governments than intended beneficiaries also brought into question the very comparative advantages once lauded,\" wrote the authors. \"NGOs could no longer be viewed as the autonomous, grassroots-oriented, and innovative organisations that they once were, raising questions about their legitimacy and sustainability.\"</p> <p>Green, senior strategic adviser for Oxfam GB, expressed his irritation with the paper on his blog. \"I've got a paper I want you to read, particularly if you work for an NGO or other lobbying outfit,\" he wrote. \"Not because it's good \u2013 far from it \u2013 but because reading it and (if you work for an NGO) observing your rising tide of irritation will really help you understand how those working in the private sector, government or the multilateral system feel when they read a generalised and ill-informed NGO attack on their work.\"</p> <p>Green said he had some sympathy with the critique, which he acknowledged was a fairly standard one. What he objected to were the sweeping generalisations, argument by assertion, \"dodgy stats\", and the lack of case studies and interviews with NGOs themselves.</p> <p>Banks denied that the paper was an attack on NGOs, and expressed surprise at Green's reaction. \"Our confusion reading this is why it has generated such a heated response from Duncan when his book, From Poverty to Power, is based on the well-founded premise that poverty is a political condition, and that solutions too, must be based upon transformations and redistributions of power. So why such disconnect,\" she wrote.</p> <p>As Green acknowledged, the overall critique was a standard one and it was not the substance to which he objected, but the approach. One gripe was that the authors apparently failed to talk directly to NGOs, and thus ignored \"all knowledge generated by NGOs themselves, either through interviews or reading their own massive literature on issues of power and inequality, and the challenges of relationships with CSOs [civil society organisations].\"</p> <p>Green has a point. There is a vigorous debate among NGOs about the present discourse on development. Some are unhappy about how much of this has been skewed towards the aid agenda, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/02/is-aid-target-still-relevant\" title=\"\">especially the focus on the 0.7% of GDP target</a>.</p> <p>John Hilary, executive director of War on Want, the anti-poverty group, is highly critical of this focus. \"Far too many NGOs have lost sight of the long-term, transformative goals of international development, and are instead following a donor-led agenda of aid and service delivery,\" he said. \"British NGOs are especially guilty of this \u2013 often highly professional and efficient, but lacking the political drive that should be the lifeblood of the sector. If we are to play our proper role in civil society, NGOs need to learn from grassroots movements and embrace a far more radical vision of change.\"</p> <p>Hilary belongs to a group called the progressive development forum, which seeks to reframe the debate away from aid, charity and philanthropy towards one of global justice and shifting the discourse towards structural causes of poverty. At a meeting of the forum in July, attended by 50 senior figures from a wide range of NGOs \u2013 among them the <a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/\" title=\"\">World Development Movement</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Jubilee Debt Campaign</a> \u2013 and trade unions, many of the concerns raised were similar to those voiced by Banks and Hulme.</p> <p>The meeting laid bare a faultline among NGOs on the state of the development debate. Several participants said they did not want to be involved in further alliances with the larger aid agencies that are mounting their own campaign on food, aid and hunger, linked with the UK government, in the runup to next year's G8.</p> <p>\"There was a strong feeling that we should cease to be so British and 'polite', and instead be more willing to enter into open criticism of NGOs and to challenge those that are beyond the pale in their distortion of the agenda, particularly agencies such as Save the Children that are now reviving unacceptable imagery of the south in their communications,\" said a report by the forum from the July meeting.</p> <p>The UK <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/13/uk-hunger-summit-global-malnutrition?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">hunger summit at Downing Street at the weekend</a>, attended by NGOs, politicians and the private sector, crystallised the difference of approach. On one side of the divide are Save the Children and the advocacy group One, which pushed hard for the summit. They urged target commitments to reduce hunger and malnutrition and would argue the summit was a success.</p> <p>But those demanding a more fundamental rethink on development would say the summit tinkered around the edges. Owen Barder, senior fellow and director for Europe at the <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/\" title=\"\">Centre for Global Development</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2012/08/will-the-next-g-8-summit-really-tackle-hunger.php\" title=\"\">wrote:</a> \"The discussion in 2013 should be much more about the responsibility of G8 countries to improve their own policies \u2013 and this summit on malnutrition unfortunately did not start that conversation as it needs to continue. The risk is that the G8 will think that they can address these issues by earmarking some of their aid programmes and they will not feel under pressure to make the systemic changes which only they can make.\"</p> <p>With the focus on the UK as it takes over the G8 next year from the US, and the discussions on hunger and nutrition set to continue, this faultline among British NGOs can be expected to deepen.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Christine Wilson, head of youth and society, </strong><a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>British Council</strong></a><strong>, UK</strong></h2> <p><strong>Defining social enterprise:</strong> I like <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/about/about-social-enterprise\" title=\"\">the Social Enterprise UK definition</a> \u2013 A social enterprise is a business that trades for a social and/or environmental purpose. It will have a clear sense of its social mission, which means it will know what difference it is trying to make, who it aims to help, and how it plans to do it. It will bring in most or all of its income through selling goods or services. And it will also have clear rules about what it does with its profits, reinvesting these to further the social mission.</p> <p><strong>Workshops and networks:</strong> We are working at the moment with partners including the Asia Europe Foundation on a network of social entrepreneurs. We've held three workshops, which combined training, networking and ideas incubation, in Thailand, Burma and Vietnam. British and European entrepreneurs also took part. We try to build strong international networks and support them in supporting each other.</p> <p><strong>NGO to social enterprise:</strong> A lot of the organisations we work with are supporting NGOs in transition to social enterprises. It's not often cut and dried \u2013 in the first few years at least, they are still in receipt of charitable donations or other sources of funding.&#xa0;Other NGOs I have seen start up an enterprise of some sort \u2013 perhaps a charity shop, or some other sort of trading arm \u2013 as an additional source of income. A couple of organisations I recently visited in Burma fit these descriptions - <a href=\"http://www.fxb.org/programs/myanmar/\" title=\"\">FXB Myanmar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.proximitydesigns.org/\" title=\"\">Proximity Design</a>.</p> <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> If it's not possible to launch an enterprise without getting caught up in legal and regulatory issues, but you still want to create a social action project, then look to ways to make it more sustainable.</p> <p><strong>Role of academics:</strong> Let's also not forget the role that can be played by the academic community. In Turkey, we have worked with <a href=\"http://www.khas.edu.tr/en/\" title=\"\">Kadir Has University</a>, now including social enterprise as part of their lifelong learning programme.</p> <p><strong>Reasons for growth:</strong> In some places, social entrepreneurs are looking for more sustainable ways of tackling issues they face. They feel charitable donations or foundational funding don't offer stability, so they look for more reliable sources of income. In other countries, such as China, there is an interest (as there is in the UK), of delivering better public services (or trying to), by putting power in the hands of the people and communities in receipt of those services.</p> <p><strong>Our work in China:</strong> Here's <a href=\"http://dsi.britishcouncil.org.cn/zh/index.shtml\" title=\"\">some information about our work in China</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">here's some more!</a></p> <p><strong>Young entrepreneurs:</strong> On the global scale, I would speculate that as young people now have a much greater understanding of the wider world around them. We seem to be seeing a generation of young people who want to embed their values and aspirations in their working lives, and not have them as an adjunct.</p> <p><strong>The ability to measure social impact is key:</strong> It's certainly vital in seeking finance \u2013 investors want to know that their money is being well managed and that the organisation is achieving its stated goals. But in addition, I think being able to demonstrate social impact \u2013 people being brought out of poverty, young people having new skills, jobs being created, pollution diminished, whatever the aim of the social entrepreneur \u2013 is crucial to show the world that this is not \"business as usual\".</p> <p><strong>Agricultural projects have potential:</strong> If new technologies and access to state of the art skills and tools could be made affordable and available to greater numbers, then many lives would be enhanced. Proximity Design in Burma is trying to do just that, using local know how about the land, and local engineering skills, combined with expertise in design and innovation, to bring effective and affordable tools to local farmers.</p> <p><strong>Umbrella organisations:</strong> There is the umbrella organisation route, where social enterprises fund a central body to represent them, offer support and so on.&#xa0;We are trying to create more opportunities for entrepreneurs in the UK and the rest of the world to engage, share practice and have dialogue on policy, so keep an eye on the International Hub.</p> <h2><strong>Petra Kroon, owner of </strong><a href=\"http://www.goedgeefs.nl/#/home/\" title=\"\"><strong>bureau goedgeefs</strong></a><strong>, Netherlands</strong></h2> <p><strong>Defining social enterprise:</strong> The rather classical one that states that a social entrepreneur is somebody who wants to solve a social problem \u2013 whether it's people or planet \u2013 in an entrepreneurial way. At least 50%, and some even say 75%, of the revenues are own income \u2013 so no grants or subsidy. Others define \"entrepreneurial\" in the same way as Melinda Gates did at <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/tedxchange_overview\" title=\"\">TEDxChange</a>: using entrepreneurial strategies to solve a social problem.</p> <p><strong>Budget cuts:</strong> As budgets are being cut at this very moment, they turn to institutional grants as a solution. But that is not an entrepreneurial attitude, that's just replacing subsidies for grants. In Holland there is still the attitude that you earning money by doing good isn't the right thing. So, in order to survive I think they need to have a more entrepreneurial attitude, be more pro-active and be more open-minded.</p> <p><strong>NGOs to social enterprises:</strong> In Holland subsidies to NGO's are being cut and they're all thinking about how to survive. I think many people need to learn from others who made the switch from NGO to social enterprise.</p> <p><strong>Organisations working in social entrepreneurship:</strong> There are not so many organisations that are involved in social entrepreneurship. There used to be the <a href=\"http://www.dutchfoundation.com/\" title=\"\">Dutch Foundation</a> of social entrepreneurship but because of a lack of money and a lack of interest it was shut down. I think for over 10 years Ashoka tried to enter Dutch market, but it didn't succeed. But for some time now some people are working on the introduction of Social Enterprise NL, an initiative that focuses on helping and promoting social entrepreneurship. It looks really promising and it is set to launch in September.</p> <p><strong>Financial crisis a good thing?</strong> I must say, I sometimes praised the crisis. Because it made people think of how they can work in an social entrepreneurial way. It made them look at the real problems, not at the problems the grant-takers or governments want to solve. So the crises also gave a boost to social enterprise, to the people who were already involved and also to the idea and image of social enterprise.</p> <p><strong>More focus on social innovation:</strong> In Holland there is a focus on ecological or green innovation while social innovations is left behind. But with government backing in this area, it will develop.</p> <p><strong>Lack of legal structure:</strong> In UK you can register as CIC, in US as B Corps. Here in Holland we are a bit jealous about that.</p> <p><strong>Scaling up:</strong> It's an important issue. In Holland there are no large social enterprises. I have several discussions about scaling up. Of course, as a social enterprise you want to scale your social impact. But do you scale by having more employees in a quantitative way, or do you scale in a qualitative way? In other words, staying small but improving your service or product.</p> <p><strong>Foundations and enterprises:</strong> In Holland there is a big difference between foundations and enterprise. As a foundation it is almost impossible to get investments because you're obliged to use your profits to fulfill your mission. As a foundation you are not allowed to pay it to your shareholders. Meanwhile, as an enterprise it is very hard to find any grants or subsidies because the grant-makers state that they don't want their money to be used to develop an enterprise that is going to make profits.</p> <h2><strong>Nadya Saib \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4v-2NK9R2U\" title=\"\"><strong>Wangsa Jelita</strong></a><strong>, Indonesia</strong></h2> <p><strong>Defining social entrepreneurship:</strong> I personally would go with Professor Yunus on his book \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Creating-World-Without-Poverty-Capitalism/dp/1586484931\" title=\"\">Creating a World Without Poverty: Social Business and the Future of Capitalism</a>\", here I quote: \"any innovative initiative to help people may be described as social entrepreneurship. The initiative may be economic or non-economic, for-profit or not-for-profit\". I once <a href=\"http://nadya-saib.blogspot.com/2012/01/social-entrepreneurship-vs-social.html\" title=\"\">wrote about this on my blog,</a> but of course&#xa0;it's not the defining that matters, it's the doing to create the better world that is much more important.</p> <p><strong>NGO support:</strong> There are a lot of foreign NGOs trying to support local social entrepreneurs. In Indonesia for example, when I started to form my social enterprise I was supported by a program initiated by <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/indonesia.htm\" title=\"\">British Council Indonesia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guinness.com/en-row/agf/\" title=\"\">Arthur Guinness Fund</a>. It was a huge stepping stone for us to develop our business and at the same time tackling social problems.</p> <p><strong>Connecting with the community:</strong> One of the biggest challenges I face is engaging the community. It took us more than a year to finally convince them to collaborate with us. The first time we talked to farmers about value added production in making soaps out of roses it did not go that smoothly. But when we demonstrated how it works they understood how it helped them become less dependent on the middleman.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Lack of professional skills:</strong> None of the founders of Wangsa Jelita had a background in business or management. In dealing with this we are helped by being mentored or coached from someone who is expert in certain area that we want to work on.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/richardjcatherall\" title=\"\"><strong>Richard Catherall</strong></a><strong>, founder of Katarsis Ventures, Cyprus</strong></h2> <p><strong>Business modelling:</strong> This is just as relevant to non-profits as it is for profit focused organisations. It can help people start to broaden what they think about that evil word! For example, social profits, financial profits, environmental profits. Fundamentally modelling helps them to put all the essential elements of a focused enterprise together. This overtakes the focus on profit or non-profit and allows impact and customer orientation to emerge.</p> <p><strong>Value of internships:</strong> Quite a broad partnership here in Cyprus has started with action around internships. Early findings have provided rich insights into the culture change required within companies and with students. Some really interesting ideas emerging about life-long networks and associations that could support very talented people to start an international career while keeping their unique island home as the hub.</p> <p><strong>CSR strategy:</strong> Employability and employment are emerging as the principle CSR activity. What I love about here, is that, from whatever sector, the focus is always on the issue. So with CSR they are focused on the problem, being creative about how each sector can play a role. Then, when there is excitement and clarity, the companies are willing to invest alongside others. This includes NGOs and social enterprises committing their own resources. They believe they have to have a CSR strategy rather than believing they should be someone else's CSR strategy. So for example, instead of working up a project on employability and trying to raise project funds, they collaborate earlier and then engage in what is created by those stakeholders. The largest companies accept a role in holding court over these developments including some of the development costs. The success is everyone playing their part based on what they have, rather than competing for a role they want.</p> <p><strong>Support for managers:</strong> Linked to employability there is also an acceptance that, in lieu of having had this effort in place there is a generation of managers that also need support. So this then links to efforts to build capacity of managers and leaders within organisations. This is something that we have just started to target.</p> <p><strong>Investment culture:</strong> There is investment here into family firms and groups of companies, there are also some small foundations, which are not as apolitical as they could be. There may be an opportunity under the banner of sustainable investment to keep a useful link between investment in companies and investment in social enterprises and NGOs. I don't mean one size fits all, I mean a strategic approach to sustainable investment which is tailored for each sector.</p> <p><strong>Investment readiness:</strong> I have worked with organisations that were almost born investment ready and organisation that will never be investment ready. The investment readiness process we use was tested as part of a programme with <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NESTA</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Cabinet Office</a>. The process of getting investment ready &#xa0;took consideration of the fact that the organisations are most likely to be already a going concern, rather than a start up. </p> <p><strong>CIC model is great:</strong> My partner in Radical Capital was instrumental in encouraging a greater dividend limit. This is because the original (5%) would have blocked out more social investors. It is a bit like our definition debate though. Just because you have a useful structure doesn't make you a great enterprise. I have worked with excellent social enterprises using 'for-profit' structures that have been able to access capital and move money for reinvestment more easily than they would as a CIC.</p> <p><strong>Growing in underdeveloped markets:</strong> They will be challenged to become market makers and that is something we will become involved in. This is not just a test of their business model, but how their commitment to achieving the goal informs their ideas for educating stakeholders, customers and investors. Social enterprises and enterprising NGOs will engage with businesses in the commercial sectors differently. In lieu of project funding and programmes, some may lay solid foundations by doing business together.</p> <h2><strong>Manju George, co-founder and head of corporate development at </strong><a href=\"http://intellecap.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Intellecap</strong></a><strong>, India</strong></h2> <p><strong>Farming and social enterprise:</strong> Agriculture and rural business is one of the sectors we focus on and we have an awards track dedicated to this sector <a href=\"http://www.sankalpforum.com\" title=\"\">in our annual forum</a>. A community based example is the <a href=\"http://www.masuta.org/\" title=\"\">Masutha producers company</a> (created by <a href=\"http://www.pradan.net/\" title=\"\">PRADAN</a>, the NGO). A slightly more commercial example can be INI Farms, a company that does commercial pomegranate cultivation. There are also efforts to increase land productivity.</p> <p><strong>NGOs shifting to social enterprise in India:</strong> Most microfinance institutions in India started at NGOs in the 1990's and early 2000's and by 2005 almost all made the shift to a for-profit legal structure. Those that came after started as for-profits directly.</p> <p><strong>Water-focused social enterprises:</strong> Community based water treatment plants, initially a largely NGO led activity, is now adopted by many for-profit models. Education, largely the domain of NGOs now have many private players \u2013 affordable private schools, night schools and remedial education, alternative curriculum developers and so on. Vocational skill training is another area where there is a huge shift to private sector activity.</p> <p><strong>Support is always needed:</strong> Anybody trying to promote and catalyse social enterprise activity needs to make sure that they make available a variety of support that the social enterprises need. This includes money, connections, advice, hand holding, visibility and information. A narrower approach will not really move the needle. There needs to be an 'ecosystem' of people, tools and policies that support them. One organisation may not be able to do all; but multiple organisations complementary to each other can create this ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>Eco-problems:</strong> When we talk of the ecosystem, it is also important to recognise that there are some industry/market level challenges that need to be dealt with beyond direct support to the social enterprise \u2013 for instance the lack of awareness about off grid and renewable energy solutions, lack of access to consumer and SME finance and lack of quality assurance and standards are common challenges that multiple energy social enterprise face in India. There has to be intervention that try and tackle these, help 'build the market' and make it easier for the social enterprise. This is where philanthropic capital can play a significant role to play (for example <a href=\"http://www.lightingafrica.org/\" title=\"\">IFC's Lighting Africa program</a> and the recently launched Lighting India program).</p> <p><strong>For-profit structures have better prospects:</strong> Not surprisingly, social enterprises with for-profit structures have access to a larger and diverse pool of capital that can fuel their growth and impacts much faster. Most NGO-microfinance to for-profit microfinance transformations saw this happen. Growth of microfinance in India between 2005 and 2011 was phenomenal. However, it also brought along with it the debate on 'how much profits is good and acceptable'. How to balance making money for the investors and deepening social impact?</p> <p><strong>Financial crisis has increased focus on social enterprise:</strong> I was at the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/\" title=\"\">Davos Forum</a> earlier this year and of course the dominant theme was the need to 'reimagine capitalism' and to find a 'new economic models that is inclusive and responsible'. Many seem to highlight social entrepreneurs and their work as pioneering in this regard and as proof that you can do good and well.</p> <p><strong>The need to go mainstream:</strong> Most social enterprises remain small, doing work in local communities, lack access to resources and find it difficult to scale their operations and are no way comparable to mainstream business corporations. The idea is still not as 'mainstream' as I would like it to be.</p> <p><strong>Awareness of CSR is encouraging:</strong> We are also encouraged by the growing interest from large corporations simply because we need them to address the magnitude of development challenges we face in countries like India. Social enterprises can't do this alone. Last year we started some work with DFID managing their Business Innovation Facility in India; we work with large corporations here and many are looking to get involved. However, the general risk tolerance is definitely much lower than a social enterprise. They will not put big money in without the business case being absolutely clear.</p> <p><strong>Social enterprise in India is rapidly on the rise:</strong> In our annual awards forum, we get close to 60 new social enterprise applications every year. And many are significantly larger than employing 250 people. We recently surveyed 100 social enterprises in India and at least one third of them are operating in over 100 localities and touching more than 50,000 base of the pyramid lives annually. Before the microfinance crisis in India in 2010, the largest MFI has over 40,000 employees including field staff. So certainly the scale is much larger, but not enough as we still have 300-400 million people below the poverty line.</p> <h2><strong>Yoshiaki Ishikawa, social agenda lab manager at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.etic.or.jp/english/outline.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Entrepreneurial Training for Innovative Communities (ETIC)</strong></a><strong>, Japan</strong></h2> <p><strong>Social enterprise and disaster recovery:</strong> I'm in Sendai, where is a capital city around the disaster area.

We've sent over 100, and it's a bit contributing changing mindset and attitude or \"work\" in Japan.</p> <h2><strong>Drew Tulchin, managing partner of </strong><a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.net/\" title=\"\"><strong>Social Enterprise Associates</strong></a><strong>, US</strong></h2> <p><strong>Defining social enterprise in US:</strong> There is not one definition in the US but generally it means that a company creates a positive impact by doing business. So also a market-based approach by practitioners.</p> <p><strong>Alternatives to Wall Street:</strong> I don't know if there actually are more social enterprise in terms of numbers because of the financial crisis. But it probably has lead to new forms of social enterprises and topics for them like Slow Money NYC who state \"We hope to reshape roles for investors and extend the definition of investment, providing alternatives to Wall Street.\"</p> <p><strong>Legal status:</strong> In the US there actually is a legal status (<a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/\" title=\"\">B Corp</a>). It's quite new and was first introduced by the State of New York and now passed in eight or nine States. It's also a result of the financial crisis, which also emerged because of the need to increase shareholder value. The new legislation allows B Corps to prioritise stakeholder value (social and environmental).</p> <h2><strong>Bharti Patel, headed </strong><a href=\"http://www.svaraj.in/\" title=\"\"><strong>Society for Voluntary Actions Revitalisation and Justice</strong></a><strong>, India</strong></h2> <p><strong>Business acumen is crucial:</strong> There is an urgent need for such input \u2014 writing a good business plan for a social and green enterprise can go a long way towards achieving the desired results and sustainability. It also helps to convince banks to provide the necessary credit. A suggestion to create a local voluntary time bank where such expertise can be tapped into by the entrepreneur.</p> <p><strong>Double crisis:</strong> there are two crisis which need to be considered in the modern definition of business. 1) no doubt the financial crisis but increasingly it is 2) the crisis of depleting natural resources which are affecting business globally. But disproportionately those whose livelihood is directly impacted by changes in land, water and eco-system. The recent debate on green economy is important in the context of new social enterprise.</p> <p><strong>India needs leadership:</strong> The social impact of the organization together with the environmental best practices /impact gives a true picture of the social enterprise in the modern global economic development paradigm. I do believe India can and should show real leadership here. <a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/248022/why-india-should-embrace-sdgs.html\" title=\"\">Here's my article</a> highlighting India's traditional practices have done much, but their efforts are dismissed as small scale and backwards.</p> <h2><strong>Laura Fedorciow, co-founder of </strong><a href=\"http://www.vertigoventures.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Vertigo Ventures</strong></a><strong>, UK</strong></h2> <p><strong>Vocational training:</strong> Interesting point about vocational training. Here in the UK we have seen that some charities have started providing training on their core skills to generate their own revenue. LeapCC is one such example. Some small to medium charities are evolving particularly at the moment as donations have slowed here.</p> <p><strong>Philanthropy is rife:</strong> When we were in New Orleans, we were amazed by the number of graduates from across the USA who moved down there to help with the clean up for a period of time. Even more surprising was how they were staying and setting up lives there. The AmeriCorps were also supportive in sending volunteers which may be a useful model? <a href=\"http://www.stbernardproject.org/\" title=\"\">See the St. Bernard Project.</a></p> <p><strong>Partnering with businesses:</strong> In the USA we saw this a lot, where companies such as Macy's would help build a social enterprise building at a University or perhaps sit on their social enterprise company board to provide commercial advice to the team. Being open to new/different ways of engaging with social enterprises is key to supporting the ecosystem and its development as there are commercial lessons to be learnt as well.</p> <h2><strong>Rathish Balakrishnan</strong></h2> <p><strong>Student fellowships:</strong> One of the trends in India is for students to apply for \"fellowships\" which are often one to two years of immersive experience in a social setting where they work with the community to come up with solutions to social problems.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>China, the world's most populous country, might be described as cricket's greatest untapped resource. And now Cleethorpes Cricket Club are doing something about it.</p> <p>Perched on the estuary of the Humber, in northern Lincolnshire, Cleethorpes CC could already claim, with some justification, to know a thing or two about east Asia.</p> <p>Now they know a little more, for they have engaged the services of the first cricketer from mainland China to play in an overseas league. That player is Jiang Shuyao, 24, whose vivid, blood-red batting gloves, the ones he wears when representing China, focus the minds of potentially dismissive opponents.</p> <p>\"Shu\", as he is popularly known throughout the club, has scored 196 runs for Cleethorpes' second team, in the Lincolnshire League, for an average of 24.5 and with a top score of 50, in the middle order. For the academy side, opening or going in first wicket down, he has scored 362 at 51.7, with five fifties and a top score of 98.</p> <p>\"When I wait to bat I want team-mates to get out so I can go in,\" he says, with a mischievous grin and what sounds dangerously like KP-ish solipsism.</p> <p>Meeting him in the pavilion, however, is to realise that he is immensely well-liked in the dressing room. As he watched an under-13 game between Cleethorpes and Doncaster, calls of \"Hello Shu\" or \"Hi Jonty\" \u2013 a reference to Jonty Rhodes, the great South Africa fielder, for Jiang is prodigious in the area of point \u2013 came at regular intervals. Someone bought him a drink. Another player, who lives locally, has given him a room, lent him his bicycle and taken him shopping.</p> <p>The young man from Shenyang, in the north-east of China, is getting to know Lincolnshire, that sprawl of a county that borders Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire to the west while somehow appearing to rub shoulders with the North Sea. When he arrived, in May, he spoke hardly any English, making him impervious to sledging, though early mastery of the words \"yes\" and \"no\" prevented the mayhem in running between the wickets which has been the downfall of so many.</p> <p>He bowls very little, though he has tried leg-spin, and is frequently and understandably asked whether he is a purveyor of \"the chinaman\", the delivery bowled by a slow left-arm wrist-spinner. \"He doesn't bowl it,\" says his friend Matt Smith, \"but while in China I saw a man who did, and it made me fall about with laughter.\"</p> <p>Smith, 41, who played for Cleethorpes for 10 years and now lives in Shenyang, where he is an English teacher at the local Aerospace University, is the man responsible for introducing Jiang to club cricket in England. \"Two years ago I saw him play a really good knock and I thought he was one of the very few players in the country who really was a cricketer. He just had that little bit of understanding of when to play and when to leave it, and how to build an innings.</p> <p>\"The remarkable thing is that he's been playing for only four years. He had a trial for Shenyang Sports University, to get credit for his PE degree, and within a month the national coach was asking him to play for China in an international tournament in Thailand.</p> <p>\"I set up a cricket team at my university, and because we played regular matches against Shu's university I watched his development. When I came back to Cleethorpes one day I said I was involved with cricket in China and they said: 'Yeah, right, when are you going to send some Chinese kids over here?' We had a joke about it. Now I've done it. Last year I was convinced that he was ready to come.\"</p> <p>Smith paid Jiang's travel costs \u2013 though he has been promised a refund by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), of which China is a member. The player's parents have covered his costs since he arrived at the start of the season, though he eats at the club three or four times a week.</p> <p>\"He's on a special visa which entitles him to stay for six months,\" says Smith. \"He is allowed to take part in a sporting event and the league season for the Lincolnshire League is deemed a sporting event. We weren't sure we'd get the visa. He is good enough for Cleethorpes' first team.\"</p> <p>At the moment, though, Jiang cannot appear for the first team, who play in the Yorkshire League, because their overseas player must have played first-class cricket.</p> <p>The world's governing body, the ICC, to which China \u2013 coached by the former Pakistan Test player Rashid Khan \u2013 is affiliated through the ACC, has taken a great deal of interest in the game in that country, even though most of the clubs there are made up of British expats. Because of its population of almost 1.4bn and its huge marketing potential, China is at the forefront of the ICC's global development programme. It has sent a working party out there and the MCC sent a team under the captaincy of Mike Gatting.</p> <p>\"They are struggling to create the right environment,\" says Smith. \"We grow up with the game here. And there are so many other sports there. But progress is being made and one of Shu's team-mates will be going to Sydney this winter to play for Western Suburbs.\"</p> <p>Wind and rain drove the Cleethorpes and Doncaster youngsters from the field. But Jiang was still smiling, happy to be involved in cricket in this environment. \"When I started, I thought you bowl from just one end, because that's how it is in China, with a mat on top of concrete. There is only one proper cricket ground in China.\"</p> <p>He does not see himself becoming a professional cricketer. \"I'm too old. But after just four years I cannot do without cricket in my life. I hope I can coach, or umpire.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, he is happier with the more gentle training schedule at Cleethorpes CC, where Darren Pattinson \u2013 memorably once an England cricketer \u2013 played. \"I like training for one or two hours here. In China we train for four hours, have some rice and then train for another four. And here you can say 'hello' to another player in training. If you do that in China you must run 10 laps of the pitch.\"</p> <p>Cricketers are at last emerging from China; the cricket culture will take a little longer to establish itself.</p>",
  "<p>Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas has admitted that the loss of Luka Modric to Real Madrid would be \"dramatic\" for Tottenham Hotspur if adequate midfield cover is not signed but he admitted he has ended all interest in Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, Yann M'Vila and Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez.</p> <p>The manager confirmed that there had been a breakthrough in the talks with the Spanish champions over Modric's proposed transfer and he is planning for the season without the Croat. But Villas-Boas will have to broaden his search for a new midfielder as Porto's Moutinho, who has long been his priority target, seems to be too expensive. As a former Porto coach, Villas-Boas knows how the club's president, Pinto da Costa, demands high prices for the players that he sells.</p> <p>Villas-Boas said that Tottenham have \"moved on\" from M'Vila after seeing a \u00a312m bid for him turned down by Rennes although he added that, as a more defensive midfielder, the France international was not the answer to the gap that Modric is set to leave. Bologna's Ram\u00edrez, he noted, is a more advanced midfielder, and the club have sufficient strength on the flanks and in the No10 position. Tottenham have had a \u20ac16m (\u00a312.5m) offer rejected for the Uruguayan.</p> <p>\"No, it will be very difficult,\" Villas-Boas said, when asked whether he wants to sign Moutinho. \"It's very difficult as the level of expectation of Porto would be very difficult. I have experience of Porto and it is a club that sells expensive but they sell a good product. They have a pride of defending that kind of brand. They know that what they sell triumphs at other clubs. It has been like that with numerous amounts of players and that is why it is very difficult.</p> <p>\"M'Vila is an interesting player but I don't think he will join Tottenham. The player is a player of defensive characteristics. On the possible replacements for Luka, we are looking for a more creative player. I can't lie to you. We had initial interest in the player but we have moved on from that one and are now looking for a more creative player because we think that we have certain players already that offer us those defensive characteristics. With Ram\u00edrez, he is in a more advanced role and we are covered in that position.\"</p> <p>It was curious to hear Villas-Boas talk about why Tottenham do not really need M'Vila or Ram\u00edrez. Why the bids, then? The likely explanation is that the chairman, Daniel Levy, was attracted by their youth, talent and potential sell-on value. They could be shrewd additions at the right price.</p> <p>Villas-Boas said that the negotiations with Madrid over Modric had \"picked up recently\" and \"were back on track\", although he lamented how the delay had \"put the market on hold\" for Tottenham in terms of making signings. Villas-Boas has replacements for Modric in mind and, for him, it has reached the stage where the club has to push on with their business.</p> <p>\"We don't want it going right to the deadline,\" he said. \"We might have to play in anticipation in that sense, but if we end up with a player of Luka's dimension and one more strengthening the team, we can find solutions. The targets are identified. It's a question of how quickly we can close the deals.\"</p> <p>Modric has trained away from the first-team squad since his refusal to travel to the United States on the club's pre-season tour and Villas-Boas insisted that the sideshow has not been a distraction. \"He doesn't disrupt our environment in any way because we see him daily,\" Villas-Boas said. \"He speaks to his colleagues. We know the situation here. It is in the chairman's hands. I think we will have a conclusion in the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>\"I have to be very careful with the player's emotional state. Losing a player of Luka's dimension will be dramatic if the club is not able to find the right replacement, but we are looking to strengthen immediately if the transfer goes through.\"</p> <p>Villas-Boas will take his squad to Newcastle United on Saturday for the opening round of Premier League fixtures with Jermain Defoe as his only established striker and without Modric and the injured Scott Parker. Another key midfielder, Sandro, reported to the training ground on Thursday for the first time under Villas-Boas, after playing at the Olympics for Brazil and in Wednesday's friendly against Sweden, but he is \"in contention\", according to the manager, for Newcastle.</p> <p>Villas-Boas, who cautioned against reading too much into the result at St James' Park due to the difficulties he has had in completing his squad, is still not in a position to finalise the signing of the Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor. The sense of flux was reinforced when Villas-Boas said that he would not announce his captain until his transfer business was closer to being concluded.</p> <p>\"On that one, we are deciding towards the end of the transfer market,\" he said. \"We have our reference this year which is Michael Dawson and we hope to keep it that way but towards the end of the window we will have a better idea of the players that stay with us and come in. Dawson will start the season as captain.\"Villas-Boas is implementing a new 4-3-3 system and he has many innovative ideas. But, mindful of how his desire to change too much, too quickly at his previous club Chelsea back-fired, his mantra at Tottenham will be gradual evolution.</p> <p>\"There are changes which have to be done but I won't promote that change as aggressively as I did at Chelsea,\" Villas-Boas said. \"When you promote so much change ... when things were going along smoothly, everybody is happy and you are able to progress it. But when you are faced with a set-back, it's the ability to bounce back from a set-back that will keep you right on track and our set-backs last year at Chelsea happened three in a row ... I think it was three negative results in a row, which had a tremendous impact.</p> <p>\"When we wanted to correct things, it was always like putting the fire out and never establishing what we were before. It comes down to progressional change. We also have to respect what has been built here by Harry [Redknapp] and hopefully I can do exactly that.\"</p>"
